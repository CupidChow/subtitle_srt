1
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:49,179
   

2
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:58,179
No, why should I hide?

3
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,119
You tried to hide. You must know you committed a sin.

4
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:06,549
What did you say? Sin?

5
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:08,299
Sin? What sin?

6
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:10,779
Who are you talking to right now?

7
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:13,799
How shameless.

8
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:18,209
I'd better not engage.

9
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:20,969
Shameless? You're calling me that right now?

10
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,289
You sent your mother-in-law to blackmail me for money.

11
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:28,739
Money? What money?

12
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:30,679
How dare you act innocent now?

13
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:34,989
You sent your mother-in-law, blackmailed me, and took 50 million, including the interest.

14
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:36,549
I even got a memorandum from her.

15
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:39,369
How dare you play ignorant right now?

16
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:41,299
50 million?

17
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:42,569
M-My mother-in-law?

18
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,489
Let me make this clear.

19
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:47,399
You can fool me once but not twice.

20
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,939
If you bring up the ridiculous story and say I owe you money

21
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,079
and blackmail me like that again,

22
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,539
I'll call the police for blackmail.

23
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:00,209
I warned you.

24
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:02,199
How annoying.

25
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:04,119
That woman—

26
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:07,089
You've got to be kidding.

27
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:13,969
 I know. That's why we need to get that money back. 

28
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:19,619
 Hey, 30 million won was a fortune 15 years ago. 

29
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:21,839
Could it be...

30
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:23,619
Could it?

31
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:26,249
Mother.

32
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:28,129
You scared me.

33
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:30,649
What's with you?

34
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:34,359
How dare you look at your mother-in-law like that?

35
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:39,329
Mother, by chance, did you take 50 million from that woman?

36
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:43,009
Is it true that you took 50 million from Do Ra's mom?

37
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:47,379
Aigoo, S-Seon Yeong... Seon Yeong...

38
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:53,089
H-How did you... how did you know about that?

39
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,069
D-Did Hyeon Cheol tell you that?

40
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:57,589
What?

41
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:02,959
Wait, does Hyeon Cheol know about that, too?

42
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,619
Did you take that money with him, then? Is that right?

43
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:11,559
Tell me right now, Mother.

44
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,609
Is that true?

45
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:16,339
How could you do that? How?

46
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:19,839
Mom, why...

47
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:23,159
Honey, what's going on?

48
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:29,029
Is it really true that you took that money from that woman?

49
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,309
What money?

50
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:35,589
Hyeon Cheol, what do we do?

51
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:40,749
S-Seon Yeong found out everything about the 50 million.

52
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:42,789
Honey.

53
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:46,979
How could you do this to me?

54
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:51,179
How could you accept that money? Don't you know what that money means?

55
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:54,359
H-Honey, I'm sorry. I deserve to die.

56
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,509
Where is that money?

57
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:58,119
Bring it to me now. Right now.

58
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:00,019
Seon Yeong, that money is gone.

59
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:02,509
We lost all of that money to a scam.

60
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:06,099
Hyeon Cheol's friend took it and fled.

61
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,159
What did you say?

62
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,429
Honey, I invested it into that thing I mentioned last time and...

63
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:17,229
How could you...

64
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:21,249
Not anyone else but you...

65
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:24,789
Not just any money, but that money from my father?

66
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:27,349
How could you do this?

67
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:29,319
Are you out of your mind?

68
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:32,059
Are you in the right mind?

69
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:35,409
Don't you know why my dad died?

70
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,589
The bloody bruises on my heart

71
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:42,149
are still here since my dad died because of that woman!

72
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,189
How could you do this?

73
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:45,879
How could you...

74
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,949
- Seon Yeong! Seon Yeong! 
 - How could you do this?

75
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:52,919
Seon Yeong, Seon Yeong, stop. Seon Yeong.

76
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,939
Hyeon Cheol... Hyeon Cheol tried to die after losing that money.

77
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:00,919
I stopped him when he was trying to jump off the bridge.

78
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,219
So, please stop, Seon Yeong.

79
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:06,229
Please...

80
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,839
Director Go, you're here!

81
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,659
Bong Soo, you came early.

82
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:14,009
Where have you been?

83
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,499
- Well, someone visited me. 
 - I see.

84
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:19,489
Director, Bong Soo.

85
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:22,679
Hey, Do Ra Park.

86
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:24,359
The heroine of "Straightforward Romance."

87
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:26,319
The queen of romance, Park Do Ra, is here.

88
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,429
Gosh, why are you embarrassing me?

89
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:38,969
It's here. It's here. Let's go, queen.

90
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:42,829
Let's go. Common, let’s go.

91
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:44,309
Let's get going.

92
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:46,309
I'm eating tasty food today.

93
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:48,359
- Let's enjoy it. 
 - Wait!

94
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:52,859
Thanks for working hard. Welcome. Thank you...

95
00:05:54,169 --> 00:06:00,409
The station director was so excited that the premiere was a hit.

96
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:02,529
That place is really good. Really good.

97
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,859
You don't go there anytime. Only when it's a hit.

98
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:10,549
- You must be hungry. 
 - That's why I'll eat a lot.

99
00:06:10,549 --> 00:06:13,019
This isn't just any other place.

100
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,969
- They're really good. 
 - Really?

101
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:20,689
- Let's us have some, too. 
 - We need to stuff ourselves.

102
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:22,249
The scallion pancakes...

103
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:25,039
To "Straightforward Romance's" success!

104
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,429
 Cheers! 

105
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,639
Okay, okay, okay.

106
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,419
As soon as "Straightforward Romance" premiered,

107
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:40,519
it was all over the internet, and the rating was through the roof.

108
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:44,199
Our drama is being received with enthusiasm. It's no joke.

109
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,289
All of this is thanks to you.

110
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:50,909
The station director gave me this card today.

111
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:54,789
Enjoy all you want, and here's for the 30% rating.

112
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,629
Let's go. Here we go!

113
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:58,859
Here we go!

114
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:08,799
   

115
00:07:19,299 --> 00:07:20,999
Enjoy!

116
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:25,369
- Do Ra. 
 - Yes?

117
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:27,989
My impression of you really changed this time.

118
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,919
Do Ra, you really are the queen of ratings.

119
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,779
I've actually never been in a hit show like this.

120
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:40,649
Do Ra, we might've had a rocky start in the beginning,

121
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:44,019
but I was so happy to work with you.

122
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:45,809
We had great chemistry, too.

123
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:48,919
I was happy to work with you, too.

124
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:50,419
- Really? 
 - Yes.

125
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:54,399
I hope we work together again next time, too.

126
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,349
That's how I feel.

127
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:59,039
How about you? Tell me. Tell me.

128
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,759
- Tell me, I said. 
 - Okay, okay, okay.

129
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,579
Let's work together if we get a chance again.

130
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:04,779
Really? You heard that, right?

131
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,669
Of course. I hope you do.

132
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:08,379
President Gong is here.

133
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:10,239
President Gong came.

134
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,129
You came, President Gong.

135
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,499
- Yes. 
 - Come this way.

136
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,269
Have a seat here.

137
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,529
Thank you so much. I mean it.

138
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:26,359
Let me pour you a glass, sir.

139
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:30,589
Thank you so much, President Gong.

140
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:33,289
Thanks to your generous support,

141
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:37,649
Do Ra and I were able to act comfortably.

142
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,219
We really were able to love freely.

143
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,449
Where's Do Ra? Do Ra...

144
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:44,789
Do Ra, am I right?

145
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:02,199
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo.

146
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:04,859
Pace yourself, President Gong.

147
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,409
- Mr. Cha. 
 - Yes.

148
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:10,559
I'd like to talk to you privately.

149
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,819
Let's talk for a moment.

150
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,639
Privately?

151
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,749
It's an honor.

152
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,579
Why did you want to see me privately, President Gong?

153
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:40,279
President Gong, why are you doing this to me?

154
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,149
You cocky bastard. How dare you?

155
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,299
How dare you mess with my woman?

156
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:47,729
I'll teach you a thing or two today.

157
00:09:48,969 --> 00:09:50,799
Hey, she's my woman!

158
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,369
How dare you? You bastard.

159
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:58,259
You bastard! Hey! Come here. Come here!

160
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:00,839
Hey, what are you doing?

161
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,899
- Come here, come here! 
 - Calm down, calm down.

162
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,179
- Nothing can stop me! 
 - What's with you? Calm down.

163
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,679
President Gong must be crazy.

164
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:12,319
He brought me here saying he wanted to talk, but he punched me!

165
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:15,389
Asshole, so what if you're a CEO? Why did you hit me?

166
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:17,559
Don't you dare hit on Park Do Ra again.

167
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,739
Expect a lot worse, then.

168
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:22,229
I'll bury you in the ground!

169
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:24,209
What? Park Do Ra?

170
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:26,839
What's he saying? He must be crazy. Hey!

171
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,029
My girlfriend is Bi Bi! Bi Bi!

172
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:33,089
Shut up! You just said you and Park Do Ra loved freely!

173
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:34,699
President Gong really is a crazy bastard.

174
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:39,409
Hey! We freely acted like we were in love in our drama, "Straightforward Romance!"

175
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:41,939
Whatever. Hey! Bring Park Do Ra here!

176
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:44,169
We need to have a three-way conversation!

177
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:45,809
What are you doing right now?

178
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:48,559
Why are you bringing me up? What did I do?

179
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,449
Ms. Park, did you reject me because of a bastard like this?

180
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:54,369
Because of a loser like him?

181
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:57,009
- What did you say? 
 - Hey, Park Do Ra, be honest.

182
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:59,429
Do you like me? I don't like you.

183
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:01,279
I'm seeing Bi Bi again right now.

184
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,139
Did you tell this bastard that you liked me?

185
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:07,179
What are you talking about? Bong Soo and I are just colleagues.

186
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:10,099
President Gong, what's all this?

187
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:18,379
Ms. Park, is there really nothing going on... between you and Cha Bong Soo?

188
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,449
President Gong, please leave. Please leave.

189
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:22,319
Talk to me instead. Please leave now.

190
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:24,449
Ms. Park, listen to me. The thing is—

191
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:27,289
A loser? A loser? I'm an impressive person.

192
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:29,999
- So what if you have money? 
 - Please, Hyung!

193
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:33,739
Pil Sung why did I get punched? That bastard...

194
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:36,699
Noona, what's wrong with President Gong?

195
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:49,839
- Geez. 
 - Hyung, did President Gong leave? What did he say?

196
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,719
He said he was mistaken.

197
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:54,199
He left because he must've had nothing to say.

198
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:56,039
But even so.

199
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:00,289
How could a CEO do something like this at an afterparty?

200
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:03,289
I didn't think he was like this, but he's so disrespectful.

201
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,619
I know.

202
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:09,929
I thought he was strange when he was sending flowers and catering to the set.

203
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:14,779
By the way, maybe something actually happened between him and Park Do Ra.

204
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,099
That's not true.

205
00:12:16,099 --> 00:12:19,009
What? It's not true?

206
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:21,509
What I meant is...

207
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:25,069
It can't be true if she says so.

208
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:28,999
I suppose. No sensible person would date someone like him.

209
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,619
How dare he ruin a happy occasion like this?

210
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:35,519
Why did he come and ruin things? Geez.

211
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:41,209
You know Park Do Ra?

212
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:44,499
Something serious must be up if President Gong is acting up like that.

213
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:46,359
I know.

214
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:48,069
The chimney doesn't smoke for no reason.

215
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:50,999
There had to be fire for there to be smoke.

216
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:52,569
I suppose.

217
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:55,049
Anyway, Park Do Ra is the problem.

218
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:57,819
She made Cha Bong Soo and Bi Bi fight in the beginning.

219
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,489
Now it's Cha Bong Soo and President Gong.

220
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:03,119
Isn't she really something?

221
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:05,089
What's this now? How messy.

222
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:06,779
Let's go.

223
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:49,729
It's okay. It's all right.

224
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,489
It's okay now.

225
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:59,089
Oppa, I swear there's nothing going on between me and President Gong.

226
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,089
I swear nothing happened.

227
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:06,209
You don't doubt me like other people, right?

228
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:11,159
What are you talking about?

229
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:14,789
Do I doubt you? How could you say that?

230
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:19,069
But I think people really are doubting me.

231
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:23,239
They say, "President Gong wouldn't have done that for no reason.”

232
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:26,099
“Something must've happened between the two."

233
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:28,849
Everyone saw that he was flipping out

234
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:34,129
on his own because he was mistaken, and it had nothing to do with you.

235
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:37,589
So, they won't doubt you or have wrong ideas about you.

236
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,339
You think so?

237
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,369
Of course.

238
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,859
If you say it didn't happen, it didn't.

239
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:51,359
And people will learn the truth as time goes by, too.

240
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:57,069
Don't worry about the people who don't know the situation and speak badly of others.

241
00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:01,329
Just forget about what happened today, okay?

242
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,769
Okay.

243
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:11,469
You're a good girl, Do Ra.

244
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,069
Do Ra, what should we do tomorrow?

245
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:16,739
You said you're free tomorrow.

246
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:19,179
Is there something you'd like to do? It can be anything.

247
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:22,409
Anything is good as long as you're with me.

248
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:26,649
Let's go to a famous restaurant, watch a movie, and go on a drive.

249
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:29,129
I'd like anything! Anything!

250
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:49,279
What crazy bastard is driving like that in the morning?

251
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:55,349
Isn't that President Gong?

252
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:58,469
Why is he giving me the stink eye like that?

253
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:09,999
President Gong, what brings you all the way here so early?

254
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:17,129
President Baek, Park Do Ra isn't interested in me, and she doesn't even like me.

255
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:20,129
Why did you make it sound like she liked me and was interested?

256
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:23,279
Why did you gaslight me?

257
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,199
Do you know what I did in public because you tricked me?

258
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,209
I became a total loser who chased her around when she was not interested in me at all.

259
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:34,799
who chased her around when she was not interested in me at all.

260
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,059
President Gong, are you blaming me right now?

261
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:40,449
You said you liked Do Ra.

262
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:43,719
You don't know how long I've been encouraging her all this time.

263
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:47,789
I've been helping you, but you couldn't even win her over.

264
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:51,469
What am I supposed to do? Seriously.

265
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,869
Anyway, I've totally given up. I don't know anymore.

266
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:57,869
So, you should figure it out yourself.

267
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:03,239
You want to play innocent after what you did to me?

268
00:17:06,314 --> 00:17:10,869
President Baek, do you still think I'm a joke?

269
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,809
Do you look down on me?

270
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:15,869
President Gong, how could you say that?

271
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:21,129
If only you didn't gaslight me as if Park Do Ra could be won over,

272
00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:23,489
I wouldn't have been in this mess.

273
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:27,699
Because you said she likes me and finds me attractive,

274
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:30,589
I gave her my heart, too.

275
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:32,889
So... since you turned me into a total loser by playing me,

276
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:37,749
since you turned me into a total loser by playing me,

277
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:40,109
you should be responsible for it.

278
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,479
President Gong, gaslighting?

279
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:46,339
I played you?

280
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:47,969
How could you be so unreasonable?

281
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:52,029
I did that to you? How does that make sense?

282
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,139
There's no need to talk further.

283
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:57,089
I'll give you exactly a month.

284
00:17:57,089 --> 00:18:01,799
Change her mind and put her in front of me in a month.

285
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,659
Otherwise, I'll make sure your daughter, Park Do Ra

286
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:10,079
loses her career so she disappears from the industry forever.

287
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:13,369
President Gong.

288
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:14,869
Why?

289
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:17,659
You think I won't be able to?

290
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:19,799
I made myself clear.

291
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:26,419
President Baek... you have a month.

292
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:39,629
President Gong must be really angry.

293
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:44,079
What do I do?

294
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,110
   

295
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:52,969
You should try this, too. It's the most popular product at our store.

296
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,829
My gosh. This is so nice.

297
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:00,419
This is so nice.

298
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,059
By the way, is it okay for me to just use it?

299
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,319
Of course. This is the store my son got me.

300
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,869
So, don't worry and use it.

301
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:15,969
Thank you, Ae Gyo. You got me a delicious meal and I'm caring for my skin, too.

302
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:18,529
I'm really treating myself, thanks to you.

303
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:22,379
Don't mention it. I can do this much for a friend.

304
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:25,539
Oh, right.

305
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:29,409
I heard you were also in the US when Soo Yeon studied there.

306
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:30,679
Yes, I was.

307
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,529
You must've seen her in the US often, then.

308
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:38,959
Hey, the US is a huge country. How could we meet often?

309
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:42,939
I ran into her once when I visited Boston.

310
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:44,449
Just once?

311
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,809
Yes. We met at a Korean restaurant.

312
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:48,739
She was with her boyfriend.

313
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:52,559
Oh, right. She had a boyfriend when she studied abroad.

314
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,019
What was the boyfriend's name?

315
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:58,079
It was Kang something. What was it?

316
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,629
Getting old makes me so forgetful.

317
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:04,389
Kang? What do you mean, Kang? It's Kim. Kim Seong Soo.

318
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:07,049
Right, it was Kim Seong Soo.

319
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:09,559
Gosh, you still have a good memory.

320
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:13,229
That's not why. My brother's name is Kim Seong Soo.

321
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:16,829
I remember because he had the same name.

322
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:22,349
Soo Yeon's boyfriend was tall and handsome. 
    

323
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:25,359
They made such a good-looking couple.

324
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,449
Jae Gyeong, this is to celebrate our reunion.

325
00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:33,009
Care for your skin with this now.

326
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:35,349
My gosh, you're giving me a gift, too?

327
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:37,500
Gosh, thank you so much.

328
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:39,839
Auntie. Auntie!

329
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:46,079
Soo Yeon did have a boyfriend back then.

330
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,029
Right?

331
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,639
She did have a man, right?

332
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:52,329
Yes, I suppose they were serious.

333
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:56,119
My goodness. Ms. Jo was right.

334
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:59,509
She didn't say that for no reason.

335
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:02,459
So where's that man now?

336
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:05,699
I don't know that yet. But I found out the name.

337
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:09,469
She used to date a man named Kim Seong Soo.

338
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,899
His name is Kim Seong Soo?

339
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:16,509
You did important work. You really did.

340
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:20,589
Auntie, I told you to just count on me.

341
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:30,709
Mother, you were with Auntie.

342
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:32,649
I only prepared one tea.

343
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:34,609
Should I make another one?

344
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:38,199
No, it's okay. I don't need to drink it.

345
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:42,139
We have something to talk about. Put the tea here and leave.

346
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:43,759
Okay.

347
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:55,639
How annoying.

348
00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:00,339
Were they talking about me? They stopped talking when I went in.

349
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:03,039
What are they plotting, exactly?

350
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:08,259
Yes, let's not worry. Who cares what they do?

351
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,505
Heart, heart.

352
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:33,551
Huh? It's Park Do Ra.

353
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:35,421
I'm not Park Do Ra.

354
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,954
It's Park Do Ra! My gosh.

355
00:22:38,954 --> 00:22:41,264
Hey, what are you doing right now?

356
00:22:41,264 --> 00:22:44,554
Why did you lie she wasn't Park Do Ra? So annoying.

357
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:46,764
You're not supposed to lie.

358
00:22:46,764 --> 00:22:48,714
Are you dating?

359
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,594
Gosh, are you a couple?

360
00:22:51,594 --> 00:22:55,104
Daebak, did we witness Park Do Ra's date, then?

361
00:22:55,104 --> 00:22:56,634
- Take a picture. Take a picture. 
 - Wait.

362
00:22:56,634 --> 00:22:59,664
You can't take a photo with your phone. I'm her manager.

363
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:03,004
She's on a break right now. I hope you understand.

364
00:23:03,004 --> 00:23:05,664
I beg you, please.

365
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:08,024
I'm sorry I lied.

366
00:23:09,324 --> 00:23:12,804
Have a good time. I love your uniform.

367
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:25,664
Drink this.

368
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,444
I'm sorry, Oppa.

369
00:23:33,414 --> 00:23:36,724
You can't walk around in the streets freely because of me.

370
00:23:36,724 --> 00:23:39,654
You can't even eat at famous restaurants, either.

371
00:23:39,654 --> 00:23:44,814
You wouldn't have had to go through this if you dated a normal person.

372
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:48,564
Our date was ruined because of me again.

373
00:23:48,564 --> 00:23:50,214
Ruined?

374
00:23:50,214 --> 00:23:52,944
Our date hasn't even started yet.

375
00:23:54,754 --> 00:23:56,654
I'm okay with everything.

376
00:23:56,654 --> 00:23:59,384
Just talking to you in the car like this is fun

377
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:03,074
and I'm happy to eat a sandwich sitting on the lawn.

378
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:07,734
But if you don't like doing this,

379
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:10,934
we can make our relationship public.

380
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:12,644
Do whatever you want to do. I'm okay with everything.

381
00:24:12,644 --> 00:24:14,864
I'm okay with everything.

382
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,164
What?

383
00:24:18,754 --> 00:24:22,014
I'm so moved to hear you say that.

384
00:24:22,014 --> 00:24:24,404
It's not moving at all.

385
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:28,264
It's so uncomfortable even now.

386
00:24:28,264 --> 00:24:32,444
You'd get a lot more tired if we went public.

387
00:24:32,444 --> 00:24:35,064
I don't want you to suffer.

388
00:24:35,064 --> 00:24:37,924
You're moving me this time.

389
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:42,874
Other celebrities only go out late at night

390
00:24:42,874 --> 00:24:45,824
and they only have dates in cars or at home.

391
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,784
Because everyone recognizes you everywhere you go.

392
00:24:49,924 --> 00:24:52,674
But we can't do the same.

393
00:24:53,214 --> 00:24:57,154
Do Ra, we can come up with our own dates.

394
00:24:57,154 --> 00:24:59,094
We'll do it our style.

395
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,914
Our style?

396
00:25:11,414 --> 00:25:13,374
Where are we going?

397
00:25:14,254 --> 00:25:16,364
Where?

398
00:26:04,484 --> 00:26:10,744
Aigoo, you're such a handsome married couple. Seriously.

399
00:26:10,744 --> 00:26:12,584
Thank you.

400
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:18,074
What village is the handsome man's wife from?

401
00:26:18,074 --> 00:26:20,804
We're from the village on that side. How about you?

402
00:26:20,804 --> 00:26:24,044
I'm from the village on this side.

403
00:26:24,044 --> 00:26:28,424
Smelling the banquet noodles and anchovy noodles makes me hungry.

404
00:26:28,424 --> 00:26:30,774
How about you, Honey?

405
00:26:30,774 --> 00:26:33,114
I'm hungry, too.

406
00:26:33,114 --> 00:26:37,714
We'll have two banquet noodles and give us enough soondae, too.

407
00:26:37,714 --> 00:26:41,074
Okay. Wait a moment.

408
00:26:43,994 --> 00:26:46,394
Drink water. It's hot.

409
00:26:46,394 --> 00:26:48,314
Okay.

410
00:26:50,414 --> 00:26:53,264
Thank you so much.

411
00:27:04,454 --> 00:27:08,424
By the way, how many kids do you have?

412
00:27:09,404 --> 00:27:10,834
We have three sons.

413
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:15,414
Aigoo, you're so young, but you had three sons?

414
00:27:15,414 --> 00:27:17,954
You're patriots. Patriots.

415
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:22,594
The country needs to award people like you.

416
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:27,324
What? You want me to feed you? Here.

417
00:27:28,474 --> 00:27:30,304
Say ah.

418
00:27:30,304 --> 00:27:35,104
Your husband is feeding you. Go ahead and eat it.

419
00:27:49,994 --> 00:27:52,144
Okay.

420
00:27:52,144 --> 00:27:55,044
You say ah, too.

421
00:27:59,254 --> 00:28:04,464
You have three kids because you're so affectionate.

422
00:28:07,054 --> 00:28:09,624
By the way, when will we have a daughter?

423
00:28:14,204 --> 00:28:16,574
You're the one who should be acting.

424
00:28:16,574 --> 00:28:18,164
Why are you so good at acting?

425
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:20,564
Do you know the first thing I did as a drama producer?

426
00:28:20,564 --> 00:28:24,934
- What is it? 
 - I acted dead.

427
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:27,374
one of the extras got an upset stomach and couldn't film.

428
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:31,574
So, I did a scene where I was shot with an arrow and died. And I did the scene in one go.

429
00:28:31,574 --> 00:28:33,094
Wow, really?

430
00:28:33,094 --> 00:28:36,314
Everyone told me to be an actor instead.

431
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:41,024
I would've been the biggest actor if I debuted as an actor then.

432
00:28:41,024 --> 00:28:43,814
I complimented you once, and now you're the biggest actor?

433
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:46,034
Seriously, I can't say anything to you.

434
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:48,754
Hey, Park Do Ra. I'm serious.

435
00:29:03,804 --> 00:29:08,144
 Seon Yeong, I... 

436
00:29:08,144 --> 00:29:11,224
 have no regrets... 

437
00:29:11,224 --> 00:29:14,804
 and I don't blame anyone. 

438
00:29:14,804 --> 00:29:20,084
 So, don't blame that woman. 

439
00:29:20,084 --> 00:29:25,894
 And don't accept her money. 

440
00:29:38,324 --> 00:29:43,054
   

441
00:29:46,124 --> 00:29:47,944
Seon Yeong.

442
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:54,254
What's wrong? What happened?

443
00:29:57,684 --> 00:29:59,514
Soo Yeon.

444
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,164
I'm glad you came, Seon Yeong.

445
00:30:08,794 --> 00:30:11,374
I'll give you the 50 million right now.

446
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:14,494
Go ahead and pay her back immediately.

447
00:30:16,854 --> 00:30:23,264
I didn't want to depend on you for stuff like this. I'm sorry.

448
00:30:23,264 --> 00:30:26,734
Come on, don't be like that between us.

449
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:31,634
I sent it just now. Check your phone.

450
00:30:38,614 --> 00:30:40,504
Thank you.

451
00:30:41,344 --> 00:30:45,104
I'll make sure to pay you back.

452
00:30:45,664 --> 00:30:48,254
Okay.

453
00:30:48,254 --> 00:30:51,964
Take your time to pay me back when you can.

454
00:30:52,924 --> 00:30:56,744
I wanted to get it myself somehow,

455
00:30:57,624 --> 00:31:01,184
but I can't even get loans anymore.

456
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,274
To be honest,

457
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:12,614
my husband took out 300 million to start a business and lost it.

458
00:31:13,554 --> 00:31:16,984
Pil Sung is still paying for it.

459
00:31:16,984 --> 00:31:18,514
What?

460
00:31:18,514 --> 00:31:20,474
Pil Sung is?

461
00:31:21,664 --> 00:31:27,104
Yes, so I couldn't even bring it up to Pil Sung.

462
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:34,074
I didn't want him to go all around town trying to get a loan again.

463
00:31:39,154 --> 00:31:41,694
Yes, you did the right thing.

464
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,724
He's still a young man.

465
00:31:45,724 --> 00:31:49,614
He shouldn't carry such a heavy burden.

466
00:31:51,334 --> 00:31:54,064
I'm glad you came to me, Seon Yeong.

467
00:31:54,064 --> 00:32:00,294
Tell me first if something like this happens again, okay?

468
00:32:03,474 --> 00:32:05,814
Thank you so much...

469
00:32:07,744 --> 00:32:09,884
for even saying that.

470
00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:08,054
Pil Sung just started his career,

471
00:33:09,134 --> 00:33:13,584
but he's paying back 300 million?

472
00:33:14,614 --> 00:33:18,114
I feel so bad for poor Pil Sung.

473
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,864
We have so many commercials lined up.

474
00:33:22,864 --> 00:33:25,634
Which one should we start with?

475
00:33:25,634 --> 00:33:29,904
I won't have to worry about debt if she did all this.

476
00:33:29,904 --> 00:33:32,384
I can finally sleep comfortably.

477
00:33:32,384 --> 00:33:34,150
Yes.

478
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,860
   

479
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,984
President Baek, someone named Kim Seon Yeong is here.

480
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:41,564
Kim Seon Yeong? Who's that?

481
00:33:44,634 --> 00:33:46,694
It's me.

482
00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:49,504
You can leave. We don't need tea.

483
00:33:49,504 --> 00:33:51,314
Yes, Ma'am.

484
00:33:52,754 --> 00:33:55,074
What brings you here?

485
00:33:58,584 --> 00:34:01,064
I came to give you the 50 million won back.

486
00:34:01,064 --> 00:34:05,254
We have no reason to take this from you.

487
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:09,024
My father gave it to you. Just take it.

488
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,824
Hey, hey, hey. Why did you bring this here, exactly?

489
00:34:13,544 --> 00:34:16,624
You cried and begged for money once.

490
00:34:16,624 --> 00:34:18,394
Why? Is this not enough?

491
00:34:18,394 --> 00:34:22,524
Your mother-in-law brought up 100 million with me.

492
00:34:22,524 --> 00:34:24,944
Are you demanding that much now?

493
00:34:24,944 --> 00:34:26,534
Excuse me, dream on.

494
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:31,024
You can't blackmail me for money anymore.

495
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,634
Let me ask you one thing.

496
00:34:34,634 --> 00:34:39,184
Don't you feel bad for my father even a little bit?

497
00:34:39,184 --> 00:34:42,254
Why should I feel bad for your father?

498
00:34:42,254 --> 00:34:46,004
Gosh, you've got to be kidding me.

499
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:50,174
My father was sincere to you.

500
00:34:50,174 --> 00:34:53,384
Without knowing you were a piece of trash like this.

501
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:56,384
Even when he was dying,

502
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:59,024
he told me to forgive you and not accept this money from you.

503
00:34:59,024 --> 00:35:02,394
he told me to forgive you and not accept this money from you.

504
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:05,084
Can you still call yourself a human?

505
00:35:05,084 --> 00:35:07,794
What kind of person are you?

506
00:35:07,794 --> 00:35:11,284
How could you not feel bad for my father even a tiny bit?

507
00:35:11,284 --> 00:35:13,414
So why...

508
00:35:14,314 --> 00:35:15,914
Why do I have to feel bad?

509
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:18,654
A smelly old man wanted to be with a young woman.

510
00:35:18,654 --> 00:35:21,574
He gave me that money to seduce me. Why should I?

511
00:35:21,574 --> 00:35:25,654
The old man paid me to seduce me without knowing his place.

512
00:35:25,654 --> 00:35:27,714
Why should I?

513
00:35:27,714 --> 00:35:32,094
You bitch! You're less than an animal!

514
00:35:32,094 --> 00:35:35,924
You played with a person's heart. What did you just say?

515
00:35:35,924 --> 00:35:38,624
Are you a human? You bitch!

516
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:42,034
My father died because of you! Bring him back to life!

517
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:44,034
Bring him back to life!

518
00:35:44,034 --> 00:35:46,794
Bring him back...

519
00:35:48,704 --> 00:35:50,024
Get that bitch out of here!

520
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:52,384
I want to call the police on you,

521
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,664
but I'm holding back since you'd taint Do Ra's image.

522
00:35:54,664 --> 00:35:56,494
What are you doing? Get that bitch out of here!

523
00:35:56,494 --> 00:35:58,564
Let go of me!

524
00:35:58,564 --> 00:36:01,024
I'll leave myself! I will!

525
00:36:03,044 --> 00:36:06,214
Baek Mi Ja, listen carefully.

526
00:36:06,214 --> 00:36:08,924
I know you don't want to admit it,

527
00:36:08,924 --> 00:36:12,114
but you must know what you did better than anyone.

528
00:36:12,114 --> 00:36:17,304
And you'll get punished by the heavens someday for what you did.

529
00:36:17,304 --> 00:36:19,514
Remember that.

530
00:36:23,254 --> 00:36:28,264
That bitch... How dare she curse me here? How dare she?

531
00:37:15,504 --> 00:37:19,734
Mom, thanks for breakfast.

532
00:37:19,734 --> 00:37:22,794
Toast and coffee aren't breakfast.

533
00:37:22,794 --> 00:37:24,774
Go to work now.

534
00:37:24,774 --> 00:37:26,514
Okay.

535
00:37:27,434 --> 00:37:31,284
Mom, are you free this afternoon?

536
00:37:31,284 --> 00:37:35,304
This afternoon? Why? What is it?

537
00:37:35,304 --> 00:37:39,304
What do you mean, why? Go on a date with me like we used to.

538
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:44,844
I know you're busy. You shouldn't worry about me.

539
00:37:44,844 --> 00:37:49,804
Let's go some other time. Thanks for thinking of me, Son.

540
00:37:49,804 --> 00:37:53,614
I haven't cared for you since I've been busy with "Straightforward Romance."

541
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:56,434
It's been long since we've been on a date, too.

542
00:37:56,434 --> 00:37:59,074
I suppose. It's been a while, right?

543
00:37:59,074 --> 00:38:02,104
So, meet me for lunch later.

544
00:38:02,104 --> 00:38:04,884
Don't tell Dad and Grandma.

545
00:38:04,884 --> 00:38:08,944
Okay, I'll come since you're asking me to.

546
00:38:08,944 --> 00:38:11,414
I'm going to work now.

547
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,134
Okay.

548
00:38:16,334 --> 00:38:19,554
 - See you later! 
 - Yes, have a good day, Son. 

549
00:38:19,554 --> 00:38:22,444
 Beware of cars and women. 

550
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:27,004
Hey, doesn't she sound less angry?

551
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:29,844
Her voice sounded normal, and her face lightened up, too.

552
00:38:29,844 --> 00:38:33,974
Aigoo, she's only like that to Pil Sung.

553
00:38:33,974 --> 00:38:37,314
She won't even make eye contact with me.

554
00:38:37,314 --> 00:38:39,724
- Still? 
 - Yes.

555
00:38:39,724 --> 00:38:45,354
She made me so uncomfortable that I slept briefly in front of the door last night.

556
00:38:45,354 --> 00:38:48,094
You sleep in front of the door?

557
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:50,884
Gosh, this is so upsetting.

558
00:38:50,884 --> 00:38:58,464
But still, I thought she'd throw a pillow at me and tell me to leave the house.

559
00:38:58,464 --> 00:39:01,994
But I'm glad she lets me sleep, at least in front of the door.

560
00:39:01,994 --> 00:39:05,654
Gosh, glad, my foot.

561
00:39:05,654 --> 00:39:10,514
But still, what are you, a sock that's lying around?

562
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,944
Isn't she taking it too far?

563
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:20,054
By the way, how long do we have to tiptoe around her like this?

564
00:39:20,054 --> 00:39:22,834
Mom, can you really say that now?

565
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:25,774
As Oppa said, be glad you didn't get kicked out.

566
00:39:25,774 --> 00:39:29,164
Please watch your mouth from now on.

567
00:39:29,164 --> 00:39:33,344
You and Oppa have nothing to say in this situation.

568
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:47,044
Hey, Honey. I'm going to work.

569
00:39:47,044 --> 00:39:49,284
I was saying goodbye to Mother.

570
00:39:49,284 --> 00:39:50,844
Eat before you go.

571
00:39:50,844 --> 00:39:53,794
No, how could I eat here?

572
00:39:53,794 --> 00:39:56,064
I'll be right back.

573
00:39:56,064 --> 00:39:58,834
If you go to work with an empty stomach and pass out,

574
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:01,944
who will take care of the rest?

575
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:05,784
I packed you lunch. Take that with you after you eat.

576
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:10,214
O-Okay. I will.

577
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,930
   

578
00:40:25,864 --> 00:40:28,044
He's not here today.

579
00:40:29,604 --> 00:40:34,544
I suppose. I yelled at him so much. How could he come back?

580
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:49,514
Well...

581
00:40:50,454 --> 00:40:53,114
I'll have a cappuccino.

582
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:57,124
It's okay.

583
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:59,074
It's my treat today.

584
00:40:59,074 --> 00:41:01,634
You're buying me a coffee?

585
00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:06,564
Since I owe you for the last time,

586
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:09,334
I should return the favor.

587
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:12,754
Oh, okay, then...

588
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:32,894
Thank you for last time.

589
00:41:32,894 --> 00:41:38,334
Not at all. It's not like you're a stranger. I had to help.

590
00:41:38,334 --> 00:41:41,554
I'll enjoy the coffee. Thank you.

591
00:41:46,284 --> 00:41:49,064
I'm grateful for last time...

592
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:53,644
and I no longer resent you.

593
00:41:54,254 --> 00:41:57,174
But to be honest,

594
00:41:57,174 --> 00:42:01,894
I no longer want to even run into you anymore.

595
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:05,914
Our encounter wasn't so positive.

596
00:42:09,264 --> 00:42:11,684
I'll ask you politely.

597
00:42:11,684 --> 00:42:14,464
Please don't come here anymore.

598
00:42:21,794 --> 00:42:25,224
Okay. I see that you're cheerful now.

599
00:42:25,224 --> 00:42:27,714
I'll just finish this coffee and leave.

600
00:43:06,374 --> 00:43:08,774
- Gosh! 
 - Here, here!

601
00:43:08,774 --> 00:43:10,994
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

602
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:18,804
Today was so much fun.

603
00:43:19,844 --> 00:43:23,184
But I'm so sad you're going back to the US already.

604
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,484
We can't see each other anymore?

605
00:43:24,484 --> 00:43:28,474
I'll contact you the next time I come back to Korea. Let's hang out again, then.

606
00:43:28,474 --> 00:43:31,104
You mean it, right? Promise.

607
00:43:31,104 --> 00:43:32,434
Promise.

608
00:43:32,434 --> 00:43:35,784
You have to hang out with me if I contact you in the US, okay?

609
00:43:35,784 --> 00:43:39,174
Of course, I will. And here's a present.

610
00:43:39,174 --> 00:43:42,274
I got that because I noticed you like dolls last time.

611
00:43:42,274 --> 00:43:45,564
Gosh, this is my absolute favorite.

612
00:43:45,564 --> 00:43:48,454
You really have the same taste as me, don't you?

613
00:43:48,454 --> 00:43:51,634
I think we can become good friends.

614
00:43:53,204 --> 00:43:57,024
Don't call me "Noona" from now on.

615
00:43:57,024 --> 00:43:59,584
Everyone is friends in the US.

616
00:44:01,054 --> 00:44:03,754
Let's be friends starting today.

617
00:44:03,754 --> 00:44:05,834
What do you say?

618
00:44:05,834 --> 00:44:07,864
Okay, sounds good.

619
00:44:20,584 --> 00:44:24,734
Ma Ri, my gosh. What's this? Did you buy it?

620
00:44:24,734 --> 00:44:28,874
No, Park Do Joon gifted it to me since he's going back to the US.

621
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,134
Isn't it so cute?

622
00:44:31,134 --> 00:44:35,144
And Do Jun and I agreed to be friends starting today.

623
00:44:35,144 --> 00:44:39,524
You must be happy, Ma Ri. You got a pretty gift and a friend, too.

624
00:44:39,524 --> 00:44:43,274
Yes. Mom, I think Do Jun is really sweet.

625
00:44:43,274 --> 00:44:48,434
He doesn't look at me strangely and he treats me like a friend.

626
00:44:49,954 --> 00:44:53,074
What? Do you want to rest at home now?

627
00:44:53,074 --> 00:44:56,614
Okay, if so...

628
00:44:56,614 --> 00:44:58,044
Here.

629
00:44:58,044 --> 00:45:00,074
On the bed? Good night.

630
00:45:00,074 --> 00:45:03,104
Noona, I'm at the airport now. I'm leaving in two hours.

631
00:45:03,104 --> 00:45:07,274
 I'm sorry. I was too busy to hang out with you. 

632
00:45:07,274 --> 00:45:08,984
 See you again during summer break. 

633
00:45:08,984 --> 00:45:11,874
Okay. Noona, take care of yourself while working.

634
00:45:11,874 --> 00:45:13,604
Don't worry about me.

635
00:45:13,604 --> 00:45:15,404
Fighting, Noona.

636
00:45:17,864 --> 00:45:21,294
This is so tasty. It melts in my mouth.

637
00:45:22,884 --> 00:45:26,134
Didn't you choose a place that's too expensive?

638
00:45:26,134 --> 00:45:28,724
It's on your son, Mom.

639
00:45:28,724 --> 00:45:31,454
Don't worry about money, and enjoy it.

640
00:45:31,454 --> 00:45:37,204
Okay. I'll eat all I want and enjoy it since it's your treat.

641
00:45:40,494 --> 00:45:44,794
By the way, Mom, something's up at home, right?

642
00:45:44,794 --> 00:45:46,464
What?

643
00:45:47,854 --> 00:45:50,274
No, not at all.

644
00:45:50,274 --> 00:45:53,294
Come on. The house is quiet whenever I come home from work

645
00:45:53,294 --> 00:45:55,440
and you won't tell me when I ask you about it.

646
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,950
You think I'm that dense?

647
00:45:58,984 --> 00:46:01,204
Mom, is Dad...

648
00:46:01,204 --> 00:46:04,074
Is something going on with him?

649
00:46:04,984 --> 00:46:07,454
No, it's nothing, I said.

650
00:46:07,454 --> 00:46:11,954
I'm not telling you because there really is nothing going on.

651
00:46:13,494 --> 00:46:15,404
That's a relief, then.

652
00:46:16,214 --> 00:46:20,124
But, Mom, if something happens,

653
00:46:20,124 --> 00:46:24,474
tell your son instead of suffering all by yourself.

654
00:46:24,474 --> 00:46:28,884
I'm the only son in this family. I should be the first one to know.

655
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:32,274
All right.

656
00:46:33,034 --> 00:46:36,354
Okay, so you should go ahead and eat, too.

657
00:46:37,334 --> 00:46:39,574
This place is really good.

658
00:46:39,574 --> 00:46:41,684
It must taste better since I'm eating with my son.

659
00:46:41,684 --> 00:46:43,604
I suppose you're right.

660
00:46:44,574 --> 00:46:47,724
- You should eat, too. Don't give me all of it. 
 - Okay, okay.

661
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:50,884
 Gosh, why am I seeing that woman here? 

662
00:46:50,884 --> 00:46:53,484
It's the room back there. Let's go, President Baek.

663
00:46:53,484 --> 00:46:55,144
Okay.

664
00:46:55,144 --> 00:46:58,194
Mom, this is non-alcoholic.

665
00:46:58,194 --> 00:47:00,934
Really? Should I try some, then?

666
00:47:00,934 --> 00:47:02,124
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

667
00:47:02,124 --> 00:47:06,354
 He called her "Mom." Is he Dae Chung? 

668
00:47:06,354 --> 00:47:08,664
 Gosh, he's all grown now. 

669
00:47:08,664 --> 00:47:12,074
Is it good? I'll get you another one after this.

670
00:47:21,514 --> 00:47:23,274
Who's this?

671
00:47:26,864 --> 00:47:28,364
Hello?

672
00:47:28,364 --> 00:47:31,744
 Soo Yeon, this is Soo Yeon, right? 

673
00:47:31,744 --> 00:47:33,904
 It's me, Eun Joo. Kang Eun Joo. 

674
00:47:33,904 --> 00:47:35,994
Gosh, Eun Joo.

675
00:47:35,994 --> 00:47:38,324
It's been so long.

676
00:47:38,324 --> 00:47:40,884
We haven't talked for so long, right?

677
00:47:40,884 --> 00:47:43,324
 Gosh, I know. 

678
00:47:43,324 --> 00:47:46,404
 I can't believe so much time has passed. 

679
00:47:46,404 --> 00:47:48,594
 You're doing well, right, Soo Yeon? 

680
00:47:48,594 --> 00:47:50,934
Yes, of course. I am.

681
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:53,714
How about you? You're doing well, too, right?

682
00:47:53,714 --> 00:47:55,534
 Yes, I am. 

683
00:47:55,534 --> 00:47:59,604
 By the way, something has been bothering me. 

684
00:47:59,604 --> 00:48:01,504
 That's why I called. 

685
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:06,564
Well, what do you mean, something's bothering you?

686
00:48:10,184 --> 00:48:12,874
W-What did you say?

687
00:48:12,874 --> 00:48:14,684
Ae Gyo?

688
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:22,434
What does Auntie want to do by finding Soo Yeon's ex-boyfriend, Kim Seong Soo?

689
00:48:22,434 --> 00:48:25,334
I bet something is up with that Soo Yeon.

690
00:48:25,334 --> 00:48:29,321
Auntie is doing this because there's something more mysterious and shocking.

691
00:48:29,321 --> 00:48:32,001
Gosh, I wonder what that is.

692
00:48:32,001 --> 00:48:36,051
What is it? I'm dying to know!

693
00:48:36,051 --> 00:48:38,761
- Hey, Hong Ae Gyo! 
 - You scared me!

694
00:48:38,761 --> 00:48:42,861
Gosh, why are you acting so rude right now?

695
00:48:42,861 --> 00:48:48,161
And how dare you say, "Hey, Hong Ae Gyo" to your mother-in-law?

696
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:49,791
You called Eun Joo, didn't you?

697
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:52,091
You met with Jae Gyeong, too, right?

698
00:48:52,091 --> 00:48:53,711
What's with you?

699
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:57,211
How dare you ask them about my past?

700
00:48:57,211 --> 00:48:59,891
I studied abroad more than 30 years ago.

701
00:48:59,891 --> 00:49:02,471
Why do you care about what I did and whom I dated?

702
00:49:02,471 --> 00:49:04,731
Why are you so curious about me?

703
00:49:04,731 --> 00:49:07,671
Well, I just...

704
00:49:07,671 --> 00:49:11,461
So... As the elder of this house...

705
00:49:11,461 --> 00:49:15,841
You're my friend but also my daughter-in-law.

706
00:49:15,841 --> 00:49:19,781
So, I was curious how you lived while studying abroad.

707
00:49:19,781 --> 00:49:22,151
Do you think that makes any sense?

708
00:49:22,151 --> 00:49:26,361
And we live together as a family.

709
00:49:26,361 --> 00:49:28,911
How could you ask around about me?

710
00:49:28,911 --> 00:49:31,481
Why are you doing this, exactly?

711
00:49:31,481 --> 00:49:33,201
What's the reason, exactly?

712
00:49:33,201 --> 00:49:35,011
Gosh, it's not like that.

713
00:49:35,011 --> 00:49:36,691
I have no other reasons.

714
00:49:36,691 --> 00:49:39,371
I swear I'm not trying to get at anything.

715
00:49:39,371 --> 00:49:42,531
I just thought of my old friends,

716
00:49:42,531 --> 00:49:45,111
so I called them, chatted in person,

717
00:49:45,111 --> 00:49:50,291
and it just came up while talking about stuff. I'm serious!

718
00:49:55,161 --> 00:49:56,931
What's this about?

719
00:49:57,831 --> 00:49:59,581
What's going on?

720
00:50:05,911 --> 00:50:08,691
What's with you two?

721
00:50:10,061 --> 00:50:12,071
What's going on?

722
00:50:13,381 --> 00:50:16,021
I-It's nothing.

723
00:50:16,021 --> 00:50:20,801
I told her off because she was saying useless things to our classmates.

724
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:22,781
Ae Gyo...

725
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:29,871
I mean, Mother always used to say inappropriate things.

726
00:50:29,871 --> 00:50:31,991
I hope you understand.

727
00:50:32,841 --> 00:50:35,731
I'll get a glass of water.

728
00:50:43,631 --> 00:50:47,621
Why is Ae Gyo asking around about my past?

729
00:50:47,621 --> 00:50:50,131
Does she know something?

730
00:50:51,751 --> 00:50:53,861
No.

731
00:50:53,861 --> 00:50:56,251
That can't be.

732
00:50:56,251 --> 00:50:59,971
No one knows about my Pil Sung.

733
00:51:01,031 --> 00:51:03,511
No one but my late mother.

734
00:51:04,701 --> 00:51:08,581
No, it can't be that.

735
00:51:11,371 --> 00:51:13,141
What did you say?

736
00:51:13,141 --> 00:51:18,211
You got caught asking your classmates about Soo Yeon's past?

737
00:51:18,211 --> 00:51:19,921
Yes.

738
00:51:20,941 --> 00:51:23,811
You need to be careful from now on.

739
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:27,971
She'll try even harder to hide things now.

740
00:51:27,971 --> 00:51:29,671
Something is definitely up.

741
00:51:29,671 --> 00:51:32,101
Chairman Gong asked her what it was about,

742
00:51:32,101 --> 00:51:34,291
but since she's guilty about something,

743
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:37,721
she told him it was nothing and took him away immediately.

744
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:40,191
My poor Jin Taek.

745
00:51:40,191 --> 00:51:43,131
He doesn't even know his wife is a nine-tailed fox.

746
00:51:43,131 --> 00:51:46,621
He listens to everything she says.

747
00:51:46,621 --> 00:51:53,771
Auntie, might as well tell me why you want to know about her past.

748
00:51:53,771 --> 00:51:58,941
Why are you looking for her ex-boyfriend, Kim Seong Soo?

749
00:51:58,941 --> 00:52:01,141
It's not time yet.

750
00:52:01,141 --> 00:52:04,871
I'll tell you first when the time comes.

751
00:52:19,711 --> 00:52:21,541
I'm home.

752
00:52:21,541 --> 00:52:23,501
Mom, I'm back.

753
00:52:23,501 --> 00:52:27,711
My Do Ra. Actor Do Ra. You worked hard today, too.

754
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:31,131
By the way, who sent this? It's pretty.

755
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:33,341
President Gong sent this bouquet.

756
00:52:33,341 --> 00:52:36,391
With the highest-quality champagne.

757
00:52:36,391 --> 00:52:41,371
Mom, you can't accept stuff like this from him again. Return these right now.

758
00:52:41,371 --> 00:52:44,961
And don't accept even a grain of rice from him, okay?

759
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:49,041
Hey, Do Ra. Have a look at this. Here.

760
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:56,201
He sent an apology, asking you to forgive him for what he did at the afterparty. Look.

761
00:52:56,201 --> 00:53:00,341
And look at this. Here...

762
00:53:00,341 --> 00:53:04,601
Here. Cha Bong Soo posted this on social media.

763
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:06,911
I guess he made up with President Gong.

764
00:53:06,911 --> 00:53:10,741
They took a photo with their arms around each other.

765
00:53:10,741 --> 00:53:12,531
So what?

766
00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:15,711
Of course, he should apologize since he did something wrong.

767
00:53:15,711 --> 00:53:19,071
Do Ra, it's hard to find a man like him.

768
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:22,361
He's an heir to a corporation, but he apologized politely to an actor.

769
00:53:22,361 --> 00:53:25,961
Not everyone can do this. This requires true courage.

770
00:53:25,961 --> 00:53:31,091
I'm seeing him in a new light now. So... consider him just once. With an open mind.

771
00:53:31,091 --> 00:53:33,871
Don't be so hasty, and take your time.

772
00:53:33,871 --> 00:53:37,291
Mom, don't bring him up in front of me again.

773
00:53:37,291 --> 00:53:39,191
I really hate him.

774
00:53:39,191 --> 00:53:43,201
What's the real reason you don't like him?

775
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:46,281
Isn't he a perfect man you only see in dramas?

776
00:53:46,281 --> 00:53:48,891
Why do you hate someone so impressive?

777
00:53:48,891 --> 00:53:50,611
Are you blind or something?

778
00:53:50,611 --> 00:53:52,711
What's so impressive about him?

779
00:53:52,711 --> 00:53:57,701
You must like everything about him because he's a corporate heir. But I don't.

780
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:00,351
What is he, a king? God?

781
00:54:00,351 --> 00:54:02,761
He's arrogant and only cares about himself.

782
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:04,971
Hey, it's because he's exceptional.

783
00:54:04,971 --> 00:54:06,531
Why is that a problem?

784
00:54:06,531 --> 00:54:09,731
Just try dating him with an open mind, I said.

785
00:54:09,731 --> 00:54:13,601
He's so devoted to you. How pure is that?

786
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:18,191
Mom, don't ever mention him again.

787
00:54:18,191 --> 00:54:19,831
I beg you.

788
00:54:23,751 --> 00:54:27,681
She hates him that much. What am I going to do?

789
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:32,431
 Change her mind and put her in front of me in a month. 

790
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:35,311
 Otherwise, I'll make sure your daughter, Park Do Ra 

791
00:54:35,311 --> 00:54:40,261
 loses her career, so she disappears from the industry forever. 

792
00:54:41,651 --> 00:54:46,871
No way. President Gong can't be such a vicious man.

793
00:54:56,971 --> 00:54:59,391
 Oppa, where are you? 

794
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:04,501
 I just got back. I'm at home. 

795
00:55:08,091 --> 00:55:09,371
 Me, too. 

796
00:55:09,371 --> 00:55:12,421
 I shot an editorial, a commercial, and had an interview. 

797
00:55:12,421 --> 00:55:16,721
 I did everything today so I could go on a date with you tomorrow. I'm tired. 

798
00:55:16,721 --> 00:55:19,451
 Praise me, Oppa. 

799
00:55:21,581 --> 00:55:23,981
 You worked hard, Ms. Park. 

800
00:55:23,981 --> 00:55:27,491
 I praise you. Pet, pet. 

801
00:55:29,681 --> 00:55:32,061
 I'm so happy that you praised me. 

802
00:55:32,061 --> 00:55:35,371
 Oppa, what should we do tomorrow? 

803
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,771
 Should we go stargazing? 

804
00:55:43,771 --> 00:55:46,241
 I know a good place for it. 

805
00:55:47,021 --> 00:55:50,581
 Stargazing? I love it. I love it. I love it. 

806
00:55:54,241 --> 00:55:55,881
Hold on.

807
00:56:07,141 --> 00:56:08,591
- Yes. 
 - Oppa.

808
00:56:08,591 --> 00:56:11,151
How do you know that good spot for stargazing?

809
00:56:11,151 --> 00:56:13,111
Who did you go there with?

810
00:56:14,261 --> 00:56:15,571
It's a secret.

811
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:17,821
What? It's a secret?

812
00:56:17,821 --> 00:56:19,701
Why is it a secret? For what reason?

813
00:56:19,701 --> 00:56:20,961
Come on, tell me!

814
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:24,281
Who did you go with? I'll stay up if you don't tell me.

815
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:26,891
I was on location hunting. Location hunting.

816
00:56:29,741 --> 00:56:32,351
Oh, hunting?

817
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:35,501
Did you get jealous just now? You thought I went with someone else?

818
00:56:35,501 --> 00:56:38,251
No, it's not that.

819
00:56:38,251 --> 00:56:41,311
I asked because I was curious.

820
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:43,111
Bye.

821
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:48,231
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed!

822
00:56:48,971 --> 00:56:52,101
Why is Park Do Ra so cute?

823
00:57:13,961 --> 00:57:18,081
Hey, Jae Dong. Drop me off here and leave.

824
00:57:18,081 --> 00:57:20,961
What? Who are you meeting with?

825
00:57:20,961 --> 00:57:23,321
I can't leave you alone in a secluded place like this.

826
00:57:23,321 --> 00:57:26,141
What do you mean? This isn't secluded.

827
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:29,211
It's okay. A friend will pick me up. Leave.

828
00:57:29,211 --> 00:57:30,621
Which friend?

829
00:57:30,621 --> 00:57:34,441
Hey, do I have to report to you about stuff like that?

830
00:57:35,271 --> 00:57:40,071
Take a break for a few days since you've been working hard, okay?

831
00:57:40,071 --> 00:57:41,721
I'm really leaving, then.

832
00:57:41,721 --> 00:57:44,821
That's what I said. Bye.

833
00:57:55,811 --> 00:57:57,121
There.

834
00:57:57,121 --> 00:57:59,191
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

835
00:58:08,971 --> 00:58:10,401
Whoa, shit.

836
00:58:10,401 --> 00:58:12,091
What did I just see?

837
00:58:12,091 --> 00:58:16,671
Why is Do Ra getting into the curly-haired director's crappy car?

838
00:58:16,671 --> 00:58:20,381
Why did she lie that she was seeing a friend and meeting him secretly?

839
00:58:20,381 --> 00:58:22,381
What's with those two?

840
00:58:24,021 --> 00:58:26,221
Do Ra, you can take your mask off here.

841
00:58:26,221 --> 00:58:28,571
No one will come here since we're in the corner.

842
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:31,151
- Really? 
 - Yes.

843
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:41,231
That feels good now. Gosh, I feel alive now.

844
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:44,551
But we're furthest away from the bathroom and water fountain.

845
00:58:44,551 --> 00:58:47,401
It'd be uncomfortable to go back and forth. That's okay, right?

846
00:58:47,401 --> 00:58:50,721
Of course, it's okay. So what if it's a little uncomfortable?

847
00:58:50,721 --> 00:58:53,911
I get to be alone with you freely like this.

848
00:58:53,911 --> 00:58:56,681
You found a good spot today. I praise you.

849
00:58:56,681 --> 00:58:59,281
Five stars. Pet, pet.

850
00:58:59,281 --> 00:59:01,311
Thank you.

851
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:09,981
By the way, this spot is a bit suspicious.

852
00:59:09,981 --> 00:59:13,321
It's too tucked away, and I don't see anyone.

853
00:59:13,321 --> 00:59:16,461
Are you sure you came here for location hunting?

854
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,211
To be honest, no.

855
00:59:19,211 --> 00:59:22,131
No? Who did you come with, then?

856
00:59:22,131 --> 00:59:24,351
Be honest with me.

857
00:59:24,351 --> 00:59:27,001
- With a young— 
 - Woman? Really?

858
00:59:27,001 --> 00:59:29,531
Which woman? What for?

859
00:59:29,531 --> 00:59:31,101
I was kidding. It was a joke.

860
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:33,101
I can't joke around with you.

861
00:59:33,101 --> 00:59:36,281
I came here to shoot the drama "Meadow" here.

862
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,991
Seriously, why do you keep teasing me?

863
00:59:38,991 --> 00:59:41,111
Try teasing me again.

864
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:42,971
- Okay, okay. 
  - What? 

865
00:59:42,971 --> 00:59:47,941
Do Ra got into the assistant director's crappy car and went somewhere alone with him? Why?

866
00:59:47,941 --> 00:59:50,101
I think they're dating.

867
00:59:50,101 --> 00:59:51,601
Are you crazy?

868
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:56,711
She'd be crazy to date a lowly assistant director like that.

869
00:59:57,601 --> 01:00:01,651
I think I was mistaken... I was mistaken.

870
01:00:02,501 --> 01:00:04,591
What's the name of that assistant director?

871
01:00:04,591 --> 01:00:06,701
Assistant Director Go Pil Sung.

872
01:00:06,701 --> 01:00:09,411
Go Pil Sung?

873
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:12,021
Anyway, okay.

874
01:00:12,021 --> 01:00:14,361
You'd better keep your mouth shut.

875
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:17,121
You know you can't tell anyone about this, right?

876
01:00:17,121 --> 01:00:19,151
Yes.

877
01:00:19,151 --> 01:00:22,421
Hold on. Hey, keep this as pocket money.

878
01:00:22,421 --> 01:00:24,261
No, no... Thank you.

879
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:26,341
Thank you.

880
01:00:33,181 --> 01:00:36,591
 The phone is turned off. After the beep... 

881
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:42,071
Gosh. What's she doing with her phone off?

882
01:00:43,171 --> 01:00:45,031
Could it be...

883
01:00:45,031 --> 01:00:50,051
No way. She'd have to be out of her mind.

884
01:00:58,771 --> 01:01:02,281
Do Ra, it's cold at night since we're in the mountains.

885
01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:04,751
Thank you.

886
01:01:04,751 --> 01:01:06,561
Share it with me.

887
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:08,151
Okay.

888
01:01:16,681 --> 01:01:21,471
Oppa, there are so many stars here, as you said.

889
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:24,691
I haven't seen so many stars in a while.

890
01:01:27,391 --> 01:01:31,881
I feel so happy at this moment right now.

891
01:01:32,961 --> 01:01:34,511
What more could I ask for?

892
01:01:34,711 --> 01:01:37,111
You're by my side right now...

893
01:01:37,111 --> 01:01:39,941
and the sparkly jewels are filling up the sky.

894
01:01:45,721 --> 01:01:47,361
Hold on.

895
01:01:58,831 --> 01:02:01,731
What's that? Isn't that a guitar?

896
01:02:02,481 --> 01:02:05,041
This is the highlight of a camping trip.

897
01:02:06,211 --> 01:02:08,061
You know how to play the guitar?

898
01:02:08,061 --> 01:02:09,511
When did you learn?

899
01:02:09,511 --> 01:02:12,081
I was in a band in college.

900
01:02:12,081 --> 01:02:15,891
Will you play "The Mountain Rabbit" or "School Bell" or something like that?

901
01:02:23,881 --> 01:02:26,771

917
01:04:14,721 --> 01:04:17,421
Oppa, thank you so much for today.

918
01:04:17,421 --> 01:04:20,631
I haven't felt such healing in such a long time.

919
01:04:20,631 --> 01:04:23,961
I feel like I cleaned inside my head, too.

920
01:04:25,051 --> 01:04:29,471
Hey, go inside now. What if someone sees us?

921
01:04:29,471 --> 01:04:32,311
I feel like I've become a good person since I met you.

922
01:04:32,311 --> 01:04:34,741
Oppa, let's go stargazing again.

923
01:04:34,741 --> 01:04:37,001
So, I become an even better person.

924
01:04:38,731 --> 01:04:40,391
Park Do Ra,

925
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:43,381
you've always been good.

926
01:04:52,831 --> 01:04:56,251
That little brat. What's she doing in front of the house?

927
01:04:56,251 --> 01:04:58,541
Is that the assistant director...

928
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:02,461
Oh, my. That's...

929
01:05:06,601 --> 01:05:09,481
Isn't that Go Dae Chung?

930
01:05:10,151 --> 01:05:14,741
Hey!

931
01:05:16,941 --> 01:05:18,511
Mom.

932
01:05:19,391 --> 01:05:22,291
   

933
01:05:25,701 --> 01:05:29,251
♫  You keep showing up  ♫

934
01:05:29,251 --> 01:05:35,211
♫  And make my heart flutter and get me excited over and over  ♫

935
01:05:35,211 --> 01:05:38,801
♫  You keep finding me without fail  ♫

936
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:42,011
♫  So I can't think about anything else  ♫

937
01:05:42,011 --> 01:05:46,780
♫  I think this is what they call fate  ♫

938
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:54,390


939
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:57,031
 You'd better take this to your grave. 

940
01:05:57,031 --> 01:06:01,691
 Everyone, where is she hiding that kid? 

941
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:04,471
 You can't be with Pil Sung even if you died and came back. 

942
01:06:04,471 --> 01:06:06,721
 What do you mean by that? 

943
01:06:06,721 --> 01:06:08,881
 Mom, I'm sorry. 

944
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:12,091
 I'm sorry for hurting your feelings. 

945
01:06:12,091 --> 01:06:14,691
 Why didn't you tell me? 

946
01:06:14,691 --> 01:06:16,081
 Why... 

947
01:06:16,081 --> 01:06:18,641
 Why are you suffering alone, Oppa? 

948
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,071
 I've been happy being with you. 

949
01:06:21,071 --> 01:06:23,161
 But I think this is it for us. 

950
01:06:23,161 --> 01:06:26,311
 Let's break up now.
