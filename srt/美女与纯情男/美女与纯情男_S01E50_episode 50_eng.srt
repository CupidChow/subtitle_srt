1
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,500
Yes, let's break up. 
    

2
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,900
Just quit all of it!

3
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,550
You don't have to try so hard with me!

4
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:06,600


5
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,350
Do Ra.

6
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,980
Did you...

7
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,040
Do Ra.

8
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,890
Did you just walk?

9
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,580
Oppa.

10
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,500
I...

11
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,750
I-I j-just felt a tingle.

12
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,000
I think my sense...

13
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,100
I can apply pressure to my toes.

14
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,290
Do Ra. Just once.

15
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,660
Let's do it one more time, okay?

16
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,910
Do Ra,

17
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,860
You walked.

18
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,840
You walked.

19
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,980
You did it, Do Ra.

20
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,760
It's okay now.

21
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,240
You did it, Do Ra.

22
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,760
You said you only felt the right big toe.

23
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,850
The neurology test result from just now

24
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,260
says both your right and left feet are responding well.

25
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,190
Is that true?

26
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,190
Your efforts are the most important now.

27
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,030
Strengthening the muscles that were paralyzed is the fastest way.

28
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,480
You have to focus more on physical therapy now.

29
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,280
Yes, yes, Doctor.

30
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,100
Thank you.

31
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,300
See?

32
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,780
I said you could do it, didn't I?

33
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,650
Do Ra,

34
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,210
let's not be impatient and take it slow.

35
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,370
Tomorrow, you'll take a step further and another step further the day after.

36
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,170
Let's try that, okay?

37
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,650
Oppa,

38
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,230
I walked, right?

39
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,490
The doctor said I could walk again, too.

40
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,640
So, you should keep your promise.

41
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,850
What promise?

42
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,440
You promised me.

43
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,780
That you'd break up with me if I walked.

44
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,800
So, let's keep the promise...

45
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,950
and break up.

46
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,600
Hey, Park Do Ra.

47
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,510
Must you say that on a happy day like this?

48
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,870
A promise is a promise.

49
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,250
You saw me walk.

50
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,140
Be free from your burden toward me and leave.

51
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,470
I don't want to break up with hard feelings.

52
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,830
Please do that.

53
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,910
I cancel the promise. I cancel it.

54
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,830
I just said that to make you feel better because you kept feeling guilty.

55
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,200
I had no interest in breaking up with you, okay?

56
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,220
And you didn't mean it when you said that, either.

57
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,060
No, I meant it.

58
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,680
Don't you care about your parents?

59
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,180
Although I walked one step today,

60
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,000
but there's no guarantee that I could walk like before again.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,890
No parents would like their child to date someone like me.

62
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,850
Is this about what happened last time?

63
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,110
Don't worry about stuff like that anymore.

64
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,780
My parents worry about you a lot, too.

65
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,900
They want you to get up quickly more than anyone.

66
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,110
They sincerely support you.

67
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,770
No. I said I don't want to because I feel bad, okay?

68
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,000
You need to work on the next project and grow as a director.

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,340
Why should someone like you waste your time caring for me?

70
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,990
Park Do Ra.

71
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,480
Will you keep this up?

72
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,490
I want to live quietly now, Oppa.

73
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,650
So, you go on your way, and I'll go mine.

74
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,260
Let's cheer for each other and just live like that.

75
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,720
That's what I want.

76
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,310
So, please keep your promise...

77
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,000
to break up with me.

78
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,660
Do you want to break up with me that badly?

79
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,650
Okay, let's break up, then.

80
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,850
I've done enough.

81
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,310
I can't take this anymore.

82
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,350
Why are you back?

83
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,080
We just broke up!

84
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,000
Why are you pushing my wheelchair?

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,480
I can do it alone. Stop worrying about me and leave!

86
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,440
Do Jun, what's wrong with them?

87
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,000
I think they like each other a lot.

88
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,230
Why are they talking about breaking up?

89
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,490
I think I understand how she feels.

90
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,590
She's not trying to break up because she hates him.

91
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,930
It's because she loves him a lot.

92
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,110
Huh? Why should they break up if they love each other a lot?

93
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,190
Pil Sung went through too much because of her.

94
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,440
It's because she feels bad.

95
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,100
What are you talking about?

96
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,000
Why should they break up if they love each other?

97
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,120
Unni, I saw you breaking up with Pil Sung earlier.

98
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,110
But I think you guys love each other a lot. Why are you breaking up?

99
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,080
You're making a big mistake, Unni.

100
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,980
- What?

101
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:56,660
Unni. Do Jun and I had difficulty, but we're doing just fine.

102
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,060
You can overcome everything if you have faith in each other.

103
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,250
Why are you breaking your precious love?

104
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,080
Ma Ri.

105
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,200
Ma Ri,

106
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,880
I'm an unlucky person.

107
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,800
Noona, why would you say that?

108
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,280
Pil Sung...

109
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,200
went through so much while he's been with me.

110
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:37,390
He's been hurt and criticized because of me.

111
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:46,510
I want him to meet someone many people support

112
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,910
and be happy.

113
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,140
That's how I feel.

114
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,920
Unni.

115
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,990
Are you satisfied now?

116
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:16,050
Are you happy that Pil Sung and Do Ra broke up as you wished?

117
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,320
They broke up because of you and Seon Yeong.

118
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,870
You paid a ridiculous woman who sold her daughter because of her gambling addiction.

119
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,000
And you asked her to leave with Do Ra.

120
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,700
Imagine how Do Ra must've felt then.

121
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,920
Not being able to walk is devastating enough.

122
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,380
She must've felt so devastated that she had to run away from her loved one.

123
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,630
I'm admitting I was wrong, Honey.

124
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,600
The more I think, the more I feel sorry for them.

125
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,640
It must've hurt her so much that

126
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,040
she broke up with Pil Sung as soon as she started walking.

127
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,180
You and Seon Yeong need to be responsible for this.

128
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:15,360
You two need to meet with Do Ra and comfort her.

129
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,020
And they love each other so much.

130
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,730
I don't think we should give them a hard time anymore.

131
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,080
Okay. I understand.

132
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,590
Okay, Soo Yeon. See you tomorrow.

133
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,290
Is there something going on with her?

134
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,220
It's not that. Do Ra can walk again.

135
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,250
My goodness! Hey, that's amazing.

136
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,230
That's so great!

137
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,930
I can't believe this. My goodness.

138
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,120
I'm home.

139
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,880
Hey, have you had dinner?

140
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,240
I don't feel like eating.

141
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,910
Pil Sung, I heard Do Ra can walk again.

142
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,980
Yes.

143
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,050
Why does he look so upset?

144
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:14,310
I thought he'd be over the moon if Do Ra walked again.

145
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,450
But he looks like he's about to die.

146
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,910
Do Ra broke up with him.

147
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,250
- Why? 
 - Mom, what do you mean why?

148
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,100
It's because of her.

149
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,980
You must be happy that your dream came true.

150
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,160
   

151
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,620
Sang Gu, what happened to your face?

152
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,750
Did you get beat up for disobeying?

153
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,060
Or is someone bullying you?

154
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,910
No.

155
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,600
People keep beating up Jin Dan.

156
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,530
Because of what he did to Park Do Ra, they call him names and bully him.

157
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,120
I ended up this way, trying to defend him.

158
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,510
Gosh, what bastards.

159
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,360
I'm sorry, Sang Gu.

160
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,680
But I want you to keep protecting him.

161
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,830
He has no one else to rely on here.

162
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:02,640
I wish I could, but he won't open up to me.

163
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,220
But I do understand why.

164
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,270
He's lived his whole life lacking nothing.

165
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,340
It must be so difficult for him to be here.

166
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,990
I wish he'd rely on me at times like this.

167
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:24,820
My heart breaks whenever I see him, Ae Gyo.

168
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:35,430
Ae Gyo, you should try talking to him.

169
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,500
It'd be nice if the father and son relied on each other in jail.

170
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:44,780
Even now, I want us to build a relationship while we're here.

171
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,160
Please try persuading him for me.

172
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,490
Tell him to try getting along with me.

173
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,500
Jin Dan, you should get along with your father.

174
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,450
He worries about you a lot.

175
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,980
Who says he's my father? Who says?

176
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,620
I'm not his son.

177
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,840
I'll never accept it.

178
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,920
Jin Dan.

179
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,030
Stop talking about him.

180
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,370
Mom,

181
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,610
what happened to Do Ra?

182
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,010
She still can't walk?

183
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,670
Did she split with Go Pil Sung?

184
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,990
Why do you care what happened to her?

185
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,440
Are you still hung up on her in this situation?

186
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,220
What do you mean, I'm hung up? Can't I just ask?

187
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,480
I'm leaving.

188
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,220
Jin Dan.

189
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,240
Try getting along with your father, okay?

190
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,740
Mom,

191
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,130
don't come here anymore if you're going to say that.

192
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,780
Why did they have to be in the same jail?

193
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,410
How could the father and son end up this way?

194
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,860
And how did I end up this way?

195
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,390
I barely make any money to visit them.

196
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,700
It's hard enough to send them money.

197
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,330
What sin did I commit in my previous life?

198
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,270
Jin Taek lectured me a lot.

199
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,330
He said we did a terrible thing to someone who couldn't even move.

200
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,950
Did he say that?

201
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,670
Hyeon Cheol says I'm cruel, too.

202
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,860
He asks me if I'm happy for breaking our son's heart.

203
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,490
He wants to divorce me.

204
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,860
Seon Yeong, I think we did something terrible.

205
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,860
It's not just because Jin Taek said so.

206
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:10,510
Do Ra must've been so desperate to leave with a mom like hers.

207
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:17,830
If I were her, I would've wanted to die.

208
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:27,330
I think we've only been thinking about Pil Sung.

209
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:33,640
Thinking Do Ra pushed him away because of us breaks my heart.

210
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,860
So, Seon Yeong,

211
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,220
let's finally make Pil Sung feel at ease.

212
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,940
Let's help them out.

213
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,870
It's okay. It's okay. Just stay there.

214
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,140
Hello.

215
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,970
Congratulations.

216
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,600
I'm so glad you can walk again.

217
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,400
I'm so happy for you.

218
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:24,080
I was so happy to hear your news.

219
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:29,770
All Pil Sung wanted was for you to walk again.

220
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:34,420
I'm so happy that you're getting healthy again.

221
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,960
Thank you.

222
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:52,870
The reason we're here to see you today is...

223
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,830
because we think we did a terrible thing to you last time.

224
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,450
We're here to apologize.

225
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,480
Pardon?

226
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,410
We really hurt you a lot last time, huh?

227
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:19,780
You were devastated because you might never walk again.

228
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,030
But we hurt you so much on top of that.

229
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,690
I'm sorry, Do Ra.

230
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,450
We mistreated you.

231
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,810
Mother.

232
00:18:45,716 --> 00:18:47,576
Do Ra,

233
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:52,496
we're the ones who mistreated you.

234
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:58,886
So, please don't do that to Pil Sung.

235
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:07,966
Could you stop breaking his heart

236
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:11,786
and just accept him?

237
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,926
I'd like you two...

238
00:19:17,746 --> 00:19:21,276
to live happily now.

239
00:19:28,996 --> 00:19:30,756
Mother.

240
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:37,246
Do you really mean that?

241
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:48,156
Can I be with Pil Sung?

242
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:52,216
Yes.

243
00:19:52,946 --> 00:19:55,656
We did a terrible thing.

244
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:58,106
Please forgive us, Do Ra.

245
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:01,906
Mother.

246
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,366
I'm sorry.

247
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:11,856
I'm so sorry.

248
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:20,116
Thank you, Mother.

249
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:26,786
Thank you, Mother.

250
00:20:27,816 --> 00:20:29,756
Do Ra.

251
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:32,786
I'm sorry.

252
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:35,036
I'm sorry.

253
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:39,326
Mother.  Mother...

254
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:44,836
Thank you, Mother.

255
00:20:44,836 --> 00:20:49,046
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

256
00:20:54,276 --> 00:20:58,436
It's our fault. Please forgive us.

257
00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:31,706
How do I change Do Ra's mind?

258
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,906
How do I stop her from being so stubborn?

259
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:50,376
   

260
00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:04,306
You came.

261
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:07,216
Ms. Park Do Ra.

262
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:11,926
I no longer want to cling to you like a loser.

263
00:22:11,926 --> 00:22:14,966
So, I tried to be cool and let you break up with me.

264
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,066
But we share a history together.

265
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:21,326
So, I'm here to give you the last chance.

266
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:24,506
Last chance?

267
00:22:24,506 --> 00:22:26,366
What chance?

268
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:30,606
You don't know because I haven't told you,

269
00:22:30,606 --> 00:22:33,746
but there are so many women who want me.

270
00:22:33,746 --> 00:22:37,076
To be blunt, over 100 women want to go on a date with me.

271
00:22:37,076 --> 00:22:38,996
They're lining up outside right now.

272
00:22:38,996 --> 00:22:42,226
I have a blind date today, too.

273
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:47,756
But if you don't want me to, I won't go.

274
00:22:50,116 --> 00:22:55,816
Oppa, I said I want you to meet someone else and be happy.

275
00:22:55,816 --> 00:23:00,086
So, go on dates with 100 women outside.

276
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:03,796
Do you mean it?

277
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:07,116
Are you sure you won't regret this?

278
00:23:09,226 --> 00:23:12,956
But you're kind of ridiculous.

279
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:17,906
You were supposed to be a romantic, a piece of gum and whatnot.

280
00:23:17,906 --> 00:23:21,596
But you've been hiding 100 women to go on dates with?

281
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:27,436
What are you doing? Go on your date.

282
00:23:28,936 --> 00:23:31,736
- Do you mean it? 
 - Yes.

283
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:34,906
Okay, fine.

284
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:36,976
It's no use regretting it later.

285
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:39,586
Saying, "Come back, Oppa," won't work, okay?

286
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,906
Okay, I said.

287
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:44,346
Go to your date, I said.

288
00:23:44,346 --> 00:23:46,306
Okay, fine.

289
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:47,876
Oppa.

290
00:23:58,156 --> 00:23:59,756
What...

291
00:24:01,076 --> 00:24:02,936
What are you doing?

292
00:24:04,796 --> 00:24:07,666
I know you're lying, Oppa.

293
00:24:08,986 --> 00:24:11,616
You're trying to make me jealous.

294
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:15,866
You could've just said so.

295
00:24:15,866 --> 00:24:18,946
Why are you hugging me after breaking up with me?

296
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:20,646
Oppa,

297
00:24:23,706 --> 00:24:28,656
your mothers were here earlier today.

298
00:24:31,026 --> 00:24:32,496
What?

299
00:24:33,226 --> 00:24:34,826
What did they say this time?

300
00:24:34,826 --> 00:24:37,256
Did you cry again?

301
00:24:37,256 --> 00:24:39,036
No.

302
00:24:42,406 --> 00:24:45,726
They said I can be with you now.

303
00:24:47,756 --> 00:24:50,606
They approved us.

304
00:24:50,606 --> 00:24:52,356
W-What?

305
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:56,786
To be honest, I felt...

306
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:01,616
discouraged because they've been against it.

307
00:25:02,426 --> 00:25:05,546
I didn't want to hurt them.

308
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:11,806
But they said they wanted us to be happy.

309
00:25:11,806 --> 00:25:16,826
I was so thankful and happy that all I could do was cry.

310
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:23,806
They apologized for coming to see me last time, too.

311
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:29,596
And they said they bless our future.

312
00:25:35,566 --> 00:25:39,216
I have the confidence to see you again.

313
00:25:42,616 --> 00:25:44,296
Do Ra.

314
00:25:47,306 --> 00:25:49,076
Oppa.

315
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:58,806
I'll work hard so I don't burden you from now on.

316
00:26:04,216 --> 00:26:07,116
I'm so sorry I hurt you...

317
00:26:09,206 --> 00:26:12,146
and said mean things to you.

318
00:26:13,046 --> 00:26:16,596
All I do is hurt you.

319
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,826
Thank you for staying with me without giving up.

320
00:26:23,735 --> 00:26:26,345
I won't do that anymore.

321
00:26:28,535 --> 00:26:31,105
I'll never do that again.

322
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,595
I'm sorry, Oppa.

323
00:26:39,595 --> 00:26:41,695
I love you, Oppa.

324
00:26:46,545 --> 00:26:48,155
Do Ra.

325
00:27:11,614 --> 00:27:13,494
- This is amazing. 
 - Hey, hey, hey.

326
00:27:13,494 --> 00:27:15,949
Grapes? Is it a wine, then?

327
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,722
Mom!

328
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:19,982
Father!

329
00:27:19,982 --> 00:27:23,192
Hey, what are you doing? What's going on?

330
00:27:28,702 --> 00:27:30,732
- What's he doing? 
 - What's he doing?

331
00:27:36,162 --> 00:27:38,192
Thank you, Mom.

332
00:27:38,892 --> 00:27:43,852
You comforted Do Ra and changed her heart. Thank you so much.

333
00:27:45,822 --> 00:27:50,212
Gosh, you love fool. Seriously!

334
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:54,302
Do you like Do Ra that much? You like her so much you could die?

335
00:27:54,302 --> 00:27:58,372
Yes, Mom. I like Do Ra so much I could die.

336
00:28:01,812 --> 00:28:03,582
Mom,

337
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:07,512
I'll live happily with Do Ra.

338
00:28:07,512 --> 00:28:12,582
I'll be forever thankful that you made an effort today.

339
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:16,122
Pil Sung, if you're that thankful,

340
00:28:16,122 --> 00:28:19,202
get married and have a baby first.

341
00:28:19,202 --> 00:28:22,882
Okay, Grandma. I'll do my best.

342
00:28:22,882 --> 00:28:24,902
Victory!* 
  ("Pilseung" in Korean) 

343
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:26,232
Aigoo, aigoo...

344
00:28:26,232 --> 00:28:29,072
- My goodness! 
 - Okay, fine.

345
00:28:29,702 --> 00:28:31,262
Aigoo, aigoo...

346
00:28:31,262 --> 00:28:34,372
Gosh, well done. Well done.

347
00:28:37,212 --> 00:28:38,572
What brings you here, Pil Sung?

348
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:41,082
What are those flowers for?

349
00:28:43,492 --> 00:28:45,402
Thank you,

350
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:48,892
Mother.

351
00:28:56,842 --> 00:28:58,702
"Mother"?

352
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:08,202
Did you call me "Mother" just now?

353
00:29:08,822 --> 00:29:13,092
I heard you changed my mom's heart.

354
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:19,812
You visited Do Ra and comforted her with kind words.

355
00:29:19,812 --> 00:29:22,142
Thank you so much.

356
00:29:22,142 --> 00:29:24,042
From now on,

357
00:29:24,742 --> 00:29:27,192
I'll be good to you, Mother.

358
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:34,322
And thank you, Father.

359
00:29:36,712 --> 00:29:41,042
Did you call me "Father" just now?

360
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:43,102
Thank you.

361
00:29:43,102 --> 00:29:45,052
Thank you.

362
00:29:45,622 --> 00:29:47,432
Thank you.

363
00:29:54,122 --> 00:29:55,652
Honey.

364
00:30:03,342 --> 00:30:05,102
Thank you.

365
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,030
Be careful.

366
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,100
Ji Yeong.

367
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,170
Why are you crying?

368
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,340
My Ji Yeong.

369
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,910
You've been through a lot.

370
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,390
I didn't even know you were injured.

371
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,360
I thought you were just working in the US.

372
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,600
But I heard about it yesterday.

373
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,610
I'm sorry. I had no idea all this time.

374
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,160
Why should you be sorry?

375
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,840
I'm the one who's sorry.

376
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:57,580
I had to lie to you because I didn't want you to be sad like this.

377
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,950
I'm sorry, Grandma.

378
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,350
No, no. It's okay.

379
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:08,380
I'm just happy that you came back like this.

380
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,220
Ji Yeong, can you really walk again now?

381
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,090
Yes, I'm totally fine.

382
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:27,530
But how come you don't look so well, Grandma?

383
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:32,210
What do you mean? It's because I couldn't see you.

384
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:39,690
I've been waiting to see you before I die.

385
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,740
Don't say stuff like that, Grandma.

386
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,340
You need to live with me for a long time, okay?

387
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,510
Yes, yes, yes.

388
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:56,030
Aigoo, aigoo, my baby.

389
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:00,370
Aigoo, my sweet baby.

390
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,890
Hello?

391
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,300
Yes, this is Park Do Jun.

392
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,480
Pardon?

393
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,350
I won the grand prize?

394
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,520
Really?

395
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,290
You won the grand prize at the Korean Architecture Competition?

396
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,950
Congratulations, Do Jun. That's so cool.

397
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,700
Thank you.

398
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:38,170
By the way, I think I need to go to the US.

399
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:41,210
The school I used to attend reached out after seeing my entry.

400
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,530
They promised me a scholarship if I came back.

401
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,620
Really? That's wonderful.

402
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,890
Hold on.

403
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:58,530
Does that mean I have to be apart from you?

404
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,130
Yes.

405
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:07,220
Ma Ri, could you wait until I finish my studies?

406
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:12,050
I want to come with you, then.

407
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:16,380
What? Can you be apart from your parents?

408
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,110
Yes. You're all I need.

409
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:30,760
Congratulations on winning the grand prize at the Korean Architecture Competition.

410
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,990
You won a major award.

411
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,470
You're very talented.

412
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,720
Congratulations, Do Jun.

413
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,530
Thank you.

414
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:42,440
The talented and handsome Do Jun is my boyfriend.

415
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,910
Take a good look at him.

416
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:46,470
Come on now.

417
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:51,740
I heard you're going back to the US for school.

418
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:55,150
I think it'd be difficult for Ma Ri to come along.

419
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:59,620
We're worried about her,

420
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:05,510
and caring for her would interrupt Do Jun's studies, too.

421
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:11,520
I'll be just as fine with Do Jun as I am with you.

422
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,740
And I'll never distract him.

423
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,570
I'll study art there, too.

424
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,640
We have plans, too.

425
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,840
Ma Ri, studying abroad together would still burden Do Jun.

426
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,500
You'd be alone with him without your dad and me.

427
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,200
You can't insist on these things.

428
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,410
I can't let you study with him in the US.

429
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,960
I'm okay with it.

430
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,730
I'd like to go with Ma Ri.

431
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,580
I understand what you're worried about,

432
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:47,980
but I'm sure we can do well.

433
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,270
Ma Ri works at our kalguksu store these days.

434
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,820
She never made a single mistake.

435
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,970
I'm sure there will be challenges.

436
00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:01,780
But I think it's something we need to work on our entire lives.

437
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:07,380
And Ma Ri will grow stronger after facing a few challenges.

438
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,760
I think Do Jun is right, Honey.

439
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,200
We've been coddling her like an orchid in the greenhouse.

440
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:35,210
She needs to leave us and be out in the world someday.

441
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,980
And Do Jun might be young,

442
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,810
but he seems manly and mature.

443
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:47,720
He seems to be a good fellow.

444
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,500
He's young, but he's very thoughtful.

445
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:58,530
Honey, let's send Ma Ri with Do Jun.

446
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,490
If he'd be her other half, anyway,

447
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,270
it'd be nice if they could overcome challenges together.

448
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:12,940
What should we do with Ma Ri and Do Jun, then?

449
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,400
If they'd studied abroad, wouldn't it be nice if

450
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,030
they got engaged, if not married?

451
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,420
Engaged?

452
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,240
   

453
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,060
 I ran out of all the money and... all of my kids blocked my number. 

454
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,310
 That old lady is the only one I have now. 

455
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,150
 She thinks I'm her daughter. 

456
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:45,350
 They probably won't kick me out. 

457
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:48,800
 I just need to cling onto her. 

458
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,960
Go ahead and spin.

459
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,910
Mom! Mom.

460
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:56,300
Hey, it's Dong Dong.

461
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,770
Take care.

462
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,950
See you.

463
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,350
Thank you.

464
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:04,720
Gosh, where have you been?

465
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,270
You know your nephew, Do Jun?

466
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:11,640
He's about to get engaged and move to the US.

467
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,300
Mom, Do Jun is getting engaged? To whom?

468
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,990
Ma Ri. You know Ma Ri.

469
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:22,330
They're about to have an engagement ceremony.

470
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,210
Is that true?

471
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:27,200
I'm telling you. Have you always been lied to?

472
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,060
Anyway, I'm glad you're back.

473
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,930
Your nephew is getting engaged. You need to be there.

474
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,400
Grandma.

475
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,860
Don't talk to this lady, Grandma. Let's go.

476
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,900
Hold on! Do Jun.

477
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,600
Is it true you're getting engaged to Ma Ri?

478
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,590
Did her family approve of you?

479
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,870
Why do you care if I get engaged or not?

480
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:57,570
Grandma, don't ever talk to her again, okay? Let's go.

481
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:00,700
Okay. I hate that meanie, too.

482
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,810
Let's go, Do Jun.

483
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,270
Hold on, Mom!

484
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,040
I'm your daughter, Dong Dong. I need to come with you.

485
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,130
You crazy bitch. How dare you call me "mom"?

486
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,650
And how are you Dong Dong?

487
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:16,610
You can't deal with a crazy bitch like her, either. Okay?

488
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,580
Okay. Let's go, Do Jun.

489
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,650
Mom! Mom, wait for me!

490
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:23,810
Mom!

491
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,900
Wow, that senile old woman.

492
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,470
Why does she keep switching back and forth?

493
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,890
And that bastard called me "ahjumma"?

494
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,050
Hold on.

495
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:38,730
Do Jun is getting engaged to Ma Ri?

496
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,710
What am I supposed to do, then?

497
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,710
Hold on. What am I supposed to do?

498
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,290
I'm sorry, we're closed—

499
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,510
Do Sik, it's me.

500
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,200
Get out. I'm closing.

501
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,100
I heard Do Jun was getting engaged. Is that true?

502
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:09,300
That means he's getting married. He should tell me stuff like that.

503
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,890
When is the engagement ceremony?

504
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,500
Why are you doing this to me?

505
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,850
Looks like it's because I put Do Ra in the countryside hospital.

506
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:25,540
It's because she begged me to take her somewhere far away.

507
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:29,690
And Pil Sung's mom gave me money and asked me to take Do Ra away.

508
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:30,910
That's why.

509
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,740
I was just doing what I was told to.

510
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,980
Why are you doing this to me?

511
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,280
You call that an excuse right now?

512
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,080
Leave. Get out.

513
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,170
- But I— 
 - Get out. Get out.

514
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,010
Hey, Do Sik. The thing is—

515
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,960
- Get out. 
 - I... Do Jun... Do Sik—

516
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,880
- Get out. 
 - Hey, Do Sik!

517
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,170
You bastard. Hey, Do Sik.

518
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:51,410
It's because Do—

519
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,430
Wow, seriously.

520
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,490
These bastards. How could they do this to their mom?

521
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,140
Hey, Do...

522
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,700
Wow, seriously.

523
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,230
Who is it?

524
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,490
 This is Park Do Jun's mother. 

525
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:19,620
 I wanted to discuss his engagement with Ms. Jang and Chairman Gong. 

526
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,360
Who's that?

527
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,500
Well... she's apparently Park Do Jun's mom.

528
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,090
She came to discuss something.

529
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:30,760
- Park Do Jun's mom? 
 - Yes.

530
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,240
What brings you here?

531
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,060
Well, yes...

532
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:46,150
I didn't want to say this, but I worked very hard to raise Do Jun.

533
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,460
Without buying clothes and food for myself,

534
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,770
I raised him with all my devotion.

535
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,200
I sent him to study abroad, too.

536
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,340
Although he had to come back because of my situation.

537
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:04,810
Your daughter got injured in a car accident

538
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:08,890
and she's not fully there, I heard.

539
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:14,450
How could you even try to make this happen?

540
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,230
I understand you want my son, but still.

541
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:28,940
I know we don't have much, but this just isn't right.

542
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:34,410
I had to approve them because Do Jun likes your daughter so much,

543
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:37,830
but this is just unfair, isn't it?

544
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,780
My Do Jun is about to care for your daughter,

545
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:45,920
who's not all there his whole life.

546
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,950
Well, you know I do make a good point.

547
00:42:55,950 --> 00:43:01,440
So, you should compensate me for it.

548
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,960
Just ask anyone on the streets.

549
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,940
No mother would want her son to marry someone like your daughter.

550
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,700
And this isn't just about my son.

551
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:16,490
It'd affect our entire family greatly.

552
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,260
You're going too far.

553
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,230
By compensation, do you mean...

554
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,820
money, by chance?

555
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:31,040
You compensate with money.

556
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,330
What else?

557
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,430
Welcome.

558
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:57,450
Chairman, what brings you all the way here?

559
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:01,520
I came because I thought you'd be free about now.

560
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,270
I'd like to talk to you, too.

561
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:06,930
Well, I'm free. Have a seat here.

562
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,990
Your mother came to see me.

563
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,580
My mother?

564
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:21,600
Did you tell her about Do Jun and Ma Ri getting engaged?

565
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,370
She somehow found out and visited me. I didn't tell her.

566
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,520
She told me Do Jun was too good for Ma Ri

567
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,790
and demanded compensation.

568
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:36,570
So, I cut her off and said no.

569
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:41,070
But I'm not sure if I did the right thing.

570
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:43,240
I felt a little uncomfortable about it.

571
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,070
So, I decided to talk to you about it.

572
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:47,590
I'm so glad you did.

573
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:51,860
If you gave her money, she would've lost all of it by gambling.

574
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,240
And the three of us totally cut ties with her.

575
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,550
You don't have to worry about her anymore.

576
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:02,100
If she comes back again, please ignore her.

577
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,060
I'm so sorry, Chairman.

578
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:11,550
I feel better hearing that from you.

579
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,270
Thank you.

580
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:20,030
There's one more thing I'd like to discuss with you since I'm here.

581
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:22,260
Yes, go ahead.

582
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:27,700
After the engagement, Do Jun and Ma Ri will study abroad together.

583
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,700
- You know, right? 
 - Yes.

584
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:38,460
I worry that Ma Ri might interfere with Do Jun's studies.

585
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,560
I'm curious to hear your opinion.

586
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:47,280
If you're worried about Ma Ri joining him as Do Jun's brother,

587
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,520
I'll try persuading her again.

588
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,330
No.

589
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,890
I might be presumptuous,

590
00:45:55,890 --> 00:46:01,370
but I think engagement means they will eventually get married.

591
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:05,870
For them to be together in the future,

592
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:09,430
they certainly need to figure out their path.

593
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:15,630
And since they're adults, they should live their own lives.

594
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:20,380
Right? I think so, too.

595
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,810
Everyone says your kalguksu is delicious.

596
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:27,250
I'd like a bowl.

597
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,910
Got it. Please wait a moment.

598
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:57,110
Do Sik. Do Sik. You said you wanted to see me briefly.

599
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,910
Why are we here? You're scaring me.

600
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:03,700
Why are we here when it's so dark?

601
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:09,410
Let's die here together tonight.

602
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,050
Do Sik! Do Sik! Do Sik!

603
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,240
Do Sik! Do Sik! Do Sik! Do Sik! Do Sik!

604
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:18,500
You... You're doing this because I took Do Ra to the countryside hospital.

605
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,010
I apologized for that.

606
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:23,840
I said I'll never do that again.

607
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,080
I heard you visited Chairman Gong.

608
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:29,510
You asked for money for Do Jun's engagement?

609
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:32,250
Did you try using him to get gambling money?

610
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:36,300
No, no. I didn't accept money. I'm serious.

611
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,030
He said he won't pay me. So, I didn't accept a penny.

612
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:43,240
I'm serious, Do Sik. Believe me. Believe me.

613
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:51,300
Do Ra couldn't even walk, and you abandoned her in the countryside clinic!

614
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,520
How could a human do that?

615
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,010
Since you apologized...

616
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:59,550
Since you're still my mother, I believed you.

617
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,490
But what did you do?

618
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:07,340
You said you love Do Jun so much, but you demand money for his engagement?

619
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,570
Are you really a mother?

620
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,020
Leave. Let's die.

621
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,540
So, Do Jun and Do Ra can live. Let's go.

622
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,240
Do Sik! Do Sik! Do Sik! Do Sik!

623
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,200
Do Sik! Do Sik! Do Sik! Do Sik!

624
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:32,920
Okay, okay. Okay, I said.

625
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:37,940
I don't know why I'm like this, either.

626
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:41,050
I don't think I'm a human.

627
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,980
I'm less than an animal.

628
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:48,690
I really want to die.

629
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:54,080
I-I... I'll die alone.

630
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,400
I'll die alone, Do Sik.

631
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,390
You can't die.

632
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:03,300
You shouldn't die because of a mom like me.

633
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,870
Do Sik, Do Sik, I...

634
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,260
I promise you.

635
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:16,870
I'll never show up in front of you guys again.

636
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,160
I swear. I swear.

637
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,880
I'm sorry, Do Sik. I'm sorry.

638
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,790
Just pretend I don't exist.

639
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:30,210
I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead, Do Sik.

640
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,250
You don't have a mom. I'm dead.

641
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,330
I'm dead. I'm dead.

642
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:38,960
I'm dead, Do Sik. I'm dead.

643
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,650
I'm dead!

644
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:44,500
I'm dead!

645
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,450
I'm dead!

646
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,220
I'm dead!

647
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,470
I'm dead!

648
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:16,720
By the way, Ma Ri has such a big family.

649
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,920
Our family is just the three of us.

650
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,870
Yes. Ma Ri has a big family because she's very blessed.

651
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:28,170
I'm Dad No. 1 and...

652
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:30,030
I'm Dad No. 2.

653
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:33,430
Dad No. 1 and 2?

654
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,530
There are two dads

655
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:39,260
and two moms here.

656
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,540
That's what's going on.

657
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,100
Gosh, gosh.

658
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,610
Huh? It's Ma Ri.

659
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,640
My gosh.

660
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,050
Ma Ri, you look beautiful. So beautiful.

661
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,540
Beautiful, Ma Ri.

662
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,180
So beautiful!

663
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:59,730
What a beautiful couple.

664
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:02,370
My friend, Ma Ri.

665
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:06,200
By the way, Director Go!

666
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,590
What are you doing here?

667
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:11,610
You're on our side.

668
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:15,200
I'm here today because I'm Ma Ri's brother.

669
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,160
You're Ma Ri's brother?

670
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,890
- Yes. 
 - Gosh, I didn't know that.

671
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:22,740
Is that why?

672
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:26,910
I like Ma Ri as much as I like Director Go.

673
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:33,270
Ma Ri, please be happy with Do Jun in the US, too.

674
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:35,220
Okay, Grandmother. Don't worry.

675
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:39,770
I'll care for him so he doesn't do anything bad.

676
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:48,480
Our handsome son and beautiful daughter

677
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:54,310
are becoming one and leaving us far away in the US to study.

678
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:59,140
Let's raise our glasses so they finish their studies well.

679
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:04,060
For Do Jun and Ma Ri's adventure!

680
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:06,750
Cheers!

681
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:15,030
♫  We'll only have happy days  ♫

682
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:22,210
♫  I'll give you everything  ♫

683
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:31,550
- Welcome— 
 - I heard you're hiring a part-timer.

684
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,710
Well...

685
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:36,350
Is the owner here?

686
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:39,640
Owner... Well, I'm the owner.

687
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:43,620
I'm sorry. I thought you were too young and handsome.

688
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:47,770
Well, you don't have to apologize.

689
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:58,880
Nice.

690
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,640
Thanks for working on this.

691
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,910
That's Episode 4. We can move on to Episode 5.

692
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,930
Yes, Director. I'll send it to you by next week.

693
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:13,170
Okay. No need to push yourself too much.

694
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:17,670
Okay. I'll see you at the next meeting.

695
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:23,240
Also...

696
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,940
this is just for your information.

697
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,390
I no longer have a boyfriend.

698
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,230
Pardon?

699
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:34,700
My boyfriend and I split.

700
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,760
Keep that in mind.

701
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,670
We'd feel better if we saw you off at the airport.

702
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:54,900
Mom, Do Jun and I need to figure things out from now on.

703
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,940
We want to do things ourselves starting at the airport.

704
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:01,350
So, please understand it, Mom and Dad.

705
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,640
Do Jun,

706
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,970
please take good care of Ma Ri.

707
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:09,610
Don't worry, Father.

708
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:11,980
Ma Ri and I will be fine.

709
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:18,920
Seriously, why are you crying, Dad?

710
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,780
I'm not leaving alone. I'm with Do Jun.

711
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,290
So, don't worry.

712
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:27,650
Don't worry. Don't worry, Mommy.

713
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:29,990
See? I speak English well, too.

714
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:34,370
Don't worry about me, and live happily, both of you.

715
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:38,520
And you can visit me whenever you miss me.

716
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:42,000
Yes, my daughter.

717
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,590
Let me hug you one more time.

718
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,420
Mom.

719
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,390
Don't worry.

720
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,400
Okay.

721
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:01,840
- We'll be back soon. 
 - She's in your care.

722
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:05,240
We'll go now.

723
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,130
We'll get going.

724
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,100
Ma Ri...

725
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:17,910
I'm sure she'll be fine, Honey.

726
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:20,200
She'll be fine.

727
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,510
Bye.

728
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,950
Don't do too much. Do little by little.

729
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:42,460
Gosh, Do Ra. I said you don't have to do this.

730
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:46,060
No, Mother. I want to learn how to make your kimchi.

731
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:49,120
I'll learn how to make your side dishes whenever I can, too.

732
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,170
Yes, Do Ra.

733
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:55,420
How did you know Seon Yeong is a good cook?

734
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:58,550
Grandmother, my standard for food is very high.

735
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:01,300
But everything she makes is delicious.

736
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,710
Gosh, this isn't that special.

737
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:05,260
Here, taste this. Say ah.

738
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,340
Okay. Ah.

739
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:09,460
Me, too, Seon Yeong.

740
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,020
Yes, Mother.

741
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:14,000
Unni! Me, too. Me, too.

742
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,650
It's perfectly seasoned, too.

743
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:18,400
Here you go. Here.

744
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,900
It's tasty. It's tasty.

745
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,920
It's so good. It's good.

746
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,130
Right?

747
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,980
- Hey, Do Ra. 
 - Yes.

748
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,150
Is it because we're making this with you?

749
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,840
The kimchi tastes better today.

750
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,730
Really?

751
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,620
Do Ra, bring more containers.

752
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,440
Okay.

753
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:41,200
Aigoo, it looks tasty.

754
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:48,300
You don't even limp anymore. You're good at walking.

755
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,790
I can run, too, Grandmother.

756
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:55,550
Gosh, don't run. Be careful. Be careful.

757
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:57,570
Okay, Mother.

758
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,490
Mom, are you putting her to work already?

759
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:03,630
Seriously.

760
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,810
What are you talking about?

761
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:10,500
I'm asking her to share her kimchi secrets.

762
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,850
Gosh, I hate you so much.

763
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,040
Geez, you love fool.

764
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,860
He does look a little dumb at times like this.

765
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,860
- Right, Mother? 
 - I know.

766
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:23,930
It's not just a little. He's very dumb. Very.

767
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:27,130
- Anyway, Do Ra. 
 - Yes.

768
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:31,050
Did you know Chairman Gong is building houses for

769
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:34,200
us, you guys, and themselves in one lot?

770
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,460
So we can all live together.

771
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,210
Yes, I heard.

772
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:42,240
So, you'd better get married within this year.

773
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,100
Do it properly since it was cut short last time.

774
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,740
Okay, Grandmother.

775
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,980
Don't worry, Grandma. That was the plan.

776
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,390
Gosh, really?

777
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:53,750
Should we schedule it on an evil-spirit-free day, then?

778
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:57,920
I'll find a good shaman and ask for a good date.

779
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,850
Grandmother, what's your zodiac sign?

780
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:03,430
Yes, Chief Yun. Talk to me.

781
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:07,480
Yellow Dragon Arts Awards?

782
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:12,240
Okay.

783
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,860
Do Ra.

784
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:21,370
What is it, Oppa? What's going on?

785
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:26,770
Yellow Dragon Arts Awards nominated us for...

786
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:33,270
the Best Director and the Best Actress for "Seoul Lady."

787
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:35,510
- My gosh. 
 - Gosh!

788
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:38,840
Gosh! My goodness! Really?

789
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:43,130
I-I was nominated for Best Actress?

790
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:46,890
- Really? 
 - Congrats! Congrats!

791
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,350
Both of you?

792
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:51,700
- Gosh, I'm so happy for you. 
 - My goodness!

793
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,410
Something to celebrate!

794
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:01,310
   

795
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:08,280
I'll announce the Best Actress award winner this year, which all of you are waiting for.

796
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:23,310
Park Do Ra of "Seoul Lady." Congratulations.

797
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,520
Congratulations.

798
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:43,950
Congratulations.

820
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:53,120
♫  One love, one love  ♫

821
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:59,410
♫  You're my love  ♫

822
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:00,950
Congratulations.

823
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,520
- Thank you. 
 - You look beautiful. Congratulations.

824
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,240
Thank you.

825
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,310
   

826
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:10,200
   

827
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:24,140
First of all, I want to thank the viewers who loved "Seoul Lady."

828
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:28,330
Director, Writer,

829
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:33,750
the staff members who worked hard, and the fellow actors.

830
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:38,600
I'm up here on behalf of my team.

831
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,540
   

832
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:47,050
Being up here... gives me flashbacks 
    

833
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:52,700
of my acting career since I was 12.

834
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:00,730
Since we were so poor growing up,

835
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:06,490
my mom made me act to support the family.

836
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:19,560
But at some point,

837
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:23,770
I came to love acting so much that

838
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:30,760
my life felt meaningless without it.

839
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,690
Even when...

840
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:40,950
I lost everything and almost died,

841
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:46,420
when I lost my memory and didn't recognize myself,

842
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:51,750
and when I faced a great hardship from the accident,

843
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:57,400
there was one person who held my hand and lifted me up quietly.

844
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,700
He let me stand up here.

845
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,540
My lover,

846
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,210
Director Go Pil Sung.

847
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:14,800
I want to give him all the honor.

848
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,810
Thank you.

849
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,640
Thank you,

850
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,380
Director Go Pil Sung.

851
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:33,350
Thank you as Channel Managers
 tacianelopes55_718 and  xialongne

852
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:37,550
Thank you to the General Editor: trangstar888

853
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:41,650
Thank you to CS porkypine and his entire segmenter team.

854
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:46,350
Thank you to the language moderators and their teams.

855
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:51,050
Thank you to the audience for watching.

856
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:56,150


857
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:59,120
   

858
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:09,600
Do Ra, I want you to play Bun Hong for "Seoul Lady" Season 2.

859
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,150
I wrote Season 2 because of you.

860
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:13,900
Really?

861
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,210
Thank you, Writer Kim.

862
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:21,860
By the way, we're getting married. On an evil-spirit-free day.

863
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,240
What?

864
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,230
This is a romantic drama. You can't get married.

865
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:38,770
The house felt empty since Ma Ri and Do Jun left for the US.

866
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:43,320
But since both of the families gathered, it feels so lively.

867
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,850
It's so nice.

868
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:49,930
The new houses will be finished by next spring.

869
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:53,090
So, we'll be able to live together.

870
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:56,490
But I can't wait for that day to come.

871
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:58,460
Yes, yes.

872
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:01,740
I'm so looking forward to that house, too.

873
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:06,210
Which reminds me, you're preparing for their wedding, right?

874
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:07,950
Yes, of course.

875
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:13,870
But first, I checked their compatibility.

876
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:17,930
But apparently, they're incredibly compatible.

877
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:20,610
They're meant to be together.

878
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:24,880
Seriously, Mom. No one cares about that these days.

879
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,440
You can just tell they make a great couple.

880
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,780
Yes, Mom. No one believes in that anymore.

881
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,860
And what if they say it's no good at this point?

882
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:35,490
They're a good match, I said.

883
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:40,640
And I asked them for a wedding date, too.

884
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,220
Okay.

885
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:47,000
Here it is. Have a look.

886
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,550
Here. Ta-da.

887
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,390
The 25th of next month.

888
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:56,550
That's apparently an amazing date for them.

889
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:57,900
It's an exceptionally lucky date.

890
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,900
The 25th of next month...

891
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:03,500
They can't get married next month. Come on.

892
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:08,560
By the way, we can't get married.

893
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:11,170
Pil Sung...

894
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:12,700
What do you mean?

895
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:14,370
Why can't you get married?

896
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:17,160
Gosh, did you guys have a fight?

897
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,260
It's not that.

898
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:21,510
Do Ra has to film a drama.

899
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:24,040
But it's a romantic drama. That's why we can't.

900
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,050
Writer Kim said she'd kill us if we married.

901
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:30,630
What did you say? Gosh, what's wrong with her?

902
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,410
But the director agrees, too.

903
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:34,180
Who's that director?

904
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:36,510
Huh? Which bastard is it?

905
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:37,930
It's me.

906
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:40,400
What? Hey!

907
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,970
I also agree with the writer.

908
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:45,320
It's our drama, "Seoul Lady" Season 2.

909
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:48,420
It'd ruin the romantic feeling if the female lead were married.

910
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:52,070
I thought if you got married this year,

911
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:56,260
we'd be able to hear a baby crying in the new house.

912
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:00,070
Will you delay the pregnancy, too?

913
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:02,400
Don't worry about that, Grandma.

914
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:07,490
We'll hand you a baby like this once our drama ends.

915
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:13,490
What if another drama starts afterward?

916
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:15,260
Will you delay the wedding again?

917
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:18,880
It'd depend on the situation, then.

918
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,550
My gosh, Pil Sung.

919
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:25,770
Why do you always do the opposite?

920
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:29,650
You insisted on getting married when we told you not to.

921
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:32,410
Now, you're postponing because we told you to?

922
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:34,850
I'm sorry, Mother.

923
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:36,280
I'm sorry.

924
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,660
I'm sorry.

925
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:04,320
 No, this isn't a dream. 

926
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:08,320
 Dae Choong finally became mine. 

927
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,320
 The wall that's been between us is gone now. 

928
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,200
 The sky seems to be blessing us today, too. 

929
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,080
 The sky is clear, the clouds are pretty, 

930
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,520
 and the wind is gentle. 

931
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:24,190
 Our love is bubbling up indeed. 

932
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:28,210


933
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:32,810


934
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:37,610


935
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:42,610


936
01:09:42,610 --> 01:09:47,600


937
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,370
Cut, okay! Nice!

938
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:53,400
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you!

939
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,940
 - Thank you. 
 - Good job, everyone! 

940
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,780
Thank you!

941
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:59,760
It's over!

942
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:13,840
   

943
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:18,140


944
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:23,140


945
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:28,140


946
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:33,140


947
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:38,140


948
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:43,130


949
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,560
   

950
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,910
That female monk, you know?

951
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:51,730
I think it's been more than two years since she came here.

952
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:54,230
But I don't think she ever goes outside.

953
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:56,780
And no one ever visits her.

954
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,860
I asked her about it once, too.

955
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:01,870
She says she has no one in her life.

956
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:05,430
She has no family or a child.

957
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:34,290


958
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:41,460
What? Do you know him?

959
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,920
She's my in-law. Let's go.

960
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:56,480
♫  The reason I love you is  ♫

961
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:02,420
♫  Because you're you  ♫

962
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:07,050
♫  Just like how the sun shines in the morning  ♫

963
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:09,530
Our twins are up now.

964
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:11,900
- Wow! 
 - My gosh!

965
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:17,480
My gosh! They're so cute and pretty.

966
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,890
Right, Do Jun?

967
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:21,820
Mom, I want babies like them, too.

968
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:23,880
I want to have twins like Oppa.

969
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,250
A boy and a girl at once.

970
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:30,000
Unni, Oppa, what's the secret?

971
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:34,930
Do Jun, fighting!

972
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:36,490
Fighting!

973
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:41,650
♫  Even if we changed after some time  ♫

974
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:47,680
♫  My love always feels new  ♫

975
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:52,930
♫  I opened my eyes in your arms  ♫

976
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:58,980
♫  I'll close my eyes in your arms, too  ♫

977
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:04,620
♫  Day by day ~ Day by day  ♫

978
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:10,100
♫  Day by day ~ Day by day  ♫

979
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,810
