1
00:00:46,574 --> 00:00:48,494
So, answer me.

2
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:51,484
Say you like me, too!

3
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,574
President Gong Jin Dan!

4
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:09,090


5
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:13,994
Did you hit me just now?

6
00:01:13,994 --> 00:01:16,374
What's with you, you bastard?

7
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:21,014
What are you doing?

8
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,964
Director! What are you doing?

9
00:01:22,964 --> 00:01:25,574
- How dare you flip out? 
 - Please stop!

10
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:27,394
Let's go home!

11
00:01:28,854 --> 00:01:33,134
If you treat Ji Yeong like that one more time,

12
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,354
I won't tolerate it anymore.

13
00:01:38,024 --> 00:01:40,354
Ji Yeong, let's go.

14
00:01:43,024 --> 00:01:45,314
   

15
00:01:49,104 --> 00:01:50,734
Are you okay, Ji Yeong?

16
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:52,624
You were scared, weren't you?

17
00:01:53,244 --> 00:01:56,804
Yes, but I'm okay.

18
00:01:57,414 --> 00:01:59,084
But what happened?

19
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:01,094
Why did he come here?

20
00:02:01,094 --> 00:02:04,574
The things his mother did to me by coming here...

21
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:07,204
He said he came to apologize for that.

22
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:10,964
I didn't want to hear it, and I didn't want to see him,

23
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,154
but I had to return the money she threw at me.

24
00:02:14,154 --> 00:02:17,414
There's no reason for me to take that.

25
00:02:17,414 --> 00:02:21,414
So, I went out to give it back to him.

26
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:25,274
But he suddenly did that.

27
00:02:26,484 --> 00:02:28,704
Is he for real?

28
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:35,824
Ji Yeong, I'm glad nothing happened to you.

29
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:42,194
I know you were angry, but why did you have to punch him?

30
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:46,754
Ji Yeong, I don't just punch people all the time.

31
00:02:46,754 --> 00:02:50,654
How could I have tolerated it when he was being violent to you?

32
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:54,724
I won't hold back if he treats you like that again.

33
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:57,744
Director...

34
00:02:58,954 --> 00:03:02,474
I think I'm touched right now.

35
00:03:03,614 --> 00:03:05,654
Don't be touched by stuff like this.

36
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:08,824
You're my girlfriend. I need to protect you.

37
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:11,214
Are you happy you're my girlfriend?

38
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,164
Don't ever see that man again, okay?

39
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:18,694
Of course, I won't. Why would I see someone like that?

40
00:03:18,694 --> 00:03:20,904
Do you think I went cuckoo?

41
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:23,744
What did you say?

42
00:03:49,324 --> 00:03:51,234
Gong Jin Dan, youâ€”

43
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:55,054
Oh, my! What happened to your face? Who did that?

44
00:03:55,054 --> 00:03:57,284
Did you get beat up somewhere?

45
00:03:57,284 --> 00:04:00,284
Why would I get beat up? You think I let that happen?

46
00:04:00,284 --> 00:04:02,264
Why do you look like that if you weren't?

47
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:03,714
Why is your lip bleeding? And why are you covered in dirt?

48
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:05,720
.

49
00:04:05,724 --> 00:04:08,214
What happened? Aren't you going to tell me?

50
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,274
- This is all your fault! 
 - Gosh!

51
00:04:10,274 --> 00:04:11,874
- Get out of my room. 
 - Hey!

52
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:15,044
- I don't want to talk to you! 
 - Gong Jin Dan!

53
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:18,674
Shit!

54
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:28,774
 And I already like someone. Don't ever come to see me again. 

55
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,014
What's with Kim Ji Yeong?

56
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:39,974
By chance... is she dating that Go Pil Sung?

57
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:43,814
Seriously, are you kidding me?

58
00:04:49,864 --> 00:04:53,754
Ma Ri, here, it's a mango cake.

59
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:56,564
Do Jun, it's me. Get the car ready.

60
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,654
Where are you going?

61
00:05:00,654 --> 00:05:02,784
I'm going to Pil Sung Oppa's house.

62
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:04,484
Ma Ri.

63
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,784
Why would you go there?

64
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:10,354
Why this time?

65
00:05:10,354 --> 00:05:12,534
To see Pil Sung Oppa.

66
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:16,984
Ma Ri, why are you doing this?

67
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,074
Mom, why are you so surprised?

68
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:23,004
Are you worried I'd say something weird there?

69
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:25,484
You're so shameless.

70
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:27,394
What did you say?

71
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:33,644
Mom, shouldn't you feel bad for Pil Sung Oppa and Seon Yeong?

72
00:05:33,644 --> 00:05:37,674
Are you only worried about me saying something there?

73
00:05:37,674 --> 00:05:39,534
Is that all you care about?

74
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:41,314
Ma Ri.

75
00:05:41,314 --> 00:05:45,004
I can't just sit still like you.

76
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:50,944
I feel so bad for Pil Sung and Seon Yeong that I can't just sit still like this!

77
00:05:50,944 --> 00:05:52,894
Hey, Ma Ri...

78
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,584
Ma Ri...

79
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:58,954
This is a pearl necklace for Grandma.

80
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:02,324
This is a purse for you, Ahjumma.

81
00:06:02,324 --> 00:06:05,184
This is a shirt for you, Ahjussi.

82
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:09,094
- And these are sunglasses for Myeong Dong. 
 -  Wait...

83
00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:14,544
By the way, M-Ma Ri, what's all this?

84
00:06:19,174 --> 00:06:27,244
Thank you so much for raising Pil Sung Oppa as a great person.

85
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:34,704
Ahjumma, you're such an angel.

86
00:06:34,704 --> 00:06:38,224
Thank you. I'm so thankful for you.

87
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:44,194
 What kind of strategy is this now? 

88
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:50,864
Ma Ri, why are you suddenly doing this?

89
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:55,274
Why are you thanking us, and what are all these presents?

90
00:06:56,884 --> 00:07:01,044
I'm giving you these presents to apologize.

91
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:05,764
I scared everyone by hiding in Pil Sung's closet last time.

92
00:07:05,764 --> 00:07:10,544
Things like that would never happen again.

93
00:07:10,544 --> 00:07:12,684
Because...

94
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:19,594
I decided to think of Pil Sung as an older brother, not a man.

95
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:25,634
Grandma, Ahjumma, Ahjussi, Myeong Dong,

96
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:31,954
please think of me as Pil Sung's little sister from now on.

97
00:07:43,444 --> 00:07:45,564
 Look at this! This is... 

98
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:48,124
The TV is too small.

99
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:50,374
Should I get them a new TV, too?

100
00:07:56,214 --> 00:08:00,004
Will Ma Ri really only think of Pil Sung as an older brother?

101
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:01,794
I'm telling you.

102
00:08:01,794 --> 00:08:05,224
She was confused because she was a lonely only child.

103
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:08,144
She definitely doesn't think of him as her boyfriend.

104
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:12,114
She said imagining kissing him makes her puke.

105
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:16,394
Geez. He can't be her boyfriend, then. That'd be impossible.

106
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:21,384
She said she'd visit us often as his little sister.

107
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:25,794
She changes her mind all the time, I'm telling you.

108
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:29,274
She really is strange.

109
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:33,634
She's been playing us all this time.

110
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:38,564
But I'm glad that she decided to be like this.

111
00:08:39,784 --> 00:08:42,704
 Ahjumma, when are we eating our noodles? 

112
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:46,104
Wait just a moment, Ma Ri!

113
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:49,394
It's all done.

114
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:53,584
Ma Ri really said that?

115
00:08:53,584 --> 00:08:58,554
Yes. She said she's been lonely because she's an only child.

116
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:01,594
 She thought of Pil Sung as an older brother. That's why she liked him. 

117
00:09:01,594 --> 00:09:04,394
 She mistakenly thought she wanted to date him. 

118
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:08,634
 She doesn't want to marry him. She just wants him to be her older brother. 

119
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:11,744
Really?

120
00:09:11,744 --> 00:09:14,614
 She apologized for going into his closet, too. 

121
00:09:14,614 --> 00:09:21,930
She even thanked me for raising Pil Sung as a great person.

122
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:24,854
Oh, really?

123
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:31,954
Anyway, Ma Ri brought us a designer purse, clothes, and

124
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:34,984
all sorts of expensive things.

125
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:39,074
I set them aside since I don't think it's right. I'll give them back next time we meet.

126
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:42,374
Gosh, come on. No, it's okay.

127
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:46,944
Just accept the presents since Ma Ri wanted you to have them.

128
00:09:46,944 --> 00:09:52,094
Looks like she brought them because she felt bad and grateful.

129
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:56,714
That'd make her feel better, too. Please accept them.

130
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,734
All right.

131
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,434
Anyway, I called to let you know she's okay.

132
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:05,824
She had noodles with us...

133
00:10:05,824 --> 00:10:09,334
and she's having fun with my mother-in-law.

134
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:13,494
Yes, Seon Yeong. I'm sorry about everything.

135
00:10:13,494 --> 00:10:18,144
Ma Ri has been bothering you a lot, hasn't she?

136
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:20,224
I'm so sorry for all the trouble.

137
00:10:20,224 --> 00:10:22,944
Gosh, what are you talking about?

138
00:10:22,944 --> 00:10:25,014
It's not like that at all.

139
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:29,044
Don't worry. Ma Ri is basically my daughter.

140
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:33,384
It's so nice to hear her chattering at our house.

141
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:37,734
Our house used to feel like a temple, but it's filled with laughter now.

142
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:43,184
Besides, Pil Sung is an only child, and so is Ma Ri.

143
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,984
It'd be nice if they were like siblings.

144
00:10:46,984 --> 00:10:49,434
I'm so thankful that...

145
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:53,884
you'd say that, Seon Yeong.

146
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:55,884
Thank you so much.

147
00:10:55,884 --> 00:10:57,784
 Come on. Here we go again. 

148
00:10:57,784 --> 00:11:00,704
 Why do you always say that? 

149
00:11:00,704 --> 00:11:04,384
Anyway, she wants to see Pil Sung before she goes home. I'll send her home later.

150
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:06,744
Okay. See you.

151
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:19,194
Seon Yeong.

152
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:24,754
Thank you so much, Seon Yeong. Thank you.

153
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:45,174
What are you doing here this time?

154
00:11:45,174 --> 00:11:48,284
Hey, Kim Ji Yeong. Have you been two-timing?

155
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:51,194
Pardon? What are you talking about?

156
00:11:51,194 --> 00:11:52,904
Don't you know what I'm talking about?

157
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:54,804
You were seeing Go Pil Sung,

158
00:11:54,804 --> 00:11:58,104
but you said you'd think about it when I asked you to be my girlfriend.

159
00:11:58,104 --> 00:12:00,724
You've been testing and tempting me.

160
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:02,794
But now you don't want me?

161
00:12:02,794 --> 00:12:06,844
You'd better compensate me for playing with my heart.

162
00:12:09,304 --> 00:12:16,494
President Gong, I never tempted or tested you.

163
00:12:16,494 --> 00:12:20,214
You told me to buy you meals instead of paying for the jacket.

164
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:22,184
Since I didn't have money then,

165
00:12:22,184 --> 00:12:26,864
I was so grateful you told me to buy you meals instead.

166
00:12:26,864 --> 00:12:30,674
That's why I bought you meals. That's all.

167
00:12:31,724 --> 00:12:34,994
Hey, are you joking right now?

168
00:12:34,994 --> 00:12:37,714
You shouldn't have said you'd think about it, then.

169
00:12:37,714 --> 00:12:42,574
I already explained about that last time.

170
00:12:42,574 --> 00:12:44,724
I had to buy you another meal,

171
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:48,574
but if I said no, it would've been difficult to eat together.

172
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:51,064
That's why I said that.

173
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:54,854
I said I'd think about it,

174
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:57,664
but I didn't say I was interested in you.

175
00:12:57,664 --> 00:13:00,524
If I knew you'd be so mistaken,

176
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:04,764
I would've paid you for the jacket even if I had to get a loan.

177
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:08,554
I said all I needed to say. I need to get going.

178
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:12,584
Hey, I'm not done talking. Where are you going?

179
00:13:13,104 --> 00:13:15,294
If you don't let go,

180
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:21,424
I'll tell my boyfriend, the director, to beat you up again. Okay?

181
00:13:21,424 --> 00:13:22,914
What?

182
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:28,114
Just be nice to your fiancee instead.

183
00:13:28,844 --> 00:13:30,744
You've got to be kidding.

184
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:32,884
Don't ever come back here, okay?

185
00:13:32,884 --> 00:13:35,074
No one wants to see you.

186
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:40,464
That country bumpkin!

187
00:13:40,464 --> 00:13:42,944
What do I do with her?

188
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:46,284
You country bumpkin...

189
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,574
Stop calling me that!

190
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:53,584
   

191
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:55,994
What?

192
00:13:57,744 --> 00:13:59,654
What did you say?

193
00:13:59,654 --> 00:14:01,404
Tae Hee?

194
00:14:02,324 --> 00:14:05,564
- I'm back. 
 - Hey, welcome back.

195
00:14:05,564 --> 00:14:07,284
Jin Dan, I'm here.

196
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:10,044
Tae Hee, what's going on?

197
00:14:10,044 --> 00:14:13,794
Why didn't you call me? I would've picked you up, then.

198
00:14:13,794 --> 00:14:16,134
I wanted to surprise you.

199
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:18,684
Actually, Mother invited me.

200
00:14:18,684 --> 00:14:20,534
Oh, really?

201
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:23,884
Auntie and Chairman Gong were so curious about Tae Hee.

202
00:14:23,884 --> 00:14:28,264
You should visit Tae Hee's family, too.

203
00:14:28,264 --> 00:14:31,804
So, when would they like to have an in-laws' gathering?

204
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:36,404
They'd like to know if you're free for lunch next weekend.

205
00:14:36,404 --> 00:14:39,724
Chairman Gong, would you be free then?

206
00:14:39,724 --> 00:14:44,094
Of course. This is such a major family event.

207
00:14:44,094 --> 00:14:47,914
Soo Yeon, you should help us with it, too.

208
00:14:47,914 --> 00:14:49,944
Yes, Auntie.

209
00:14:51,214 --> 00:14:53,154
Try some of this.

210
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:08,484
Did you drive Tae Hee home safely?

211
00:15:09,814 --> 00:15:11,304
Mom,

212
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:15,694
why would you invite Tae Hee without telling me?

213
00:15:15,694 --> 00:15:17,984
And what's with the in-laws' gathering all of a sudden?

214
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:22,304
It's not all of a sudden. It was brought up a long time ago.

215
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:25,904
Why? Do you miss that girl or something?

216
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:27,464
Is it because of her?

217
00:15:27,464 --> 00:15:30,384
Should I go berate her again? Should I?

218
00:15:30,384 --> 00:15:35,164
Mom, if you do that to Ji Yeong again, I might do something about it.

219
00:15:35,164 --> 00:15:37,494
Come to your senses, Gong Jin Dan!

220
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:46,484
I've been hiding all of your crazy behaviors and waiting all this time.

221
00:15:47,234 --> 00:15:50,304
I thought you'd stop and come back at some point.

222
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:51,924
But why are you acting like this?

223
00:15:51,924 --> 00:15:54,904
How far will you go? How far?

224
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:04,364
Jin Dan, you can't do this to Tae Hee.

225
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:09,514
You were with girls in the past you were crazy over and ended things on your own.

226
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:12,064
But Tae Hee is different.

227
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:15,984
Auntie, your brother, and sister-in-law.

228
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:19,674
They're all happy and looking forward to you and Tae Hee's wedding.

229
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:24,024
How could you get distracted by such a loser? How could you?

230
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:28,554
Do you really want to lose everything you have?

231
00:16:31,494 --> 00:16:33,434
No, Mom.

232
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:35,964
I'm not that crazy.

233
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:41,074
I won't do that again. Never again.

234
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:43,684
Do you mean it?

235
00:16:43,684 --> 00:16:45,724
You mean it, right?

236
00:16:47,644 --> 00:16:53,954
 Yes, I can't abandon everything for a stupid woman like her. 

237
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:57,944
Mom, I told you.

238
00:16:57,944 --> 00:17:00,104
I won't lose Tae Hee.

239
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:03,044
I'll make sure to marry Tae Hee.

240
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:05,774
Right, Jin Dan? Right?

241
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,074
I'll count on you, okay?

242
00:17:16,514 --> 00:17:18,124
 I'm all done. 

243
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:19,564
 Where are you, Ji Yeong? 

244
00:17:19,564 --> 00:17:21,904
 Are you finished with the reading? 

245
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:40,024
I'm sorry, Director.

246
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:42,344
I'm not done yet.

247
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:46,964
Director Hong and the actors will read the script until late since the shooting starts next week.

248
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:49,334
You should go home first.

249
00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:52,284
You want me to go home alone?

250
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:55,884
I'd feel so bored driving alone.

251
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:59,694
You're getting sillier and sillier.

252
00:17:59,694 --> 00:18:02,644
How did you live without me all this time?

253
00:18:02,644 --> 00:18:05,144
- Weren't you bored? 
 - This is no good.

254
00:18:05,144 --> 00:18:08,894
I should call Director Hong and ask him to finish it up now.

255
00:18:08,894 --> 00:18:10,644
So, we can have a date on the way home.

256
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:14,354
Huh? No, no! You can't do that.

257
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:17,984
I was kidding. I was kidding. Seriously, you're so easy to fool.

258
00:18:20,454 --> 00:18:22,944
You worked hard today, too.

259
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:25,134
Go home early and rest.

260
00:18:25,134 --> 00:18:27,584
I'll text you when I'm done.

261
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:29,414
Okay.

262
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:34,234
Since we can't have a date,

263
00:18:34,974 --> 00:18:38,064
give me a hug instead. So I can go home.

264
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:45,434
All right.

265
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:49,804
Let's hug quickly before someone sees us.

266
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:00,984
Do you want to borrow anything else?

267
00:19:00,984 --> 00:19:04,524
I'm sorry, Director! I'll get going!

268
00:19:06,824 --> 00:19:09,074
Director, what are you doing?

269
00:19:09,074 --> 00:19:10,514
Did you fall?

270
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:13,694
Fall? No. My shoelace got undone.

271
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:23,004
- We'll get going, then. 
 - Okay.

272
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:29,104
Grandma, I love hearing Oppa's stories.

273
00:19:29,104 --> 00:19:30,784
Please tell me another one. Please.

274
00:19:30,784 --> 00:19:34,414
Should I tell you a story of him as a baby, then?

275
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:36,814
As a baby? Yes, I love it.

276
00:19:36,814 --> 00:19:43,124
It was when he was about a year old when he was still crawling.

277
00:19:43,124 --> 00:19:48,614
He was by our side one moment, but he was gone a moment later.

278
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:51,044
He was gone? Where?

279
00:19:51,044 --> 00:19:56,464
We didn't know then, either. So we searched the whole house, freaking out.

280
00:19:56,464 --> 00:20:00,154
My goodness. The baby who was crawling a moment ago

281
00:20:00,154 --> 00:20:04,094
somehow suddenly ended up on the rooftop.

282
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:07,694
The rooftop? So? Did he get hurt?

283
00:20:07,694 --> 00:20:14,784
So the entire family was trembling nervously, hoping he didn't fall.

284
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:20,654
But you know she's a mother.  She crawled gently toward him,

285
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:24,494
grabbed him and brought him back.

286
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,144
Thank you. What a relief.

287
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,534
Ahjumma, you're so admirable.

288
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:33,794
What?

289
00:20:33,794 --> 00:20:37,644
And Grandma, Ahjussi, and Myeong Dong.

290
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:42,714
You all raised Pil Sung Oppa as a healthy and strong person.

291
00:20:42,714 --> 00:20:44,684
You worked so hard.

292
00:20:44,684 --> 00:20:46,724
I'm so thankful for you.

293
00:20:46,724 --> 00:20:50,084
I'll never forget that you did that.

294
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:54,364
Aigoo, aigoo. My gosh.

295
00:20:54,364 --> 00:20:57,674
- I'm home. 
 - Hey, Pil Sung.

296
00:20:58,914 --> 00:21:01,034
Ms. Ma Ri.

297
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:06,004
Oppa.

298
00:21:07,314 --> 00:21:09,074
Yes, Ms. Ma Ri.

299
00:21:09,544 --> 00:21:14,814
From now on, call me "Ma Ri" instead of "Ms. Ma Ri."

300
00:21:14,814 --> 00:21:16,864
Because...

301
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:22,274
I just want to be your little sister from now on.

302
00:21:22,274 --> 00:21:25,684
Just speak casually to me, too.

303
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:30,614
Should I?

304
00:21:31,284 --> 00:21:33,104
Okay, Ma Ri.

305
00:21:33,104 --> 00:21:34,854
Okay.

306
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:38,854
Oppa, I was raised all alone, and I was lonesome.

307
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:41,584
So I've always wanted an older brother.

308
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:45,384
What I really wanted was a real older brother figure like you.

309
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:50,844
But I foolishly got confused and insisted you become my boyfriend.

310
00:21:51,414 --> 00:21:55,334
Oppa, I'm so sorry about everything.

311
00:21:55,334 --> 00:21:57,274
I apologize.

312
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,224
I see.

313
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:08,304
Yes. So I never want you to become my boyfriend.

314
00:22:08,304 --> 00:22:11,234
Never, ever, ever, ever.

315
00:22:11,234 --> 00:22:15,304
So, can you just think of me as your little sister

316
00:22:15,304 --> 00:22:19,124
and we'd be like siblings from now on?

317
00:22:19,124 --> 00:22:22,444
Of course. I'd like that, too.

318
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:25,174
I'm happy to have a little sister, too.

319
00:22:25,174 --> 00:22:27,804
Really? Oppa, thank you so much.

320
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:32,984
Let's shake hands to celebrate us becoming siblings, then.

321
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:42,676
I heard you decided to be like siblings with Pil Sung.

322
00:22:42,676 --> 00:22:49,066
Yes. I was mad at you, hated you, and couldn't understand you.

323
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:51,646
But Pil Sung Oppa said he'd be my older brother.

324
00:22:51,646 --> 00:22:53,946
So, I hate you a little less...

325
00:22:53,946 --> 00:22:58,166
and I'm thankful to you for giving birth to such a cool brother.

326
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,486
Ma Ri,

327
00:23:02,486 --> 00:23:06,976
I'm so thankful that you're telling me that.

328
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:12,706
Mom, I said I'm thankful you gave birth to him.

329
00:23:12,706 --> 00:23:14,616
But I still can't understand you.

330
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:19,006
I never would've forgiven you if I were Pil Sung.

331
00:23:22,616 --> 00:23:24,526
Since we're on the topic,

332
00:23:24,526 --> 00:23:29,536
Mom, it's not too late to be nice to him if you feel bad.

333
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:34,656
- What did you say? 
 - Mom, I want to share what I have with him.

334
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,646
How can we make him as rich as we are?

335
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:40,366
How can I share what I have with him?

336
00:23:40,366 --> 00:23:43,706
I can't tell Dad I want to give mine to Oppa.

337
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:47,206
Because Dad can't know about him.

338
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:51,036
How can we share what we have with him?

339
00:23:53,356 --> 00:23:55,696
Thank you so much, Ma Ri.

340
00:23:56,596 --> 00:24:00,316
You're a thousand times smarter

341
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:03,076
and a better person than I am.

342
00:24:04,596 --> 00:24:06,436
You are.

343
00:24:08,366 --> 00:24:10,886
   

344
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:13,766
   

345
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:16,216
   

346
00:24:16,216 --> 00:24:18,796
   

347
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:21,456
It's not just a hit, but it's a smashing hit?

348
00:24:21,456 --> 00:24:25,556
I'm telling you. The first episode's ratings were over 15%.

349
00:24:25,556 --> 00:24:29,576
Ratings like this are considered a miracle.

350
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:31,736
My goodness.

351
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,586
We need to celebrate. Seriously.

352
00:24:34,586 --> 00:24:36,376
Aigoo, how amazing.

353
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:41,346
Hold on. So, what would happen to Pil Sung going forward?

354
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,386
Everyone would want to hire him now.

355
00:24:44,386 --> 00:24:48,216
Everyone will reach out to him once you create a hit show like this.

356
00:24:48,216 --> 00:24:49,876
Really?

357
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:54,076
He just needs to choose whoever pays him more, then.

358
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:58,496
No. He'd have to quit his job at the broadcasting station, then.

359
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:02,366
Come on, Unni. There are so many freelancer directors these days.

360
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:05,186
The world has completely changed now.

361
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:08,066
I still prefer him to have a salary.

362
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:11,656
He'd be guaranteed his job until he retires, too.

363
00:25:11,656 --> 00:25:16,686
Thinking about how worried I was when Hyeon Cheol said

364
00:25:16,686 --> 00:25:20,196
he'd quit his job and start a business,

365
00:25:20,196 --> 00:25:23,576
I don't want Pil Sung to go through that.

366
00:25:23,576 --> 00:25:27,976
I still wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it.

367
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:33,676
Seon Yeong, do you have to bring up Hyeon Cheol's failure right now?

368
00:25:33,676 --> 00:25:36,416
Oh, Mother, it's not that.

369
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:41,486
Anyway, don't encourage Pil Sung to do that, Myeong Dong.

370
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:42,906
Okay.

371
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:46,986
But you know he wouldn't listen to me even if I did.

372
00:25:46,986 --> 00:25:50,196
Hey, hey. So what if his show became a hit?

373
00:25:50,196 --> 00:25:51,856
He's dating the wrong person.

374
00:25:51,856 --> 00:25:54,456
Mom, why would you say that?

375
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:57,026
What? I'm saying this for a reason.

376
00:25:57,026 --> 00:25:59,936
Not only is she a country bumpkin who has nothing,

377
00:25:59,936 --> 00:26:03,626
she's a gold digger who seduced an engaged man.

378
00:26:03,626 --> 00:26:09,466
Gosh! Anyway, why does Pil Sung have such poor taste in women?

379
00:26:10,356 --> 00:26:12,426
Don't worry, Mother.

380
00:26:12,426 --> 00:26:14,676
He'd give up eventually.

381
00:26:14,676 --> 00:26:18,796
Aigoo, aigoo. They're always together at home and at work.

382
00:26:18,796 --> 00:26:21,806
- Yeah, right! They'd break up. 
 - Mom!

383
00:26:21,806 --> 00:26:24,686
What? Did I say something wrong?

384
00:26:24,686 --> 00:26:26,776
That's enough.

385
00:26:28,376 --> 00:26:32,536
Director, have you considered my proposal?

386
00:26:32,536 --> 00:26:38,346
Yes, I appreciate you coming to see me and calling me several times.

387
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:43,416
But I'm not experienced enough to become a freelancer yet.

388
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:45,606
I don't think it's the time yet.

389
00:26:46,436 --> 00:26:49,176
What is it? Are you not satisfied with the terms?

390
00:26:49,866 --> 00:26:52,386
It's not that.

391
00:26:52,386 --> 00:26:57,386
I don't think I'm ready to leave the broadcasting station yet.

392
00:26:57,386 --> 00:27:01,026
Let's talk when we get a chance later.

393
00:27:01,026 --> 00:27:03,676
Okay. I'll think about it...

394
00:27:03,676 --> 00:27:08,646
and come back with the terms you won't be able to refuse.

395
00:27:08,646 --> 00:27:11,376
You have to consider it then.

396
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:13,006
Okay.

397
00:27:13,836 --> 00:27:15,536
Answer it. I'll be in touch.

398
00:27:15,536 --> 00:27:17,006
Okay.

399
00:27:17,676 --> 00:27:19,346
Thank you.

400
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:23,616
Yes, Hyung.

401
00:27:24,846 --> 00:27:26,526
The station director?

402
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:33,806
Pil Sung, the best production companies in the country

403
00:27:33,806 --> 00:27:37,876
are eager to recruit you, apparently.

404
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:41,056
You're getting tons of calls already, aren't you?

405
00:27:41,056 --> 00:27:43,056
Not that much.

406
00:27:43,056 --> 00:27:47,086
You didn't meet any of the CEOs, then?

407
00:27:47,936 --> 00:27:50,626
Well, I did.

408
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:57,596
Pil Sung, it's fair to say that I made you successful.

409
00:27:57,596 --> 00:28:01,126
You leaving the broadcasting station now is...

410
00:28:01,126 --> 00:28:05,076
to exaggerate it a bit, it's a betrayal.

411
00:28:05,076 --> 00:28:10,176
What I'm saying is that you should stay grounded.

412
00:28:10,176 --> 00:28:14,186
It's not like you and I had a dating relationship or something. What do you mean by "betrayal"?

413
00:28:14,186 --> 00:28:21,496
Pil Sung, the world looks rosy to you since you're here.

414
00:28:21,496 --> 00:28:23,096
This is a greenhouse.

415
00:28:23,096 --> 00:28:26,846
The outside is the Himalayas. Everything is covered with ice.

416
00:28:26,846 --> 00:28:31,636
Station Director, why are you scaring me when I'm just getting started?

417
00:28:31,636 --> 00:28:35,336
I'm not scaring you. I'm just worried about you.

418
00:28:35,336 --> 00:28:37,836
I'm telling you to think carefully.

419
00:28:37,836 --> 00:28:41,016
Okay. I'll think about it carefully.

420
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:46,236
Yes. Think carefully... and stay here.

421
00:28:46,236 --> 00:28:48,026
What did you say?

422
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,946
You want to start a drama production company?

423
00:28:51,946 --> 00:28:54,856
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

424
00:28:54,856 --> 00:28:58,126
It's not sudden. I've been talking about this for years.

425
00:28:58,126 --> 00:29:03,016
You told me to think about it after building experience running a store.

426
00:29:03,016 --> 00:29:06,516
I did say that.

427
00:29:06,516 --> 00:29:10,296
Do you not trust me? You look nervous.

428
00:29:10,296 --> 00:29:13,916
Of course I do. It's just so sudden.

429
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:17,326
Dad, stop arguing and let her do what she wants.

430
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:20,186
A man should be a man of your word.

431
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:25,206
Yes, a promise is a promise. I should keep it.

432
00:29:25,206 --> 00:29:27,366
Since you run the store well, you'd be good at running a production company, too.

433
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:30,716
you'd be good at running a production company, too.

434
00:29:30,716 --> 00:29:32,226
My gosh.

435
00:29:33,236 --> 00:29:35,246
Thank you, Honey.

436
00:29:36,116 --> 00:29:38,676
Dad, thank you so much. I love you.

437
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:43,076
Ma Ri looks happier that you're starting a production company.

438
00:29:43,076 --> 00:29:45,106
Are you that happy?

439
00:29:45,106 --> 00:29:48,876
You were saying you hated her just a few days ago.

440
00:29:49,596 --> 00:29:51,426
The two of you...

441
00:29:51,426 --> 00:29:54,026
When did you make up?

442
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:58,486
A fight between a mother and daughter is like cutting water with a knife.

443
00:29:58,486 --> 00:30:02,376
What did you say? Cutting water with a knife?

444
00:30:06,706 --> 00:30:09,446
Where did you learn that phrase?

445
00:30:13,636 --> 00:30:16,736
Ji Yeong, here.

446
00:30:17,796 --> 00:30:22,396
President Lee, I'm nervous to death right now.

447
00:30:22,396 --> 00:30:25,146
My heart is about to pop out.

448
00:30:25,146 --> 00:30:27,776
I can't think of any lines, either.

449
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:31,216
My head hurts, and I think I'll throw up.

450
00:30:31,216 --> 00:30:34,486
What? I-If so...

451
00:30:34,486 --> 00:30:38,616
I'll go get you chungshimhwan*. Wait just a moment. 
  (T/N: Calming herbal medicine) 

452
00:30:46,726 --> 00:30:49,786
What do I do? We're about to start filming soon.

453
00:30:50,506 --> 00:30:52,946
Why am I so nervous?

454
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:07,786
Director.

455
00:31:07,786 --> 00:31:11,186
 Ji Yeong, you must be nervous since it's your first shoot. 

456
00:31:11,186 --> 00:31:13,556
I wish I were there in moments like that.

457
00:31:13,556 --> 00:31:15,946
I can't come because I have a lot of meetings today.

458
00:31:15,946 --> 00:31:17,256
Are you okay?

459
00:31:17,256 --> 00:31:19,966
Yes, I-I'm...

460
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:22,166
I-I'm okay.

461
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:24,886
I'd get even more nervous if you were around.

462
00:31:24,886 --> 00:31:27,456
 But you don't look okay. 

463
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:28,786
 Ji Yeong, 

464
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:32,206
you weren't nervous at all when you shot "Don't Lie to Me."

465
00:31:32,206 --> 00:31:34,886
What's wrong? You look so nervous now.

466
00:31:34,886 --> 00:31:39,356
I know. I don't know why I'm like this.

467
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:42,976
I think it's because I'm the leading actor.

468
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:46,866
The drama would fail if I did a bad job.

469
00:31:46,866 --> 00:31:51,746
Thinking about that makes me so scared and panicked.

470
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:53,786
It's because you have a big responsibility.

471
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,546
But having responsibility isn't a bad thing.

472
00:31:56,546 --> 00:31:58,706
I know, but...

473
00:31:59,446 --> 00:32:03,596
I don't know if I can do well since I'm so nervous.

474
00:32:03,596 --> 00:32:08,506
Ji Yeong, pretend like you're the character and start focusing.

475
00:32:08,506 --> 00:32:12,376
Pretend you're someone else, not Kim Ji Yeong.

476
00:32:12,376 --> 00:32:15,356
Put yourself under a spell. Like you did for "Don't Lie to Me."

477
00:32:15,356 --> 00:32:16,996
Okay.

478
00:32:16,996 --> 00:32:18,666
I will.

479
00:32:19,316 --> 00:32:21,726
 - Baby chick.  
 - Pardon?

480
00:32:21,726 --> 00:32:24,766
"Baby chick"? What baby chick?

481
00:32:26,336 --> 00:32:29,876
There are a lot of people around me right now.

482
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:34,926
If I say, "baby chick," from now on, it means I like you.

483
00:32:34,926 --> 00:32:36,876
What did you say?

484
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,316
Okay.

485
00:32:46,056 --> 00:32:47,876
Chirp, chirp.

486
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:52,946
- Baby chick. 
 - Chirp, chirp.

487
00:33:14,896 --> 00:33:18,196
How's this outfit? Can you still tell I'm a country bumpkin?

488
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,376
Would it be okay for the interview tomorrow?

489
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:23,826
Yes, you look like a city woman. Good.

490
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:29,056
Over here. I'll take everything.

491
00:33:30,696 --> 00:33:33,506
Cut! Okay! Nice!

492
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:38,336
That country bumpkin. How is she so natural?

493
00:33:38,336 --> 00:33:42,056
She's a newbie, but she doesn't even get nervous.

494
00:33:42,056 --> 00:33:43,536
Gosh...

495
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:47,026
How was I, President Lee?

496
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,616
Was I okay?

497
00:33:48,616 --> 00:33:51,056
Are you kidding me?

498
00:33:51,056 --> 00:33:53,136
Ji Yeong, you did a great job.

499
00:33:53,136 --> 00:33:56,716
Why is Jae Dong next to that country bumpkin?

500
00:33:56,716 --> 00:33:58,916
Jae Dong! Hey!

501
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:02,266
Why are you with that country bumpkin?

502
00:34:02,266 --> 00:34:05,786
President Baek, I started an entertainment company.

503
00:34:07,186 --> 00:34:09,886
And she's not a country bumpkin. She's Kim Ji Yeong.

504
00:34:09,886 --> 00:34:11,796
She's my first actor.

505
00:34:11,796 --> 00:34:16,896
Popcorn Entertainment? So... she's an actor at your company?

506
00:34:16,896 --> 00:34:18,596
Yes.

507
00:34:18,596 --> 00:34:22,906
Wow, you little.

508
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,276
Ji Yeong.

509
00:34:35,286 --> 00:34:37,376
Director.

510
00:34:38,296 --> 00:34:39,956
What's wrong, Ji Yeong?

511
00:34:39,956 --> 00:34:42,186
Did something happen on set?

512
00:34:42,186 --> 00:34:44,746
I'm the problem.

513
00:34:44,746 --> 00:34:50,256
I made a lot of mistakes today and I don't think I did as well as I wanted to.

514
00:34:51,606 --> 00:34:53,846
Is that why you're so down?

515
00:34:53,846 --> 00:34:55,706
Yes.

516
00:34:55,706 --> 00:34:57,506
Everyone's like that in the beginning.

517
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:59,516
You mess up a lot since you're nervous.

518
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:03,146
Some actors forget all the lines because of stage fright.

519
00:35:03,146 --> 00:35:06,666
One actor had one line, but he messed up over 30 times.

520
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:09,686
We had to cancel the shoot because of him that day.

521
00:35:09,686 --> 00:35:13,616
That sounds made up.  You made that up, right?

522
00:35:13,616 --> 00:35:19,526
Well... I exaggerated it a tiny bit, but everyone's like that in the beginning.

523
00:35:20,426 --> 00:35:22,226
Thank you.

524
00:35:22,226 --> 00:35:28,626
I think I feel a little better since you said that.

525
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:32,476
By the way, when will you stop calling me "Director"?

526
00:35:32,476 --> 00:35:35,426
Are we working right now? Aren't we dating?

527
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:37,966
You still always call me "Director."

528
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:40,426
What should I call you, then?

529
00:35:40,966 --> 00:35:44,606
Well, "Oppa" would be nice.

530
00:35:44,606 --> 00:35:46,746
What?

531
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:50,136
I can't say stuff like that.

532
00:35:50,136 --> 00:35:54,596
And we're not siblings. What do you mean, "Oppa"?

533
00:35:54,596 --> 00:35:58,076
I hate calling my boyfriend "Oppa."

534
00:35:58,076 --> 00:36:00,826
Will you keep calling me "Director," then?

535
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:03,566
No, but...

536
00:36:04,186 --> 00:36:06,476
How about "Pil Sung"?

537
00:36:06,476 --> 00:36:10,086
That's not bad, either.

538
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:15,456
I'm not too thrilled about it, either.

539
00:36:15,456 --> 00:36:18,446
I'll give it a thought, then.

540
00:36:18,446 --> 00:36:20,836
What should I call you, then?

541
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:23,746
Darling?

542
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:25,106
Huh?

543
00:36:25,106 --> 00:36:27,456
- Baby? 
 - What?

544
00:36:27,456 --> 00:36:29,376
- Honey? 
 - Gosh!

545
00:36:29,376 --> 00:36:32,056
That's enough! Just call me by my name.

546
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,286
The chills are killing me right now.

547
00:36:34,286 --> 00:36:37,326
Okay. You can't die from having the chills.

548
00:36:37,326 --> 00:36:39,916
I'll start with "Ji Yeong," then.

549
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:45,836
Sounds good. I love it whenever you call my name.

550
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:49,736
Okay. I prepared something to celebrate your first shoot.

551
00:36:49,736 --> 00:36:51,346
Let's get going.

552
00:36:51,346 --> 00:36:54,986
- What is it? 
 - You'll see when you get there.

553
00:36:54,986 --> 00:36:59,196
I'm curious. Can't you just tell me?

554
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:05,266
Director, these are so pretty.

555
00:37:06,576 --> 00:37:10,006
There's a treasure box in there. Look for it.

556
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:11,606
Okay.

557
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:20,426
I-I found it.

558
00:37:20,426 --> 00:37:23,296
- Open it. 
 - Oh, okay.

559
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:35,076
 I hope you always walk on the petal-filled path. 

560
00:37:35,076 --> 00:37:39,256
 Actor Kim Ji Yeong's forever No. 1 fan, Go Pil Sung. 

561
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:43,756
Director.

562
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:49,746
Whenever you feel stressed and sad, look at these and feel better.

563
00:37:49,746 --> 00:37:53,796
And let your anger out on this when you get mad at me.

564
00:37:53,796 --> 00:37:56,666
Can I, really?

565
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:58,886
Will you actually do it?

566
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:04,036
Why would I ever be mad at you?

567
00:38:04,036 --> 00:38:06,756
I'd never do it, Director.

568
00:38:06,756 --> 00:38:08,336
You're calling me "Director" again.

569
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:10,966
Okay, fine, Pil Sung.

570
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,576
What did you say?

571
00:38:16,376 --> 00:38:18,616
Yes, go ahead and call me that.

572
00:38:48,946 --> 00:38:51,656
It's my grandma. What do I do?

573
00:38:51,656 --> 00:38:55,016
Leave now, Director. It'd be bad if she finds out.

574
00:38:55,016 --> 00:38:57,636
She'd beat me to death!

575
00:38:57,636 --> 00:38:59,816
- What did I do? 
 - Leave, leave.

576
00:38:59,816 --> 00:39:03,136
- I'll go, then. 
 - Yes, bye!

577
00:39:09,256 --> 00:39:12,696
Aigoo, what's going on, Grandma?

578
00:39:12,696 --> 00:39:16,096
Why did you have to call me now?

579
00:39:16,096 --> 00:39:20,216
 I called because I wanted to hear your voice. 

580
00:39:20,216 --> 00:39:24,256
 Why are you yelling at me? 

581
00:39:24,256 --> 00:39:27,566
When did I yell at you?

582
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:32,346
 Ji Yeong, you can't just date random people in Seoul. 

583
00:39:32,346 --> 00:39:35,706
 You can't just let anyone in at your place. 

584
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,946
 Keep that in mind, okay? 

585
00:39:37,946 --> 00:39:40,976
Okay, I-I will.

586
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:43,426
Why are you so worried?

587
00:39:43,426 --> 00:39:47,806
I-I'll talk to you later, then. Okay.

588
00:39:54,346 --> 00:39:58,176
How does Grandma know what's going on from there?

589
00:39:58,836 --> 00:40:02,676
I can't do anything because of her.

590
00:40:07,266 --> 00:40:11,876
By the way, what was that situation just now?

591
00:40:13,576 --> 00:40:18,856
Kim Ji Yeong, what are you imagining right now?

592
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:42,721
Pil Sung, I started a production company.

593
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:45,551
Production company?

594
00:40:46,751 --> 00:40:49,431
It's something I've been dreaming of for years.

595
00:40:49,431 --> 00:40:52,411
I'm thinking of finally doing it now.

596
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:54,471
Oh, I see.

597
00:40:54,471 --> 00:40:59,711
So, I've been meeting directors and writers to sign contracts before the foundation ceremony.

598
00:41:00,471 --> 00:41:04,611
Would you like to help me, Pil Sung?

599
00:41:05,481 --> 00:41:06,851
Pardon?

600
00:41:06,851 --> 00:41:13,041
I want to sign Go Go Entertainment's first contract with you, Director Go Pil Sung.

601
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:15,771
That's why I wanted to see you.

602
00:41:17,011 --> 00:41:18,301
With me?

603
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:24,631
Yes. I really enjoyed your drama, "Don't Lie to Me."

604
00:41:24,631 --> 00:41:28,811
Your directing skills made it shine even more.

605
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:32,251
That's why the whole world is focusing on you now.

606
00:41:32,861 --> 00:41:37,151
Pil Sung, please join my company.

607
00:41:42,391 --> 00:41:49,061
Ahjumma, I appreciate the offer, but I still need to build more experience.

608
00:41:49,061 --> 00:41:52,611
No, Director Go. You're good enough.

609
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,641
This is the contract.

610
00:41:57,641 --> 00:42:01,131
Do you want to look through it now?

611
00:42:01,131 --> 00:42:04,101
And let me know if it's missing something.

612
00:42:18,251 --> 00:42:19,811
This is...

613
00:42:20,391 --> 00:42:22,981
The contract fee is too high.

614
00:42:22,981 --> 00:42:27,831
What are you talking about? I'm doing this since you're worth it.

615
00:42:27,831 --> 00:42:32,851
I heard other production companies are desperate to hire you, too.

616
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:36,731
Shouldn't I offer at least this much to have the edge?

617
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:39,301
Ahjumma.

618
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:46,761
I want Go Go Entertainment to be Korea's best drama production company.

619
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:49,121
As long as you join me,

620
00:42:49,121 --> 00:42:54,631
I'll fully support you so you can tell the stories you want to tell.

621
00:42:55,391 --> 00:42:58,981
I'm just getting started. So I need a trustworthy person.

622
00:42:58,981 --> 00:43:05,621
Director Go. I mean, Pil Sung... please help me.

623
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:15,061
Okay, I'll think about it.

624
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:35,021
 I want Go Go Entertainment to be the best drama production company in Korea. 

625
00:43:35,021 --> 00:43:37,621
 As long as you join me, 

626
00:43:37,621 --> 00:43:43,341
 I'll fully support you so you can tell the stories you want to tell. 

627
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:48,711
 I'll make two billion if I do this for a few hours. 

628
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:50,661
 Can you give me that money? 

629
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,421
 I'll be the one who'd regret it. 

630
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:55,511
 So, shut up and leave unless you have two billion! 

631
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:57,331
 Two billion? 

632
00:43:59,231 --> 00:44:01,411
 No, I don't. 

633
00:44:03,001 --> 00:44:07,891
 Not two billion, 200 million, 

634
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:11,341
 or even 20 million won. 

635
00:44:13,761 --> 00:44:17,391
 But I can give you two billion won. 

636
00:44:18,911 --> 00:44:21,441
 If I save on everything else... 

637
00:44:22,171 --> 00:44:25,031
 and make things work, 

638
00:44:26,341 --> 00:44:29,721
 I can give you around two million. 

639
00:44:35,861 --> 00:44:38,611
I'll never stumble again.

640
00:44:39,881 --> 00:44:46,641
I won't lose the one I love because of a lack of power and money again.

641
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:49,431
Never again.

642
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:57,251
What did you say?

643
00:44:57,251 --> 00:45:00,951
You'll join the company Soo Yeon is starting?

644
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:02,541
Yes.

645
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:09,261
Do you mean you'll quit your job at the broadcasting station?

646
00:45:09,921 --> 00:45:11,591
Yes.

647
00:45:11,591 --> 00:45:16,431
Soo Yeon's company made me an amazing offer.

648
00:45:16,431 --> 00:45:20,751
I don't think I'll get a chance like that again, so I want to give it a try.

649
00:45:22,121 --> 00:45:27,891
But Pil Sung, can you think about it more carefully?

650
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:34,181
The moment you leave your job, you'll lose the shield that's been protecting you.

651
00:45:34,181 --> 00:45:39,641
If you stay at the station you're guaranteed your retirement, and you'd be stable.

652
00:45:39,641 --> 00:45:46,011
Even if you failed a few times, you'd be given new chances.

653
00:45:46,011 --> 00:45:53,091
But once you fail as a freelance director, it'd be so hard to get another chance.

654
00:45:53,091 --> 00:45:55,961
Yes, think about it one more time.

655
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:59,231
Isn't it better to be stable?

656
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:06,051
It'd be hard once I quit my job, but I want to be successful on my own.

657
00:46:06,051 --> 00:46:08,251
I want to make money that way, too.

658
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:11,811
I want to have faith in myself and go for it.

659
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:14,081
So, don't worry so much.

660
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:17,911
Okay. Fine.

661
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:21,051
You should do that if you've decided to do that.

662
00:46:21,051 --> 00:46:25,551
Okay. Do a great job since you've decided to do it.

663
00:46:25,551 --> 00:46:27,471
Be sure to be successful.

664
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:32,011
Yes, they'd pay him much more than other places.

665
00:46:32,011 --> 00:46:33,941
Why say no?

666
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:36,061
Pil Sung, you're doing the right thing.

667
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:39,761
You're supposed to row when the water's flooding in.

668
00:46:39,761 --> 00:46:44,171
It won't fail since it's a production company under the APP Group.

669
00:46:44,171 --> 00:46:46,941
Anyway, that's great news. Congratulations.

670
00:46:53,331 --> 00:46:55,711
Yes, I understand.

671
00:46:55,711 --> 00:46:58,271
I have faith in you, too, son.

672
00:46:59,571 --> 00:47:03,911
Thank you, Mom, Dad, Grandma, and Aunt.

673
00:47:05,131 --> 00:47:06,921
What did you say?

674
00:47:06,921 --> 00:47:11,231
You're paying that much contract fee to Director Go?

675
00:47:11,231 --> 00:47:15,281
Why would you pay that much money to a newbie director?

676
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:18,781
Are you out of your mind, Soo Yeon?

677
00:47:18,781 --> 00:47:23,081
Jin Dan, how dare you talk to your sister-in-law like that?

678
00:47:23,081 --> 00:47:25,021
"Out of your mind?"

679
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:26,851
I'm sorry.

680
00:47:26,851 --> 00:47:30,221
But this is totally unprecedented.

681
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:35,761
If you pay a newbie director that much, you'd have to raise the pay of other directors, too.

682
00:47:35,761 --> 00:47:38,151
You'd get criticized by other companies.

683
00:47:38,151 --> 00:47:41,761
This goes against the business ethics.

684
00:47:41,761 --> 00:47:46,871
Soo Yeon, is it because he's your friend's son, by chance?

685
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:52,051
That's not why. How could you ask that?

686
00:47:52,051 --> 00:47:54,611
Director Go isn't a newbie director.

687
00:47:54,611 --> 00:47:57,521
He's one of the hottest directors right now.

688
00:47:57,521 --> 00:48:00,011
Of course, he doesn't have a lot of experience,

689
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:04,171
but he won an award at an international festival with a mini-series two years ago.

690
00:48:04,171 --> 00:48:08,741
He was nominated for the Juniper Award for a drama named "Don't Lie to Me."

691
00:48:08,741 --> 00:48:11,431
He's receiving attention internationally, too.

692
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:14,191
That's why other production companies want him.

693
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,811
But I managed to persuade him.

694
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:18,991
But I'm still against it.

695
00:48:20,421 --> 00:48:24,371
I'm the CEO of Go Go Entertainment. Why are you telling me this?

696
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:29,001
Soo Yeon, Angel Investment invested in your company, too.

697
00:48:29,001 --> 00:48:31,281
Because Hyung told me to.

698
00:48:31,281 --> 00:48:34,311
So, I have the right to speak up.

699
00:48:35,381 --> 00:48:38,521
Anyway, Director Go is no good. I'm against it.

700
00:48:38,521 --> 00:48:41,281
So, meet other directors instead.

701
00:48:41,281 --> 00:48:44,351
How dare you tell Mom what to do, Uncle?

702
00:48:45,981 --> 00:48:48,821
How much did you invest that you're butting in?

703
00:48:48,821 --> 00:48:52,641
How much did you invest? Dad, sell my stocks and pay him that money.

704
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:53,751
Oh, my.

705
00:48:53,751 --> 00:48:58,101
Gong Ma Ri. How dare you talk to Uncle like that?

706
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:02,301
Uncle, don't meddle with my mom's business and focus on your job.

707
00:49:02,301 --> 00:49:04,811
Should I name all of your failed businesses?

708
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:07,681
The condos in Vietnam, Myanmar, and Lemon Construction.

709
00:49:07,681 --> 00:49:11,341
- You thought I didn't know, right? 
 - My gosh, Ma Ri.

710
00:49:11,341 --> 00:49:16,921
Ma Ri, your mom has no experience, but she's trying to run a production company.

711
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:20,051
Uncle was saying that out of concern.

712
00:49:20,601 --> 00:49:22,581
Don't worry, Great Aunt.

713
00:49:22,581 --> 00:49:25,811
Pil Sung will become a huge director.

714
00:49:25,811 --> 00:49:28,941
My mom will never fail.

715
00:49:34,291 --> 00:49:36,701
   

716
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:42,751
Here. You can sign here.

717
00:49:42,751 --> 00:49:44,321
Okay.

718
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:57,371
Director Go, I look forward to working with you.

719
00:49:57,371 --> 00:50:00,341
Yes, likewise.

720
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:02,221
Let's make this work.

721
00:50:02,221 --> 00:50:05,111
Yes. I'll do my best.

722
00:50:13,841 --> 00:50:15,701
What's this?

723
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:19,031
Looks like a bankbook. Is there money in it?

724
00:50:19,031 --> 00:50:22,051
Gosh, did you already receive the contract fee?

725
00:50:22,051 --> 00:50:23,711
Yes.

726
00:50:24,511 --> 00:50:27,701
Pil Sung, why would you give this to me?

727
00:50:27,701 --> 00:50:30,511
It's your money. You should manage it.

728
00:50:30,511 --> 00:50:35,201
Mom, pay off the loan with this first.

729
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:37,241
And Dad, you wanted to start a business.

730
00:50:37,241 --> 00:50:39,441
Do whatever you want to do with it.

731
00:50:40,061 --> 00:50:44,271
Gosh, n-no! We can't accept this money.

732
00:50:44,271 --> 00:50:49,351
You've been working hard to pay off the loan all this time.

733
00:50:49,351 --> 00:50:55,011
Keep this with you and use it when you move out or get married.

734
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:59,021
Seon Yeong, he wants to do his duty as a son.

735
00:50:59,021 --> 00:51:01,681
Why stop him?

736
00:51:01,681 --> 00:51:04,251
Pil Sung, thank you.

737
00:51:04,251 --> 00:51:06,951
You're surely a good son.

738
00:51:06,951 --> 00:51:10,131
You're willing to give this much to your father.

739
00:51:10,131 --> 00:51:14,171
Pil Sung, it was worth raising you all this time.

740
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:16,531
Gosh, no, Mother.

741
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:20,371
Pil Sung, this isn't free money.

742
00:51:20,371 --> 00:51:23,091
You need to prove your worth with your work.

743
00:51:23,091 --> 00:51:25,211
So, you should manage it.

744
00:51:25,211 --> 00:51:30,051
Mom, I'm not giving you all of it. I set some aside already.

745
00:51:30,051 --> 00:51:31,991
So don't worry.

746
00:51:31,991 --> 00:51:34,721
And I'll make even more money going forward.

747
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:36,921
So, it's okay.

748
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:41,581
And you've gone through a lot raising me all this time.

749
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:43,901
This is the least I can do.

750
00:51:48,381 --> 00:51:50,401
Pil Sung.

751
00:51:50,401 --> 00:51:52,741
Gosh, seriously.

752
00:51:52,741 --> 00:51:56,031
Yes. Yes, Pil Sung.

753
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,951
Thank you so much.

754
00:51:57,951 --> 00:52:01,481
You did a great thing. Thank you, Pil Sung.

755
00:52:04,551 --> 00:52:06,441
My goodness...

756
00:52:44,651 --> 00:52:47,471
Aren't you Myeong Dong's boyfriend?

757
00:52:48,221 --> 00:52:50,961
I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else.

758
00:52:50,961 --> 00:52:52,731
I'm sorry.

759
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:04,141
What's going on? I felt this way last time, too.

760
00:53:10,571 --> 00:53:13,231
 And she's not a country bumpkin. She's Kim Ji Yeong. 

761
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,681
 She's my first actor. 

762
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:19,781
I mean, seriously...

763
00:53:19,781 --> 00:53:24,651
How did Jae Dong recognize a gem like her?

764
00:53:25,691 --> 00:53:31,721
I suppose he did develop an eye for talent while working as Do Ra's manager.

765
00:53:32,681 --> 00:53:34,771
Do Sik, you came.

766
00:53:35,451 --> 00:53:39,241
Mom, Mom, Mom, I saw Do Ra while I was working today.

767
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:41,261
What? You saw what?

768
00:53:41,261 --> 00:53:42,691
I swear it was Do Ra.

769
00:53:42,691 --> 00:53:45,381
I followed her and stopped her,

770
00:53:46,191 --> 00:53:50,431
but it wasn't her. She was a tenant at Director Go's house.

771
00:53:51,491 --> 00:53:53,111
Seriously.

772
00:53:53,111 --> 00:53:54,751
Get it together!

773
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:57,411
How could you compare that country bumpkin to Do Ra?

774
00:53:57,411 --> 00:53:59,191
It's really uncanny, I'm telling you.

775
00:53:59,191 --> 00:54:02,681
This is the second time I thought she was Do Ra.

776
00:54:02,681 --> 00:54:06,511
No matter how much I think, she's too similar to Do Ra.

777
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:16,611
Did you secretly abandon Do Ra's twin by chance?

778
00:54:16,611 --> 00:54:18,861
You crazy bastard. How could you say that?

779
00:54:18,861 --> 00:54:24,401
Hey. No matter how tough things got, I don't abandon my babies.

780
00:54:24,401 --> 00:54:26,781
Did Dad have a baby somewhere?

781
00:54:26,781 --> 00:54:28,841
You're out of your mind. Seriously.

782
00:54:28,841 --> 00:54:30,791
My head hurts! Go take a shower!

783
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:33,021
Let's have dinner. Seriously.

784
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:36,071
- Right? 
 - Geez, listen to you.

785
00:54:36,071 --> 00:54:38,321
Why is he always like that?

786
00:54:38,321 --> 00:54:40,651
- Go take a shower! 
 - All right.

787
00:54:40,651 --> 00:54:43,211
Gosh, my head hurts.

788
00:54:48,611 --> 00:54:54,451
Yes, that country bumpkin does resemble Do Ra a bit.

789
00:54:54,451 --> 00:54:57,911
I felt weird whenever I saw her, too.

790
00:54:57,911 --> 00:55:01,651
There are many similar-looking people in the world.

791
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:09,491
My goodness... It'd be so nice if Do Ra came back to life.

792
00:55:09,491 --> 00:55:13,271
We wouldn't be living like beggars, then.

793
00:55:13,271 --> 00:55:15,381
Right, Do Ra?

794
00:55:27,661 --> 00:55:30,631
Seriously. What took you so long?

795
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:33,471
I signed a contract today. It's a great day.

796
00:55:33,471 --> 00:55:36,641
What should we do today? Tell me anything.

797
00:55:36,641 --> 00:55:38,931
People might see us.

798
00:55:38,931 --> 00:55:41,271
You can't do this near the house.

799
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,861
My gosh. So what if someone sees us?

800
00:55:43,861 --> 00:55:45,251
We're dating.

801
00:55:45,251 --> 00:55:46,851
Seriously.

802
00:55:46,851 --> 00:55:52,151
Your mother and the rest of the family are still furious because of President Gong's mother.

803
00:55:52,151 --> 00:55:54,521
They get angry whenever they see us together.

804
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:58,351
That'd give both of us a hard time, then.

805
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:03,031
Time will take care of everything.

806
00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:05,951
Hang in there a bit, Ji Yeong.

807
00:56:05,951 --> 00:56:09,101
Don't worry about stuff like that today. What would you like to do?

808
00:56:09,101 --> 00:56:12,981
Tell me everything, I said. I can do anything for you.

809
00:56:15,951 --> 00:56:19,071
Well, there was something...

810
00:56:19,071 --> 00:56:24,631
I've always wanted to do when I got a boyfriend.

811
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,391
What is it?

812
00:56:27,451 --> 00:56:29,701
Follow me for now.

813
00:56:29,701 --> 00:56:32,661
- Where are we going? 
 - You'll see when we get there.

814
00:56:32,661 --> 00:56:36,101
Ji Yeong, we need to hold hands.

815
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,931
Goodness...

816
00:56:46,851 --> 00:56:49,381
â™«  I love you  â™«

817
00:56:50,931 --> 00:56:53,431
Is this what you've wanted to do?

818
00:56:53,431 --> 00:56:57,861
Yes. It was the first thing I wanted to do with a boyfriend.

819
00:56:59,971 --> 00:57:01,351
Why?

820
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:02,901
Do you not like it?

821
00:57:02,901 --> 00:57:05,091
Is it childish?

822
00:57:05,091 --> 00:57:07,681
You just thought it was childish, didn't you?

823
00:57:07,681 --> 00:57:10,261
No, not at all.

824
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:13,471
I like anything you like, Ji Yeong.

825
00:57:13,971 --> 00:57:15,780
Really?

826
00:57:16,321 --> 00:57:18,031
Really.

827
00:57:21,631 --> 00:57:24,491
We locked our hearts with this lock.

828
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:28,991
Our love will last unless the lock comes loose, okay?

829
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:31,541
You can never change, okay?

830
00:57:32,821 --> 00:57:35,461
We'll never change now.

831
00:57:39,441 --> 00:57:42,801
This represents our love, right?

832
00:57:42,801 --> 00:57:46,511
   

833
00:57:48,091 --> 00:57:53,441
â™«  I call for you again  â™«

834
00:57:53,441 --> 00:57:55,771
â™«  My love  â™«

835
00:57:55,771 --> 00:58:02,311
â™«  I say, "I love you," but you can't hear it  â™«

836
00:58:02,311 --> 00:58:04,601
â™«  "It's okay"  â™«

837
00:58:04,601 --> 00:58:11,491
â™«  Those words are sadly lies  â™«

838
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:21,301
â™«  I try to force a smile, but we can't help but cry  â™«

839
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:26,411
   

840
00:58:26,411 --> 00:58:32,001
   

841
00:58:33,391 --> 00:58:38,291
Aunt, what's suddenly gotten into Soo Yeon?

842
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:40,341
What is all this?

843
00:58:40,341 --> 00:58:41,921
Same with Chairman Gong.

844
00:58:41,921 --> 00:58:46,021
He freaked out when Jin Dan wanted to invest in a drama.

845
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:50,651
But he started a production company for his wife, who had no experience.

846
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:53,751
I know he's under his wife's thumb, but still.

847
00:58:53,751 --> 00:58:57,281
What's Jin Taek thinking, anyway?

848
00:58:57,281 --> 00:58:59,771
It's obvious it'd be a failure.

849
00:58:59,771 --> 00:59:04,241
It won't even last a year. It'd just be a waste of money.

850
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:07,691
I know. He should just give me that money.

851
00:59:09,241 --> 00:59:15,531
Thank you so much for making time to join me here today.

852
00:59:15,531 --> 00:59:18,811
I might not have business experience,

853
00:59:18,811 --> 00:59:24,021
but I've always wanted to tell great stories.

854
00:59:24,021 --> 00:59:29,741
So, I mustered up the courage to get started instead of pushing it back.

855
00:59:29,741 --> 00:59:35,551
For Go Go Entertainment to bring happiness, hope, and joy

856
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:42,201
to lots of people with great storytelling, I need your support.

857
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:45,521
I'll do my best to discover good writers, directors,

858
00:59:45,521 --> 00:59:50,931
and stories going forward.

859
00:59:51,871 --> 00:59:53,761
Thank you.

860
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:08,531
Here's Go Go Entertainment's first director.

861
01:00:08,531 --> 01:00:12,311
Director Go Pil Sung, please share a few words.

862
01:00:19,511 --> 01:00:23,191
Hello, I'm Director Go Pil Sung.

863
01:00:23,191 --> 01:00:30,491
I'll return the favor to Go Go Entertainment with great projects.

864
01:00:30,491 --> 01:00:32,681
I appreciate your support.

865
01:00:32,681 --> 01:00:35,801
I'll work hard and do a great job.

866
01:00:35,801 --> 01:00:37,811
Thank you!

867
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:49,080


868
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:54,270
   

869
01:00:54,270 --> 01:01:00,611
Thank you so much for coming to celebrate with us today.

870
01:01:00,611 --> 01:01:06,671
I hope Go Go Entertainment becomes a huge success.

871
01:01:06,671 --> 01:01:12,331
Hoping it'll become the best entertainment company to lead

872
01:01:12,331 --> 01:01:15,991
K-contents, we'll raise our glasses.

873
01:01:17,671 --> 01:01:23,291
- For Go Go Entertainment's success! 
  - Cheers! 

874
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:25,711
- Congratulations. 
 - Congratulations.

875
01:01:27,271 --> 01:01:29,541
Thank you.

876
01:01:33,651 --> 01:01:36,201
- It's Pil Sung. 
 - Director Go.

877
01:01:36,201 --> 01:01:37,921
We're in your care.

878
01:01:37,921 --> 01:01:40,741
- Thank you. 
 - Congratulations.

879
01:01:40,741 --> 01:01:42,611
Pil Sung Oppa, clank glasses with me, too.

880
01:01:42,611 --> 01:01:45,131
Yes, Ma Ri. Cheers.

881
01:01:45,131 --> 01:01:49,151
I'm so happy that you joined my mom's company.

882
01:01:49,151 --> 01:01:52,951
I'm happy that you're happy, too. Thank you.

883
01:01:53,651 --> 01:01:55,961
Ma Ri, what's your favorite genre?

884
01:01:55,961 --> 01:01:59,221
Seon Yeong. Hello.

885
01:01:59,221 --> 01:02:02,041
She'll be marrying Jin Dan soon.

886
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:06,251
Pil Sung should also meet a nice woman and get married soon.

887
01:02:06,251 --> 01:02:08,411
I'm sure he will when the time comes.

888
01:02:08,411 --> 01:02:11,091
Let me know when the date is set.

889
01:02:11,091 --> 01:02:13,741
She's so nice and pretty.

890
01:02:13,741 --> 01:02:16,881
You must be happy to have a nice daughter-in-law like her.

891
01:02:16,881 --> 01:02:19,321
Yes. Have a pleasant time, then.

892
01:02:19,321 --> 01:02:21,771
- Let's go, Tae Hee. 
 - Take care.

893
01:02:25,111 --> 01:02:30,131
Why was her son so into our tenant when he had

894
01:02:30,131 --> 01:02:33,731
such a pretty and elegant woman like her?

895
01:02:33,731 --> 01:02:37,531
Aigoo, seriously. How mysterious.

896
01:02:37,531 --> 01:02:40,791
That's enough. Someone might hear you.

897
01:02:50,531 --> 01:02:52,231
Director Go,

898
01:02:52,731 --> 01:02:55,311
I heard you're dating Ji Yeong.

899
01:02:55,311 --> 01:02:57,551
I found out just recently.

900
01:03:02,781 --> 01:03:07,351
You have no manners. You're ignoring my question.

901
01:03:09,551 --> 01:03:14,571
I don't think we're friendly enough to discuss personal matters here.

902
01:03:14,571 --> 01:03:16,111
Well, then.

903
01:03:16,871 --> 01:03:18,571
Yes.

904
01:03:18,571 --> 01:03:22,681
You can just have Ji Yeong.

905
01:03:22,681 --> 01:03:30,271
To be honest, I tried playing with the country bumpkin since she's funny and unusual.

906
01:03:31,681 --> 01:03:34,391
But I got bored.

907
01:03:38,961 --> 01:03:41,851
It looked like you came with your fiancee.

908
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:46,631
Aren't you disrespecting her by saying all this?

909
01:03:47,221 --> 01:03:50,821
Are you proving that you're a piece of trash?

910
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,621
What? You bastard.

911
01:03:56,621 --> 01:04:00,191
Hey! What did you just say?

912
01:04:02,851 --> 01:04:04,291
Hey.

913
01:04:10,241 --> 01:04:12,711
You cocky bastard. What did you say?

914
01:04:12,711 --> 01:04:14,361
What did you say?

915
01:04:14,361 --> 01:04:17,361
What? Piece of trash?

916
01:04:21,411 --> 01:04:22,881
Hey.

917
01:04:23,501 --> 01:04:25,431
How dare you hit me?

918
01:04:33,941 --> 01:04:36,261
Coming onto another woman when you have a fiancee.

919
01:04:36,261 --> 01:04:38,831
That's a piece of trash. What else?

920
01:04:38,831 --> 01:04:41,621
What kind of man does that?

921
01:04:41,621 --> 01:04:46,101
Whether I date one woman or two, what do you care?

922
01:04:46,101 --> 01:04:48,781
I chose Ji Yeong first.

923
01:04:49,501 --> 01:04:52,471
You're the one who stole my woman, you bastard!

924
01:05:04,631 --> 01:05:06,751
How dare someone like you try to steal mine?

925
01:05:06,751 --> 01:05:09,361
Kim Ji Yeong is mine, you bastard!

926
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:16,111
Pil Sung!

927
01:05:16,111 --> 01:05:19,051
Don't hit my Oppa!

928
01:05:19,051 --> 01:05:20,971
- Pil Sung! 
 - Don't hit my Oppa!

929
01:05:20,971 --> 01:05:24,081
Pil Sung is my oppa!

930
01:05:25,771 --> 01:05:27,441
Stop!

931
01:05:28,261 --> 01:05:30,071
Stop!

932
01:05:31,641 --> 01:05:33,991
He's my Oppa!

933
01:05:35,271 --> 01:05:37,091
Stop hitting him!

934
01:05:37,091 --> 01:05:39,221
Let go!

935
01:05:44,831 --> 01:05:47,451
   

936
01:05:47,451 --> 01:05:51,001
â™«  Why did I fall in love?  â™«

937
01:05:51,001 --> 01:05:56,511
â™«  I shouldn't have given you my heart at all  â™«

938
01:05:56,511 --> 01:06:02,251
â™«  I've already fallen for you  â™«

939
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:08,151
â™«  I'm not able to free myself anymore  â™«

940
01:06:08,151 --> 01:06:13,651
â™«  But we're drifting apart  â™«

941
01:06:19,761 --> 01:06:21,211
 They say you can't lie about your origin. 

942
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:23,671
 This is why you're called the mistress' son. 

943
01:06:23,671 --> 01:06:26,881
 Did Pil Sung and Jin Dan fight like that over that lady? 

944
01:06:26,881 --> 01:06:29,421
 We tried to stop them, but they won't budge. 

945
01:06:29,421 --> 01:06:33,311
 You didn't work so hard to raise Pil Sung to give him to a woman like her. 

946
01:06:33,311 --> 01:06:36,771
 I thought you were a perfect fit for the character. 

947
01:06:36,771 --> 01:06:39,141
 I'd like you to play the supporting actress. 

948
01:06:39,141 --> 01:06:41,361
 I'm against casting Ms. Kim. 

949
01:06:41,361 --> 01:06:43,751
 I'm nervous to go on a business trip without you. 

950
01:06:43,751 --> 01:06:44,821
 Should I not go? 

951
01:06:44,821 --> 01:06:49,561
 Don't say anything weird to Ji Yeong while I'm gone. I'm begging you. 

952
01:06:49,561 --> 01:06:51,941
 I'm here to look for an apartment. 

953
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:55,600
â™«  Why did I fall in love?  â™«
