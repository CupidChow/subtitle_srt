1
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:49,111
Bring Do Ra back to life, you bastard!

2
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:50,571
Director!

3
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:52,721
What are you doing to the Director? 
    

4
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:54,581
Who is this crazy woman?

5
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:55,931
Stop this!

6
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,601
Ji Yeong, don't do this.

7
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:59,411
Let go of him!

8
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:01,471
- Let go! 
 - Ji Yeong!

9
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:09,531
You little...

10
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:12,661
Move!

11
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:16,031
Hey. How dare you put your hand on your elder?

12
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:19,221
You country bumpkin. Don't you even have parents, bitch!

13
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:21,211
What are you doing?

14
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:24,001
She pushed me. She pushed me, you bastard.

15
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,411
Move, you bastard.

16
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:28,351
Don't do that! Don't!

17
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:30,261
Hey! Hey!

18
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:32,781
What are you doing to my son?

19
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:35,521
How dare you grab my son by his collar?

20
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:37,921
Get out of my house right now!

21
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:41,671
- Get out! 
 - How dare you, gold digger... Get out!

22
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:43,261
- How dare you? 
 - Get out.

23
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:46,181
They ganged up on me! They did!

24
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:48,941
Go inside. Go inside.

25
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:50,801
Let go! Let go!

26
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:52,901
What's going on?

27
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:54,921
Stay here, Ji Yeong.

28
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:56,771
What?

29
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:59,031
- They all assaulted me! 
 - Get out!

30
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,531
Hey!

31
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:03,281
How dare you do this at our house?

32
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:06,291
It's not like we're friends! Why do you keep coming here?

33
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:11,011
And it looks like you need to ask my son a favor.

34
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:15,091
What makes you think you can even do that?

35
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:18,401
Did you forget what you've done to us already?

36
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:23,251
I've never seen such a shameless woman in my life.

37
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:25,231
You're the No. 1 shameless person.

38
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:27,371
How could you be so thick-skinned?

39
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:29,451
You caused my in-law's death.

40
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:31,301
How dare you frequent this place?

41
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:34,131
Honey, don't get into it. She's not worth it.

42
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:36,031
Go inside. Let's go inside.

43
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:39,441
Mom, here's the cake she brought and her purse.

44
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:43,711
Hey! Take this and shove it in your mouth!

45
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:46,391
What makes you think you can come here?

46
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:49,091
I've never seen anything so ridiculous.

47
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:51,811
Go inside. Geez!

48
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:54,251
Let's go. Go.

49
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:05,120


50
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:17,871
 Go Pil Sung, you bastard! 

51
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:20,600
 How could you do this to me? 

52
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:25,701
 My Do Ra is watching you from heaven right now! 

53
00:03:25,701 --> 00:03:30,881
 How could you? How could you do this to me? How? 

54
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:33,301
What's wrong with that lady?

55
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:36,591
She really must be crazy.

56
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,131
Ji Yeong, go inside now.

57
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:41,231
Yes, you should go inside now.

58
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:44,261
Thank you for helping Pil Sung.

59
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:45,931
Don't mention it.

60
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:50,451
How could I do nothing when he was getting attacked?

61
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:54,871
By the way, what did that woman want from you?

62
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:59,411
Did she flip out because you refused to cast her actor?

63
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:03,221
Yes, I made it clear why I said no.

64
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:06,161
Anyway, I'll go inside.

65
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:09,891
- Yes, go ahead. 
 - Go inside.

66
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:16,991
By the way, she used to look down on Pil Sung.

67
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:20,791
What right does she have to ask him a favor now?

68
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:24,911
I wouldn't want to come anywhere near here out of embarrassment.

69
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:26,731
I know.

70
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:29,791
Gosh, I really can't understand that woman.

71
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:35,791
That woman. After making her daughter die that way,

72
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:39,521
does she really want to get back into that line of work again?

73
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:45,071
What a crazy woman.

74
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:49,401
That crazy woman was Park Do Ra's mom?

75
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:54,081
 How could she beg Pil Sung to do her a favor after looking down on him so much? 

76
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:56,531
 After making her daughter die that way, 

77
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:59,761
 does she really want to get back into that line of work again? 

78
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:08,971
The Director and Park Do Ra used to like each other.

79
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:13,131
Was that crazy woman against it?

80
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:20,511
He used to be a lowly assistant director,

81
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,371
but now he's humiliating me because he became a director.

82
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:28,361
Go Pil Sung, that bastard rejected me to screw me over.

83
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,341
Because I told him not to see Do Ra back then.

84
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:33,561
So, why did you even go there?

85
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:36,551
Why? What else could I have done?

86
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:39,741
You can't get anywhere without lowering your head.

87
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:46,671
We'll have to make Do Do a star so we can make a living.

88
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:50,691
But the Director and Director Hong said they'd help me,

89
00:05:50,691 --> 00:05:54,141
but Go Pil Sung, that bastard said no.

90
00:05:54,141 --> 00:05:58,401
I'll become successful somehow and destroy him.

91
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:01,331
I'll destroy him completely!

92
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:03,861
Put this on.

93
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:07,011
- Who did that to your face? 
 - Huh?

94
00:06:10,591 --> 00:06:13,881
That country bumpkin did this to me!

95
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:16,231
Who's the country bumpkin?

96
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:20,421
I think she lives in the rental unit we used to live in.

97
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,951
I was grabbing Go Pil Sung by his collar and

98
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,441
she pulled my hands out forcefully.

99
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:30,311
Her hand was so strong.

100
00:06:30,311 --> 00:06:34,081
I think this happened when I tripped.

101
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:37,281
- Mom. 
 - Yes?

102
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:39,481
Let me tell you something seriously.

103
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:42,831
You're ruining Do Ra's reputation by doing this.

104
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:45,581
I know you wanted that role, but why go there?

105
00:06:45,581 --> 00:06:47,461
That's just not right.

106
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,771
 Hey. How dare you put your hand on your elder? 

107
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:57,151
 You country bumpkin. Don't you even have parents, bitch! 

108
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:59,341
 What are you doing? 

109
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:03,321
The mother and daughter didn't even recognize each other.

110
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:09,001
Should I tell Ji Yeong everything now?

111
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:12,941
 To be honest, 

112
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:21,001
 it's been so hard because my mom thinks of me as a money-making machine. 

113
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:26,071
 To be honest, I wanted to die because of Mom today. 

114
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:31,401
 If she were someone else, I could cut ties with her, 

115
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:33,991
 but she's my mom. 

116
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:39,541
 She's my mom. She's my mom. 

117
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,331
Yes.

118
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:46,431
Kim Ji Yeong is Kim Ji Yeong.

119
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:52,421
Ji Yeong and President Baek don't know each other.

120
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:57,191
Do Ra,

121
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,701
just keep living as Kim Ji Yeong.

122
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:04,081
Don't ever get your memory back.

123
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:10,631
Continue to live without knowing anything like you're doing now.

124
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,971
You're Kim Ji Yeong.

125
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:29,431
 You bitch! 

126
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:31,131
 How dare you grab my son by his collar? 

127
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:35,171
 Hey! Take this and shove it in your mouth! 

128
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:40,671
Hold on. Those bastards.

129
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:45,271
They're less than the dirt in my toenail. How dare they?

130
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:48,031
I'm so angry.

131
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:52,551
Hey, what are you making?

132
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:55,211
Is this spicy beef soup?

133
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:57,491
Yes. Would you like to taste it?

134
00:08:57,491 --> 00:08:59,201
Let's see.

135
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:08,581
You must've put a lot of beef in it.

136
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:13,121
The broth is so rich and spicy. I love it.

137
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:17,131
We can have some, and I wanted to share it with our tenant, too.

138
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:19,441
Yes, that's a good idea.

139
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:22,991
She's such a good person, isn't she?

140
00:09:22,991 --> 00:09:24,261
Remember yesterday?

141
00:09:24,261 --> 00:09:27,991
When that woman tried to harass Pil Sung,

142
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:30,501
she threw herself to protect him.

143
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:34,231
She didn't hesitate to protect her boss at all.

144
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:35,551
I know.

145
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:39,661
And I asked the lady at the grocery store the other day.

146
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:43,691
She apparently doesn't ride Pil Sung's car anymore.

147
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:46,701
I suppose there's nothing going on between them.

148
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:51,581
I shouldn't have blindly believed the grocery store lady.

149
00:09:51,581 --> 00:09:56,351
I feel bad that I told her off then.

150
00:09:56,351 --> 00:09:58,681
What did you tell her?

151
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:02,831
That a chaebol family wants Pil Sung.

152
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:05,141
So, she'd better not fancy him.

153
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:08,561
Mother, why did you have to say all that?

154
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:11,671
If you're warning someone, you might as well do it properly.

155
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:15,251
Bad rumors wouldn't have helped anyone.

156
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:18,151
- I suppose. 
 - That's what I mean.

157
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:28,291
 Miss, are you in there? 

158
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,541
Huh? It's the landlady.

159
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:34,121
Yes!

160
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:38,401
You haven't left for work yet.

161
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:40,211
- No. 
 - Eat this before you go.

162
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:42,601
What's all this?

163
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,471
I was so grateful that you helped last time.

164
00:10:45,471 --> 00:10:48,631
So I made you some spicy beef soup.

165
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:52,631
You didn't have to thank me. That was nothing.

166
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:55,191
I'll enjoy it, then.

167
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:58,131
Ji Yeong,

168
00:10:59,131 --> 00:11:06,341
I'm so sorry that Mother and I said all that last time.

169
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:07,951
Pardon?

170
00:11:09,381 --> 00:11:14,731
To be honest, I felt terrible after talking to you.

171
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:22,301
Thank you so much for not riding Pil Sung's car since then.

172
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:27,941
Pil Sung is everything I have.

173
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:30,081
I hope you understand.

174
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:33,311
Of course.

175
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:37,711
Don't worry. I'll continue to be careful going forward.

176
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:41,481
Thank you.

177
00:11:42,341 --> 00:11:46,901
And let me know whenever you run out of kimchi instead of asking your grandmother.

178
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:50,611
I'd be happy to make you kimchi anytime.

179
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:55,281
And let me know if you need anything living here.

180
00:11:56,281 --> 00:11:58,341
Thank you.

181
00:11:58,341 --> 00:12:00,581
I'll enjoy the food.

182
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:03,361
Thank you. Eat this before going to work, okay?

183
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:05,631
- Okay. 
 - See you.

184
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:20,491
Yes, Director and I aren't meant to be.

185
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:27,231
Absolute scoundrels.

186
00:12:27,231 --> 00:12:30,001
How dare you look down on me, Bake Mi Ja?

187
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:32,491
Take this trash.

188
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:34,051
Take this.

189
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:37,271
Take all this. Take it!

190
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:40,071
You're really crazy, aren't you?

191
00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:43,191
Hey, what are you doing to the front of the house?

192
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:47,601
How dare you country bumpkin keep interrupting me? How annoying.

193
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,441
Take this!

194
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:51,871
Where are you running to? Huh?

195
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,941
After leaving all this trash in front of their house?

196
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:59,061
- Let go! 
 - Grandmother! Landlady! Come out here!

197
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:01,881
- Let go! 
 - Where do you think you're going?

198
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,091
Gosh, you're so strong. Let go!

199
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:06,341
Seriously! Aigoo! Hey!

200
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:08,501
What's all this?

201
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:10,711
It was her.

202
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:15,431
She turned this place into a landfill!

203
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:18,071
Seriously! Let go!

204
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:22,171
You gold digger! What the hell are you doing?

205
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:23,481
I can't believe these people.

206
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:26,931
You're all beneath me. How dare you look down on me?

207
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:31,431
Go ahead and tell Go Pil Sung... that I'll never go down like this.

208
00:13:31,431 --> 00:13:33,751
Tell him not to get cheeky, okay?

209
00:13:33,751 --> 00:13:35,861
It hurts. Take this!

210
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:38,441
Hey, hey, hey! Where are you running to? Gold digger!

211
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:40,391
Mother! Mother!

212
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:42,351
Just leave her alone.

213
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:44,321
Don't engage with someone like her.

214
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:47,101
What's all this? Huh?

215
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:50,601
Ji Yeong, are you okay?

216
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:52,331
I'm okay.

217
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,831
Don't do it, Ji Yeong. Go to work now. It's okay.

218
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:57,791
No, it's okay. I'm not running late.

219
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,351
It stinks.

220
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:04,701
By the way, I've never seen such a weirdo in my life.

221
00:14:04,701 --> 00:14:06,541
   

222
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:11,291
Yes, Go Pil Sung isn't the only director at the broadcasting station.

223
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,261
I'll get back up somehow.

224
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:20,541
I'll turn Do Do into a top celebrity and... stomp on that asshole, Go Pil Sung.

225
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:26,631
Director Jeong, hello. I'm Baek Mi Ja. You remember, right?

226
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:28,601
President Baek, long time no see.

227
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:32,011
Yes. How come you haven't changed at all?

228
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:35,681
- You're just as handsome as ever. 
 - Not at all.

229
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:40,561
I should give you one since I ran into you. I started working again.

230
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:43,641
She's the actor I represent. Her name is Do Do. Isn't she pretty?

231
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:45,991
She's very charming and young.

232
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:48,931
- She's in your care, Director. 
 - Sure.

233
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:52,321
If you don't have a plan, how about we get lunch together?

234
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:54,691
I'm sorry. I'm meeting someone already.

235
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:57,861
I see. Let's grab lunch some other time, then.

236
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:00,861
- Okay. 
 - Okay, see you.

237
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:04,951
Gosh, that asshole. He was desperate to cast Do Ra,

238
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:07,451
so he frequented our house and office all the time.

239
00:15:07,451 --> 00:15:11,991
Now, he's looking down on me since Do Ra's gone. Asshole.

240
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:19,251
You.

241
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,971
- Trash ahjumma? 
 - What?

242
00:15:20,971 --> 00:15:23,321
What are you doing here now, Ahjumma?

243
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:25,251
Trash ahjumma...

244
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:27,741
Hey, where did you come from?

245
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:30,101
Who are you? Why did you follow me here?

246
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:34,921
Are you here to harass Director Go again? Is that what's going on?

247
00:15:34,921 --> 00:15:37,081
Come on, seriously.

248
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:41,051
My gosh. Do you actually work here?

249
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:43,161
I can't believe it.

250
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:46,181
Move. You're getting in the way. Let me go.

251
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:49,161
No, you can't. I'll never let you pass.

252
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:51,681
How dare you stop me right now? Get out of my way!

253
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:53,371
I can't let you pass.

254
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:57,461
You can't go anywhere near Director Go now that I saw you. Leave now.

255
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:59,591
- Leave, leave, I said. 
 - You country bumpkin. How dare you...

256
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,891
Do you want to me to teach you a lesson? Move!

257
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:04,401
I can't let you pass!

258
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:06,011
- Leave, I said! 
 - Move!

259
00:16:06,011 --> 00:16:07,871
Why is this lady so strong?

260
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:11,281
- Move! Are you out of your mind? 
 - Leave!

261
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:14,681
Come on! What are you doing right now?

262
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:16,701
Director. Director Hong.

263
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:20,711
You're a staff member who works with Director Go.

264
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:22,881
Why are you treating President Baek like that?

265
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,161
And yelling in the lobby disturbing everyone?

266
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:28,781
The thing is, this ahjumma harassed Director Go—

267
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:30,071
Hey!

268
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,911
That's not true. That's not true.

269
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,760
That's not true!

270
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:38,271
That's not true.

271
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:46,751
President Baek, I didn't know you were like that.

272
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:50,181
How could you go to Director Go's house and do that?

273
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:58,181
Of course, everything would've been fine if he had cast your actor.

274
00:16:58,181 --> 00:17:03,761
That would've proved that we care about you.

275
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:10,251
But the director gets to make the final decision.

276
00:17:10,251 --> 00:17:14,951
You must know that since you know the industry well.

277
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:18,181
President Baek Mi Ja,

278
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:24,641
you went a bit too far this time.

279
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:26,331
It's not like that, Director.

280
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:29,901
Go Pil Sung used to be intimidated by me when he was an assistant director,

281
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:33,561
but now he's looking down on me now that he got successful—

282
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:35,831
President Baek Mi Ja!

283
00:17:35,831 --> 00:17:38,291
It's not "Go Pil Sung."

284
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:43,441
He's "Director Go." Director!

285
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:48,101
Okay.

286
00:17:55,101 --> 00:17:58,541
I thought I'd never hear back.

287
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,871
Why does she suddenly want to see me now?

288
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,861
You came.

289
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:20,901
What are you doing? Is something going on?

290
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:24,481
Something good happened.

291
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:28,641
I won a screenwriting competition.

292
00:18:29,421 --> 00:18:31,151
What does that mean?

293
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:35,201
I finally became a screenwriter after suffering for 10 years.

294
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:37,351
It means I've proved myself.

295
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:41,751
Oh, have you been trying to become a screenwriter?

296
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:43,571
Yes.

297
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:49,111
I'll make money as a screenwriter and become successful now.

298
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:51,921
So, let's start seeing each other again.

299
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:55,131
I'll take care of you from now on.

300
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:59,391
- Noonim— 
 - There was only one reason we parted ways.

301
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:03,741
Because you went bankrupt, and I was a screenwriter wannabe who had nothing.

302
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:07,531
We had to break up because we had nothing.

303
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:09,471
But I became a writer now.

304
00:19:09,471 --> 00:19:11,911
I can make money.

305
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:15,591
So, we have no reason to break up anymore. Don't you think?

306
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:19,101
To be honest,

307
00:19:20,441 --> 00:19:23,081
I've been thinking about you a lot, too.

308
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:28,401
I wanted to make money, contact you,

309
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:32,621
and suggest we get back together like this.

310
00:19:32,621 --> 00:19:34,861
R-Really?

311
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:37,731
Did you really think that?

312
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:43,501
Yes, let's... try seeing each other.

313
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:46,901
I'll work two jobs or three jobs. I'll work harder.

314
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:50,391
Okay.

315
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:55,581
Let's introduce ourselves first, then.

316
00:19:55,581 --> 00:19:58,651
My name is Go Myeong Dong. I'm 40 years old.

317
00:19:58,651 --> 00:20:00,431
Myeong Dong.

318
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:04,031
I'm Park Do Sik. I'm 33 years old.

319
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:07,741
What did you say? 33?

320
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,021
What?

321
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:13,731
You're seven years younger than me.

322
00:20:14,721 --> 00:20:18,481
I'd feel too bad, then.

323
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:23,541
It won't be fair to you. Because I'm too old.

324
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,681
Unfair? What is this, a business deal?

325
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:27,881
What we're about to do is...

326
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:32,041
to be in love.

327
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:35,551
Do Sik.

328
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:41,041
You're only seven years older than me.

329
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:45,101
I can't call you "Noonim," then. Should I call you "Myeong Dong" now?

330
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:48,551
Myeong Dong... No.

331
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:52,101
I should call you "Myeong Dong." Myeong Dong.

332
00:20:54,331 --> 00:20:57,231
Gosh, whatever. Come on...

333
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:05,181
Myeong Dong, let's go.

334
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:20,332
Gosh, seriously. Geez, I never...

335
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:24,692
Aigoo, that crazy woman.

336
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:31,222
I washed my hands a lot, but I can still smell trash.

337
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:35,932
Seriously, is she really out of her mind?

338
00:21:35,932 --> 00:21:38,322
We're the ones who should be ticked off.

339
00:21:38,322 --> 00:21:40,332
We should be harassing her instead.

340
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:45,372
How dare she flip out on us instead? Gosh!

341
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:47,242
She's so coarse. So coarse.

342
00:21:47,242 --> 00:21:50,522
Seriously, she's a piece of trash.

343
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:56,732
   

344
00:21:57,662 --> 00:22:00,552
Hey, my friend, Ma Ri.

345
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,642
What made you call today?

346
00:22:02,642 --> 00:22:06,132
Grandma, I just came up with a great idea.

347
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:08,042
Would you be able to help me?

348
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:10,272
G-Great idea?

349
00:22:10,272 --> 00:22:13,150
My gosh, what could that be?

350
00:22:15,612 --> 00:22:19,582
- They must've fried it just now. 
 - Yes, it's so good. Really good.

351
00:22:19,582 --> 00:22:21,232
Enjoy. Enjoy. 
    

352
00:22:21,232 --> 00:22:25,012
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

353
00:22:26,752 --> 00:22:29,382
- Grandma. 
 - Pil Sung.

354
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:31,022
Let's go.

355
00:22:32,472 --> 00:22:34,392
Pil Sung.

356
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:38,782
Hello, Pil Sung.

357
00:22:40,632 --> 00:22:46,612
Everyone, I'm Director Go's grandma. Grandma.

358
00:22:46,612 --> 00:22:50,532
Hello. Please enjoy.

359
00:22:50,532 --> 00:22:53,982
Grandma, what's all this?

360
00:22:53,982 --> 00:22:59,322
Ma Ri bought 100 chickens to cheer you up.

361
00:22:59,322 --> 00:23:03,092
This is nothing compared to how hard you work.

362
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:05,112
You don't have to thank me.

363
00:23:05,112 --> 00:23:06,952
Everyone, have some fried chicken!

364
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,442
You're working hard. Have something to drink, too. Go ahead.

365
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:13,492
Yes, enjoy the fried chicken before it gets cold.

366
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,762
Oh, our tenant lady.

367
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:18,592
You should have some fried chicken, too. Hurry.

368
00:23:18,592 --> 00:23:20,612
You're here.

369
00:23:21,342 --> 00:23:25,102
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

370
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:28,822
Tenant lady? What does that mean?

371
00:23:28,822 --> 00:23:32,832
She's a tenant who lives in our rental unit.

372
00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:36,992
And she works with Pil Sung, too?

373
00:23:36,992 --> 00:23:38,402
Pardon?

374
00:23:39,442 --> 00:23:43,492
Well, yes. I'm the newest staff member.

375
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:51,812
Enjoy.

376
00:23:54,102 --> 00:23:56,082
Thank you.

377
00:24:04,102 --> 00:24:08,562
She lives in the same house as Pil Sung, and she works with him, too.

378
00:24:08,562 --> 00:24:11,512
I'm so jealous of her.

379
00:24:13,972 --> 00:24:15,872
Hey, the woman who brought fried chicken.

380
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,802
She was dressed in designer clothes, and she was pretty, too.

381
00:24:18,802 --> 00:24:21,162
But wasn't something off about her?

382
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:23,372
You don't know who she is, do you?

383
00:24:23,372 --> 00:24:27,040
She's the only daughter of the APP Group family.

384
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,912
She's an adult, but she's mentally a child because of an injury from her childhood.

385
00:24:30,912 --> 00:24:35,572
Really? Why did the chaebol's daughter come here?

386
00:24:35,572 --> 00:24:37,622
Didn't you see it?

387
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:42,902
She was saying, "Pil Sung, Pil Sung" and chased Director Go around.

388
00:24:42,902 --> 00:24:46,252
So, the chaebol's daughter came here because she's into him?

389
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:47,672
Yes.

390
00:24:47,672 --> 00:24:52,942
So, I asked her what her relationship was with Director Go.

391
00:24:52,942 --> 00:24:57,572
She said she likes him. That's why she brought 100 chickens.

392
00:24:57,572 --> 00:24:59,402
Gosh, daebak.

393
00:24:59,402 --> 00:25:03,272
Their families must be close since Director Go's grandma came, too.

394
00:25:03,272 --> 00:25:04,702
My gosh, my gosh.

395
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:09,532
Is the Director becoming APP Group's son-in-law, then?

396
00:25:09,532 --> 00:25:11,022
We'd better be good to him.

397
00:25:11,022 --> 00:25:12,542
I know.

398
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:14,672
What does he like?

399
00:25:18,202 --> 00:25:24,792
 Ji Yeong, a chaebol family wants Pil Sung as their son-in-law. 

400
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:33,872
She was the chaebol's daughter Grandma was talking about.

401
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:40,042
Pil Sung, thank you for the fried chicken!

402
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:41,312
Well, sure.

403
00:25:41,312 --> 00:25:45,702
No, no, no. I can't call you "Pil Sung" anymore.

404
00:25:45,702 --> 00:25:50,392
Director Go, don't forget about me even after you become APP Group's son-in-law.

405
00:25:50,392 --> 00:25:53,442
I was so nice to you when you were an assistant director.

406
00:25:53,442 --> 00:25:55,762
Will you open up a broadcasting station when you become their son-in-law?

407
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,932
What are you talking about?

408
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:00,772
She's just my mom's friend's daughter. Nothing is going on.

409
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:02,662
Come on, Director Go.

410
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:06,472
Why would she bring 100 chickens if she was just your mom's friend's daughter?

411
00:26:06,472 --> 00:26:09,682
I'm serious. She's like my younger sister, okay?

412
00:26:09,682 --> 00:26:12,382
It always starts that way, then you end up getting married.

413
00:26:12,382 --> 00:26:15,392
Anyway, I'm in your care.

414
00:26:15,392 --> 00:26:18,272
Go, Pil Sung!

415
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:22,822
Seriously, what's wrong with everyone?

416
00:26:24,272 --> 00:26:26,022
 Stand by! 

417
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:27,952
 One, two! Cue! 

418
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:30,522
 Get out of here now! 

419
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:33,112
 Cut! Okay! Nice. 

420
00:26:33,112 --> 00:26:35,482
 That was great. Good job. 

421
00:26:35,482 --> 00:26:37,822
 How much do we need? 

422
00:26:37,822 --> 00:26:42,922
So cool. So cool. He looks so cool even when he's working.

423
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:48,082
Chichi, it makes me worry.

424
00:26:48,082 --> 00:26:50,992
There are many pretty actresses

425
00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:54,202
and there are so many female staff members, too.

426
00:26:55,762 --> 00:26:59,212
What? I shouldn't worry because I'm prettier?

427
00:26:59,212 --> 00:27:03,812
Come on. Okay. You're definitely my younger sister, Chichi.

428
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:10,802
My gosh! It's Pil Sung Oppa! 
    

429
00:27:12,252 --> 00:27:16,272
Pil Sung Oppa... I mean, Pil Sung.

430
00:27:19,182 --> 00:27:22,122
Really? Right now?

431
00:27:22,122 --> 00:27:25,222
I heard Jin Dan is getting along with Ilyoo Foods' daughter.

432
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:30,672
They initially wanted to discuss things after they'd dated for a year,

433
00:27:30,672 --> 00:27:33,032
but I suppose they like Jin Dan.

434
00:27:33,032 --> 00:27:36,652
They suddenly want us to meet up.

435
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:39,852
To have an in-laws' gathering and stuff.

436
00:27:39,852 --> 00:27:45,032
You know the Ilyoo Foods family well, don't you, Aunt?

437
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:47,722
Yes, I set them up.

438
00:27:47,722 --> 00:27:51,902
Jin Dan should get married, start a family, and have children...

439
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:55,082
so I can sleep soundly.

440
00:27:55,082 --> 00:27:58,052
I've wanted to discuss his marriage...

441
00:27:59,032 --> 00:28:03,652
with you and Mother, anyway. This is good.

442
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:06,652
And there's no point in delaying it since it's Ilyoo Foods.

443
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:09,792
We should have an in-laws' gathering as they suggested.

444
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:14,552
Yes. Tell them we'd like to meet, too, then.

445
00:28:14,552 --> 00:28:16,452
Okay, Auntie.

446
00:28:16,452 --> 00:28:18,412
This is great. Congratulations.

447
00:28:18,412 --> 00:28:20,372
Thank you.

448
00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:24,892
Ma Ri, you'll get hurt. Slow down.

449
00:28:24,892 --> 00:28:27,092
Why are you in such a rush?

450
00:28:27,092 --> 00:28:29,412
Mom, how do I look? Dad, how do I look?

451
00:28:29,412 --> 00:28:32,212
Grandma, how do I look?

452
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,222
Wow, you look so pretty, Ma Ri.

453
00:28:34,222 --> 00:28:37,262
So, are you going somewhere? Are you meeting someone?

454
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:40,182
Yes, Dad. I'm meeting Pil Sung.

455
00:28:40,182 --> 00:28:42,182
He wants to see me.

456
00:28:42,182 --> 00:28:43,572
I'll be right back, then.

457
00:28:43,572 --> 00:28:47,642
- M-Ma Ri. 
 - Do Jun, get ready now. Hurry.

458
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:51,952
Wait, she's meeting Pil Sung right now?

459
00:28:51,952 --> 00:28:54,202
Honey, did you know about this?

460
00:28:54,202 --> 00:28:56,782
No. I didn't.

461
00:28:56,782 --> 00:28:58,662
 Why does Pil Sung want to see Ma Ri? 

462
00:28:58,662 --> 00:29:02,022
My gosh. If he wanted to see her first,

463
00:29:02,022 --> 00:29:04,832
does it mean he's trying to start seeing Ma Ri?

464
00:29:04,832 --> 00:29:07,192
I-Is he?

465
00:29:07,192 --> 00:29:09,382
- I really hope things work out. 
 - Gosh.

466
00:29:09,382 --> 00:29:13,122
That would be so wonderful.

467
00:29:13,122 --> 00:29:18,262
Jin Dan will marry Tae Hee and Ma Ri will marry Pil Sung.

468
00:29:18,262 --> 00:29:22,832
I'd have no worries at all, then.

469
00:29:23,552 --> 00:29:25,932
 That can never happen. 

470
00:29:31,552 --> 00:29:32,772
Ma Ri.

471
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:35,502
Yes, Pil Sung.

472
00:29:35,502 --> 00:29:39,282
Thank you so much for bringing fried chicken to the set.

473
00:29:39,282 --> 00:29:41,892
Our entire staff enjoyed it a lot.

474
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:44,522
Really? I'll bring some more next time.

475
00:29:44,522 --> 00:29:46,512
No, Ma Ri.

476
00:29:46,512 --> 00:29:49,472
I hope you don't.

477
00:29:49,472 --> 00:29:52,242
Please don't come by again.

478
00:29:52,242 --> 00:29:56,602
To be honest, I felt very uncomfortable today.

479
00:29:57,492 --> 00:30:02,442
W-Why? You said everyone enjoyed it.

480
00:30:02,442 --> 00:30:08,632
Ma Ri, I told you last time that I like someone already.

481
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:13,842
But you came to my workplace and acted like we were in a relationship.

482
00:30:13,842 --> 00:30:16,492
You can't do that.

483
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:21,322
The thing is, I didn't mean to do that.

484
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:25,412
A staff member kept asking me how I knew you

485
00:30:25,412 --> 00:30:29,252
and what kind of relationship we had.

486
00:30:30,802 --> 00:30:37,532
So, I told her that I like you.

487
00:30:37,532 --> 00:30:41,532
But I only told three people that.

488
00:30:41,532 --> 00:30:45,612
That's why I wanted to see you. So, you don't ever do that again.

489
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:51,162
If you keep doing this, I won't be able to think of you as a friend.

490
00:30:51,162 --> 00:30:55,712
No, Pil Sung. I mean, Pil Sung Oppa.

491
00:30:55,712 --> 00:30:58,132
I'll be careful from now on.

492
00:30:58,132 --> 00:31:00,602
I'll never do that again.

493
00:31:02,232 --> 00:31:05,702
I'll trust you and leave now.

494
00:31:05,702 --> 00:31:08,362
Looks like you came with your driver.

495
00:31:08,362 --> 00:31:10,262
Get home safely.

496
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:46,982
Ma Ri, what's wrong?

497
00:31:47,492 --> 00:31:53,442
Do Jun, I guess Pil Sung Oppa really hates me.

498
00:31:53,442 --> 00:31:55,562
Is that what he said?

499
00:31:55,562 --> 00:31:59,172
No. He didn't exactly say that,

500
00:31:59,172 --> 00:32:01,662
but he lied about having a girlfriend.

501
00:32:01,662 --> 00:32:05,282
He told me not to bring fried chicken to the set again.

502
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:08,382
He said he wouldn't see me again if I did.

503
00:32:08,382 --> 00:32:10,372
That means he hates me.

504
00:32:10,372 --> 00:32:15,632
Is it so bad that I brought fried chicken to the set?

505
00:32:19,452 --> 00:32:22,352
It's okay. It's okay.

506
00:32:36,912 --> 00:32:40,642
Why did you go to the broadcasting station and do all that?

507
00:32:40,642 --> 00:32:42,852
Why would you go there?

508
00:32:42,852 --> 00:32:45,672
Why don't you listen to me?

509
00:32:46,602 --> 00:32:50,462
Did Do Jun tell you that? That I went to the broadcasting station?

510
00:32:50,462 --> 00:32:52,922
I won't forgive you, Park Do Jun.

511
00:32:55,622 --> 00:32:57,412
Get up. Get up.

512
00:32:57,412 --> 00:33:00,622
Why do you bother so many people?

513
00:33:00,622 --> 00:33:03,072
Pil Sung says he doesn't like you.

514
00:33:03,072 --> 00:33:06,422
It's rude to do that when the other person doesn't want it.

515
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:08,672
It's considered harassment.

516
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:13,742
Honey, why would you say that? Harassment?

517
00:33:14,462 --> 00:33:16,082
Am I wrong?

518
00:33:16,082 --> 00:33:20,152
Continuing to pursue someone against their will is harassment.

519
00:33:20,152 --> 00:33:23,322
Ma Ri needs to know these things, too.

520
00:33:24,022 --> 00:33:30,372
Gong Ma Ri, that's a very bad thing to do. You know that?

521
00:33:32,452 --> 00:33:33,972
Honey.

522
00:33:46,462 --> 00:33:50,632
Ma Ri, I'm sorry.

523
00:33:52,252 --> 00:33:54,032
I hope...

524
00:33:54,862 --> 00:33:59,022
you stop liking Pil Sung, Ma Ri.

525
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:03,302
I don't want to see you...

526
00:34:04,692 --> 00:34:07,132
getting hurt anymore.

527
00:34:08,142 --> 00:34:11,472
I don't know. I want you to leave, too.

528
00:34:26,592 --> 00:34:27,932
Who's knocking?

529
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,682
Yes, come on in.

530
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:36,202
Grandma.

531
00:34:36,202 --> 00:34:40,552
Oh, hey. You came, Pil Sung.

532
00:34:43,712 --> 00:34:48,062
Grandma... why did you do that today?

533
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:52,362
You shouldn't have brought Ma Ri to my workplace.

534
00:34:53,102 --> 00:34:56,052
Do you know how difficult my position is at work now?

535
00:34:56,052 --> 00:35:01,072
Everyone thinks I'm dating Ma Ri and getting married.

536
00:35:01,072 --> 00:35:04,572
Oh, really, Pil Sung?

537
00:35:04,572 --> 00:35:09,112
By the way, isn't that a good rumor?

538
00:35:09,112 --> 00:35:12,142
Not everyone gets to become APP Group's son-in-law.

539
00:35:12,142 --> 00:35:15,822
And even if you don't marry Ma Ri,

540
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:19,342
rumors like that make you look good.

541
00:35:19,342 --> 00:35:22,582
It'd make your value go up.

542
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:29,002
Grandma, what are you talking about right now?

543
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,042
I beg you.

544
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:34,962
Please don't do stuff like that from now on.

545
00:35:39,852 --> 00:35:44,442
Mother! Why did you take Ma Ri to Pil Sung;s workplace?

546
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,502
What would people think of Pil Sung by you doing that?

547
00:35:47,502 --> 00:35:51,212
Mother, what were you thinking?

548
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:54,182
Look, we brought not just 10 chickens,

549
00:35:54,182 --> 00:35:58,392
but 100 chickens to his work to make him look good.

550
00:35:58,392 --> 00:36:00,472
You should be thanking me.

551
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:02,632
Both you and Pil Sung...

552
00:36:02,632 --> 00:36:05,562
Why are you two doing this to me?

553
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:10,222
Mother, please stop toying with Ma Ri.

554
00:36:10,222 --> 00:36:12,792
She's mentally ill.

555
00:36:12,792 --> 00:36:14,982
You really can't do that.

556
00:36:14,982 --> 00:36:17,052
Gosh, gosh.

557
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:20,182
My goodness! I can't believe this.

558
00:36:20,182 --> 00:36:23,512
What did she say to me just now?

559
00:36:23,512 --> 00:36:28,522
What? Is she accusing me of toying with Ma Ri?

560
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:33,159
Hey, hey, hey! Ma Ri is my friend! My friend!

561
00:36:35,377 --> 00:36:38,567
Why did you want to see me so late?

562
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:41,567
Ji Yeong, have you had dinner?

563
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,387
Of course, I have.

564
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:45,787
The fried chicken your chaebol girlfriend brought.

565
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:49,127
I brought the leftovers and had that for dinner.

566
00:36:49,127 --> 00:36:50,877
I didn't have to buy dinner, thanks to you.

567
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:53,597
Girlfriend? She's not my girlfriend. It's not like that at all.

568
00:36:53,597 --> 00:36:55,187
So, don't get the wrong idea, okay?

569
00:36:55,187 --> 00:36:57,917
If there's nothing going on and she's not your girlfriend,

570
00:36:57,917 --> 00:37:00,337
why would she buy us 100 chickens?

571
00:37:00,337 --> 00:37:03,057
How does that make sense?

572
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:04,847
Ji Yeong, listen to me carefully.

573
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,817
My mom has a best friend. Her name is Soo Yeon.

574
00:37:07,817 --> 00:37:10,257
Ma Ri is that lady's daughter.

575
00:37:10,257 --> 00:37:12,787
My mom's friend's daughter.

576
00:37:12,787 --> 00:37:15,117
That ahjumma cared for me ever since I was a kid.

577
00:37:15,117 --> 00:37:18,237
That's why I try to take good care of Ma Ri, too.

578
00:37:19,097 --> 00:37:20,907
Anyway, so—

579
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:24,827
Director, why are you making excuses like that with me?

580
00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:27,127
There's nothing going on between you and me.

581
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:31,507
I'll go in if you want to spew all this nonsense.

582
00:37:33,297 --> 00:37:38,597
I'd like it, too, if you became a chaebol son-in-law, Oppa.

583
00:37:38,597 --> 00:37:42,027
Ji Yeong, it's not like that, I said. Please believe me.

584
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,997
Fine.

585
00:37:52,747 --> 00:37:55,287
You bitch. They say the enemies reunite on a log bridge.

586
00:37:55,287 --> 00:37:59,257
You country bumpkin bitch. I'm glad I ran into you!

587
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,747
What are you doing, lady?

588
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:06,417
You little. How dare you get involved and humiliate me like that?

589
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:10,057
I can't show my face at the broadcasting station because of you, bitch!

590
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:11,837
Let go of me!

591
00:38:11,837 --> 00:38:14,037
Let go!

592
00:38:14,037 --> 00:38:16,767
Why are you so strong? Geez...

593
00:38:16,767 --> 00:38:19,627
- President Baek. 
 - How dare you do this to me?

594
00:38:19,627 --> 00:38:22,947
What makes you think you can pull my hair out?

595
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:24,747
Don't you dare touch me again.

596
00:38:24,747 --> 00:38:27,567
I won't hold myself back!

597
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:29,187
- You'd better watch out. 
 - Gosh.

598
00:38:29,187 --> 00:38:30,767
You got that?

599
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:33,767
You bitch. You arrogant bitch!

600
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:38,007
President Baek, who's that woman? What's going on?

601
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:43,147
Do Do, you don't need to know who she is. Don't you deal with her.

602
00:38:43,147 --> 00:38:48,207
You'd hurt your pretty face if you got into a fight with her.

603
00:38:48,207 --> 00:38:50,887
Pay no attention to her at all. Okay?

604
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:53,687
Ignorant bitch.

605
00:38:56,987 --> 00:38:58,627
Dear God,

606
00:38:59,997 --> 00:39:03,187
why did you save me?

607
00:39:03,947 --> 00:39:06,537
What does this mean?

608
00:39:06,537 --> 00:39:09,267
Please show me what your will is.

609
00:39:17,627 --> 00:39:20,807
God saved me.

610
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:26,287
I really was chosen. I was chosen.

611
00:39:27,427 --> 00:39:30,777
That's why I matter more than those parasites.

612
00:39:30,777 --> 00:39:32,687
Yes, I matter more!

613
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:35,007
I matter more!

614
00:39:40,627 --> 00:39:43,277
The country bumpkin isn't too bad.

615
00:39:47,397 --> 00:39:51,417
I feel like I've seen her somewhere before.

616
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:55,767
Where have I seen her?

617
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:59,687
Jae Dong, I misheard you, didn't I?

618
00:39:59,687 --> 00:40:02,027
You want to do what?

619
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:06,057
Ji Yeong, I joined the entertainment industry with nothing

620
00:40:06,057 --> 00:40:08,917
and I worked here for 10 years going through all sorts of things.

621
00:40:08,917 --> 00:40:13,227
I want to start my company and do things properly now.

622
00:40:13,227 --> 00:40:15,987
My contract ends with Bi Bi this week.

623
00:40:15,987 --> 00:40:19,957
Could you become the first actor for my company?

624
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:24,497
Jae Dong, don't joke about stuff like that.

625
00:40:24,497 --> 00:40:27,717
I started attending acting school only two weeks ago.

626
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,867
I really know nothing.

627
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:32,637
How could I sign a contract with you?

628
00:40:32,637 --> 00:40:38,847
Ji Yeong, I've seen countless people, including new actors and A-list actors.

629
00:40:38,847 --> 00:40:43,667
Whenever I thought someone will make it big, they became successful 99% of the time.

630
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:47,037
A light bulb went off when I saw you acting.

631
00:40:47,037 --> 00:40:49,457
You really have what it takes.

632
00:40:49,457 --> 00:40:54,057
So, sign a contract with me. I'll support you as hard as I can.

633
00:40:54,057 --> 00:40:56,957
This makes no sense at all.

634
00:40:58,067 --> 00:40:59,847
How about this?

635
00:40:59,847 --> 00:41:04,307
Let's make it less risky for both of us and split 50-50.

636
00:41:04,307 --> 00:41:06,327
50-50?

637
00:41:08,187 --> 00:41:10,867
How could I take so much?

638
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:13,987
You can take 90. I'll take 10.

639
00:41:13,987 --> 00:41:15,967
Ji Yeong, you'd be in big trouble!

640
00:41:15,967 --> 00:41:19,257
A contract like that should never exist.

641
00:41:19,257 --> 00:41:24,547
Even if you don't sign with me, you can never split it 90-10 with anyone, okay?

642
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:27,137
Don't be like that and sign with me.

643
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:30,037
But I really don't know anything.

644
00:41:30,037 --> 00:41:32,407
It's my first time running my company, too.

645
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:36,207
Let's go for it together.

646
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:39,637
Yes.

647
00:41:39,637 --> 00:41:41,857
Well, okay.

648
00:41:41,857 --> 00:41:44,517
Let's go for it.

649
00:41:44,517 --> 00:41:47,537
You're my first actor at my company, okay?

650
00:41:47,537 --> 00:41:49,637
Fine.

651
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:51,647
Okay!

652
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:56,097
Jae Dong, it's such an honor.

653
00:41:56,097 --> 00:42:00,617
Thank you for thinking so highly of me.

654
00:42:00,617 --> 00:42:03,687
I should be thanking you.

655
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,027
Jae Dong and Ji Yeong.

656
00:42:06,027 --> 00:42:08,827
What are you doing at this sacred station?

657
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:10,237
Why are you hugging?

658
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:12,257
Director.

659
00:42:13,857 --> 00:42:15,427
Here.

660
00:42:18,047 --> 00:42:20,147
- Popcorn Entertainment? 
 - Yes. 
    

661
00:42:20,147 --> 00:42:22,587
It's a company I started.

662
00:42:22,587 --> 00:42:25,367
Let me introduce her properly.

663
00:42:25,367 --> 00:42:27,837
Kim Ji Yeong, the first actor of Popcorn Entertainment.

664
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:29,717
We're in your care!

665
00:42:31,457 --> 00:42:33,520
We're in your care.

666
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,380
   

667
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:41,237
Why would you act, Ji Yeong?

668
00:42:41,237 --> 00:42:43,507
You want to be an actor now?

669
00:42:43,507 --> 00:42:45,427
What's wrong with you?

670
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:48,287
Why are you doing this?

671
00:42:48,287 --> 00:42:50,957
I can act, sing, or dance if I want to.

672
00:42:50,957 --> 00:42:53,577
How is that any of your business?

673
00:42:53,577 --> 00:42:58,707
Ji Yeong, looks like you got into acting just because you played a small role.

674
00:42:58,707 --> 00:43:02,357
Not just anyone can act.

675
00:43:02,357 --> 00:43:05,237
You'd better not become an actor, okay?

676
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:10,777
You're looking down on me right now, aren't you?

677
00:43:10,777 --> 00:43:13,207
An uneducated country bumpkin wants to become an actor.

678
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:17,057
You think that's stupid and looking down on me, aren't you?

679
00:43:17,057 --> 00:43:20,837
No, I'm not looking down on you.

680
00:43:20,837 --> 00:43:26,987
Ji Yeong, life as an actor is so treacherous and dangerous.

681
00:43:26,987 --> 00:43:29,827
I'm worried about you. That's why.

682
00:43:29,827 --> 00:43:32,927
Having a career as a public figure is so hard.

683
00:43:32,927 --> 00:43:36,387
You have no idea how hard that is.

684
00:43:36,387 --> 00:43:38,867
Even if you do something that's normally accepted,

685
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:43,057
the whole world criticizes you just because you're a famous actor.

686
00:43:43,057 --> 00:43:45,757
Why would you choose such a difficult life?

687
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:49,147
Study something else. I'll help you.

688
00:43:49,147 --> 00:43:53,737
Director, I'll decide how I want to live.

689
00:43:53,737 --> 00:43:56,657
I'm so happy when I act.

690
00:43:56,657 --> 00:44:00,777
I'm so happy that it almost feels wrong.

691
00:44:00,777 --> 00:44:04,197
So, don't tell me what to do anymore.

692
00:44:04,197 --> 00:44:05,847
I...

693
00:44:08,107 --> 00:44:10,727
want you to live positively

694
00:44:11,687 --> 00:44:13,477
and happily...

695
00:44:14,647 --> 00:44:17,627
without any worries. That's why.

696
00:44:21,097 --> 00:44:25,187
I finally found my calling.

697
00:44:25,187 --> 00:44:30,607
I doubt I can live positively and happily if I don't act.

698
00:44:30,607 --> 00:44:34,987
I need to act so I can live positively and happily.

699
00:44:34,987 --> 00:44:36,867
Do you understand?

700
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:40,377
Fine, then.

701
00:44:42,227 --> 00:44:45,727
I'll explain more over dinner.

702
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:48,037
Let's talk about it.

703
00:44:48,037 --> 00:44:51,907
Have dinner with your chaebol girlfriend.

704
00:44:51,907 --> 00:44:54,297
I have a plan.

705
00:44:54,297 --> 00:44:57,527
How many times did I say it's not like that? It's not like that!

706
00:44:57,527 --> 00:44:59,377
What's he saying?

707
00:45:01,037 --> 00:45:03,857
Geez, I'm about to go crazy.

708
00:45:06,327 --> 00:45:09,557
President Gong, since you bought me another meal,

709
00:45:09,557 --> 00:45:13,147
we only have one more meal left, okay?

710
00:45:13,147 --> 00:45:18,787
Ji Yeong, do you want to stop having dinners with me?

711
00:45:18,787 --> 00:45:21,637
Gosh, I'm disappointed.

712
00:45:21,637 --> 00:45:25,677
No, no. It's not that.

713
00:45:25,677 --> 00:45:28,857
I need to compensate you for your jacket soon.

714
00:45:28,857 --> 00:45:33,857
I could relax if I paid off my debt quickly.

715
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:38,217
We only have one more dinner together now.

716
00:45:38,217 --> 00:45:42,507
Haven't you decided if you want to date me yet?

717
00:45:42,507 --> 00:45:46,077
I want you to become my girlfriend quickly.

718
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:48,517
Oh, that?

719
00:45:49,367 --> 00:45:51,747
 Should I just tell him now since we're talking? 

720
00:45:51,747 --> 00:45:54,197
 That I can't be his girlfriend? 

721
00:45:54,197 --> 00:45:56,037
 No, no. 

722
00:45:56,037 --> 00:45:58,387
 I need to see him one more time. 

723
00:45:58,387 --> 00:46:01,627
 How could I face him next time after saying that? 

724
00:46:01,627 --> 00:46:06,567
 Yes, I should tell him when I buy dinner for the last time. 

725
00:46:06,567 --> 00:46:08,437
 Over the last dinner. 

726
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:13,767
By chance, are you still thinking about it?

727
00:46:13,767 --> 00:46:16,437
Anyway, we have another dinner left.

728
00:46:16,437 --> 00:46:20,467
I'll think more and tell you then.

729
00:46:20,467 --> 00:46:23,207
Well, okay.

730
00:46:23,207 --> 00:46:25,637
I promised not to rush you.

731
00:46:25,637 --> 00:46:30,447
Anyway, Ji Yeong, do you want to get fresh air in Chuncheon?

732
00:46:30,447 --> 00:46:33,847
We'll have dakgalbi*, too. I'll buy you dakgalbi. 
  (Spicy stir-fried chicken) 

733
00:46:33,847 --> 00:46:35,827
Tomorrow?

734
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:37,927
I can't tomorrow because it's the weekend.

735
00:46:37,927 --> 00:46:40,857
I go to acting school on weekends.

736
00:46:40,857 --> 00:46:43,937
You go to acting school?

737
00:46:43,937 --> 00:46:47,577
Yes. I got to play a small role by chance.

738
00:46:47,577 --> 00:46:50,897
And it was so fun. That's why I'm learning.

739
00:46:50,897 --> 00:46:54,127
I want to become an actor someday.

740
00:46:55,147 --> 00:46:57,407
I'm way over my head, huh?

741
00:46:57,407 --> 00:47:00,667
Way over your head? What are you talking about?

742
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:05,637
You need to do what you want to do to be happy.

743
00:47:05,637 --> 00:47:08,767
Do you really think so?

744
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:10,417
Of course.

745
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:16,417
Ji Yeong, let me know if you need help with your acting studies.

746
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,667
I can help you with anything.

747
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:23,327
I'm so grateful for even saying that.

748
00:47:24,567 --> 00:47:27,867
 Ji Yeong wants to become an actor like Park Do Ra? 

749
00:47:27,867 --> 00:47:30,167
 Is this a coincidence? 

750
00:47:30,167 --> 00:47:34,327
 Or is this my new destiny? 

751
00:47:52,907 --> 00:47:54,507
   

752
00:47:59,617 --> 00:48:02,397
 It's been so hard. 

753
00:48:02,397 --> 00:48:04,257
 Of course, it's because of money. 

754
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:06,427
 What can silly love do for me? 

755
00:48:06,427 --> 00:48:07,937
   

756
00:48:07,937 --> 00:48:10,317
   

757
00:48:17,737 --> 00:48:20,017
Ji Yeong can't become an actor.

758
00:48:20,827 --> 00:48:22,977
She can do anything else,

759
00:48:23,997 --> 00:48:26,467
but she can never become an actor.

760
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,317
Ji Yeong.

761
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:44,847
What is it?

762
00:48:44,847 --> 00:48:49,027
Ji Yeong, I'm begging you right now.

763
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:53,087
Please don't get into acting.

764
00:48:54,637 --> 00:48:59,687
Were you waiting for me here to say that, Director?

765
00:49:02,267 --> 00:49:06,927
Director, I don't want to become a huge star.

766
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:10,537
I just want to act because I enjoy doing it.

767
00:49:10,537 --> 00:49:14,617
Acting isn't the only thing an actor does.

768
00:49:14,617 --> 00:49:16,527
There are too many things you have to endure.

769
00:49:16,527 --> 00:49:19,457
I'm worried you'd get hurt while acting.

770
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,097
I don't want you to go through hardship.

771
00:49:21,097 --> 00:49:23,167
Stop talking nonsense.

772
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:25,507
Don't do it if I tell you not to!

773
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:30,737
How much must I explain how painful that path is?

774
00:49:39,197 --> 00:49:42,417
Director, you were lying when you said

775
00:49:42,417 --> 00:49:45,157
you liked me, weren't you?

776
00:49:45,157 --> 00:49:46,837
What?

777
00:49:47,977 --> 00:49:50,347
If you like someone,

778
00:49:50,347 --> 00:49:55,357
you support their path and the dream they're dreaming.

779
00:49:55,357 --> 00:49:58,737
You don't just stop them like this.

780
00:49:58,737 --> 00:50:02,217
I'm starting to think you don't like me.

781
00:50:04,037 --> 00:50:07,347
So, stop telling me stuff like this.

782
00:50:07,347 --> 00:50:11,977
I have nothing to do with you, Director.

783
00:50:20,867 --> 00:50:23,027
   

784
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,137
Gosh, Director.

785
00:50:27,137 --> 00:50:28,547
What brings you here?

786
00:50:28,547 --> 00:50:31,527
I came to introduce Do Do to you.

787
00:50:31,527 --> 00:50:33,577
Do Do, say hello. Say hello.

788
00:50:33,577 --> 00:50:35,897
He's the director of the drama department.

789
00:50:35,897 --> 00:50:37,787
- Hello. 
 - Nice to meet you.

790
00:50:37,787 --> 00:50:41,437
Not everyone gets to meet him. Think of it as an honor.

791
00:50:41,437 --> 00:50:43,677
CEO Baek, I have a meeting to attend. See you later.

792
00:50:43,677 --> 00:50:45,837
Director!

793
00:50:45,837 --> 00:50:47,457
My gosh.

794
00:50:47,457 --> 00:50:50,547
Director Hong. Director Jeong.

795
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,627
This is Do Do. I gave you her headshot last time.

796
00:50:52,627 --> 00:50:55,037
Say hello. Say hello.

797
00:50:55,037 --> 00:50:57,477
Hello. I'm Do Do. Nice to meet you.

798
00:50:57,477 --> 00:50:59,697
Oh, I see.

799
00:50:59,697 --> 00:51:02,537
I was supposed to meet someone.

800
00:51:02,537 --> 00:51:06,017
- Director Hong... 
 - I have a meeting, too.

801
00:51:06,017 --> 00:51:08,667
Director Jeong!

802
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:16,897
How much did Go Pil Sung talk trash about me?

803
00:51:16,897 --> 00:51:19,637
Everyone is avoiding me like a plague.

804
00:51:19,637 --> 00:51:23,647
Wow, that son of a bitch. What do I do?

805
00:51:26,277 --> 00:51:29,257
Let's continue.

806
00:51:31,867 --> 00:51:34,207
Director! Director! We're in trouble.

807
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:38,637
Ms. Kim is furious that you omitted the scene with Ji Yeong.

808
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,507
He's on his way to see you right now.

809
00:51:41,507 --> 00:51:43,527
What?

810
00:51:43,527 --> 00:51:46,337
B-But still...

811
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:48,757
Why would she come here instead of writing?

812
00:51:48,757 --> 00:51:51,047
You should hide quickly for now.

813
00:51:51,047 --> 00:51:52,777
Hurry up!

814
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:54,457
Why should I hide? Why?

815
00:51:54,457 --> 00:51:56,427
What did I do wrong?

816
00:51:56,427 --> 00:51:58,417
 Director Go Pil Sung! 

817
00:51:58,417 --> 00:52:00,657
 Where's Director Go Pil Sung? 

818
00:52:00,657 --> 00:52:02,957
 Director Go Pil Sung! 

819
00:52:02,957 --> 00:52:05,447
Ms. Kim, I'm here.

820
00:52:05,447 --> 00:52:09,027
You must be busy writing. What brings you here?

821
00:52:09,027 --> 00:52:10,847
What do you think brought me here?

822
00:52:10,847 --> 00:52:14,787
Every second is precious to me, but I came here. You really don't know?

823
00:52:14,787 --> 00:52:16,937
How could you ask me that?

824
00:52:16,937 --> 00:52:20,387
Don't be so upset. The situation doesn't make sense.

825
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,467
How could "Look around" ahjumma suddenly become the female lead's sister?

826
00:52:23,467 --> 00:52:24,977
Because it's a drama.

827
00:52:24,977 --> 00:52:28,027
Ms. Kim, the viewers aren't fools.

828
00:52:28,027 --> 00:52:30,127
Anyway, I can't allow this.

829
00:52:30,977 --> 00:52:32,457
Fine.

830
00:52:32,457 --> 00:52:34,217
Okay.

831
00:52:36,527 --> 00:52:39,757
But if you want to do whatever you want to do,

832
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:41,967
you should write the last episode instead.

833
00:52:41,967 --> 00:52:43,447
You become the writer instead.

834
00:52:43,447 --> 00:52:47,687
I won't write another sentence from now on. Figure it out.

835
00:52:47,687 --> 00:52:51,237
Ms. Kim! Ms. Kim Oh Gyeong!

836
00:52:56,247 --> 00:52:59,897
Why is she so angry?

837
00:52:59,897 --> 00:53:02,337
This is all because of you.

838
00:53:02,337 --> 00:53:05,397
What? Me?

839
00:53:05,397 --> 00:53:08,297
W-Why? Did I do something wrong?

840
00:53:08,297 --> 00:53:09,897
It's not that.

841
00:53:09,897 --> 00:53:13,097
Ms. Kim must've loved your acting.

842
00:53:13,097 --> 00:53:15,437
She apparently got inspired by it.

843
00:53:15,437 --> 00:53:19,397
So, she made you the female lead's sister in Episode 15.

844
00:53:19,397 --> 00:53:21,357
Me?

845
00:53:23,487 --> 00:53:28,527
How could the market seller be the female lead's sister?

846
00:53:28,527 --> 00:53:30,777
The main character had memory loss, you know.

847
00:53:30,777 --> 00:53:35,987
You became an important character who reveals all the female lead's lies.

848
00:53:35,987 --> 00:53:41,017
But the Director removed your scene without discussing it with the writer.

849
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:44,247
That's why she got so angry and came by.

850
00:53:45,697 --> 00:53:48,937
What if she doesn't give us the last script?

851
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:58,077
So, he removed my scene, which the writer worked all night to write?

852
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,850
   

853
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:11,277
What's wrong, Ji Yeong? What's going on?

854
00:54:11,277 --> 00:54:15,117
Director, did you do that because of me?

855
00:54:15,117 --> 00:54:17,487
How could you do that because of me?

856
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:21,787
I know you hate me, but you should keep work and life separate.

857
00:54:21,787 --> 00:54:26,917
The writer worked on the script all day and night.

858
00:54:26,917 --> 00:54:28,677
But how could you just omit the scene?

859
00:54:28,677 --> 00:54:31,627
The writer must've written that for a reason.

860
00:54:31,627 --> 00:54:36,247
Ji Yeong, what are you talking about right now?

861
00:54:36,247 --> 00:54:39,777
That right. I don't want you to become an actor.

862
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:43,527
But there's no way I would've done that because of you.

863
00:54:43,527 --> 00:54:47,467
It's because the drama got messed up because of a random character in the end.

864
00:54:47,467 --> 00:54:51,437
Our drama is about to get ruined because of that character.

865
00:54:55,777 --> 00:55:01,457
Is he saying the drama is about to get ruined because of my character?

866
00:55:03,347 --> 00:55:07,517
I'm sure the writer didn't just ruin the drama.

867
00:55:07,517 --> 00:55:10,087
No, it's because of me.

868
00:55:10,087 --> 00:55:13,377
He's trying to stop me from becoming an actor now.

869
00:55:14,297 --> 00:55:17,527
Yes, Ms. Kim. Did you get back safely?

870
00:55:17,527 --> 00:55:18,877
The traffic wasn't too bad?

871
00:55:18,877 --> 00:55:23,397
 Did you call because you wanted to know if the traffic was bad? 

872
00:55:23,397 --> 00:55:28,287
No. Ms. Kim, I just read the script again.

873
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:31,667
And it turns out I mistook your intention.

874
00:55:31,667 --> 00:55:33,867
We'll shoot that scene immediately.

875
00:55:33,867 --> 00:55:38,087
Could you send the script for Episode 16 on time?

876
00:55:40,117 --> 00:55:41,437
Thank you, Ms. Kim.

877
00:55:41,437 --> 00:55:44,197
I'm rooting for you to the end, Ms. Kim!

878
00:55:44,197 --> 00:55:46,197
Yes, talk to you later.

879
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:54,277
Yes. Let's just shoot it.

880
00:55:54,277 --> 00:55:56,537
I'll do it, okay?

881
00:56:05,187 --> 00:56:06,897
Unni.

882
00:56:08,247 --> 00:56:10,447
I'm sorry, Unni.

883
00:56:12,127 --> 00:56:15,637
If only I knew you were my sister,

884
00:56:15,637 --> 00:56:19,317
I wouldn't have revealed your lies.

885
00:56:26,877 --> 00:56:29,097
It's my fault.

886
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,887
I'm sorry, Unni.

887
00:56:35,257 --> 00:56:38,007
Please wake up, Unni.

888
00:56:39,747 --> 00:56:42,717
Please wake up.

889
00:56:45,227 --> 00:56:47,687
Wake up.

890
00:56:49,717 --> 00:56:52,717
Director, won't you say, "cut?"

891
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:56,847
Cut.

892
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,447
Wake up.

893
00:57:02,927 --> 00:57:05,547
Don't cry.

894
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:08,777
Director, Ji Yeong is amazing.

895
00:57:08,777 --> 00:57:11,717
She must've been an actor in her previous life.

896
00:57:11,717 --> 00:57:13,637
I teared up.

897
00:57:13,637 --> 00:57:15,677
Don't cry.

898
00:57:24,347 --> 00:57:26,347
 President Baek Mi Ja! 

899
00:57:26,347 --> 00:57:33,077
 It's not "Go Pil Sung." He's "Director Go." Director! 

900
00:57:33,077 --> 00:57:35,317
 President Baek, I have a meeting to attend. See you later. 

901
00:57:35,317 --> 00:57:36,817
 Director! 

902
00:57:36,817 --> 00:57:39,627
 Well, I was supposed to meet someone. 

903
00:57:42,317 --> 00:57:45,147
I didn't know how influential Go Pil Sung was.

904
00:57:45,147 --> 00:57:51,517
What if no one casts Do Do because of him?

905
00:57:53,727 --> 00:57:55,737
They say the thirsty person digs a well.

906
00:57:55,737 --> 00:57:59,627
I don't care about my dignity right now.

907
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:04,787
I have no choice in order to survive.

908
00:58:04,787 --> 00:58:07,827
Yes. Yes...

909
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:12,907
Babe, we're almost there. My house is over there.

910
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:14,397
Really?

911
00:58:15,637 --> 00:58:19,357
This neighborhood feels familiar somehow.

912
00:58:19,357 --> 00:58:21,447
Let's go. I'll walk you to your door.

913
00:58:21,447 --> 00:58:24,617
It's okay. We're almost there.

914
00:58:24,617 --> 00:58:27,067
But still. You should go inside.

915
00:58:27,067 --> 00:58:29,457
I'll see you going in and then leave.

916
00:58:29,457 --> 00:58:31,507
No, you should leave first.

917
00:58:31,507 --> 00:58:33,927
I want to see you leave first.

918
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:37,207
No, I told you to go inside first.

919
00:59:05,297 --> 00:59:08,697
Gosh, how obscene.

920
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:12,877
Huh? Myeong Dong?

921
00:59:12,877 --> 00:59:14,317
Hey! Myeong Dong!

922
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:15,787
You scared me!

923
00:59:15,787 --> 00:59:19,457
I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have called you.

924
00:59:19,457 --> 00:59:20,987
Mom.

925
00:59:25,767 --> 00:59:27,887
I should've picked up some fruit, at least.

926
00:59:27,887 --> 00:59:30,427
Gosh, it's okay, I said.

927
00:59:30,427 --> 00:59:32,927
We don't need stuff like that.

928
00:59:32,927 --> 00:59:36,287
You'd be having a cup of tea briefly.

929
00:59:36,287 --> 00:59:39,177
How could I send you away when you're in front of the house?

930
00:59:39,177 --> 00:59:42,617
You're supposed to introduce yourself naturally like this.

931
00:59:42,617 --> 00:59:44,687
But still...

932
00:59:45,557 --> 00:59:49,527
Just go in. No one can stop my mom.

933
00:59:55,637 --> 01:00:00,187
 Hold on. This looks like that house from back then. 

934
01:00:00,187 --> 01:00:02,127
 - What's going on?  
 - Aigoo, aigoo!

935
01:00:02,127 --> 01:00:05,837
Seriously. Aigoo! I said it's okay.

936
01:00:05,837 --> 01:00:08,767
Don't take it too seriously.

937
01:00:08,767 --> 01:00:12,377
You'd be frequenting this place once you become my son-in-law.

938
01:00:12,377 --> 01:00:15,957
What's the big deal? Seriously...

939
01:00:15,957 --> 01:00:18,147
Myeong Dong, hurry up and come in.

940
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:19,787
Okay.

941
01:00:25,327 --> 01:00:28,027
Is he Myeong Dong's boyfriend?

942
01:00:29,907 --> 01:00:33,117
Grandmother looks so happy.

943
01:00:34,027 --> 01:00:36,107
Okay.

944
01:00:36,107 --> 01:00:39,567
Hey, get the tea ready quickly.

945
01:00:39,567 --> 01:00:41,957
I'll prepare the fruit.

946
01:00:43,817 --> 01:00:45,767
By the way...

947
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:50,857
Hey, how come we don't have more fruit than this?

948
01:00:50,857 --> 01:00:52,617
Should I go get some right now?

949
01:00:52,617 --> 01:00:55,317
Let's serve melon or red mango to impress him.

950
01:00:55,317 --> 01:00:58,747
It's too late to pick that up right now.

951
01:00:58,747 --> 01:01:02,337
He didn't want to, but I barely managed to bring him in.

952
01:01:02,337 --> 01:01:05,617
We have no choice. Go ahead and wash these grapes.

953
01:01:05,617 --> 01:01:07,767
I'll peel the apples.

954
01:01:09,517 --> 01:01:11,117
Mother,

955
01:01:11,777 --> 01:01:13,717
when did they start dating?

956
01:01:13,717 --> 01:01:19,807
I think he's the one who gave her a huge diamond ring.

957
01:01:19,807 --> 01:01:21,577
- Really? 
 - Yes.

958
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:24,877
But I don't think I've ever seen that ring.

959
01:01:24,877 --> 01:01:29,697
He was supposed to alter the ring since it was too big,

960
01:01:29,697 --> 01:01:32,307
but they broke up briefly.

961
01:01:32,307 --> 01:01:36,227
Really? Why did they break up before altering it?

962
01:01:36,227 --> 01:01:38,517
That's what I'm saying.

963
01:01:38,517 --> 01:01:43,657
By the way, since he gifted her a huge diamond ring,

964
01:01:43,657 --> 01:01:46,367
he must be really rich.

965
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:49,797
Are you sure it's the same man, by the way?

966
01:01:49,797 --> 01:01:52,077
Yes, I think so.

967
01:01:52,077 --> 01:01:55,457
Things are finally working out for Myeong Dong.

968
01:01:55,457 --> 01:01:58,777
She became a screenwriter, and she found a good man.

969
01:01:58,777 --> 01:02:00,917
- I know. 
 - I know, Mother.

970
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:02,747
- I suppose everyone has their other half. 
 - Yes, yes.

971
01:02:02,747 --> 01:02:04,777
This is so great.

972
01:02:05,647 --> 01:02:11,677
Mom, by the way, he does look quite a bit younger than her.

973
01:02:11,677 --> 01:02:15,707
Oh, yes. I think he's younger.

974
01:02:15,707 --> 01:02:20,447
Myeong Dong might be older, but she looks young.

975
01:02:20,447 --> 01:02:25,477
I shouldn't have nagged her so much all this time.

976
01:02:25,477 --> 01:02:30,427
If only I had known she'd take care of everything on her own.

977
01:02:31,757 --> 01:02:33,447
That's how capable she is.

978
01:02:33,447 --> 01:02:35,437
I think so.

979
01:02:43,577 --> 01:02:50,427
 Gosh, Ma'am. You can't bring in a family with three children. 

980
01:02:57,107 --> 01:03:00,127
 Is she Dae Chung's aunt, then? 

981
01:03:00,127 --> 01:03:01,917
 What am I supposed to do? 

982
01:03:01,917 --> 01:03:04,987
 Should I tell her I'm Do Ra's brother or not? 

983
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,177
Babe, what's wrong?

984
01:03:11,177 --> 01:03:13,127
Don't get nervous.

985
01:03:14,427 --> 01:03:17,647
- The thing is— 
 - Aigoo.

986
01:03:17,647 --> 01:03:19,147
Come out.

987
01:03:19,147 --> 01:03:21,237
No, no. Just relax. Relax.

988
01:03:21,237 --> 01:03:25,027
Relax. Just sit comfortably.

989
01:03:25,027 --> 01:03:27,347
Hand me the fruit.

990
01:03:27,347 --> 01:03:29,787
Hand me that, too.

991
01:03:29,787 --> 01:03:31,977
I'm sorry for making you wait.

992
01:03:31,977 --> 01:03:34,587
Give me that. Give me the fork, too.

993
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:39,397
Gosh, we don't have much because we suddenly invited you.

994
01:03:39,397 --> 01:03:43,317
Here's fruit. You should have some fruit.

995
01:03:43,317 --> 01:03:45,237
Thank you.

996
01:03:46,857 --> 01:03:49,237
How old are you?

997
01:03:49,237 --> 01:03:54,677
Do Sik is seven years younger than me.

998
01:03:54,677 --> 01:03:56,567
Seven years?

999
01:03:57,717 --> 01:04:00,197
No, no. Come on.

1000
01:04:00,197 --> 01:04:03,387
Who cares about age so much in this day and age?

1001
01:04:03,387 --> 01:04:09,077
Recently, on the news, they said age is an old concept these days.

1002
01:04:09,077 --> 01:04:12,087
- That's true. 
 - By the way, what do you do?

1003
01:04:12,087 --> 01:04:13,937
Well, I...

1004
01:04:15,157 --> 01:04:17,387
I'm a freelancer.

1005
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:22,417
Freelancer? W-What's a freelancer?

1006
01:04:22,417 --> 01:04:24,837
Mom, it's a good thing.

1007
01:04:24,837 --> 01:04:27,757
How cool. A freelancer?

1008
01:04:29,687 --> 01:04:35,397
Meyong Dong, he's the one who gave you the ring, right?

1009
01:04:35,397 --> 01:04:36,977
Huh?

1010
01:04:41,397 --> 01:04:47,147
 My gosh, can't believe Myeong Dong met someone so rich. 

1011
01:04:48,737 --> 01:04:51,227
 Anyone in there? 

1012
01:04:52,377 --> 01:04:54,057
 Anyone in there? 

1013
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:56,157
Hold on, whose voice is that?

1014
01:04:56,157 --> 01:04:58,477
Hey, this is that woman's voice. Isn't it?

1015
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:00,907
- My gosh. 
 - What's she doing here at this hour?

1016
01:05:00,907 --> 01:05:02,587
I'll go check real quick.

1017
01:05:02,587 --> 01:05:05,167
- Gosh. 
 - Don't get up.

1018
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:09,647
Gosh, hello, hello! The door was open.

1019
01:05:09,647 --> 01:05:12,657
Gosh, I came by to apologize.

1020
01:05:12,657 --> 01:05:18,397
I was so rude last time because I was so upset.

1021
01:05:18,397 --> 01:05:20,227
I'm so sorry.

1022
01:05:20,227 --> 01:05:23,697
Is Director Go home, by chance?

1023
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:26,467
Mom!

1024
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:32,117
Do Sik, why are you sitting there?

1025
01:05:32,117 --> 01:05:36,847
What? "Mom"? Who's your mom?

1026
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,507
I-Is she your mom?

1027
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:49,747
   

1028
01:05:51,370 --> 01:06:01,330


1029
01:06:03,817 --> 01:06:06,847
♫  Saturday afternoon  ♫

1030
01:06:06,847 --> 01:06:15,530
♫  Don't hesitate like that and try dancing with me  ♫

1031
01:06:16,517 --> 01:06:21,867
♫  I don't want to have a tiring talk today  ♫

1032
01:06:21,867 --> 01:06:26,627
 I really want to marry Pil Sung. Is there a way to do that? 

1033
01:06:26,627 --> 01:06:30,337
 Yes, that's it! I can marry Pil Sung that way. 

1034
01:06:30,337 --> 01:06:34,107
 - Is Ma Ri there, by chance? 
 - Is she missing? 

1035
01:06:34,107 --> 01:06:36,557
 Here's the script. Start practicing now. 

1036
01:06:36,557 --> 01:06:38,157
 You need to audition tomorrow. 

1037
01:06:38,157 --> 01:06:42,127
 Would I inconvenience you greatly if I became an actor? 

1038
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:44,967
 You know how Park Do Ra died, too. 

1039
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:46,997
 Nothing can make me give up. 

1040
01:06:46,997 --> 01:06:50,987
 I'm not Park Do Ra. I'm Kim Ji Yeong!
