1
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:51,034
Ji Yeong! 
    

2
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:54,894
Ji Yeong!

3
00:00:56,484 --> 00:00:58,444
Ji Yeong!

4
00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:03,524
Ji Yeong!

5
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,714
Ji Yeong!

6
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:10,204
Ji Yeong!

7
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:12,864
Not him, but I...

8
00:01:14,714 --> 00:01:17,934
I betrayed him.

9
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:22,034
I did nothing but hurt him.

10
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:24,544
I wounded him.

11
00:01:28,774 --> 00:01:33,684
Why are you still by my side like a fool, Oppa?

12
00:01:38,814 --> 00:01:43,224
You should've forgotten about a terrible woman like me.

13
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:47,954
You should've erased me.

14
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:54,394
I'm sorry, Oppa.

15
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:58,620
I'm sorry, Oppa.

16
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:06,414


17
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:09,744
What's going on here?

18
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:13,164
Where did she go in the middle of shooting?

19
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:14,804
How upsetting.

20
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:16,884
How could this happen in the first shoot?

21
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:20,204
Why did he cast someone like her, to begin with?

22
00:02:20,204 --> 00:02:22,534
She's hurting everyone right now.

23
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:26,804
Mom, everyone's worried because she disappeared. Be quiet, please.

24
00:02:26,804 --> 00:02:29,584
It's getting dark and rainy.

25
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:33,494
She ran off without her phone, too. How can you find her?

26
00:02:33,494 --> 00:02:35,794
What a problem.

27
00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:37,654
President Gong.

28
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:40,064
Aigoo, aigoo!

29
00:02:40,064 --> 00:02:43,514
- What happened to Ji Yeong? 
 - What happened to Ji Yeong?

30
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:45,574
You haven't found her yet?

31
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:46,654
We haven't.

32
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:49,554
What? You haven't?

33
00:02:49,554 --> 00:02:53,724
Why did you come here without Ji Yeong?

34
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:59,054
I sprained my ankle because I was running in the mountains in dress shoes.

35
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:03,354
Anyway, we called the police, and we'll search the mountains.

36
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:05,954
You should go back before it gets late.

37
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:07,734
I can't go!

38
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:10,214
No, I can't go! I can't!

39
00:03:10,214 --> 00:03:13,914
I can't leave before we find Ji Yeong! I can't!

40
00:03:13,914 --> 00:03:16,584
- I can't! 
 - Ma'am!

41
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:19,944
Aigoo, Ji Yeong! Ji Yeong!

42
00:03:19,944 --> 00:03:22,984
Ji Yeong!

43
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:27,644
♫  Until the East Sea's waves are dry  ♫

44
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:32,904
Seriously! Why are you doing this now, Grandma? Seriously!

45
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:36,494
Noona! Noona! Are you okay?

46
00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:41,474
 - Ji Yeong!  
 - I found her here! Director!

47
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:43,484
Where are you?

48
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:45,404
Over here!

49
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:49,104
Over here.

50
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,694
- Ji Yeong. 
 - Hello?

51
00:03:51,694 --> 00:03:53,314
Ji Yeong.

52
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:56,694
Ji Yeong, wake up.

53
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,374
Ji Yeong!

54
00:03:58,944 --> 00:04:00,494
Ji Yeong.

55
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:09,054
Oppa.

56
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:19,814
Ji Yeong.

57
00:04:19,814 --> 00:04:21,884
Ji Yeong!

58
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:23,554
Ji Yeong!

59
00:04:27,074 --> 00:04:31,984
Aigoo, Ji Yeong. Gosh, what's wrong with her?

60
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:34,074
Why isn't she waking up?

61
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:37,284
Don't worry so much. She's sleeping right now.

62
00:04:37,284 --> 00:04:38,694
Really?

63
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:43,874
The doctor just said it's because she's a bit stressed. She'll be okay.

64
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:45,614
Yes. Okay.

65
00:04:45,614 --> 00:04:49,794
By the way, why don't you leave, Director Go?

66
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:51,924
Why are you here?

67
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:55,284
My drama's leading actor passed out while shooting.

68
00:04:55,284 --> 00:04:58,594
I should make sure she wakes up since I'm the person in charge.

69
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:03,044
Because you might go over the budget since the schedule got messed up?

70
00:05:03,044 --> 00:05:05,624
I'll be responsible for that.

71
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:12,074
Do you not hear me right now?

72
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:15,444
I'm talking to you. Can't you have some manners?

73
00:05:15,444 --> 00:05:20,334
She's sick in bed right now. Why do this here? Seriously.

74
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:21,934
I'll call you when she wakes up.

75
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:26,114
Director Go and President Gong can leave now.

76
00:05:26,114 --> 00:05:28,074
Jae Dong, you should leave, too.

77
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:31,094
If everyone is here watching her when she wakes up,

78
00:05:31,094 --> 00:05:33,634
she'd be shocked and embarrassed.

79
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,214
Director.

80
00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:39,020
Okay. Please call me then.

81
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,560
Okay.

82
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:46,954
Let's go, Assistant Director.

83
00:05:52,154 --> 00:05:54,084
Why are you still here?

84
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:55,574
You should go, too.

85
00:05:55,574 --> 00:05:58,164
Grandma, I'm Ji Yeong's boyfriend.

86
00:05:58,164 --> 00:05:59,434
I need to stay here.

87
00:05:59,434 --> 00:06:03,694
You left her in the mountains to save yourself.

88
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:05,204
What? Boyfriend?

89
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:06,564
Boyfriend, my foot.

90
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:08,274
I told you about that.

91
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:11,184
I happened to be wearing dress shoes today.

92
00:06:11,184 --> 00:06:14,984
I scraped my foot while looking for her in the mountains earlier.

93
00:06:14,984 --> 00:06:16,234
It hurts.

94
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:18,654
Aigoo, you weasel.

95
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:20,724
All you got is your mouth.

96
00:06:20,724 --> 00:06:23,974
I hate to see you. Leave.

97
00:06:23,974 --> 00:06:25,994
Leave. Leave.

98
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:29,964
President Gong, wait at home. I'll be in touch.

99
00:06:29,964 --> 00:06:31,924
Okay.

100
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:35,274
Make sure to let me know when she wakes up.

101
00:06:35,274 --> 00:06:38,014
Grandma, I'm leaving.

102
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:39,864
Geez.

103
00:06:42,524 --> 00:06:48,044
Ji Yeong, wake up. I'm so upset I could die.

104
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:51,354
Please open your eyes.

105
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:57,094
Gosh.

106
00:06:57,894 --> 00:07:01,504
Ji Yeong. Ji Yeong, are you awake?

107
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,754
Do you recognize your grandma?

108
00:07:09,714 --> 00:07:11,044
Grandma.

109
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:13,834
Yes, Ji Yeong.

110
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:16,054
Ji Yeong, it's mom. It's mom.

111
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:18,734
Ji Yeong, it's mom.

112
00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:30,004
 Why are you so selfish? We're all about to starve to death. 

113
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:32,214
 Let's all jump into the Han River and die. 

114
00:07:32,214 --> 00:07:35,194
 - Let's die. 
 - Mom, Mom, no. 

115
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:36,944
 President Gong will take care of everything. 

116
00:07:36,944 --> 00:07:39,354
 He'll control the media and... 

117
00:07:39,354 --> 00:07:42,894
 pay off all of our debts, too. So... So, Do Ra... 

118
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:45,024
 She owes me! Hey! 

119
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:47,414
 It's not bad to do a nude photoshoot. 

120
00:07:47,414 --> 00:07:49,934
 It's art. Art. 

121
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:54,924
What's wrong? What?

122
00:07:54,924 --> 00:07:57,104
Ji Yeong. Ji Yeong, what's wrong?

123
00:07:57,104 --> 00:07:58,604
Ji Yeong, what's wrong?

124
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,494
- What's wrong? 
 - Doctor!

125
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:01,604
Call the doctor!

126
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:03,134
What's wrong, Ji Yeong?

127
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:04,774
I'll bring the doctor.

128
00:08:04,774 --> 00:08:08,174
Gosh! Oh, no! My gosh!

129
00:08:08,174 --> 00:08:10,394
Ji Yeong. What's wrong with her?

130
00:08:10,394 --> 00:08:12,384
Aigoo, aigoo!

131
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:14,834
Yes.

132
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:18,974
Ji Yeong, quit acting if it's too hard.

133
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:24,074
Let's harvest clams and make noodles by the sea.

134
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:26,334
Ji Yeong. Yes, yes.

135
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:29,134
- Noona! 
 - Ji Yeong!

136
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:31,934
Oppa.

137
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:35,314
Do Jun.

138
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,944
D-Do Jun. Do Jun! Do Jun!

139
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:41,074
- Do Jun! 
 - What's wrong with her?

140
00:08:41,074 --> 00:08:43,514
- Oppa! 
 - Yes, Ji Yeong. It's Oppa.

141
00:08:43,514 --> 00:08:46,404
Oppa! Oppa!

142
00:08:46,404 --> 00:08:48,514
Oppa!

143
00:08:57,144 --> 00:08:58,884
 Oppa. 

144
00:09:01,134 --> 00:09:03,034
She was...

145
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:06,644
near the vacation home, then.

146
00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:11,334
Something must've happened to her there.

147
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:15,994
Did she remember what happened there today?

148
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:20,094
Is that why she was like that today?

149
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:22,154
Hello, Ma'am.

150
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:24,554
How's Patient Kim Ji Yeong doing?

151
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:26,514
Is she still unconscious?

152
00:09:26,514 --> 00:09:28,564
Ms. Kim Ji Yeong...

153
00:09:28,564 --> 00:09:30,184
She regained consciousness.

154
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:34,974
But she was still feeling anxious. We administered a tranquilizer, and she's now asleep.

155
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,144
Oh, I see.

156
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,344
Will she be okay?

157
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,544
Yes. She's a lot calmer now.

158
00:09:40,544 --> 00:09:44,284
The doctor said there wasn't anything wrong with her.

159
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,704
Okay, thank you.

160
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:54,194
Did you come because you were worried?

161
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,834
- Yes. 
 - Your sister...

162
00:09:55,834 --> 00:10:00,154
- I hope she wakes up soon. 
 - I know.

163
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,904
Ji Yeong, are you okay?

164
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:09,754
Ji Yeong.

165
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:21,004
Yes.

166
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:24,154
I'm okay.

167
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:27,234
So please go home and rest.

168
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:29,824
But you're sick. How could we leave?

169
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:32,824
I'm okay. I told you to leave.

170
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,404
I want to be alone.

171
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:38,394
I'll stay alone, then.

172
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:40,834
I can't leave her all alone.

173
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:43,314
Grandma can stay, then.

174
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:45,494
Ahjumma can leave.

175
00:10:46,114 --> 00:10:50,214
Oppa, Do Jun, take her home with you.

176
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,594
Are you sure we can leave?

177
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:56,044
Yes, I'm really okay.

178
00:10:56,044 --> 00:11:00,464
Grandma can't be without me. I'll stay with her.

179
00:11:03,254 --> 00:11:06,574
Oppa, Do Jun, you should rest at home, too.

180
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:12,304
Okay, then. Let's go. She can't relax if there are too many people.

181
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,434
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

182
00:11:14,434 --> 00:11:16,344
Rest, Ji Yeong. We'll go.

183
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:18,984
Call me if anything happens, okay?

184
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:20,624
Okay.

185
00:11:20,624 --> 00:11:22,664
Don't worry.

186
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:24,774
- Go now. 
 - We'll go.

187
00:11:24,774 --> 00:11:27,474
We'll go. Let's go. Rest, then.

188
00:11:30,374 --> 00:11:32,264
Aigoo...

189
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:44,610
Grandma.

190
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,240
Yes.

191
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:51,034
What? Do you have something to tell me?

192
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:56,634
Tell me everything you need to say.

193
00:11:56,634 --> 00:12:01,594
By the way, could you actually be very sick?

194
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:05,884
No.

195
00:12:05,884 --> 00:12:08,094
I'm okay.

196
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:11,164
I'm fine.

197
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:15,464
But what happened earlier?

198
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:18,154
I...

199
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:21,994
I think I got too absorbed in acting.

200
00:12:21,994 --> 00:12:24,094
No.

201
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:26,974
I don't think that was it.

202
00:12:26,974 --> 00:12:31,164
Because you had a lot of surgeries,

203
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:34,144
you sometimes got sick from the complications.

204
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:37,464
Is that what happened today, too?

205
00:12:37,464 --> 00:12:44,334
Aigoo, why is it going on for so long? Aigoo...

206
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:48,324
- Grandma. 
 - Yes.

207
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:54,094
I'm okay, Grandma.

208
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:57,584
I really am okay.

209
00:12:59,184 --> 00:13:01,114
I...

210
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:06,404
I'm okay as long as I have you.

211
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:08,134
Aigoo.

212
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:13,004
Thank you, Grandma. Thank you.

213
00:13:13,674 --> 00:13:15,614
- Grandma. 
 - Yes...

214
00:13:15,614 --> 00:13:17,464
Thank you, Grandma.

215
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:24,944
Yes, yes. I'm grateful that you're alive like this, too.

216
00:13:24,944 --> 00:13:27,044
Thank you, Grandma.

217
00:13:27,044 --> 00:13:30,014
Aigoo, my baby.

218
00:13:38,414 --> 00:13:40,504
Grandma...

219
00:13:45,644 --> 00:13:47,504
I...

220
00:13:50,954 --> 00:13:55,564
remember what my mom did to me.

221
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:07,434
But I don't want to believe my memory.

222
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:15,524
I can't even bring it up because...

223
00:14:19,954 --> 00:14:23,584
I'm scared it might all be true.

224
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:29,144
How could she do that to me?

225
00:14:32,114 --> 00:14:36,444
She can't do that to me when she gave birth to me.

226
00:14:44,454 --> 00:14:47,364
She can't do that.

227
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,574
Grandma.

228
00:15:30,894 --> 00:15:34,084
I listed the room since you said you were going back to the Philippines.

229
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:36,304
I should cancel it.

230
00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:40,554
I'm sorry. I was going to go because of my business,

231
00:15:40,554 --> 00:15:42,864
but I found my son.

232
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:45,494
- What? S-Son? 
 - Oh, my.

233
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:47,554
You had a son?

234
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:50,764
What son? I thought you didn't have a child.

235
00:15:50,764 --> 00:15:52,414
Actually, I didn't know, either.

236
00:15:52,414 --> 00:15:57,594
My first love, whom I used to date, has been raising my son.

237
00:15:57,594 --> 00:16:00,054
I found that out just recently.

238
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:04,254
If so, he must be all grown up now.

239
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,904
Yes, he works for a corporation.

240
00:16:05,904 --> 00:16:09,034
My gosh, that's so great.

241
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:12,654
How could something so dramatic happen?

242
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:14,064
That's so great.

243
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:18,094
By the way, is that woman single?

244
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:19,394
Yes.

245
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:23,584
You should get remarried, then. You have a son together, too.

246
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:26,114
We can't do that right now.

247
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:28,364
But we'll get back together soon.

248
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:31,814
Wow, Sang Gu, that's wonderful.

249
00:16:31,814 --> 00:16:34,694
Let us meet her sometime, too.

250
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,884
Or bring her to our restaurant.

251
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:39,444
- Okay, I will. 
 - Okay.

252
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:47,214
Ji Yeong, why are you suddenly packing? Where are you going?

253
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:50,184
What do you mean, you got yourself a place?

254
00:16:50,184 --> 00:16:52,244
I've told you this.

255
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,574
It's too uncomfortable to live here with Grandma.

256
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,904
How many bedrooms does the place have?

257
00:16:59,904 --> 00:17:04,594
I just found something good enough for me and grandma.

258
00:17:05,254 --> 00:17:06,884
That makes no sense, Ji Yeong.

259
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:09,774
We can't be apart now that we managed to be reunited.

260
00:17:09,774 --> 00:17:11,194
We'll come with you then.

261
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:13,944
What do you mean, come with us? You meanie.

262
00:17:13,944 --> 00:17:15,784
Gosh, this old woman...

263
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:19,204
- It's okay, Grandma. 
 - Okay.

264
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:24,080
Ahjumma, to be honest,

265
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,110
No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't see you as my mom.

266
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:32,004
So, let's talk again when I get my memory back.

267
00:17:32,004 --> 00:17:37,074
Kim Ji Yeong, I proved with the DNA test that we're mother and daughter.

268
00:17:37,074 --> 00:17:39,674
You're my daughter.

269
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:44,424
You and Grandma don't get along...

270
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:47,704
and I started shooting the drama, too.

271
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:51,064
It's hard to focus on practicing the script here.

272
00:17:51,064 --> 00:17:53,860
I can't relax comfortably after work, either.

273
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:57,614
In any case, until I get my memory back,

274
00:17:57,614 --> 00:18:01,214
I want to live as Kim Ji Yeong, not as your daughter, Park Do Ra.

275
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:05,934
I'm moving out before I get busier just so you know.

276
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:10,344
- Let's go, Grandma. 
 - Let's.

277
00:18:10,344 --> 00:18:13,244
That's not right. No, Ji Yeong.

278
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:14,884
I'll come with you. Take me with you.

279
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:17,254
And I can't be without you, Ji Yeong!

280
00:18:17,254 --> 00:18:20,874
How dare you try to attach yourself like a parasite?

281
00:18:20,874 --> 00:18:23,344
- Let go! 
 - Mom, just let them go.

282
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:25,894
Let go. Let go. Hey!

283
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:29,404
Geum Dong, I'll call you.

284
00:18:29,404 --> 00:18:31,894
You should break up with that old woman, too. Okay?

285
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:33,244
That old woman... Seriously...

286
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:35,534
Hey, let go of me. Ji Yeong!

287
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:38,074
Let go! You bastard! You bastard!

288
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:42,144
How could you just watch her leave? You won't even stop her?

289
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:44,314
Wow, you bastard.

290
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:46,794
Ji Yeong. Ji Yeong. Ji Yeong!

291
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:49,864
Ji Yeong! Ji Yeong!

292
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:55,804
Oppa, please understand me moving out.

293
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:58,514
Explain it well to Ahjumma, too.

294
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,824
 I'm sorry, Oppa. 

295
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:03,994
Mom... Mom! Geez...

296
00:19:03,994 --> 00:19:05,814
Seriously...

297
00:19:05,814 --> 00:19:08,974
Ji Yeong! Do Ra! Ji Yeong! Hold on.

298
00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:12,044
Hey! Talk to me! Ji Yeong! Ji Yeong!

299
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:14,494
Don't go! Ji Yeong!

300
00:19:14,494 --> 00:19:17,474
Ji Yeong! Seriously!

301
00:19:17,474 --> 00:19:19,914
Mom, just let her go. Go back inside.

302
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:24,754
Hey! How could you just let her go when she's abandoning us?

303
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:29,014
How could she do that to her mother?

304
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:32,984
How could she leave with that old woman, who's not even related to her?

305
00:19:32,984 --> 00:19:35,904
She must feel uncomfortable with us because she still has no memory.

306
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:37,724
So, let's try to understand.

307
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:41,204
And it was uncomfortable living in that tiny place together.

308
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:47,744
By the way, Do Sik, how did she afford the new place?

309
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:50,284
She must've had money that she's been hiding from us.

310
00:19:50,284 --> 00:19:53,284
She's not like the old Do Ra.

311
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:56,634
How could she abandon us to live on her own?

312
00:19:56,634 --> 00:19:58,024
Is she really our Do Ra?

313
00:19:58,024 --> 00:20:00,824
And when will she get her memory back?

314
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,324
It's better if she doesn't.

315
00:20:02,324 --> 00:20:04,154
She'd suffer so much if she did.

316
00:20:04,154 --> 00:20:07,364
And if she does, she'll never see you again. Geez.

317
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:10,434
What did you say? How could a daughter not see her mom?

318
00:20:10,434 --> 00:20:13,884
That's against heaven's rule, you bastard!

319
00:20:13,884 --> 00:20:15,974
Whoa! Seriously.

320
00:20:18,794 --> 00:20:20,704
Grandma, come on in.

321
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:24,514
Wow. Aigoo!

322
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:31,624
Ji Yeong, what a nice and clean place.

323
00:20:31,624 --> 00:20:34,914
We should've moved sooner.

324
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:38,014
I'm so happy we moved.

325
00:20:38,794 --> 00:20:42,884
Grandma, I'm sorry.

326
00:20:42,884 --> 00:20:46,124
I made you worry about all this.

327
00:20:46,124 --> 00:20:49,694
I'll work hard and pay you back the security deposit soon.

328
00:20:49,694 --> 00:20:51,094
Come on.

329
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,554
Thank you, Grandma.

330
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:59,874
I won't forget what you've done for me as long as I live.

331
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:05,064
I mean, I'll remember it forever.

332
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:07,074
Aigoo...

333
00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:14,064
What are you talking about right now?

334
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,974
My money is your money.

335
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,854
Don't say stuff like that.

336
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:29,154
I have nothing to ask for as long as you're happy.

Grandma...

341
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,454
don't get any worse...

342
00:22:02,724 --> 00:22:06,424
You're the only one I have.

343
00:22:14,498 --> 00:22:16,768
What kind of man are you?

344
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,078
What do you mean by that?

345
00:22:19,078 --> 00:22:21,498
I confessed my feelings for you.

346
00:22:21,498 --> 00:22:24,058
You should say something back, too.

347
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:27,048
Say you like me or not.

348
00:22:30,168 --> 00:22:32,538
Why are you still thinking?

349
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:36,260
Just tell me if you like me or not.

350
00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:38,588
Don't you like me?

351
00:22:39,588 --> 00:22:41,958
It's not that I don't like you.

352
00:22:42,788 --> 00:22:45,368
What? That means you like me, too.

353
00:22:45,368 --> 00:22:48,078
Why won't you say you like me, then?

354
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:53,738
By chance,

355
00:22:55,398 --> 00:22:56,968
is it because I'm stupi—

356
00:22:56,968 --> 00:22:59,968
No, I swear it's not like that.

357
00:23:01,468 --> 00:23:04,478
It's because I'm not good enough for you.

358
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,108
What do you mean by that?

359
00:23:08,108 --> 00:23:11,398
There's no one as perfectly handsome and cool as you.

360
00:23:11,398 --> 00:23:13,768
How could you be not good enough?

361
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:18,998
My family went bankrupt... and I never got to graduate.

362
00:23:20,268 --> 00:23:25,358
I like you, too, but I'm not financially independent enough to take care of you.

363
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:27,968
Why would you take care of me?

364
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:31,608
We just need to care for and like each other.

365
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:36,318
You want to take care of someone if you like them.

366
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:43,608
Do Jun, you were way cooler than a prince in a romantic novel just now.

367
00:23:43,608 --> 00:23:47,308
I mean, even a prince can't say anything as cool.

368
00:23:48,508 --> 00:23:51,628
Do Jun, I have a lot of money.

369
00:23:51,628 --> 00:23:53,168
So, don't even worry about stuff like that.

370
00:23:53,168 --> 00:23:56,278
I'll ask my mom to pay you twice as much.

371
00:23:56,278 --> 00:23:58,138
No, don't do that.

372
00:23:58,138 --> 00:24:00,708
I wouldn't be earning that myself.

373
00:24:01,758 --> 00:24:04,698
I need to support you.

374
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:07,378
But I don't have the ability to do that yet.

375
00:24:08,358 --> 00:24:14,838
We just need to like each other sincerely, right?

376
00:24:16,648 --> 00:24:20,038
I like you.

377
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:22,858
I like you, Do Jun.

378
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:28,888
So, just go out with me.

379
00:25:02,128 --> 00:25:03,848
Yes, Noona.

380
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,618
What did you say?

381
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:11,228
Come on in.

382
00:25:11,228 --> 00:25:14,588
Noona, this is really my room?

383
00:25:14,588 --> 00:25:18,338
Yes, what do you think? Do you like it?

384
00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:21,368
Totally. I really love it.

385
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,658
I'm so glad you like it.

386
00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:28,148
I decorated your room first when I got this place.

387
00:25:28,148 --> 00:25:31,238
So visit me often, okay?

388
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,018
Okay.

389
00:25:35,228 --> 00:25:38,878
Noona, I'm so glad you moved.

390
00:25:38,878 --> 00:25:43,278
To be honest, I wanted to get a place and move you out of there, too.

391
00:25:48,008 --> 00:25:49,638
Do Jun.

392
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:53,288
Is your hand okay?

393
00:25:53,288 --> 00:25:55,138
It must've hurt a lot, then.

394
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:58,518
I'm okay, Noona. It healed quickly.

395
00:26:00,578 --> 00:26:02,628
I...

396
00:26:04,158 --> 00:26:07,418
I was okay with everything else,

397
00:26:08,128 --> 00:26:12,008
but I was so upset because of you.

398
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:16,598
You didn't even get to finish your studies.

399
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:21,068
I'm so sorry, Do Jun.

400
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:27,558
Noona...

401
00:26:28,328 --> 00:26:30,528
do you remember, by chance?

402
00:26:31,128 --> 00:26:32,678
You're Do Ra, right?

403
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:35,448
You got your memory back, right?

404
00:26:36,268 --> 00:26:38,088
Do Jun.

405
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:42,338
You got your memory back, didn't you?

406
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:46,108
Yes.

407
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:50,028
I remember everything.

408
00:26:50,028 --> 00:26:51,708
Noona.

409
00:26:52,748 --> 00:26:56,598
I missed you so much.

410
00:26:56,598 --> 00:27:00,638
I was so upset when you didn't recognize me.

411
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:04,338
Why did you die leaving me behind? Why?

412
00:27:04,338 --> 00:27:07,268
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Do Jun.

413
00:27:07,268 --> 00:27:10,548
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

414
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:14,328
No, Noona. Thank you.

415
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:16,888
Thank you so much for being alive.

416
00:27:16,888 --> 00:27:20,288
It's all okay. It's all okay.

417
00:27:25,178 --> 00:27:29,118
Do Jun, listen to me carefully.

418
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:34,448
Don't tell anyone else that I got my memory back.

419
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:37,318
Don't tell Mom or Oppa.

420
00:27:37,998 --> 00:27:42,328
I'll just live as Kim Ji Yeong.

421
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:45,048
What do you mean, Noona?

422
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:50,788
No one would understand that I'm living as Kim Ji Yeong.

423
00:27:50,788 --> 00:27:54,538
Once I clear my name from engaging in prostitution,

424
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:57,568
I'll reveal that I'm Park Do Ra.

425
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:01,768
Noona, what happened to you before you died?

426
00:28:01,768 --> 00:28:05,048
Tell me everything, please?

427
00:28:05,048 --> 00:28:06,778
Later.

428
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:13,228
I'll tell you everything once it's all sorted out.

429
00:28:13,228 --> 00:28:15,758
But not until then.

430
00:28:15,758 --> 00:28:18,398
You know what I mean, right?

431
00:28:19,468 --> 00:28:21,288
Okay.

432
00:28:22,538 --> 00:28:24,488
 Geum Dong! 

433
00:28:24,488 --> 00:28:28,048
 Gosh, our Geum Dong is here. 

434
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:36,448
Here you go.

435
00:28:36,998 --> 00:28:38,648
Go ahead and eat. Go on.

436
00:28:38,648 --> 00:28:40,228
Okay.

437
00:28:40,228 --> 00:28:43,168
Grandma's kalguksu is amazing.

438
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:44,968
Do Jun, try some.

439
00:28:44,968 --> 00:28:46,558
Okay.

440
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,648
How does it taste?

441
00:28:54,918 --> 00:28:57,088
It's so good. Grandma, it's amazing.

442
00:28:57,088 --> 00:28:58,348
Really?

443
00:28:58,348 --> 00:28:59,768
Mom, how about we start a restaurant?

444
00:28:59,768 --> 00:29:01,978
The broth is incredible. It's the best.

445
00:29:01,978 --> 00:29:03,088
Incredible?

446
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:08,888
Geum Dong, you should live here, too, once you break up with that old woman.

447
00:29:08,888 --> 00:29:11,538
I'll feed you kalguksu every day.

448
00:29:11,538 --> 00:29:14,498
Okay, okay.

449
00:29:15,218 --> 00:29:18,138
Ji Yeong, how did you get a place like this?

450
00:29:18,138 --> 00:29:20,438
You couldn't have had much money.

451
00:29:20,438 --> 00:29:24,008
I got it. I did. With my money.

452
00:29:24,008 --> 00:29:26,948
Because I didn't want to live with that meanie.

453
00:29:26,948 --> 00:29:28,358
Grandma, you did?

454
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:30,478
Grandma?

455
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:35,028
He lost his mind living with that old meanie.

456
00:29:35,028 --> 00:29:37,248
Come on.

457
00:29:37,248 --> 00:29:39,868
Okay, okay. I'll be careful from now on. Let's eat.

458
00:29:39,868 --> 00:29:41,418
Okay.

459
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:51,838
Yes, President Lee. I need some money.

460
00:29:51,838 --> 00:29:55,688
When will I get paid for the ad contract Ji Yeong signed?

461
00:29:55,688 --> 00:29:58,058
I'm sending that money directly to Ji Yeong's bank account.

462
00:29:58,058 --> 00:30:00,498
 She said she'll manage her income from now on. 

463
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,938
What do you... What do you mean? Who says she can?

464
00:30:03,938 --> 00:30:06,478
I thought you talked to her already.

465
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:11,448
Jae Dong, I think you're mistaken.

466
00:30:11,448 --> 00:30:14,818
Keep sending her income to me like you've been doing.

467
00:30:14,818 --> 00:30:17,198
Try talking to Ji Yeong again.

468
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:19,768
I have to listen to her.

469
00:30:19,768 --> 00:30:21,448
How about my cut, then?

470
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:23,398
 That will be processed after the drama ends. 

471
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:25,528
 We need travel expenses, too. 

472
00:30:25,528 --> 00:30:28,258
You know that's more important right now.

473
00:30:28,258 --> 00:30:29,558
 I'm busy. I'll hang up now. 

474
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:31,318
Hey, Jae—

475
00:30:32,878 --> 00:30:35,778
What's wrong with Ji Yeong all of a sudden?

476
00:30:35,778 --> 00:30:37,688
Why would she manage her income?

477
00:30:37,688 --> 00:30:40,088
She has me for that.

478
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,780
She's crazy.

479
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:45,640
   

480
00:30:52,178 --> 00:30:54,188
 Oppa. 

481
00:30:56,698 --> 00:30:59,018
She definitely said, "Oppa."

482
00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:03,068
By chance, has she...

483
00:31:04,228 --> 00:31:06,828
gotten her memory back completely?

484
00:31:18,018 --> 00:31:21,078
Ji Yeong, it's me.

485
00:31:21,078 --> 00:31:24,828
I'm in front of your house now. Could you come out for a second?

486
00:31:24,828 --> 00:31:26,958
I need to talk to you.

487
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:31,698
What did you say?

488
00:31:31,698 --> 00:31:33,878
You moved?

489
00:31:55,358 --> 00:31:58,438
How did you suddenly move?

490
00:32:00,088 --> 00:32:05,218
My grandma felt uncomfortable in the previous place and I did, too.

491
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:07,678
So we moved out.

492
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:09,838
I see.

493
00:32:10,988 --> 00:32:14,728
How are you feeling, Ji Yeong? Are you okay?

494
00:32:15,468 --> 00:32:18,878
Yes, I'm okay.

495
00:32:21,178 --> 00:32:25,508
The shoot got ruined because of me. I'm so sorry.

496
00:32:25,508 --> 00:32:27,858
I won't make the same mistake again.

497
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:30,118
I apologize one more time.

498
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:34,268
You didn't do it on purpose. Don't worry.

499
00:32:34,268 --> 00:32:38,118
Ji Yeong, you...

500
00:32:39,178 --> 00:32:42,688
remembered something at the vacation home again, right?

501
00:32:42,688 --> 00:32:45,828
You were near that place once before.

502
00:32:45,828 --> 00:32:47,898
I picked you up there...

503
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:51,488
and you cried a lot because something bad must've happened.

504
00:32:51,488 --> 00:32:54,388
Tell me if you got that memory back.

505
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:57,438
What happened at the vacation home?

506
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:02,758
No.

507
00:33:02,758 --> 00:33:04,758
It's not like that.

508
00:33:08,598 --> 00:33:10,618
You didn't get your memory back?

509
00:33:10,618 --> 00:33:13,128
When you passed out in the mountains,

510
00:33:13,128 --> 00:33:17,258
I was wondering if you got your memory back.

511
00:33:18,158 --> 00:33:20,138
No, it's just that...

512
00:33:22,138 --> 00:33:24,798
I'm still a newcomer...

513
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,988
and it was my first shoot as the lead.

514
00:33:28,988 --> 00:33:30,888
I must've been nervous.

515
00:33:30,888 --> 00:33:33,238
There were a lot of people there, too.

516
00:33:33,818 --> 00:33:36,738
I think it's because I was so nervous.

517
00:33:38,688 --> 00:33:41,848
I should've sent people away after the first shoot ritual.

518
00:33:41,848 --> 00:33:43,658
There were too many people on set.

519
00:33:43,658 --> 00:33:46,178
I wasn't considerate of you.

520
00:33:46,178 --> 00:33:47,718
That was my mistake. I'm sorry.

521
00:33:47,718 --> 00:33:50,178
I'll change the shoot location.

522
00:33:52,578 --> 00:33:55,578
 Since that day and until this very moment, 

523
00:33:56,848 --> 00:33:59,678
 I've regretted not reaching out to you that day 

524
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,808
 countless times every day... 

525
00:34:05,978 --> 00:34:08,498
 over and over again. 

526
00:34:08,498 --> 00:34:10,218
 I'm sorry. 

527
00:34:10,218 --> 00:34:12,168
 I'm so sorry. 

528
00:34:14,498 --> 00:34:18,788
Ji Yeong, are you okay? What's wrong?

529
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:22,098
Well...

530
00:34:22,098 --> 00:34:24,138
it's nothing.

531
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:28,948
It's because I feel so bad for you.

532
00:34:31,788 --> 00:34:34,738
Get home safely, then.

533
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,328
 Oppa, 

534
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,478
 I'm the one who was cruel to you. 

535
00:35:07,478 --> 00:35:10,778
 I'm the one who always betrayed you, too. 

536
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:15,479
 But why don't you blame me? 

537
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:19,389
 I'm the one who's truly at fault. 

538
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:23,469
 Why do you keep saying you're sorry? 

539
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:25,069
 Why? 

540
00:36:05,191 --> 00:36:07,029
Hey, you bastard.

541
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:12,409
Why are you packing Grandma and Ji Yeong's clothes?

542
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:16,069
Mom, were you awake?

543
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:17,899
You know where Ji Yeong lives, right?

544
00:36:17,899 --> 00:36:19,759
You're on your way to meet her, right?

545
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:21,329
Where's that place?

546
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:22,779
Mom, the thing is—

547
00:36:22,779 --> 00:36:26,019
Where did she move to, you punk!

548
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:30,419
She told me not to tell you.

549
00:36:30,419 --> 00:36:32,249
Hey, Kim Ji Yeong!

550
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:39,139
Wow, are you two on your way from a bathhouse without me?

551
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:40,769
And you were even humming, too?

552
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:44,639
Hey, meanie. What are you doing here?

553
00:36:45,461 --> 00:36:46,889
Oppa.

554
00:36:46,889 --> 00:36:51,009
Ji Yeong, I'm so sorry. I had no choice.

555
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:56,889
Wow, there are three bedrooms and two bathrooms here.

556
00:36:56,889 --> 00:37:01,439
And there's a bed and desk in that room, too.

557
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:05,349
How crude of you to look inside someone else's room.

558
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:08,719
That's Do Jun's room, okay?

559
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:11,459
What? Do Jun's room?

560
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:13,959
Ji Yeong, did you set up a room for him, too?

561
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:15,479
Why don't you live with us, then?

562
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:17,959
You have a living room and three bedrooms here.

563
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:19,429
How could you do this?

564
00:37:19,429 --> 00:37:24,259
I got this place with my money...

565
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:27,399
because I wanted to live with my granddaughter.

566
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:30,649
Why exactly should I live with you?

567
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:35,209
Ahjumma, we need to talk.

568
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:38,049
Oppa, please care for my grandma.

569
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:41,189
Grandma, watch TV with Oppa, okay?

570
00:37:41,189 --> 00:37:43,579
Okay.

571
00:37:49,151 --> 00:37:53,479
Ji Yeong, I'm your mom, but you abandoned me.

572
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:56,829
What are you doing with that grandma who's practically a stranger?

573
00:37:56,829 --> 00:38:00,719
She's not a stranger. She's my grandma.

574
00:38:01,511 --> 00:38:03,249
It's because you don't remember.

575
00:38:03,249 --> 00:38:06,979
When you were Do Ra, you always put me first.

576
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:09,639
You only cared about me.

577
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:13,689
Ji Yeong, you'll regret this once you get your memory back.

578
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:15,739
That's why you need to live with us.

579
00:38:15,739 --> 00:38:18,649
That way, we'd grow attached and get your memory back, too.

580
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:21,429
No, I don't want to.

581
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:24,359
What? Why?

582
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:28,379
My grandma dislikes you... and I haven't gotten my memory back.

583
00:38:28,379 --> 00:38:32,189
It doesn't feel like you're my mom, and I feel so uncomfortable.

584
00:38:32,189 --> 00:38:37,169
So, I think we'd better live apart for now.

585
00:38:37,921 --> 00:38:39,321
Please leave now.

586
00:38:39,321 --> 00:38:40,811
Ji Yeong, Ji Yeong!

587
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,469
If so,

588
00:38:42,469 --> 00:38:48,399
tell Jae Dong to keep sending your income to my bank account.

589
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:50,249
I should manage your money.

590
00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:53,509
You won't be able to because you'd be too busy.

591
00:38:53,509 --> 00:38:54,939
Why would I do that?

592
00:38:54,939 --> 00:38:57,769
Why would you manage the money I make, Ahjumma?

593
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:00,979
I'm not "Ahjumma." I'm your mom! Your mom!

594
00:39:00,979 --> 00:39:06,569
I'm an adult... and I should manage the money I make.

595
00:39:06,569 --> 00:39:08,279
What's wrong with you?

596
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,619
Hey, you stepmother.

597
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:16,439
How dare you say you'd manage the money she makes?

598
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:21,579
It's not like you're related to her or anything.

599
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:23,079
Get out of my house immediately!

600
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:24,419
Get out right now!

601
00:39:24,419 --> 00:39:27,719
You stay out of this! Why are you butting in, anyway?

602
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:30,719
What did you say? You bitch. Get out.

603
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:33,459
- Get out! Get out! 
 - Mom, stop!

604
00:39:33,459 --> 00:39:35,769
- Stop, Mom! 
 - What's wrong with you?

605
00:39:35,769 --> 00:39:37,089
- Ji Yeong. 
 - Mom, come out!

606
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:38,749
How could you do this to me?

607
00:39:38,749 --> 00:39:40,379
- Hey, Ji Yeong! 
 - Come out!

608
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:42,569
- Hey, Ji Yeong! 
 - Get out. Get out.

609
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:44,219
- Let go! 
 - Get out, I said!

610
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:48,309
 Let go! Ji Yeong! 

611
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:53,209
Let go! Let go! Let go of me.

612
00:39:53,209 --> 00:39:55,139
Ji Yeong must've lost her mind.

613
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:56,989
How could she do this to her mom?

614
00:39:56,989 --> 00:39:59,639
I know she doesn't have a memory, but we aren't strangers.

615
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:02,339
Mom, please!

616
00:40:02,851 --> 00:40:05,759
Let her do what she wants to do this time.

617
00:40:07,221 --> 00:40:09,339
We suddenly showed up, saying we were her family.

618
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:12,469
I needed money for beating up someone, and you owed money to a loan shark.

619
00:40:12,469 --> 00:40:14,419
I'd also want to move out if I were her!

620
00:40:14,419 --> 00:40:16,989
I completely understand why she's doing that.

621
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:19,069
Hey, but still!

622
00:40:19,069 --> 00:40:21,969
Why would she abandon her mom to live with that old lady?

623
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:23,879
Do you think this makes sense?

624
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:29,269
And she says she'll manage her income herself, too!

625
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:30,519
How are we supposed to live, then?

626
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,699
When will we ever buy a house?

627
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:37,601
Talk to Ji Yeong so I can at least manage her bank account.

628
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,211
Please, Do Sik.

629
00:40:40,219 --> 00:40:41,879
Mom...

630
00:40:42,871 --> 00:40:46,169
I'll make money somehow and buy you a house. So, go.

631
00:40:46,169 --> 00:40:48,499
Stop harassing Ji Yeong and leave, please!

632
00:40:48,499 --> 00:40:51,169
When... When will you ever buy a house?

633
00:40:51,169 --> 00:40:53,579
- I'll buy it for you! Just go! 
 - You bastard!

634
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:03,795
   

635
00:41:18,705 --> 00:41:20,085
   

636
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:28,405
Ji Yeong, can I come in?

637
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,635
Grandma, you're back to yourself.

638
00:41:32,635 --> 00:41:34,575
Yes, I'm back.

639
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:38,085
I feel a bit impatient because of that.

640
00:41:38,085 --> 00:41:41,055
You feel impatient? What do you mean?

641
00:41:41,055 --> 00:41:43,945
Here. Take this.

642
00:41:43,945 --> 00:41:47,075
This is all yours. Use it when you need it.

643
00:41:47,075 --> 00:41:50,465
What's this? How is this mine?

644
00:41:50,465 --> 00:41:53,845
Whenever I came back to my senses,

645
00:41:53,845 --> 00:42:00,345
I put the money from the sales of the country house, restaurant, and land in here.

646
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:05,045
Why are you giving this to me?

647
00:42:05,045 --> 00:42:07,800
Who else would I give it to?

648
00:42:08,495 --> 00:42:10,355
Grandma.

649
00:42:10,355 --> 00:42:15,525
I was planning to give this to you sooner.

650
00:42:15,525 --> 00:42:19,525
But since I keep losing my sanity,

651
00:42:19,525 --> 00:42:21,745
I've forgotten to do this.

652
00:42:21,745 --> 00:42:25,795
That's why I'm giving it to you now.

653
00:42:25,795 --> 00:42:29,985
Hey, it's still a relief...

654
00:42:29,985 --> 00:42:33,935
that I didn't put this in the trash.

655
00:42:33,935 --> 00:42:35,775
Don't you think?

656
00:42:35,775 --> 00:42:40,295
Here. So take it. Take it.

657
00:42:41,595 --> 00:42:49,205
I'll be losing my mind more from now on.

658
00:42:49,205 --> 00:42:56,245
I'll definitely put this in the trash then.

659
00:42:56,245 --> 00:42:58,805
Don't you think?

660
00:42:58,805 --> 00:43:00,335
Grandma.

661
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,945
Aigoo, why are you crying?

662
00:43:03,945 --> 00:43:06,335
Come on.

663
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:08,765
Aigoo, my baby.

664
00:43:08,765 --> 00:43:11,625
Aigoo, stop. Stop.

665
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,735
Aigoo...

666
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,660
Also...

667
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:23,950
that bastard named Gong or something.

668
00:43:23,955 --> 00:43:31,185
It looked like you were dating him because of money.

669
00:43:31,185 --> 00:43:34,905
Ji Yeong, don't. Okay?

670
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:40,545
You'd better pay him back that money first thing.

671
00:43:40,545 --> 00:43:47,495
There's nothing worse than dating someone you don't like.

672
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,555
Aigoo, there...

673
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:56,225
Thank you, Grandma.

674
00:43:56,225 --> 00:44:00,735
Aigoo, seriously. Goodness...

675
00:44:00,735 --> 00:44:03,995
Pardon? Ji Yeong moved out?

676
00:44:03,995 --> 00:44:07,245
She wants to live with that old lady from now on.

677
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,005
I suppose living in this tiny room together isn't right.

678
00:44:13,005 --> 00:44:16,715
I wondered why you lived together when you weren't even a family.

679
00:44:16,715 --> 00:44:22,445
But how could she move without even discussing it with me, her boyfriend?

680
00:44:22,445 --> 00:44:25,635
She won't answer my calls or texts.

681
00:44:25,635 --> 00:44:29,545
President Baek, where did she move to?

682
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,795
Speak of the devil.

683
00:44:37,795 --> 00:44:40,795
What? Did she text you?

684
00:44:40,795 --> 00:44:44,615
 President Gong, please send me your bank account number. 

685
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,655
She wants my bank account number?

686
00:44:48,655 --> 00:44:52,055
Why is she suddenly asking me that?

687
00:44:52,055 --> 00:44:56,165
She asked for your account number?

688
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,625
 What do you need that for? 

689
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:07,075
 To pay you the rest of 300 million. 

690
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,585
She's paying me 300 million back.

691
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:16,455
Why is she paying back the money I gave you?

692
00:45:17,355 --> 00:45:18,945
What did you say?

693
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:24,245
 Let's meet first. Let's talk in person. 

694
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,485
 Where should I meet you? 

695
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:34,125
President Gong, where—

696
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:38,605
Wow, that jerk won't even say goodbye.

697
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,525
By the way, what's this all about?

698
00:45:41,525 --> 00:45:43,875
How does she have 300 million?

699
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:47,685
Where did she get that huge amount of money?

700
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,185
Hey, Jae Dong.

701
00:45:57,185 --> 00:46:00,705
Did Ji Yeong already receive the rest of the payment for the drama?

702
00:46:00,705 --> 00:46:03,345
 Pardon? We just started shooting. What are you talking about? 

703
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:05,125
 She won't get the rest for a while. 

704
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,775
Right?

705
00:46:06,775 --> 00:46:09,535
How about the ad contract money, then?

706
00:46:09,535 --> 00:46:11,415
 That hasn't gone through yet, either. Why? 

707
00:46:11,415 --> 00:46:14,745
Oh, it's nothing. Thank you.

708
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,565
Wow, did she win a lottery or something?

709
00:46:18,565 --> 00:46:21,565
Why pay the 300 million back when he didn't even ask for it?

710
00:46:21,565 --> 00:46:24,125
Wow, she's crazy. She's crazy.

711
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:27,075
Why would she do this after leaving me?

712
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,925
She's out of her mind.

713
00:46:33,935 --> 00:46:36,455
I really don't understand.

714
00:46:36,455 --> 00:46:41,025
Ji Yeong, why would you repay that money?

715
00:46:41,025 --> 00:46:44,435
Of course, I invested because of you,

716
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:48,925
but I gave President Baek that money, to be exact.

717
00:46:48,925 --> 00:46:54,845
I told you last time that it's between President Baek and me.

718
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:58,835
So, give me your account number, President Gong.

719
00:47:01,725 --> 00:47:08,905
Ji Yeong, let's not talk about money or investment between us.

720
00:47:08,905 --> 00:47:11,365
Let's just talk about us.

721
00:47:11,365 --> 00:47:15,775
There are so many fun things to talk about, right?

722
00:47:17,755 --> 00:47:18,845
President Gong.

723
00:47:18,845 --> 00:47:25,240
To be honest, on your first shooting day, I prepared something way more special than this.

724
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,870
Did you know that?

725
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:31,925
But I had to cancel everything because you suddenly fainted.

726
00:47:32,775 --> 00:47:36,425
But instead...

727
00:47:38,435 --> 00:47:40,265
Ta-da.

728
00:47:40,265 --> 00:47:43,505
I still have this.

729
00:47:43,505 --> 00:47:49,375
- What's this? 
 - To celebrate your first lead role, I prepared something for you.

730
00:47:53,585 --> 00:47:56,925
Our love forever.

731
00:47:57,745 --> 00:48:00,105
 They say people don't change. 

732
00:48:00,775 --> 00:48:03,665
 You try to win people over like this. 

733
00:48:03,665 --> 00:48:06,635
 How come you haven't changed at all? 

734
00:48:06,635 --> 00:48:09,985
- Hold on, Ji Yeong. Let me put it on you. 
 - No, President Gong.

735
00:48:09,985 --> 00:48:11,925
I don't deserve a gift like this.

736
00:48:11,925 --> 00:48:14,765
I didn't come here to receive something like this.

737
00:48:16,175 --> 00:48:19,135
Ji Yeong, you don't want my gift

738
00:48:19,135 --> 00:48:23,375
and you don't like that I invested in President Baek's company.

739
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:25,975
What am I to you, exactly?

740
00:48:25,975 --> 00:48:27,995
Am I really your boyfriend?

741
00:48:27,995 --> 00:48:33,215
Ji Yeong, other women would kill to receive something like this.

742
00:48:33,215 --> 00:48:36,285
They wish they could receive something like this.

743
00:48:44,195 --> 00:48:46,025
T-Tae Hee.

744
00:48:46,025 --> 00:48:48,945
Gong Jin Dan, you...

745
00:48:48,945 --> 00:48:52,615
Why would you do this after setting our wedding date?

746
00:48:52,615 --> 00:48:57,365
I'm crazy for believing someone like you once again.

747
00:48:57,365 --> 00:48:58,985
Tae Hee!

748
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:09,415
Tae Hee! Tae Hee!

749
00:49:23,285 --> 00:49:26,585
Tae Hee! Tae Hee, it's all a misunderstanding.

750
00:49:26,585 --> 00:49:28,845
Please listen to me, Tae Hee.

751
00:49:30,995 --> 00:49:33,415
What? Misunderstanding?

752
00:49:33,415 --> 00:49:36,305
I misunderstood you saying, "Our love forever"?

753
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:42,265
- Tae Hee. 
 - Gong Jin Dan, our wedding and business deal are off.

754
00:49:42,265 --> 00:49:46,995
So, don't ever cling to me like this again.

755
00:49:49,275 --> 00:49:50,965
Tae Hee!

756
00:50:02,235 --> 00:50:07,115
I mean... she had to hear that part?

757
00:50:07,115 --> 00:50:10,645
Geez, what will I do now?

758
00:50:10,645 --> 00:50:12,845
Damn it!

759
00:50:12,845 --> 00:50:15,305
What? What's going on here?

760
00:50:15,305 --> 00:50:17,665
- Auntie, what's wrong? 
 - My goodness.

761
00:50:17,665 --> 00:50:19,225
What's going on here?

762
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:20,845
I'm home.

763
00:50:20,845 --> 00:50:24,745
Hey, you, you, you, Gong Jin Dan!

764
00:50:24,745 --> 00:50:28,555
Is it true Tae Hee caught you with someone else?

765
00:50:28,555 --> 00:50:30,885
Is that why she broke off the engagement?

766
00:50:30,885 --> 00:50:34,345
W-What did you say? She broke it off?

767
00:50:34,345 --> 00:50:36,375
Gosh, Jin Dan.

768
00:50:37,005 --> 00:50:41,195
Mom, Auntie. No, i-it's not like that.

769
00:50:41,195 --> 00:50:43,195
What do you mean it's not?

770
00:50:43,195 --> 00:50:46,645
Her parents told me that the engagement was off.

771
00:50:46,645 --> 00:50:50,715
My goodness. Jin Dan, is this all true?

772
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:53,705
- Aigoo. 
 - The engagement is off?

773
00:50:53,705 --> 00:50:56,445
Are you talking about Ilyoo Foods right now?

774
00:50:56,445 --> 00:50:58,125
Yes.

775
00:50:58,125 --> 00:51:03,895
Jin Dan pulled a crazy stunt giving some woman a diamond jewelry

776
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:07,535
and Tae Hee saw it herself.

777
00:51:07,535 --> 00:51:09,705
W-What did you say?

778
00:51:09,705 --> 00:51:13,105
Gosh, how could I live with this shame?

779
00:51:13,105 --> 00:51:17,525
You bastard. I told you to keep things clean when you date someone.

780
00:51:17,525 --> 00:51:21,045
I told you not to see multiple women and be proper.

781
00:51:21,045 --> 00:51:23,255
Why are you still like this?

782
00:51:24,775 --> 00:51:27,265
Hyung, Auntie,

783
00:51:27,265 --> 00:51:30,435
I'm not dating the woman Tae Hee saw.

784
00:51:30,435 --> 00:51:35,575
She's Angel's VIP client. That's why I gave her a gift.

785
00:51:35,575 --> 00:51:36,795
I was just managing my client.

786
00:51:36,795 --> 00:51:39,655
You'd better shut your mouth.

787
00:51:39,655 --> 00:51:44,875
You think Tae Hee broke off the engagement because she can't tell these things apart?

788
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:47,745
Chairman Gong, he's hopeless.

789
00:51:47,745 --> 00:51:52,265
He's not fit to do anything important.

790
00:51:52,265 --> 00:51:55,755
Auntie, how could you say that?

791
00:51:55,755 --> 00:52:00,105
And I warned you that the foreign real estate investment trend ended.

792
00:52:00,105 --> 00:52:01,525
What will you do about this now?

793
00:52:01,525 --> 00:52:04,475
What will you do about all this loss?

794
00:52:04,475 --> 00:52:07,915
Honey, calm down. Talk calmly.

795
00:52:07,915 --> 00:52:10,675
What are you talking about now?

796
00:52:10,675 --> 00:52:14,445
Jin Dan, did you lose more money?

797
00:52:14,445 --> 00:52:19,905
Auntie, we'll no longer consider adopting Jin Dan as of today.

798
00:52:19,905 --> 00:52:24,125
Chairman Gong, how could you change your mind like this?

799
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:27,205
He can't even keep a promise to his future in-laws.

800
00:52:27,205 --> 00:52:30,365
And he lost a fortune because he couldn't even run a company.

801
00:52:30,365 --> 00:52:33,335
He can't be trusted, and he's incompetent!

802
00:52:33,335 --> 00:52:36,615
How could I let him lead the company and family?

803
00:52:36,615 --> 00:52:40,295
I must've lost my mind for a moment.

804
00:52:40,295 --> 00:52:44,745
Yes, Chairman Gong. You're right. Forget about it.

805
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:48,455
You pathetic and foolish bastard.

806
00:52:50,895 --> 00:52:55,415
Auntie, how could you do this, too? I'm disappointed.

807
00:52:55,415 --> 00:52:58,745
Aigoo. You couldn't even seize the opportunity I gave you.

808
00:52:58,745 --> 00:53:03,145
I've totally given up on your son, too.

809
00:53:15,105 --> 00:53:16,715
What's this now?

810
00:53:16,715 --> 00:53:21,345
Ji Yeong, I heard you told President Gong you'll pay him 300 million back.

811
00:53:21,345 --> 00:53:23,905
Where did you get that money?

812
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,145
Grandma gave it to me.

813
00:53:27,975 --> 00:53:29,775
Grandma?

814
00:53:30,735 --> 00:53:32,615
Hold on, Ji Yeong.

815
00:53:32,615 --> 00:53:34,935
If you got money like that,

816
00:53:34,935 --> 00:53:38,885
you should've given it to me whether I pay President Gong back or get an apartment with it.

817
00:53:38,885 --> 00:53:42,845
How could you do this without discussing it with me?

818
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:44,655
What are you talking about?

819
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:48,345
Why should I give you that much money?

820
00:53:48,345 --> 00:53:51,855
Ji Yeong, you've always done that.

821
00:53:51,855 --> 00:53:55,695
You gave me every single penny you made.

822
00:53:55,695 --> 00:53:59,505
You should've given me any money you had.

823
00:53:59,505 --> 00:54:03,665
It's not like I would've spent all of it myself.

824
00:54:04,935 --> 00:54:06,615
 That's how... 

825
00:54:07,695 --> 00:54:10,215
 That's how we went bankrupt. 

826
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:13,475
 That's why I died. 

827
00:54:13,475 --> 00:54:16,045
 Because I trusted you. 

828
00:54:20,615 --> 00:54:22,235
Ahjumma...

829
00:54:23,445 --> 00:54:28,605
I dated President Gong because of your 500 million debt.

830
00:54:29,835 --> 00:54:33,535
To pay that back, I humiliated myself, asking for an advance.

831
00:54:33,535 --> 00:54:36,785
I've asked so many people for favors.

832
00:54:36,785 --> 00:54:39,995
But you still ask me for money all the time.

833
00:54:39,995 --> 00:54:42,645
Am I holding onto your money, Ahjumma?

834
00:54:42,645 --> 00:54:46,015
Why should I give you my money?

835
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:50,855
Ji Yeong, how could you do this to me?

836
00:54:50,855 --> 00:54:53,995
I live in a studio apartment, and you live in this nice place.

837
00:54:53,995 --> 00:54:56,465
Don't you feel sorry for me at all?

838
00:54:56,465 --> 00:55:00,865
Seriously. Of all people, how could you do this to me?

839
00:55:00,865 --> 00:55:05,425
I... I worked so hard to raise you ever since your dad died.

840
00:55:05,425 --> 00:55:08,185
How could you do this to me now?

841
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:11,985
- Ji Yeong! 
 - You meanie!

842
00:55:11,985 --> 00:55:15,715
How are you Ji Yeong's mom?

843
00:55:15,715 --> 00:55:18,575
You're her mean stepmother.

844
00:55:18,575 --> 00:55:20,815
All you do is torture her.

845
00:55:20,815 --> 00:55:23,095
Get out immediately. Get out!

846
00:55:23,095 --> 00:55:24,935
- Gosh, no! 
 - Get out!

847
00:55:24,935 --> 00:55:28,165
- What's wrong with you? 
 - Get out right now!

848
00:55:28,165 --> 00:55:30,685
 What are you doing? 

849
00:55:38,365 --> 00:55:40,525
What's with Ji Yeong?

850
00:55:40,525 --> 00:55:42,845
What's wrong with my daughter?

851
00:55:42,845 --> 00:55:47,015
She only cared about me when she was Do Ra.

852
00:55:47,015 --> 00:55:50,045
Why is she doing this? Why?

853
00:55:50,045 --> 00:55:54,075
When will Ji Yeong get her memory back?

854
00:55:54,075 --> 00:55:56,365
What's wrong with her?

855
00:55:59,915 --> 00:56:02,365
   

856
00:56:05,725 --> 00:56:08,715
People often play golf in parks these days.

857
00:56:08,715 --> 00:56:13,605
So, I'm thinking of having an event at a store.

858
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:17,705
What a great proposal.

859
00:56:17,705 --> 00:56:19,485
Go ahead and proceed.

860
00:56:19,485 --> 00:56:22,395
Yes, got it, Chairman.

861
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,820
Wow, look at this...

862
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,590
   

863
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:32,735
Thank you.

864
00:56:33,285 --> 00:56:35,335
I'll take this one.

865
00:56:35,335 --> 00:56:39,885
A gift comes with all new product purchases.

866
00:56:39,885 --> 00:56:41,575
My gosh.

867
00:56:41,575 --> 00:56:44,535
I like what she's wearing.

868
00:56:44,535 --> 00:56:46,105
Isn't it nice?

869
00:56:46,105 --> 00:56:48,495
It's a new line that just came out.

870
00:56:48,495 --> 00:56:51,915
I think it'd suit both of you well.

871
00:56:56,595 --> 00:56:57,845
You made it.

872
00:56:57,845 --> 00:56:59,655
How's the event coming along?

873
00:56:59,655 --> 00:57:01,485
It's going very well.

874
00:57:01,485 --> 00:57:03,505
The customers seem happy, too.

875
00:57:04,285 --> 00:57:05,765
Good work, Honey.

876
00:57:05,765 --> 00:57:08,125
Should we get dinner before we go home?

877
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:10,405
Yes, sounds good.

878
00:57:16,075 --> 00:57:17,985
You were amazing today.

879
00:57:17,985 --> 00:57:20,445
The event was a huge hit, too.

880
00:57:20,445 --> 00:57:22,725
Come on, Honey.

881
00:57:22,725 --> 00:57:23,905
What would you like to eat?

882
00:57:23,905 --> 00:57:26,795
Should we watch a musical after the meal like we used to?

883
00:57:26,795 --> 00:57:28,615
Yes, sounds good.

884
00:57:28,615 --> 00:57:31,575
How about we get pasta near the venue?

885
00:57:31,575 --> 00:57:33,685
Sounds good.

886
00:57:33,685 --> 00:57:36,065
What show would you like to watch?

887
00:57:36,655 --> 00:57:40,635
I'd be happy to watch anything with you.

888
00:58:02,615 --> 00:58:06,145
Chairman, are you awake?

889
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:09,115
Soo Yeon.

890
00:58:09,725 --> 00:58:12,655
How's my wife?

891
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,745
She's right next to you.

892
00:58:19,185 --> 00:58:22,695
Looks like she's waking up now, too.

893
00:58:24,005 --> 00:58:25,845
Honey,

894
00:58:27,425 --> 00:58:29,255
are you okay?

895
00:58:30,855 --> 00:58:32,595
Yes, Honey.

896
00:58:32,595 --> 00:58:34,835
How about you?

897
00:58:35,475 --> 00:58:37,645
I'm okay, too.

898
00:58:40,615 --> 00:58:42,795
Doctor,

899
00:58:42,795 --> 00:58:46,915
is she really okay?

900
00:58:46,915 --> 00:58:49,955
Yes, we ran a few tests...

901
00:58:49,955 --> 00:58:53,265
and thankfully, you're both completely fine.

902
00:58:53,265 --> 00:58:55,835
I'm glad it wasn't a major accident.

903
00:58:55,835 --> 00:59:01,625
Once you relax and finish the IV treatment, you can go home.

904
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:03,185
Well, then.

905
00:59:09,685 --> 00:59:11,735
Honey...

906
00:59:11,735 --> 00:59:15,835
the Heavens helped us.

907
00:59:35,975 --> 00:59:38,545
Honey, what's wrong? Are you okay?

908
00:59:38,545 --> 00:59:40,305
Are you okay, Honey?

909
00:59:40,305 --> 00:59:42,645
Do you want to go to the hospital?

910
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:44,685
No...

911
00:59:44,685 --> 00:59:46,755
that's not why.

912
00:59:47,995 --> 00:59:51,170
To be honest, the moment I got into the accident,

913
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:54,885
I could only think of Ma Ri's face.

914
00:59:56,975 --> 01:00:01,255
If something terrible happened to both of us together,

915
01:00:02,495 --> 01:00:04,985
what would happen to our Ma Ri?

916
01:00:06,685 --> 01:00:09,085
But nothing happened to us, Honey.

917
01:00:09,085 --> 01:00:11,865
Why would you think about something like that?

918
01:00:11,865 --> 01:00:13,645
No.

919
01:00:13,645 --> 01:00:17,265
We don't know what would happen to us.

920
01:00:17,265 --> 01:00:19,375
We're getting old, too.

921
01:00:20,275 --> 01:00:22,905
We were lucky today,

922
01:00:24,585 --> 01:00:29,615
but if we died from a serious accident,

923
01:00:30,775 --> 01:00:34,335
what would happen to Ma Ri and our family?

924
01:00:35,475 --> 01:00:38,225
I felt hopeless for a moment.

925
01:00:38,225 --> 01:00:42,355
Don't worry about that already. We can start preparing for it.

926
01:00:42,355 --> 01:00:44,675
How could we prepare?

927
01:00:44,675 --> 01:00:48,485
There's no one to protect the company and Ma Ri.

928
01:00:50,545 --> 01:00:56,915
Let's find someone nice for Ma Ri again, then.

929
01:00:57,715 --> 01:00:59,705
No.

930
01:00:59,705 --> 01:01:01,995
As Auntie said,

931
01:01:03,975 --> 01:01:05,975
we can't just trust anyone.

932
01:01:05,975 --> 01:01:08,845
And we've tried.

933
01:01:08,845 --> 01:01:10,945
It's not so easy.

934
01:01:15,075 --> 01:01:16,695
Honey,

935
01:01:17,865 --> 01:01:19,735
do you know...

936
01:01:20,735 --> 01:01:23,015
who I thought of...

937
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:27,005
the moment the accident happened?

938
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,905
Who?

939
01:01:30,435 --> 01:01:33,915
It wasn't Auntie or Jin Dan.

940
01:01:36,045 --> 01:01:38,675
I thought of Pil Sung.

941
01:01:40,585 --> 01:01:43,385
He's the only person...

942
01:01:44,415 --> 01:01:47,045
who'd be by Ma Ri's side.

943
01:01:47,045 --> 01:01:49,425
Honey...

944
01:01:49,425 --> 01:01:52,225
what do you mean by that?

945
01:01:52,225 --> 01:01:56,045
Pil Sung is Ma Ri's brother.

946
01:01:57,095 --> 01:01:59,305
He's your son.

947
01:02:00,865 --> 01:02:03,855
If he's your son, he's my son, too.

948
01:02:07,955 --> 01:02:09,565
Honey.

949
01:02:16,965 --> 01:02:18,665
Ji Yeong,

950
01:02:21,035 --> 01:02:23,325
what does this all mean?

951
01:02:24,505 --> 01:02:26,835
You left...

952
01:02:26,835 --> 01:02:30,705
the necklace because you left in a hurry. So I brought it.

953
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,835
And this envelope...

954
01:02:34,435 --> 01:02:35,995
contains 300 million.

955
01:02:35,995 --> 01:02:37,465
So?

956
01:02:38,495 --> 01:02:41,145
Are you breaking up with me after giving me this money?

957
01:02:41,145 --> 01:02:45,575
President Gong, this is the right thing to do.

958
01:02:45,575 --> 01:02:50,605
It's silly that you've been pursuing me while seeing another woman.

959
01:02:50,605 --> 01:02:54,255
I was dating you because I thought you broke up with her.

960
01:02:55,725 --> 01:02:57,575
We should...

961
01:03:03,195 --> 01:03:05,045
call it quits now.

962
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:10,885
Hey, Kim Ji Yeong.

963
01:03:10,885 --> 01:03:12,815
I mean, Ji Yeong...

964
01:03:12,815 --> 01:03:14,715
Why are you doing this to me?

965
01:03:14,715 --> 01:03:17,575
I ended everything. It's completely over.

966
01:03:17,575 --> 01:03:21,035
I swear I lost everything because of you.

967
01:03:21,035 --> 01:03:24,135
I broke off the engagement with her that day. And my family blew up on me.

968
01:03:24,135 --> 01:03:29,555
Anyway, I chose you in the end, Ji Yeong.

969
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:33,645
My relationship with Tae Hee was arranged by our families.

970
01:03:33,645 --> 01:03:37,535
You were the only one I was ever interested in.

971
01:03:37,535 --> 01:03:41,635
- This is the truth. 
 - Don't lie so easily.

972
01:03:43,135 --> 01:03:45,465
I'll get going now.

973
01:03:55,835 --> 01:04:00,185
What? "Don't lie so easily"?

974
01:04:04,175 --> 01:04:06,075
By the way,

975
01:04:07,245 --> 01:04:10,725
is it because she's not speaking with an accent?

976
01:04:10,725 --> 01:04:12,745
She looks like a different person.

977
01:04:12,745 --> 01:04:14,775
She looks sophisticated.

978
01:04:16,685 --> 01:04:19,185
Is she the Kim Ji Yeong I know?

979
01:04:32,505 --> 01:04:34,635
She's really going for it.

980
01:04:34,635 --> 01:04:37,825
Looks like she's determined to break up with me.

981
01:04:40,325 --> 01:04:47,865
By the way, where did Kim Ji Yeong suddenly get 300 million from?

982
01:04:53,095 --> 01:04:54,745
By chance...

983
01:04:58,025 --> 01:04:59,815
Could it be...

984
01:05:06,055 --> 01:05:08,195
Hey, Go Pil Sung.

985
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:11,065
Do you think I made you the CEO to spend money like this?

986
01:05:11,065 --> 01:05:14,355
Help me understand. Provide some context.

987
01:05:14,355 --> 01:05:16,445
The 300 million won.

988
01:05:18,745 --> 01:05:21,825
You want to play ignorant?

989
01:05:21,825 --> 01:05:25,245
You gave this to Kim Ji Yeong, didn't you?

990
01:05:25,245 --> 01:05:28,795
You told her to take this money and break up with me!

991
01:05:28,795 --> 01:05:31,215
Did you think I wouldn't know that?

992
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:39,855
What did you just say?

993
01:05:39,855 --> 01:05:42,655
Are you saying Ms. Kim has been...

994
01:05:43,685 --> 01:05:46,585
seeing you because of money?

995
01:05:47,265 --> 01:05:50,385
   

996
01:05:50,385 --> 01:05:52,745
♫  And tell you  ♫

997
01:05:52,745 --> 01:05:58,045
♫  I call for you again  ♫

998
01:05:58,045 --> 01:06:00,405
♫  My love  ♫

999
01:06:00,405 --> 01:06:05,505
♫  My last tears you won't get to see  ♫

1000
01:06:05,505 --> 01:06:08,675
♫  I'll hold you tightly  ♫

1001
01:06:08,675 --> 01:06:10,975
♫  And let you go  ♫

1002
01:06:10,975 --> 01:06:16,365
♫  I call for you again  ♫

1003
01:06:16,365 --> 01:06:18,635
♫  My love  ♫

1004
01:06:18,635 --> 01:06:22,485
♫  I say, "I love you," but you can't hear it  ♫

1005
01:06:22,485 --> 01:06:24,675
 What's going on? 

1006
01:06:24,675 --> 01:06:29,795
 The chairman of APP Group wants us to consider them family. 

1007
01:06:29,795 --> 01:06:32,525
 You were at Seon Yeong's house? 

1008
01:06:32,525 --> 01:06:34,185
 Why did you do that without telling me? 

1009
01:06:34,185 --> 01:06:36,985
 President Gong paid CEO Baek's private loan debt? 

1010
01:06:36,985 --> 01:06:42,285
 Instead of lending money to that meanie stepmother, 

1011
01:06:42,285 --> 01:06:45,175
 he demanded to date Ji Yeong, apparently. 

1012
01:06:45,175 --> 01:06:49,055
 I'll never get my memory back, and I'll never go back to you. 

1013
01:06:49,055 --> 01:06:50,395
 Stop waiting for me. 

1014
01:06:50,395 --> 01:06:53,775
 It's okay if you don't like me. I like you a lot. 

1015
01:06:53,775 --> 01:06:56,025
 That's why I want to protect you.
