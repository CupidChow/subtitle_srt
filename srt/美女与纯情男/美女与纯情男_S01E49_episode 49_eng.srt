1
00:00:47,987 --> 00:00:50,017
   

2
00:00:53,397 --> 00:00:55,537
Mom.

3
00:00:55,537 --> 00:00:57,937
Jin Dan, are you okay?

4
00:00:57,937 --> 00:01:00,617
Why do you look like this?

5
00:01:03,387 --> 00:01:05,157
I'm okay.

6
00:01:05,157 --> 00:01:09,847
By the way, you said we have money to leave together?

7
00:01:09,847 --> 00:01:11,867
Where did you get that much money?

8
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:14,027
Here's the money.

9
00:01:14,027 --> 00:01:16,457
Your brother gave it to me.

10
00:01:16,457 --> 00:01:19,037
He gave you this money?

11
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:23,847
Yes. He said the family and company would look bad if you get arrested.

12
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:26,397
He told us to leave the country, no matter what.

13
00:01:26,397 --> 00:01:29,647
He said you attempted to kill Park Do Ra, too.

14
00:01:29,647 --> 00:01:32,547
That's not true, right, Jin Dan?

15
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:35,877
I didn't do it. I didn't do it. Do you think I'm crazy?

16
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:38,097
Gong Jin Dan!

17
00:01:40,047 --> 00:01:42,207
Mom.

18
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:43,777
Did you let him follow you?

19
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:46,077
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:46,077 --> 00:01:47,907
Shit.

21
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,437
So, this money was a bait?

22
00:01:50,437 --> 00:01:52,587
What? Bait?

23
00:01:52,587 --> 00:01:54,147
Mom, run.

24
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,577
Mom, run!

25
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:59,627
Gong Jin Dan!

26
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:02,967
Run, Mom!

27
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:04,967
Run faster!

28
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:08,217
Mom.

29
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:10,167
Mom, are you okay?

30
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:12,287
- Why did you wear heels? 
 - I can't go.

31
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:14,047
Hurry up.

32
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:16,717
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

33
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:19,567
Pil Sung, don't go after Jin Dan!

34
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:23,007
Let him go! Don't catch him!

35
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:25,957
Move! Move! Move!

36
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:31,517
Catch that man!

37
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:33,677
He's a criminal!

38
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:36,587
He's the criminal who hurt Park Do Ra!

39
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:38,957
Don't come!

40
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:40,737
Don't come!

41
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,487
Shit.

42
00:02:45,487 --> 00:02:48,940
It's him! It's that bastard!

43
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:59,090


44
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:10,327
He's the one who drove Park Do Ra to kill herself!

45
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:12,777
- You bastard. 
 - It's him!

46
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:16,777
So what if you're a chaebol? Huh?

47
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:23,647
Police?

48
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:25,537
I'd like to make a report.

49
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:30,647
I caught Gong Jin Dan, who's wanted for embezzlement and attempted murder.

50
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:32,497
Please hurry over.

51
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,907
Over here! Over here!

52
00:03:38,907 --> 00:03:40,767
Please leave now.

53
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:42,267
Grab him.

54
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:44,347
He had to be caught.

55
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:51,917
He... He... Go Pil Sung, that bastard.

56
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:53,587
He's the one who beat me like this.

57
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:55,907
Arrest him, too. Arrest him, too!

58
00:03:55,907 --> 00:03:58,517
I'll never settle with that bastard.

59
00:03:58,517 --> 00:04:01,077
Hey, he didn't hit you!

60
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:03,267
He's barking like a dog.

61
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:05,807
- He's lying! 
 - You bastard!

62
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:08,767
You made Park Do Ra jump into the ocean.

63
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:13,137
Are you that upset about getting hit a few times? You terrible bastard.

64
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:15,137
That's enough!

65
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:18,167
Gong Ji Dan, you're arrested for libel,

66
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:21,967
instigating defamation, embezzlement, and attempted murder.

67
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:23,257
- Take his bag. 
 - It's mine!

68
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:26,487
- Take it. 
 - It's mine, you bastard!

69
00:04:26,487 --> 00:04:29,397
You have the right to an attorney and have a chance to defend yourself.

70
00:04:29,397 --> 00:04:33,177
You have the right to remain silent, and you can file a wrongful arrest complaint to the court.

71
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:35,947
- Let's go. 
 - Hold on. Why are you only arresting me?

72
00:04:35,947 --> 00:04:37,757
I said that bastard beat me up like this!

73
00:04:37,757 --> 00:04:40,017
Arrest that bastard, too! Arrest him!

74
00:04:40,017 --> 00:04:41,767
Arrest him, too!

75
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,777
Go Pil Sung, you bastard!

76
00:04:43,777 --> 00:04:45,517
Hey!

77
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:48,227
Hey! Hey!

78
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:53,367
   

79
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:56,167
My gosh, my gosh. This says...

80
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:59,297
Pil Sung caught Gong Jin Dan.

81
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:01,157
What do they mean by this?

82
00:05:01,157 --> 00:05:03,547
How did Pil Sung do that?

83
00:05:03,547 --> 00:05:07,167
I don't know the details, either, but according to the article,

84
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:12,657
Pil Sung and over 30 citizens went after him and caught him together.

85
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:15,447
- My gosh. 
 - He was beaten to a pulp.

86
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:19,837
He got beaten because there were too many people, but they don't know who beat him.

87
00:05:19,837 --> 00:05:22,057
And everyone said they didn't know who hit him.

88
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:23,077
My goodness.

89
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:27,597
They beat him up because they must've been so angry.

90
00:05:27,597 --> 00:05:32,617
It's a relief that they caught him, but APP Group is a mess right now.

91
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:34,127
Why? Why?

92
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:36,457
Gong Jin Dan framed Park Do Ra for prostitution.

93
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:39,097
Gong Jin Dan also attempted to kill Park Do Ra.

94
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:41,947
People are boycotting APP Group right now.

95
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:44,967
They're protesting in front of the office, and their stock value plummeted.

96
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:47,027
It's a total, utter chaos right now.

97
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:52,257
Hey, by the way, what does APP Group have to do with Gong Jin Dan?

98
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:56,857
Gong Jin Dan isn't Gong Jin Dan. He's Jin Jin Dan now.

99
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:01,307
Only we know that, but people don't know that.

100
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:03,447
Seriously.

101
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:08,307
Pil Sung managed to become the adoptive son of APP Group.

102
00:06:08,307 --> 00:06:11,227
Can't believe this is happening right now.

103
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,280
   

104
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:35,927
Do Ra, now that he got arrested, let's forget about it now.

105
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:37,367
Let's forget.

106
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:41,837
How could I forget?

107
00:06:46,747 --> 00:06:48,317
Oppa,

108
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:51,877
please take me to that bastard.

109
00:06:52,857 --> 00:06:56,467
There's something I want to ask him in person.

110
00:06:57,007 --> 00:07:00,157
I want to ask him why he did this to me.

111
00:07:00,157 --> 00:07:01,587
Why he took it so far.

112
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:06,027
- Noona, Noona... 
 - Do Ra, Do Ra, hold on.

113
00:07:10,317 --> 00:07:11,967
Oppa.

114
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:15,837
Do Jun.

115
00:07:16,257 --> 00:07:22,897
I want to see him and slap him in the face just once,

116
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:26,177
but I can't move.

117
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:29,337
I can't control my body.

118
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:37,147
Do Ra, don't cry because of a bastard like him.

119
00:07:37,147 --> 00:07:38,317
He's over now.

120
00:07:38,317 --> 00:07:41,667
He'll rot in jail forever, and he'll never show up in front of you.

121
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:45,637
And why bother seeing a piece of trash like him? It'd only ruin your eyes.

122
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:49,747
So, let's move on now. Move on. Okay?

123
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:52,747
Yes, Noona.

124
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:56,377
Everyone knows he framed you for prostitution now.

125
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:59,967
And everything he's done has been revealed.

126
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:04,107
Do you know how many people are cheering for you right now?

127
00:08:04,107 --> 00:08:06,607
They want you to get up quickly.

128
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:11,127
There are thousands of comments every day telling you to cheer up. So,

129
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:13,737
let's cheer up a bit more, Noona.

130
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:24,467
What's the point?

131
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:28,307
What's the point?

132
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:34,567
He was arrested, but I can't even get up.

133
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:38,377
Oppa.

134
00:08:38,957 --> 00:08:40,957
Do Jun.

135
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:45,207
How am I supposed to live now?

136
00:08:46,077 --> 00:08:49,467
What am I supposed to do now?

137
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:19,547
Hello, I'm Gong Jin Taek, the chairman of APP Group.

138
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:23,687
The former CEO Gong Jin Dan of Angel Investment,

139
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:29,417
a subsidiary company of APP Group, caused a lot of issues lately.

140
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:32,837
I sincerely apologize for that.

141
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:50,067
There have been a few misunderstandings about APP Group.

142
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:54,347
I'm here today to correct those misunderstandings.

143
00:09:55,297 --> 00:10:02,717
Gong Jin Dan, the former CEO, has nothing to do with Angel Investment anymore.

144
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:05,477
The board of directors already dismissed him.

145
00:10:05,477 --> 00:10:12,287
And he has nothing to do with my family, either.

146
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:18,647
Gong Jin Dan, the former CEO, is not my biological brother.

147
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:25,587
Let me show you the DNA test result.

148
00:10:25,587 --> 00:10:27,447
   

149
00:10:34,497 --> 00:10:36,387
 It's true. 

150
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:44,517
I've believed Gong Jin Dan was my younger brother my whole life.

151
00:10:44,517 --> 00:10:50,447
But recently, I learned he was not the son of my father,

152
00:10:50,447 --> 00:10:56,267
the founding chairman of APP Group, Gong Dae Gil.

153
00:10:56,267 --> 00:11:01,607
He deceived me and the entire family and scarred us forever.

154
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:05,937
I couldn't forgive him for the heinous crimes he had committed.

155
00:11:05,937 --> 00:11:13,597
There's currently a lawsuit to take back Angel Investment as well, which he inherited.

156
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:18,457
And there's an adoption cancellation lawsuit happening, too.

157
00:11:19,757 --> 00:11:22,237
Let me make this clear one more time.

158
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:25,377
Gong Jin Dan, the former CEO...

159
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:29,887
has nothing to do with our family.

160
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:31,480
However,

161
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:38,077
I decided to personally compensate Park Do Ra as much as I can

162
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:41,797
for being victimized by Gong Jin Dan.

163
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:50,737
I'll help her the best I can until she can get up again.

164
00:11:50,737 --> 00:11:55,507
Lastly, I wish her a swift recovery.

165
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:59,687
I apologize to her sincerely once again. Thank you.

166
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:03,577
   

167
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:19,067
Noona, let's go in now.

168
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:20,817
Okay.

169
00:12:24,237 --> 00:12:25,627
Noona.

170
00:12:27,907 --> 00:12:29,087
   

171
00:12:31,537 --> 00:12:33,437
Yes, Oppa.

172
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:38,347
Yes, I'm with Do Jun.

173
00:12:38,347 --> 00:12:40,397
I'll be there now.

174
00:12:41,947 --> 00:12:44,377
Wait in the hospital room.

175
00:12:57,887 --> 00:12:59,777
Hey, did you get some fresh air?

176
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:01,547
Yes, Hyung.

177
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,997
Do Jun, let's switch now.

178
00:13:03,997 --> 00:13:05,197
Okay.

179
00:13:05,197 --> 00:13:07,807
Noona, I'll be back later.

180
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:10,237
It's okay. You don't have to come back today.

181
00:13:10,237 --> 00:13:12,237
The caretaker lady is coming later, too.

182
00:13:12,237 --> 00:13:14,927
Okay, call me later.

183
00:13:15,717 --> 00:13:18,337
- I'll go now. 
 - Okay, see you.

184
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:31,337
Do Ra, you also saw the article, right?

185
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:35,087
Yes.

186
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:37,147
I did.

187
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:39,937
You caught Gong Jin Dan.

188
00:13:41,077 --> 00:13:43,327
Thank you, Oppa.

189
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:46,077
Thank you so much.

190
00:13:47,137 --> 00:13:51,627
A lot of my resentment has been relieved, thanks to you.

191
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:57,227
I'll never forget how grateful I am to you,

192
00:13:57,227 --> 00:14:01,037
for the rest of my life.

193
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:09,437
Do Ra,

194
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:15,837
Gong Jin Dan, that bastard, could never hurt you again.

195
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:21,357
Do Ra,

196
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,647
I know it's very hard,

197
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:27,687
but let's cheer up again.

198
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:35,017
You'll be able to get up if you work hard on physical therapy.

199
00:14:35,017 --> 00:14:39,627
I'll make sure you walk again.

200
00:14:41,157 --> 00:14:44,797
I'll always be by your side, okay?

201
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,917
Okay.

202
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:54,517
Sounds good.

203
00:14:59,027 --> 00:15:03,277
I'm suddenly feeling hungry, Oppa.

204
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:06,697
Really? What do you want to eat?

205
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,327
Just tell me. I'll get you anything.

206
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:17,107
I want choux buns, blueberry yogurt,

207
00:15:17,107 --> 00:15:19,057
and also coffee.

208
00:15:19,057 --> 00:15:23,197
Okay, got it. I'll get you all that. Wait just a moment.

209
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:46,757
Yogurt and coffee.

210
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:42,757
Do Ra, I—

211
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:48,817
Where did she go?

212
00:16:51,297 --> 00:16:54,347
Did Do Jun come back and take her for a walk?

213
00:17:03,387 --> 00:17:07,397
Do Jun, it's me. Did you take Do Ra with you?

214
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:10,527
 No, I'm at the kalguksu shop now. 

215
00:17:11,387 --> 00:17:13,367
Is Do Sik there, too?

216
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,607
 Yes, he's here, too. 

217
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:19,357
 Why? Is she not there? 

218
00:17:20,197 --> 00:17:26,057
No, I stepped out to get some pastry, but she's not in her room.

219
00:17:26,057 --> 00:17:28,697
I'll look for her. She probably went out to get fresh air.

220
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:31,727
Yes, don't worry. Okay.

221
00:17:51,557 --> 00:17:53,347
Good evening.

222
00:17:53,347 --> 00:17:56,587
Patient Park Do Ra isn't in her room. Is she receiving a test or something?

223
00:17:56,587 --> 00:18:00,607
No, all the tests on her ended in the morning.

224
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:02,017
Pardon?

225
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:06,917
Where could she be, then? Have you seen her, by chance?

226
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:09,297
She was in her room just now, but she's gone.

227
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,127
Excuse me, Park Do Ra just...

228
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:16,117
left the hospital in her wheelchair.

229
00:18:16,117 --> 00:18:19,147
- Pardon? She left? 
 - Yes.

230
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:20,907
Thank you.

231
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:31,387
Do Ra!

232
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:33,307
Park Do Ra!

233
00:18:34,937 --> 00:18:36,757
Do Ra!

234
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:39,567
 Park Do Ra! 

235
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:42,747
 Do Ra! 

236
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:46,447
 Do Ra! 

237
00:18:48,147 --> 00:18:50,017
Park Do Ra!

238
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:52,767
Do Ra.

239
00:18:57,277 --> 00:18:58,797
Do Ra.

240
00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:04,897
Do Ra. Do Ra, are you okay? Huh?

241
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:06,887
Why did you come out alone?

242
00:19:06,887 --> 00:19:08,657
Where were you trying to go?

243
00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:10,917
You can tell me if you want to go somewhere.

244
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,817
What are you doing? It could've been dangerous!

245
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:22,967
I wanted to run away to somewhere you can't see me.

246
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:30,147
I'll go anywhere you can't see me.

247
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:32,267
What?

248
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:36,707
Park Do Ra,

249
00:19:38,457 --> 00:19:40,697
how could you be like this?

250
00:19:46,327 --> 00:19:48,427
I told you.

251
00:19:48,427 --> 00:19:51,327
I don't want to see you anymore.

252
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:54,307
I asked you to stay away from me.

253
00:19:54,307 --> 00:19:56,977
But you're refusing to do that.

254
00:19:56,977 --> 00:20:00,917
That's why I left to run away from you.

255
00:20:02,407 --> 00:20:04,727
Just look at me, Oppa.

256
00:20:05,407 --> 00:20:07,767
Just look at me.

257
00:20:09,297 --> 00:20:12,327
I can't even run away.

258
00:20:13,597 --> 00:20:16,877
I can't do anything on my own.

259
00:20:16,877 --> 00:20:20,667
I can't go anywhere on my own.

260
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:23,747
I can't do anything on my own.

261
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:27,807
Why are you with someone like me?

262
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:34,307
Please leave when I ask you to! Please!

263
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:36,637
Leave, I said!

264
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:38,917
Do Ra...

265
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:40,277
Do Ra?

266
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:43,117
I know why you're doing this.

267
00:20:44,107 --> 00:20:47,167
But this isn't good for me.

268
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:49,857
You're hurting me even more.

269
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:52,357
I like being by your side.

270
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:55,797
Do Ra,

271
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:59,427
we can do this.

272
00:20:59,427 --> 00:21:03,087
So, Do Ra, don't ever do this again.

273
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:06,067
Don't ever do it again.

274
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:10,787
♫  Love is so difficult. So difficult.  ♫

275
00:21:10,787 --> 00:21:14,227
♫  It hurts a lot  ♫

276
00:21:14,227 --> 00:21:22,657
♫  I gave my everything, but it's still not enough  ♫

277
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:42,747
Pil Sung, I know you're busy, but have a seat here.

278
00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:46,817
Okay, Father.

279
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,237
What...

280
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:57,507
will you do going forward?

281
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:00,817
What do you mean?

282
00:22:02,097 --> 00:22:04,347
I mean, Do Ra.

283
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:13,737
Father, Do Ra will definitely walk again.

284
00:22:13,737 --> 00:22:16,297
She started physical therapy, too.

285
00:22:16,297 --> 00:22:22,107
I believe she'll walk again for sure.

286
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,137
Y-Yes.

287
00:22:24,137 --> 00:22:26,277
It'd be great if she walked miraculously.

288
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:28,987
That's what we all want, too.

289
00:22:28,987 --> 00:22:33,797
But things don't always go the way you want.

290
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:38,277
W-What if she stays that way for the rest of her life?

291
00:22:39,397 --> 00:22:41,907
Why would you even ask that?

292
00:22:41,907 --> 00:22:47,997
I'll be by her side for the rest of my life, no matter what condition she's in.

293
00:22:47,997 --> 00:22:51,087
Pil Sung, that's...

294
00:22:51,087 --> 00:22:53,367
How about your life?

295
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:55,817
You have a whole life ahead of you.

296
00:22:55,817 --> 00:22:58,907
You can't let Do Ra chain you like that forever.

297
00:22:58,907 --> 00:23:03,217
Mom, what do you mean, chain me?

298
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,527
Please don't say stuff like that.

299
00:23:05,527 --> 00:23:08,367
And we've talked about this already.

300
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:12,067
I even married Do Ra in front of you and Father.

301
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:14,897
Hey, let's set this straight.

302
00:23:14,897 --> 00:23:17,217
What do you mean you married her?

303
00:23:17,217 --> 00:23:20,087
It was just a wedding, and it was interrupted.

304
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:22,367
Don't tell me stuff like this anymore.

305
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:26,267
I don't want to hear it, and I won't hear it.

306
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:28,677
I'll leave now.

307
00:23:35,077 --> 00:23:37,727
What do we do with him?

308
00:23:46,777 --> 00:23:49,247
Yes, Seon Yeong.

309
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:53,307
I was going to call you regarding Pil Sung, anyway.

310
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,827
Yes, let's meet now.

311
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:03,357
Park Do Sik, that bastard.

312
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:07,367
How could he abandon me? I worked so hard to raise them.

313
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:09,407
Gosh, this bastard.

314
00:24:17,427 --> 00:24:20,047
Hey, Park Do Sik.

315
00:24:20,047 --> 00:24:24,767
I got out of jail today, but you won't even bring me tofu?

316
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:27,857
Anyway, where's Do Ra's hospital?

317
00:24:27,857 --> 00:24:30,107
That's none of your business.

318
00:24:30,107 --> 00:24:33,387
 What? Listen to you right now. 

319
00:24:33,387 --> 00:24:36,607
I'm your mom. I need to know how my daughter is doing.

320
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:38,427
Did you say "daughter"?

321
00:24:38,427 --> 00:24:42,867
I told you to never visit or call us. Hang up!

322
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:47,277
Hey, hey, Park Do—

323
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,767
Wow, this bastard. Seriously.

324
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:52,507
Wow, who does he think I am?

325
00:24:53,997 --> 00:24:57,707
Fine, I'll find her myself.

326
00:24:57,707 --> 00:25:02,117
You think I won't be able to if you don't tell me?

327
00:25:02,117 --> 00:25:04,687
Wow, these bastards.

328
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:06,327
   

329
00:25:06,327 --> 00:25:08,197
   

330
00:25:08,197 --> 00:25:09,987
   

331
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:13,677
Noona.

332
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:23,197
Noona, you didn't finish the food earlier, either.

333
00:25:23,197 --> 00:25:26,927
I'll tell Pil Sung that you're refusing to eat if you keep doing this.

334
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:30,647
He'll leave work and run over here, then.

335
00:25:35,897 --> 00:25:40,787
Just try one slice, Noona.

336
00:25:40,787 --> 00:25:44,167
You need to eat so you get energy for treatment.

337
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,527
No, no...

338
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,197
Stay like that.

339
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:05,967
Just be comfortable.

340
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:16,397
Do Jun.

341
00:26:16,397 --> 00:26:17,977
Yes?

342
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:21,037
Go home and do what you need to do.

343
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,257
The caretaker is coming later.

344
00:26:25,057 --> 00:26:28,537
Okay, Noona. Call me later.

345
00:26:45,377 --> 00:26:47,297
Do Ra,

346
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,987
seeing you...

347
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:54,767
in bed like this...

348
00:26:55,777 --> 00:26:58,317
makes me so upset and...

349
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,857
I can't say anything.

350
00:27:08,097 --> 00:27:10,177
Do Ra,

351
00:27:13,117 --> 00:27:16,147
our Pil Sung...

352
00:27:20,297 --> 00:27:23,637
What are we supposed to do with you two?

353
00:27:23,637 --> 00:27:27,137
What do I do with you two?

354
00:27:34,597 --> 00:27:36,517
Mother,

355
00:27:40,137 --> 00:27:43,837
I know what you mean very well.

356
00:27:45,907 --> 00:27:49,527
I don't want to be a burden to him, either.

357
00:27:51,447 --> 00:27:55,837
So, I asked Pil Sung not to come here.

358
00:27:55,837 --> 00:27:58,587
I tried talking to him...

359
00:27:58,587 --> 00:28:01,527
and begged him, too,

360
00:28:01,527 --> 00:28:04,667
but he won't listen to me, Mother.

361
00:28:07,697 --> 00:28:12,787
I want to break up with him.

362
00:28:14,347 --> 00:28:17,907
Please let me break up with him.

363
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:23,957
I tried running away last night, but he caught me.

364
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:26,447
I...

365
00:28:27,347 --> 00:28:33,527
I hate that he has to see me like this more than anything, Mother.

366
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:40,067
So, I want to hide somewhere he can't find me.

367
00:28:41,827 --> 00:28:47,257
Mother, this is how I really feel.

368
00:28:47,787 --> 00:28:52,497
Please help me, Mother.

369
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,677
What do we do?

370
00:28:55,387 --> 00:28:57,667
You're going through so much already.

371
00:28:57,667 --> 00:29:01,127
I'm sorry we're making it worse.

372
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:03,987
What are you doing right now? Huh?

373
00:29:03,987 --> 00:29:09,627
Are you telling her to break up with Pil Sung because she can't walk?

374
00:29:09,627 --> 00:29:12,197
No, Mom. Don't do this.

375
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:15,297
Do Ra, look what happened to you.

376
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:19,127
She can't even walk right now. How could you do this?

377
00:29:19,127 --> 00:29:21,967
How could you be so cruel? How?

378
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:23,757
Get out if you'd do this! Get out!

379
00:29:23,757 --> 00:29:25,757
Leave! Leave! Leave right now!

380
00:29:25,757 --> 00:29:28,117
- Mom. 
 - Let's go, Seon Yeong.

381
00:29:28,117 --> 00:29:32,237
You can't just cherry-pick as you please like this!

382
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,417
Mom, that's enough!

383
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:37,297
How could they be like this?

384
00:29:37,297 --> 00:29:42,027
By the way, Do Ra, look at you. My gosh...

385
00:29:42,027 --> 00:29:43,997
Did you get paralyzed here? Your legs?

386
00:29:43,997 --> 00:29:46,857
S-So, you can't walk anymore, Do Ra?

387
00:29:46,857 --> 00:29:50,617
Gosh, what are we going to do?

388
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:53,867
- What are we going to do? 
 - Mom.

389
00:29:56,587 --> 00:30:00,177
I want to break up with Pil Sung.

390
00:30:01,807 --> 00:30:05,957
What can I do to make that happen?

391
00:30:08,177 --> 00:30:09,757
What are you talking about?

392
00:30:09,757 --> 00:30:12,647
You need to stay close to him at times like this.

393
00:30:12,647 --> 00:30:15,467
- So, you can live. 
 - I don't want to!

394
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:20,107
I hate Pil Sung seeing me like this more than anything.

395
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:25,727
I'd do anything if I could break up with him, Mom.

396
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:29,157
Mom, Mom, please...

397
00:30:29,157 --> 00:30:34,367
take me somewhere he can't find me.

398
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:36,327
Mom...

399
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:39,237
Mom, please take me away.

400
00:30:41,497 --> 00:30:43,327
What?

401
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:49,817
Mom, please take me away.

402
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:57,117
Seon Yeong, I'll talk. So, just listen.

403
00:30:57,117 --> 00:30:58,967
Okay.

404
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:03,417
Looks like she's coming to argue about what happened.

405
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,417
Geez, that woman.

406
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:09,137
She couldn't even come to the wedding because her kids cut ties with her.

407
00:31:09,137 --> 00:31:12,257
She has no right to be a mother.

408
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,897
But seeing Park Do Ra...

409
00:31:15,897 --> 00:31:20,447
at the hospital like that made me feel so sad.

410
00:31:21,487 --> 00:31:24,747
Because I got to see her in person after only reading about it.

411
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:30,127
Soo Yeon, what should I do?

412
00:31:30,127 --> 00:31:33,307
Because she's like that,

413
00:31:33,307 --> 00:31:37,177
Pil Sung would never be away from her.

414
00:31:44,157 --> 00:31:45,707
Seon Yeong.

415
00:31:57,057 --> 00:32:02,847
Do Ra must love Director Go sincerely.

416
00:32:04,457 --> 00:32:07,947
She says she doesn't want to burden him.

417
00:32:07,947 --> 00:32:13,460
She wants to run far away somewhere he can't find her.

418
00:32:14,077 --> 00:32:17,237
She begged me to help her.

419
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:20,547
I wish I could grant her wish,

420
00:32:21,387 --> 00:32:24,197
but I'm not so well off right now.

421
00:32:25,197 --> 00:32:30,447
So, I'm here to discuss it with you shamelessly.

422
00:32:31,437 --> 00:32:33,007
If you help me,

423
00:32:33,007 --> 00:32:38,507
I'll move somewhere far away with Do Ra.

424
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:41,607
Out of sight, out of mind, they say.

425
00:32:41,607 --> 00:32:46,327
I'm sure Director Go will forget Do Ra, then.

426
00:32:47,397 --> 00:32:51,477
Whether it's the countryside or abroad,

427
00:32:51,477 --> 00:32:57,817
I'll find a nursing home and live with Do Ra there.

428
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:04,197
I'll leave without even telling my sons.

429
00:33:54,097 --> 00:33:55,777
Do Ra,

430
00:33:57,747 --> 00:34:02,817
do you really want to live where no one can find you?

431
00:34:02,817 --> 00:34:05,937
Do you want to leave with me?

432
00:34:08,537 --> 00:34:10,247
Mom,

433
00:34:11,137 --> 00:34:14,037
could you really make that happen?

434
00:34:15,227 --> 00:34:20,927
I'll go anywhere Pil Sung can't find me.

435
00:34:24,117 --> 00:34:25,677
Okay.

436
00:34:27,057 --> 00:34:29,367
Let's go together.

437
00:34:56,557 --> 00:35:00,697
   

438
00:35:14,997 --> 00:35:16,497
Is Do Ra receiving a treatment?

439
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:18,177
It looks like it.

440
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:21,517
Give me.

441
00:35:26,187 --> 00:35:30,207
 Do Jun, Do Sik, 

442
00:35:30,207 --> 00:35:33,427
 I'll be somewhere far away for now. 

443
00:35:33,427 --> 00:35:36,437
 Until Pil Sung forgets about me. 

444
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:42,177
 I'll work hard on physical therapy. Don't worry. 

445
00:35:42,177 --> 00:35:44,897
 I'll be in touch once I settle down. 

446
00:35:46,137 --> 00:35:50,197
 And please take good care of Grandma. 

447
00:35:50,987 --> 00:35:52,647
Hyung.

448
00:35:52,647 --> 00:35:54,177
- Hyung. 
 - What?

449
00:35:54,177 --> 00:35:56,317
L-Look at this.

450
00:35:56,317 --> 00:35:58,047
What's this?

451
00:36:00,317 --> 00:36:02,317
You were together.

452
00:36:03,637 --> 00:36:05,187
Where's Do Ra?

453
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:08,027
Hyung, read this.

454
00:36:24,237 --> 00:36:26,807
 The phone is powered off. 

455
00:36:26,807 --> 00:36:30,657
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

456
00:36:31,617 --> 00:36:34,317
What happened, exactly?

457
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,917
I don't know.

458
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:38,747
You were with Do Ra earlier. Did something happen then?

459
00:36:38,747 --> 00:36:40,107
No.

460
00:36:40,107 --> 00:36:43,937
Your mom and Ma Ri's mom were here.

461
00:36:45,687 --> 00:36:47,227
What?

462
00:36:52,607 --> 00:36:56,127
- H-Hey... 
 - Noona. Noona...

463
00:37:04,867 --> 00:37:08,377
Mom, what did you tell Do Ra?

464
00:37:08,377 --> 00:37:10,757
Where did you send her?

465
00:37:10,757 --> 00:37:13,697
What? Where would I send Do Ra?

466
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:15,877
I know nothing about it.

467
00:37:15,877 --> 00:37:18,577
I heard you were at the hospital today.

468
00:37:18,577 --> 00:37:22,077
What did you tell her? Why is she missing?

469
00:37:23,437 --> 00:37:28,777
Yes, I did visit her at the hospital with Soo Yeon today.

470
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:33,257
But I couldn't tell her anything when I saw her. So, we just left.

471
00:37:33,257 --> 00:37:35,437
Mom!

472
00:37:35,437 --> 00:37:38,857
What have you done, Honey?

473
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,847
Did you really hide Do Ra?

474
00:37:40,847 --> 00:37:43,667
She can't even walk. Where do you hide her? Tell us right now.

475
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:47,127
What do you mean? I didn't hide her anywhere.

476
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:52,547
Do Ra's mom asked me to help her leave with Do Ra.

477
00:37:52,547 --> 00:37:54,417
So, Soo Yeon gave her some money.

478
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:55,987
What?

479
00:37:57,767 --> 00:37:59,457
What did you say?

480
00:38:00,767 --> 00:38:02,997
It's true.

481
00:38:02,997 --> 00:38:06,267
Do Ra cried and begged her mom, apparently.

482
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:10,167
She said she didn't want to burden you and asked her to help her leave.

483
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:14,097
So, her mom decided to leave with her. Were we supposed to stop her?

484
00:38:14,097 --> 00:38:16,507
They decided to do that on their own.

485
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:18,067
Mom!

486
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:23,597
What did you do to someone who can't even walk?

487
00:38:23,597 --> 00:38:25,267
Yes.

488
00:38:26,227 --> 00:38:32,327
To be honest, I was thankful when Do Ra said that.

489
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:35,417
It's not like I'm hiding her somewhere.

490
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:39,777
Her mom said she'd leave with her. What was I supposed to do?

491
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:45,497
Do you think I'm happy about this?

492
00:38:48,357 --> 00:38:53,677
And she wants to leave you so badly.

493
00:38:53,677 --> 00:38:56,187
She wants to break up with you.

494
00:38:56,187 --> 00:39:00,377
Pil Sung, you'd better stop now.

495
00:39:00,377 --> 00:39:03,587
Please forget Do Ra now!

496
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:06,427
Mom,

497
00:39:07,727 --> 00:39:12,997
I didn't think you'd hurt me like this.

498
00:39:12,997 --> 00:39:14,577
Pil Sung.

499
00:39:16,257 --> 00:39:18,267
Wow...

500
00:39:18,267 --> 00:39:22,447
You're really unbelievable.

501
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:25,017
You've always wanted to divorce me, right?

502
00:39:25,017 --> 00:39:26,877
Yes, let's get divorced.

503
00:39:26,877 --> 00:39:28,447
Let's go to the court first thing tomorrow.

504
00:39:28,447 --> 00:39:32,897
Honey, I... I swear I did that for Pil Sung...

505
00:39:32,897 --> 00:39:37,467
Don't say it was for him. He's crying.

506
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:42,267
He's crying bloody tears. How could you say that right now?

507
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:53,115
What do we do?

508
00:39:53,115 --> 00:39:54,799
Seriously.

509
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:57,156
Seriously.

510
00:39:57,156 --> 00:40:01,026
Our mom took Do Ra away, you said?

511
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:02,426
Yes.

512
00:40:02,426 --> 00:40:05,036
Call President Baek first. She won't answer my calls.

513
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:08,766
She'd probably answer your calls.

514
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:12,836
 The phone is powered off... 

515
00:40:12,836 --> 00:40:15,756
- Her phone is off. 
  - You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

516
00:40:15,756 --> 00:40:18,562
Are you sure our mom took her?

517
00:40:19,096 --> 00:40:20,716
Yes.

518
00:40:20,716 --> 00:40:24,236
I can't believe Noona left with Mom.

519
00:40:27,856 --> 00:40:30,176
Did my mom ask for money?

520
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:39,776
Seriously!

521
00:40:39,776 --> 00:40:42,506
What's wrong? What's going on?

522
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:45,886
No, it's nothing. I pranked Do Jun.

523
00:40:45,886 --> 00:40:49,626
He's being too dramatic.

524
00:40:49,626 --> 00:40:54,426
By the way, is Ji Yeong not home yet?

525
00:40:54,426 --> 00:40:57,366
Come on. I told you she's filming in the US.

526
00:40:57,366 --> 00:40:59,656
She'd be back after a month. I told you.

527
00:40:59,656 --> 00:41:02,976
Gosh, I miss my Ji Yeong.

528
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,186
Geez.

529
00:41:04,186 --> 00:41:05,276
Ji Yeong...

530
00:41:05,276 --> 00:41:07,986
Go to sleep, okay?

531
00:41:14,086 --> 00:41:16,136
Is this Saemmul Physical Therapy Center?

532
00:41:16,136 --> 00:41:18,516
Is there a patient named Park Do Ra there?

533
00:41:18,516 --> 00:41:20,796
Is this Somang Physical Therapy Center?

534
00:41:20,796 --> 00:41:24,176
Did a patient named Park Do Ra check in, by chance?

535
00:41:24,176 --> 00:41:27,066
Got it.

536
00:41:29,746 --> 00:41:32,226
Yes, is this Joy Physical Therapy Center?

537
00:41:32,226 --> 00:41:34,466
Is there a patient named Park Do Ra there?

538
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:37,376
 Come on, give it to me. 

539
00:41:37,376 --> 00:41:40,456
 - Let's go now.
- I want 10. 

540
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,946
 Don't be like that. 

541
00:41:41,946 --> 00:41:44,596
 You can just quit, then. 

542
00:41:44,596 --> 00:41:46,366
Here are two.

543
00:41:48,936 --> 00:41:50,646
Call.

544
00:41:50,646 --> 00:41:52,856
Me, too.

545
00:41:55,176 --> 00:41:56,646
Here.

546
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:07,126
Yes, is this Bada Physical Therapy Center?

547
00:42:07,126 --> 00:42:11,026
Is there a patient named Park Do Ra there?

548
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:16,386
Got it.

549
00:42:22,286 --> 00:42:25,856
Hyung, what did the police say? Did you report her missing?

550
00:42:25,856 --> 00:42:29,506
We can't report her missing because she left with Mom.

551
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:33,626
We can't even track her phone because she's not involved in a crime.

552
00:42:33,626 --> 00:42:35,376
How does that make sense?

553
00:42:35,376 --> 00:42:38,226
She's missing, and we can't reach her right now.

554
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:44,916
I asked a friend of mine about it, but it'd be difficult to track her because her phone is off.

555
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:46,976
Seriously.

556
00:42:50,896 --> 00:42:52,366
Hyung,

557
00:42:53,016 --> 00:42:55,726
Mom can't be doing that, right?

558
00:42:56,516 --> 00:42:58,486
Come on, no way...

559
00:42:59,346 --> 00:43:00,926
What is it?

560
00:43:02,236 --> 00:43:05,346
We've been calling all the hospitals for days.

561
00:43:05,346 --> 00:43:07,786
But we haven't found her yet.

562
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:11,026
We're wondering if she went to a gambling house with that money.

563
00:43:11,026 --> 00:43:14,206
Hey, but still. That can't be true.

564
00:43:14,206 --> 00:43:17,436
Hyung, what do we do with Noona?

565
00:43:17,436 --> 00:43:20,996
We need to find Mom now. We need to find her!

566
00:43:21,786 --> 00:43:23,776
Geez...

567
00:43:30,486 --> 00:43:35,016
Hello, Ma'am. I'm Baek Mi Ja's son, Do Sik.

568
00:43:35,016 --> 00:43:40,346
Yes, well, you used to go to the gambling house with my mom, right?

569
00:43:40,346 --> 00:43:42,096
 What are you talking about? 

570
00:43:42,096 --> 00:43:45,006
 I quit a long time ago. 

571
00:43:45,006 --> 00:43:49,016
No, no. I'm not asking if you're still gambling.

572
00:43:49,016 --> 00:43:52,776
Could you tell me where the gambling house you used to go with her is?

573
00:43:52,776 --> 00:43:54,906
Please, I beg you.

574
00:44:03,096 --> 00:44:04,606
Mom!

575
00:44:04,606 --> 00:44:06,286
All-in!

576
00:44:06,286 --> 00:44:08,366
Okay.

577
00:44:09,526 --> 00:44:10,986
- What are you doing? 
 - What's this now?

578
00:44:10,986 --> 00:44:13,546
- Do Sik. 
 - Where's Do Ra?

579
00:44:13,546 --> 00:44:17,216
Do Ra? W-Where did Do Ra go?

580
00:44:17,216 --> 00:44:20,136
Do Sik, what day is it today? What's the date?

581
00:44:20,136 --> 00:44:21,966
I asked where Do Ra is.

582
00:44:21,966 --> 00:44:24,306
Hold on. Hold on.

583
00:44:26,636 --> 00:44:29,046
It's already been five days.

584
00:44:30,056 --> 00:44:31,986
Where's Do Ra?

585
00:44:31,986 --> 00:44:34,366
Where's Do Ra right now?

586
00:44:34,366 --> 00:44:35,796
Do Ra...

587
00:44:35,796 --> 00:44:38,046
W-Where's Do Ra? Do Ra...

588
00:44:38,046 --> 00:44:40,376
Where's Do Ra?

589
00:44:44,856 --> 00:44:49,876
   

590
00:44:51,766 --> 00:44:54,266
Get out of my face now.

591
00:44:54,266 --> 00:44:56,696
Do Sik, I-I'm sorry.

592
00:44:56,696 --> 00:44:58,606
Get out of my face, I said!

593
00:45:00,586 --> 00:45:02,256
Do Sik...

594
00:45:44,736 --> 00:45:46,906
Oppa.

595
00:45:46,906 --> 00:45:48,546
Park Do Ra.

596
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,916
What are you doing here?

597
00:45:56,406 --> 00:45:57,956
Oppa.

598
00:45:59,196 --> 00:46:01,556
I said what are you doing here?

599
00:46:03,976 --> 00:46:06,206
Can't you tell?

600
00:46:08,136 --> 00:46:11,966
I ran away from you.

601
00:46:12,966 --> 00:46:16,696
But what are you doing here again?

602
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:24,506
I need to run away again, then.

603
00:46:29,566 --> 00:46:32,396
Do you want to break up with me that badly?

604
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:37,236
Yes, I do.

605
00:46:37,936 --> 00:46:39,746
Fine, then.

606
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:43,622
Walk, then.

607
00:46:44,106 --> 00:46:49,006
If you can walk and run away yourself,

608
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,786
I'll break up with you, then.

609
00:46:50,786 --> 00:46:52,516
So, walk.

610
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:56,016
Walk if you want to break up with me.

611
00:46:56,776 --> 00:47:01,626
You can't break up with me until then.

612
00:47:01,626 --> 00:47:03,686
So, stay by my side.

613
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:15,866
♫  The shiny stars of this love don't fade  ♫

614
00:47:19,386 --> 00:47:22,656
♫  One love  ♫

615
00:47:22,656 --> 00:47:24,326
It's okay.

616
00:47:25,486 --> 00:47:27,276
It's okay now.

617
00:47:27,276 --> 00:47:29,186
Come with me.

618
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:34,436
   

619
00:47:41,076 --> 00:47:43,726
Jin Dan, are you okay?

620
00:47:43,726 --> 00:47:47,266
They heard a fighting noise in your cell last night.

621
00:47:47,266 --> 00:47:49,536
Did someone harass you?

622
00:47:54,566 --> 00:47:57,286
I said not to act like you know me.

623
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:03,966
Asshole, talking down to elders in the country of politeness.

624
00:48:03,966 --> 00:48:06,066
Wow, what a rude bastard.

625
00:48:06,066 --> 00:48:10,516
Hey, you're the one who did that to Park Do Ra, right?

626
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:12,076
I'm her fan.

627
00:48:12,076 --> 00:48:15,256
I was a huge fan and turned her into a star.

628
00:48:15,256 --> 00:48:17,276
How could you destroy her like that?

629
00:48:18,716 --> 00:48:21,216
You bastards! Why are you hitting him? Why?

630
00:48:21,226 --> 00:48:22,426
What's this now?

631
00:48:22,426 --> 00:48:24,876
What are you, his dad or something?

632
00:48:28,176 --> 00:48:30,256
Jin Dan!

633
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:37,616
- Jin Dan! 
 - What are you doing?

634
00:48:37,616 --> 00:48:41,236
- You're looking great. 
 - Right?

635
00:48:43,496 --> 00:48:45,796
Here's your order.

636
00:48:45,796 --> 00:48:47,486
Gosh, Ae Gyo.

637
00:48:47,486 --> 00:48:48,946
What are you doing here?

638
00:48:48,946 --> 00:48:50,476
Do you work here?

639
00:48:50,476 --> 00:48:52,116
N-No...

640
00:48:52,116 --> 00:48:56,136
This is my aunt's restaurant. I'm helping her.

641
00:48:57,106 --> 00:49:00,626
Ahjumma, we're busy. What are you doing here?

642
00:49:02,286 --> 00:49:04,736
Ahjumma. Ahjumma?

643
00:49:04,736 --> 00:49:11,386
The rumor says her son, Jin Dan, went to jail and she got kicked out of Soo Yeon's house.

644
00:49:11,386 --> 00:49:13,916
I can't believe this.

645
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:16,916
Why did they have to eat here?

646
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:22,446
Since I got caught working here, all of my classmates will hear about it.

647
00:49:22,446 --> 00:49:25,176
How am I supposed to live now?

648
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,226
Ae Gyo.

649
00:49:27,226 --> 00:49:30,026
Gosh, Gyeong Suk.

650
00:49:30,716 --> 00:49:35,046
Here. Mi Suk and I are giving this to you.

651
00:49:35,046 --> 00:49:36,416
Why are you doing this?

652
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:38,656
Just keep it.

653
00:49:38,656 --> 00:49:40,576
I'm sure every penny counts.

654
00:49:40,576 --> 00:49:42,656
Cheer up, Ae Gyo.

655
00:49:42,656 --> 00:49:45,306
Life always finds a way.

656
00:49:45,306 --> 00:49:48,196
Don't worry about us and work.

657
00:49:52,116 --> 00:49:55,956
This is all because of Jin Sang Gu, that bastard.

658
00:49:55,956 --> 00:49:59,886
If only he hadn't come back from the Philippines...

659
00:49:59,886 --> 00:50:03,556
Jin Dan, what do we do now?

660
00:50:03,556 --> 00:50:06,086
What will my poor son do?

661
00:50:09,576 --> 00:50:11,516
Gosh.

662
00:50:14,286 --> 00:50:16,276
It's for the table in the back.

663
00:50:16,276 --> 00:50:18,986
Okay. Don't worry.

664
00:50:18,986 --> 00:50:20,646
Be careful.

665
00:50:30,146 --> 00:50:32,336
Enjoy.

666
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:36,216
- Thank you. 
 - Of course.

667
00:50:38,866 --> 00:50:41,046
Well...

668
00:50:41,046 --> 00:50:42,566
I know serving's hard.

669
00:50:42,566 --> 00:50:45,336
Why don't you clean utensils here instead?

670
00:50:45,336 --> 00:50:47,946
I just want to serve.

671
00:50:47,946 --> 00:50:49,376
I'm having so much fun.

672
00:50:49,376 --> 00:50:52,226
I've never done anything like this before.

673
00:50:52,226 --> 00:50:54,316
I won't make a mistake.

674
00:50:54,316 --> 00:50:57,706
So, just let me do it. Please?

675
00:50:57,706 --> 00:50:59,336
Please, Boss.

676
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:02,496
I'm not the boss. My brother is.

677
00:51:02,496 --> 00:51:03,616
Is it that fun?

678
00:51:03,616 --> 00:51:05,376
Yes, I want to do it again.

679
00:51:05,376 --> 00:51:08,536
Let me do it. Please.

680
00:51:09,026 --> 00:51:11,016
Ma Ri is doing a good job. What's the problem?

681
00:51:11,016 --> 00:51:12,946
Thank you for helping, Ma Ri.

682
00:51:12,946 --> 00:51:16,106
Yes, I'll work hard. Fighting.

683
00:51:17,006 --> 00:51:18,346
Welcome.

684
00:51:18,346 --> 00:51:21,156
Welcome. Have a seat here.

685
00:51:26,376 --> 00:51:28,646
Gosh, it smells so good.

686
00:51:28,646 --> 00:51:30,926
See? I told you.

687
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:36,176
- Ma Ri! Be careful. 
 - Hey, what's going on?

688
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,996
Mom, Dad, I made money today.

689
00:51:38,996 --> 00:51:41,416
I worked at Do Jun's kalguksu store

690
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:45,436
- and got paid 50,000 won. 
 - What?

691
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:47,416
You made money?

692
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:50,976
What did you do there that they paid you?

693
00:51:50,976 --> 00:51:56,146
I did serving. I was told I was friendly by the customers, too.

694
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,306
What? Is that true?

695
00:51:58,306 --> 00:51:59,466
Yes, it's true.

696
00:51:59,466 --> 00:52:05,166
Ma Ri, what if you get burnt carrying the hot broth?

697
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:06,296
I'm good at it.

698
00:52:06,296 --> 00:52:10,096
Do Jun and Do Sik complimented me a lot, too.

699
00:52:10,096 --> 00:52:13,016
Mom, Dad, I find it so much fun, too.

700
00:52:13,016 --> 00:52:14,266
I'll do it tomorrow, too.

701
00:52:14,266 --> 00:52:16,046
No, Gong Ma Ri. No, no.

702
00:52:16,046 --> 00:52:19,036
She thinks it's really fun. Let's just let her.

703
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:22,176
Ma Ri, you still have to be careful.

704
00:52:22,176 --> 00:52:24,806
Mom and Dad will be sad if you get injured.

705
00:52:24,806 --> 00:52:25,996
He's right.

706
00:52:25,996 --> 00:52:27,046
Okay.

707
00:52:27,046 --> 00:52:30,576
Right, I got you guys presents, too.

708
00:52:30,576 --> 00:52:32,816
What? Presents?

709
00:52:34,046 --> 00:52:39,566
I heard you're supposed to buy your parents red long johns with your first paycheck.

710
00:52:39,566 --> 00:52:44,056
But I didn't make that much money, so I just got you red socks.

711
00:52:44,056 --> 00:52:46,456
- Red socks? 
 - Here, Mom.

712
00:52:46,456 --> 00:52:48,676
Gosh, Ma Ri.

713
00:52:48,676 --> 00:52:50,926
Make sure to wear them.

714
00:52:52,006 --> 00:52:53,336
Of course, we will.

715
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,586
Our Ma Ri got them with her paycheck.

716
00:52:55,586 --> 00:52:56,826
You should wear them, too.

717
00:52:56,826 --> 00:52:58,686
Okay. They're matching socks.

718
00:52:58,686 --> 00:53:00,516
Thank you, Ma Ri.

719
00:53:00,516 --> 00:53:03,026
- What's the happy occasion? 
 - Hi...

720
00:53:03,856 --> 00:53:05,316
I got you a pair, too, Grandma.

721
00:53:05,316 --> 00:53:07,706
What's this?

722
00:53:07,706 --> 00:53:10,556
Gosh, they're socks.

723
00:53:10,556 --> 00:53:15,216
Ma Ri bought these with her paycheck from her job today.

724
00:53:15,216 --> 00:53:17,136
What?

725
00:53:17,656 --> 00:53:20,386
Ma Ri worked and earned money?

726
00:53:20,386 --> 00:53:22,476
My goodness.

727
00:53:22,476 --> 00:53:25,396
- They're so pretty. 
 - My gosh.

728
00:53:25,396 --> 00:53:28,046
Thank you.

729
00:53:28,046 --> 00:53:30,096
My toes feel so cozy.

730
00:53:30,096 --> 00:53:35,026
We're wearing couples' socks right now.

731
00:53:35,026 --> 00:53:37,046
I'll wear them to work tomorrow.

732
00:53:37,046 --> 00:53:38,776
Really?

733
00:53:38,776 --> 00:53:42,546
Of course. My daughter bought them with her first paycheck.

734
00:53:42,546 --> 00:53:45,756
I'll wear them and brag.

735
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:49,576
She did choose pretty ones, didn't she?

736
00:53:49,576 --> 00:53:55,346
I hope Ma Ri and Do Jun have a cute relationship like this,

737
00:53:56,776 --> 00:54:01,582
but I'm worried about his mom, Baek Mi Ja.

738
00:54:02,266 --> 00:54:05,056
She really is an irredeemable person.

739
00:54:05,886 --> 00:54:09,996
I like him, too, but that's the only thing that bothers me.

740
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,976
Same with Park Do Ra.

741
00:54:11,976 --> 00:54:15,216
Why did they have to have a mother like her?

742
00:54:15,216 --> 00:54:18,962
If you're so well aware, why did you give her money?

743
00:54:19,396 --> 00:54:23,306
What's the difference between a mother who takes money using a sick daughter

744
00:54:23,306 --> 00:54:27,566
and someone who pays her money to break up a couple?

745
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:34,322
You and Seon Yeong did a very bad thing.

746
00:54:34,766 --> 00:54:40,736
Honey, I did a terrible thing, and I have no excuse.

747
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,552
Putting everything aside,

748
00:54:42,552 --> 00:54:47,152
I like how Pil Sung stays loyal

749
00:54:47,156 --> 00:54:50,806
and loving toward one person.

750
00:54:52,016 --> 00:54:57,816
My son is a good man... and I judged him correctly.

751
00:54:59,006 --> 00:55:04,136
If you were in that situation, I wouldn't have given up on you, either.

752
00:55:06,276 --> 00:55:07,906
Honey.

753
00:55:08,926 --> 00:55:13,246
Of course, it's painful to watch as a parent.

754
00:55:13,246 --> 00:55:14,996
But it's his decision.

755
00:55:14,996 --> 00:55:16,976
What can we do about it?

756
00:55:16,976 --> 00:55:18,626
So,

757
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:23,896
you should try persuading Seon Yeong.

758
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:27,836
Okay. I'll do that.

759
00:55:27,836 --> 00:55:31,416
I'm so glad you liked the edited script.

760
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:35,976
I was worried you might not like it.

761
00:55:35,976 --> 00:55:40,976
I liked the first draft, but the story got fuller and speedier.

762
00:55:40,976 --> 00:55:42,766
I prefer it that way.

763
00:55:42,766 --> 00:55:46,166
I think we can move on to Episode 3 now.

764
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:50,586
Okay. I'll contact you when I finish Episode 3.

765
00:55:55,246 --> 00:55:56,996
I'll get going now.

766
00:55:56,996 --> 00:55:59,256
Hold on a moment.

767
00:56:01,586 --> 00:56:04,466
Take this, Writer Go.

768
00:56:05,256 --> 00:56:06,976
What's this?

769
00:56:06,976 --> 00:56:08,726
It's not much.

770
00:56:08,726 --> 00:56:10,976
They're earrings.

771
00:56:11,716 --> 00:56:16,656
I bought them on a whim because I thought they'd suit you.

772
00:56:21,856 --> 00:56:25,456
I don't think you just bought them on a whim.

773
00:56:25,456 --> 00:56:28,376
They're Bulgaria.

774
00:56:28,376 --> 00:56:30,926
Why are you giving them to me?

775
00:56:30,926 --> 00:56:35,356
Writer Go, do you have a boyfriend, by chance?

776
00:56:35,356 --> 00:56:36,836
Pardon?

777
00:56:38,116 --> 00:56:41,866
To be honest, I fell in love with you at first sight.

778
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:45,446
You're so pretty, but we work together.

779
00:56:45,446 --> 00:56:49,042
So, I tried not to show it to be careful, but...

780
00:56:49,482 --> 00:56:53,496
I've never done this before. So, I don't know what to do.

781
00:56:53,496 --> 00:56:56,146
Should we try seeing each other?

782
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:59,586
D-Director...

783
00:57:21,956 --> 00:57:23,816
I'm sorry.

784
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:27,066
I have a boyfriend.

785
00:57:27,906 --> 00:57:30,306
Really?

786
00:57:30,306 --> 00:57:32,556
I was way out of line.

787
00:57:32,556 --> 00:57:35,066
Not at all.

788
00:57:36,306 --> 00:57:40,476
Could you still accept the earrings?

789
00:57:40,476 --> 00:57:45,062
I want to give them to you because I like your writing and respect it.

790
00:57:45,636 --> 00:57:50,126
Or just think of them as a gift from a friend.

791
00:57:51,826 --> 00:57:53,676
Writer Go.

792
00:57:55,946 --> 00:57:58,166
I-I'm sorry.

793
00:58:00,056 --> 00:58:05,946
♫  The day I saw you for the first time  ♫

794
00:58:08,406 --> 00:58:14,636
♫  The wind blew in my heart  ♫

795
00:58:16,746 --> 00:58:24,296
♫  I can't handle my heart that's pressing me  ♫

796
00:58:24,296 --> 00:58:31,026
♫  When I opened my eyes, the world was filled with you  ♫

797
00:58:32,506 --> 00:58:39,606
♫  Both the end and beginning of each day  ♫

798
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:49,166
♫  Is filled with you, and my heart is full  ♫

799
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:57,646
♫  The starlights that filled my dark nights  ♫

800
00:58:57,646 --> 00:59:04,756
♫  You shine even more since you came into my life  ♫

801
00:59:04,756 --> 00:59:08,996
 To be honest, I fell in love with you at first sight. 

802
00:59:08,996 --> 00:59:12,466
 You're so pretty, but we work together. 

803
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:16,146
 So, I tried not to show it to be careful, but... 

804
00:59:16,736 --> 00:59:20,646
 I've never done this before. So, I don't know what to do. 

805
00:59:20,646 --> 00:59:22,856
 Should we try seeing each other? 

806
00:59:30,006 --> 00:59:31,626
   

807
00:59:34,156 --> 00:59:35,816
   

808
00:59:47,276 --> 00:59:49,146
Hey, it's me.

809
00:59:50,906 --> 00:59:52,946
Right now?

810
00:59:52,946 --> 00:59:55,596
You need to tell me something important?

811
01:00:01,016 --> 01:00:03,476
Okay, let's meet now.

812
01:00:03,476 --> 01:00:05,656
I need to tell you something, too.

813
01:00:13,966 --> 01:00:16,516
What's the important thing you wanted to say?

814
01:00:21,866 --> 01:00:24,086
Let's stop seeing each other.

815
01:00:26,326 --> 01:00:27,926
W-What?

816
01:00:29,086 --> 01:00:31,026
I saw you earlier today.

817
01:00:31,026 --> 01:00:33,642
You were with another man at a cafe.

818
01:00:34,116 --> 01:00:36,206
You like him, right?

819
01:00:40,206 --> 01:00:42,116
The thing is...

820
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:50,926
I felt betrayed and angry at first, but thinking now, I've been negligent.

821
01:00:51,976 --> 01:00:56,386
I've been holding onto you even though I couldn't see you because I've been busy.

822
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:58,216
I'm sorry.

823
01:01:00,276 --> 01:01:02,656
No, Do Sik.

824
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:05,636
I'm sorry.

825
01:01:07,716 --> 01:01:11,826
I really want you to be happy. I mean it.

826
01:01:13,646 --> 01:01:15,826
I'll leave now.

827
01:01:15,826 --> 01:01:17,646
Don't get sick, okay?

828
01:01:23,686 --> 01:01:30,346
♫  You, the one who loved me  ♫

829
01:01:30,346 --> 01:01:37,806
♫  If you still feel that way even a little bit  ♫

830
01:01:37,806 --> 01:01:40,846
♫  Please give me a chance just once  ♫

831
01:01:40,846 --> 01:01:48,906
♫  My love for you hasn't changed  ♫

832
01:01:55,236 --> 01:01:57,556
Oppa.

833
01:01:57,556 --> 01:02:00,096
I'm so terrible. I can't do it anymore.

834
01:02:00,096 --> 01:02:02,456
Just a little more, Do Ra. You're already halfway there.

835
01:02:02,456 --> 01:02:04,096
Let's go a little further.

836
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:05,956
Oppa,

837
01:02:05,956 --> 01:02:10,966
I came this far using my arms. I didn't walk.

838
01:02:10,966 --> 01:02:13,366
I didn't walk, I said.

839
01:02:13,366 --> 01:02:16,596
Yes, Do Ra. You're using your arms, and I'm holding you now,

840
01:02:16,596 --> 01:02:19,646
but they said you'll be able to walk if you keep doing this.

841
01:02:19,646 --> 01:02:21,566
So, let's hang in there just a little longer.

842
01:02:21,566 --> 01:02:22,846
You can do it.

843
01:02:22,846 --> 01:02:24,736
I did everything I could.

844
01:02:24,736 --> 01:02:26,326
I used every bit of energy I had.

845
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:29,196
But I can't do it.

846
01:02:29,196 --> 01:02:32,406
It's all useless!

847
01:02:32,406 --> 01:02:36,616
Do Ra, you couldn't even stand here before. But look at you now.

848
01:02:36,616 --> 01:02:38,806
You can move holding onto the bars.

849
01:02:38,806 --> 01:02:40,896
I can't do it.

850
01:02:40,896 --> 01:02:43,516
- I don't think I can. 
 - Do Ra.

851
01:02:46,866 --> 01:02:48,616
Look.

852
01:02:49,556 --> 01:02:53,606
I can't even stand when you let go of me.

853
01:02:54,606 --> 01:02:57,836
I can't do anything.

854
01:03:00,506 --> 01:03:04,316
I need to walk to break up with you.

855
01:03:04,316 --> 01:03:07,876
That's why I want to walk, but...

856
01:03:07,876 --> 01:03:11,232
But I can't do it.

857
01:03:11,756 --> 01:03:15,326
I don't think I could do it.

858
01:03:16,586 --> 01:03:18,436
Oppa,

859
01:03:19,566 --> 01:03:22,296
let's stop now, please?

860
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:26,232
Please, let's break up.

861
01:03:26,846 --> 01:03:32,196
I know it's hard for you to watch me, but it's hard for me to watch you, too.

862
01:03:32,196 --> 01:03:35,376
I'm so tired that I could die, Oppa.

863
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:38,426
So, you should just leave.

864
01:03:40,256 --> 01:03:41,686
Leave.

865
01:03:41,686 --> 01:03:44,236
Leave.

866
01:03:44,236 --> 01:03:46,966
Please, leave, I said!

867
01:03:46,966 --> 01:03:48,856
Leave!

868
01:03:48,856 --> 01:03:51,466
Leave!

869
01:03:51,466 --> 01:03:52,916
Do Ra,

870
01:03:54,696 --> 01:03:56,816
I told you.

871
01:03:58,406 --> 01:04:03,006
I'll be the same in the future like I've always been.

872
01:04:04,116 --> 01:04:06,696
I can't be without you.

873
01:04:08,516 --> 01:04:11,116
So, I can't break up with you.

874
01:04:13,996 --> 01:04:16,486
No matter how much you push me away,

875
01:04:18,586 --> 01:04:21,496
I'll attach myself to you like a piece of gum.

876
01:04:39,406 --> 01:04:41,536
Have you seen "The Nation's Gum Boyfriend?"

877
01:04:41,536 --> 01:04:43,656
"The Nation's Gum Boyfriend?" What's that?

878
01:04:43,656 --> 01:04:45,696
You haven't seen that video yet?

879
01:04:45,696 --> 01:04:48,076
At the hospital, Park Do Ra tells her boyfriend...

880
01:04:48,076 --> 01:04:50,376
Director Go Pil Sung, you know.

881
01:04:50,376 --> 01:04:54,286
She says they should break up because she can't walk. She tells him to leave.

882
01:04:54,286 --> 01:04:57,486
But Director Go says he can never break up with her.

883
01:04:57,486 --> 01:04:59,896
But he says he'll attach himself to her like gum.

884
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,336
Daebak, he's so romantic.

885
01:05:02,336 --> 01:05:08,126
That's why Go Pil Sung is now the nation's romantic and gum boyfriend.

886
01:05:11,206 --> 01:05:12,996
 No matter how much you push me away, 
   

887
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:15,146
 I'll attach myself to you like a piece of gum. 

888
01:05:15,146 --> 01:05:18,386
 Do Ra, accept the gum oppa's heart. Don't remove the gum. 

889
01:05:18,386 --> 01:05:21,206
 Do Ra, make another masterpiece with the gum hyung. 

890
01:05:21,206 --> 01:05:23,706
 Gum director's "Seoul Lady" is so entertaining. 

891
01:05:23,706 --> 01:05:25,696
 Park Do Ra is so good in "Seoul Lady." 

892
01:05:25,696 --> 01:05:28,436
 "Seoul Lady" is a masterpiece. I know I'm late, but binge-watching. 

893
01:05:28,436 --> 01:05:30,766
 You should leave now. 

894
01:05:31,336 --> 01:05:33,566
 Leave now, Oppa. 

895
01:05:33,566 --> 01:05:35,396
Is Pil Sung...

896
01:05:35,396 --> 01:05:40,206
doing that when Do Ra wants to break up with him?

897
01:05:40,206 --> 01:05:43,106
Gosh, this is so upsetting.

898
01:05:44,016 --> 01:05:50,742
Should he break up with her when she can't even walk, then?

899
01:05:51,336 --> 01:05:53,106
Imagine you were in her shoes.

900
01:05:53,106 --> 01:05:57,896
Am I supposed to leave you because you can't walk?

901
01:05:57,896 --> 01:06:00,496
It's so touching.

902
01:06:00,496 --> 01:06:03,376
You can't be so heartless.

903
01:06:05,826 --> 01:06:08,166
Gosh, why... Why is he...

904
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:12,566
Why is he doing that? She didn't say anything wrong.

905
01:06:12,566 --> 01:06:18,136
Mom, Unni, I don't think Pil Sung could break up with Do Ra.

906
01:06:18,136 --> 01:06:21,266
So, you should give up now.

907
01:06:21,266 --> 01:06:23,466
Why can't he break up with her?

908
01:06:23,466 --> 01:06:26,726
He should leave when she tells him to leave.

909
01:06:26,726 --> 01:06:28,376
This is his chance.

910
01:06:28,376 --> 01:06:30,786
Mom, have a look at this.

911
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:35,126
The entire country is calling him the nation's romantic right now.

912
01:06:35,126 --> 01:06:37,546
How could he break up?

913
01:06:37,546 --> 01:06:42,996
If he ends up breaking up with her,

914
01:06:42,996 --> 01:06:47,736
he'd become "the nation's betrayer." I'm telling you.

915
01:06:47,736 --> 01:06:49,646
The nation's betrayer?

916
01:06:49,646 --> 01:06:51,346
Myeong Dong.

917
01:06:51,346 --> 01:06:57,226
Come on. Should he live with her who won't be able to walk to avoid criticism?

918
01:06:57,226 --> 01:07:02,826
It sounds easy, but not anyone could do such a thing.

919
01:07:02,826 --> 01:07:07,136
By the way, isn't Park Do Ra being too much?

920
01:07:07,136 --> 01:07:10,826
She should just let him if he wants to be with her.

921
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,196
She tells him to leave and wants to break up.

922
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:16,416
Why is she hurting him so much?

923
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:18,276
Seriously.

924
01:07:19,796 --> 01:07:21,246
We'll look through it, President Go.

925
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:23,346
Okay, see you.

926
01:07:28,716 --> 01:07:32,846
President Go, you won't believe what's going on.

927
01:07:32,846 --> 01:07:35,366
What? What's going on?

928
01:07:35,366 --> 01:07:38,396
Europe, South East Asia, North America, and...

929
01:07:38,396 --> 01:07:44,066
I mean, the entire world wants to air our show, "Seoul Lady."

930
01:07:44,066 --> 01:07:46,256
The requests are flooding in.

931
01:07:46,256 --> 01:07:47,646
Pardon?

932
01:07:48,516 --> 01:07:50,556
"Seoul Lady"?

933
01:07:51,246 --> 01:07:53,726
Why all of a sudden?

934
01:07:53,726 --> 01:07:59,836
The viral video of you... moved not just Korean people but the entire world.

935
01:07:59,836 --> 01:08:03,176
That's why we're having a huge comeback right now.

936
01:08:03,176 --> 01:08:06,046
It's all thanks to you.

937
01:08:06,946 --> 01:08:08,986
What?

938
01:08:08,986 --> 01:08:12,206
Anyway, that's good news.

939
01:08:12,206 --> 01:08:13,886
Let's gather everyone, then.

940
01:08:13,886 --> 01:08:18,006
Although it's long overdue, we should try boosting the sales of "Seoul Lady."

941
01:08:18,006 --> 01:08:19,696
We need an emergency meeting now.

942
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:22,616
Okay, got it, President Go.

943
01:08:42,196 --> 01:08:44,466
I can't do it.

944
01:08:44,466 --> 01:08:46,246
I can't do it, Oppa.

945
01:08:46,246 --> 01:08:48,276
Do Ra,

946
01:08:48,276 --> 01:08:50,356
Do Ra,

947
01:08:50,356 --> 01:08:52,266
Do Ra, look at this.

948
01:08:53,886 --> 01:09:00,236
Not to mention Korea, but people from all over the world are cheering for you.

949
01:09:00,826 --> 01:09:02,016
 I miss you, Do Ra. 

950
01:09:02,016 --> 01:09:03,336
 Come back, Park Do Ra. 

951
01:09:03,336 --> 01:09:04,696
 I hope she recovers quickly and does a new project. 

952
01:09:04,696 --> 01:09:06,686
 Love you, Do Ra. 

953
01:09:13,036 --> 01:09:15,702
Many people are waiting for you

954
01:09:16,236 --> 01:09:18,696
to come back as an actor.

955
01:09:28,116 --> 01:09:29,656
Oppa.

956
01:09:30,626 --> 01:09:34,866
I... I'll try again.

957
01:09:34,866 --> 01:09:37,136
Okay, let's.

958
01:09:43,366 --> 01:09:46,076
One, two, three.

959
01:09:48,906 --> 01:09:51,246
- Are you holding them? 
 - Yes.

960
01:10:08,126 --> 01:10:10,036
Do Ra.

961
01:10:11,256 --> 01:10:13,026
Do Ra, are you okay?

962
01:10:14,146 --> 01:10:15,616
Do Ra.

963
01:10:16,496 --> 01:10:18,826
This isn't working at all.

964
01:10:18,826 --> 01:10:21,116
It's not working!

965
01:10:23,216 --> 01:10:24,736
Do Ra.

966
01:10:25,816 --> 01:10:28,246
Look at me right now.

967
01:10:32,526 --> 01:10:34,816
Do Ra.

968
01:10:34,816 --> 01:10:36,956
Do Ra.

969
01:10:47,336 --> 01:10:51,916
I can't even stand, let alone walk. This will never work!

970
01:10:51,916 --> 01:10:54,946
Why do you say I can do this?

971
01:10:55,736 --> 01:10:59,136
So, don't give me false hope!

972
01:10:59,136 --> 01:11:03,162
Stop suffering because of me!

973
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:05,996
Yes, let's do that.

974
01:11:05,996 --> 01:11:07,866
Let's just call it quits!

975
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:13,526
I hate you doing this more than... the fact that you can't walk!

976
01:11:13,526 --> 01:11:15,606
I hate this, too!

977
01:11:15,606 --> 01:11:18,646
Yes, let's break up.

978
01:11:18,646 --> 01:11:20,986
Let's quit all of it!

979
01:11:20,986 --> 01:11:24,616
You don't have to try so hard with me!

980
01:11:25,752 --> 01:11:35,792


981
01:11:41,966 --> 01:11:43,536
Do Ra.

982
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:49,136
You're...

983
01:11:57,056 --> 01:11:58,666
Do Ra.

984
01:11:59,726 --> 01:12:02,926
   

985
01:12:02,926 --> 01:12:07,096
♫  Tear us apart  ♫

986
01:12:07,096 --> 01:12:13,516
♫  Don't let go of my hand you're holding tightly  ♫

987
01:12:13,516 --> 01:12:24,016
♫  The shiny stars of this love don't fade  ♫

988
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:29,726
 Do Jun is getting engaged? With whom? 

989
01:12:29,726 --> 01:12:31,756
 Why do you care if I get engaged or not? 

990
01:12:31,756 --> 01:12:36,146
 Getting engaged means you're getting married. You should tell me stuff like that. 

991
01:12:36,146 --> 01:12:37,436
 Get out. I need to close the store. 

992
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:40,996
 - Park Do Jun's mom? 
 - What brings you here? 

993
01:12:40,996 --> 01:12:44,056
 Do Sik, why are we here? You're scaring me. 

994
01:12:44,056 --> 01:12:46,936
 Why are we here when it's so dark? 

995
01:12:46,936 --> 01:12:49,636
 Do Ra apparently broke up with him. 

996
01:12:49,636 --> 01:12:52,416
 You must be happy that your dream came true. 

997
01:12:52,416 --> 01:12:55,386
 You and Seon Yeong need to be responsible for this. 

998
01:12:55,386 --> 01:12:56,996
 Mother. 

999
01:12:56,996 --> 01:13:00,896
 Do you really mean that?
