1
00:00:50,546 --> 00:00:52,496
Ji Yeong!

2
00:00:55,616 --> 00:01:00,276
 Don't go to the bathroom without me from now on. 

3
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:05,606
Ji Yeong.

4
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:07,816
Ji Yeong!

5
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:13,941
Ji Yeong, are you okay?

6
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:23,139
Ji Yeong! Are you okay?

7
00:01:23,139 --> 00:01:25,829
- Are you okay, Director? 
 - Yes, I'm okay.

8
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:27,319
Gosh, that was scary.

9
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:30,349
It must be hard because you aren't used to this.

10
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:31,969
Why don't we take a break?

11
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:35,149
Undo this. Undo this for her.

12
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:42,179
   

13
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:48,299
What's all this?

14
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,779
Ji Yeong, drink some water.

15
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,149
You must've been scared. Are you sure you're okay?

16
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:14,409
You're not hurt?

17
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:16,219
Yes.

18
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,409
I'm really okay.

19
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:21,429
I-I wasn't injured.

20
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:24,369
That's a relief.

21
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:29,449
By the way, it looks like you're shocked.

22
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,409
That's not it...

23
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:39,519
Actually, when I fell with you just now,

24
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,809
I think I got a part of my memory back.

25
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:44,659
Memory?

26
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:47,289
What memory?

27
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,389
By chance, in the past,

28
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:54,859
did you ever hold me when I almost fell while

29
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:58,199
I was running around on a trail?

30
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,209
Yes, I have.

31
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:02,870
When we shot "Straightforward Romance."

32
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,939
When we shot "Straightforward Romance"?

33
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:07,759
- Really? 
 - Yes.

34
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:21,049
I-I'll go practice more inside.

35
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,079
Director, why haven't you left?

36
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:51,539
If you'd like, let's eat where we used to eat

37
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:55,379
and I also want to talk to you about Do Ra.

38
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:59,309
I thought it might help you remember.

39
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,579
What do you think?

40
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:03,529
Would that be okay?

41
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:13,359
You don't remember this place, either?

42
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:16,869
No.

43
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:24,049
I was an assistant director and you were a top star.

44
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:29,469
You said you haven't drunk at a snack bar like this for a long time.

45
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,929
You said just looking at the eel and odolbbyeo* got you excited. 
  (T/N: Pork belly cartilage) 

46
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:34,329
You loved it here.

47
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:39,139
I said I got excited about this eel and odolbbyeo?

48
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,849
I did?

49
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,699
Yes.

50
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:48,449
Since you were a top star then, it must've been difficult

51
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:51,529
to come to a place like this without people staring.

52
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:55,719
Seeing you happy over a bowl of noodles and soju

53
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:58,189
made me sad a bit, to be honest.

54
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:05,869
So that's how I was.

55
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,729
I guess you don't remember writing

56
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:16,549
"an idiot and a fool" on my back when we drank here in the past.

57
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,949
"An idiot and a fool"?

58
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:21,739
You mean I called you that?

59
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:28,039
How could I do something like that to you?

60
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:32,509
You're lying, aren't you?

61
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:34,929
You're teasing me right now, right?

62
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,349
I'm not lying.

63
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:39,539
You really did that. I'm telling you.

64
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:44,629
With that piece of paper on my back, I walked around everywhere from here to my house.

65
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:47,129
People stared at me and laughed.

66
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:49,129
Even my mom and grandma saw it.

67
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:51,649
Do you know how embarrassed I was then?

68
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:52,819
Come on.

69
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,829
That makes no sense.

70
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:57,799
There's no way I'd do that to you.

71
00:05:57,799 --> 00:06:00,159
I'm serious.

72
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:05,609
Okay. If so, when you get your memory back,

73
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:08,349
you're buying me a drink here.

74
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:11,749
- What do you say? 
 - Well, okay.

75
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:15,169
If I get my memory back and realize you told the truth,

76
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:18,009
I'll buy you two drinks.

77
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:20,759
Okay. You promised, okay?

78
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:24,249
Let's eat. The noodles will get bloated.

79
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,559
We have a lot to do after this.

80
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,329
Like what?

81
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:32,339
You just need to trust me and follow me today.

82
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:49,609
Ji Yeong, I didn't know you wanted to catch moles so badly.

83
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,629
You used to do this here whenever you were stressed.

84
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:54,639
You're even better than you were then.

85
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,239
This really relieves your stress.

86
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:05,239
It worked.

87
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,929
I got it.

88
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,069
I used to get you stuffed animals like this.

89
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:16,049
Really?

90
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:20,739
You made fun of me, saying I should just buy a crane game machine instead.

91
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:25,159
- Don't you remember? 
 - I don't remember saying that,

92
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:29,769
but it's true that you're not good at this.

93
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:35,119
What do you mean? I'm good once I focus. Watch me.

94
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:39,749
♫  I'll give you my everything  ♫

95
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:46,349
♫  I'll give you the rest of the love I have  ♫

96
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:47,559
You got it.

97
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:50,099
- I got it! I got it! I got it! 
 - You got it! You got it! You got it!

98
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,429
I got it! I got it!

99
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:54,489
You got it!

100
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:59,199
Here. It's for you.

101
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:03,469
Instead of getting my memory back,

102
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:06,189
I'm just getting a present.

103
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:22,389
Hey, you two.

104
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:24,799
What are you doing right now?

105
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:30,039
Hey, Go Pil Sung.

106
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:32,269
What are you doing with my woman right now?

107
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,299
- President Gong, it's not that— 
 - Kim Ji Yeong.

108
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,189
Are you cheating on me with this bastard?

109
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:42,339
It's not that.

110
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:47,439
After the stunt class, I needed to talk to him about something. So that's what we did.

111
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,789
You call that an excuse right now?

112
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:53,829
You were at the stunt school, but you came home with him.

113
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:56,219
And why are you holding that stuffed animal?

114
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:58,429
Did you practice with that at stunt school?

115
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:02,989
He gave you that, didn't he?

116
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:05,529
Why are you holding stuff like this?

117
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:08,609
What are you doing right now?

118
00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:10,749
Geez.

119
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:13,499
How dare you grab me right now?

120
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:16,929
- Do you want to die? 
 - D-Don't do this.

121
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:20,499
Don't do this, Director! Stop.

122
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:23,779
Ji Yeong, why would you date someone like him?

123
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,549
How long will you keep seeing him?

124
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:28,259
 Why do you think I'm... How much did they pay you that... 

125
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:31,269
 Why do you... Don't ever show up in front of me. 

126
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,269
- Ji Yeong!
- Ji Yeong.

127
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,559
Gosh, what's wrong with Ji Yeong? Ji Yeong.

128
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,399
Are you two fighting over Ji Yeong?

129
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,329
Hey. You're leaving. Get out of here.

130
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:55,369
- Leave! Leave! 
 - Grandma!

131
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:57,249
Why are you only yelling at me?

132
00:09:57,249 --> 00:09:59,959
- Leave, you bastard! 
 - Ji Yeong.

133
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,179
Ji Yeong, are you okay?

134
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:13,459
Ji Yeong! What's wrong, Ji Yeong?

135
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:16,269
Let's go. Let's go inside.

136
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:18,269
Seriously.

137
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:19,599
Let's go. Let's go.

138
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,699
Leave! Leave!

139
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:25,059
What's wrong, Ji Yeong?

140
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:40,539
 Why do you live like this? 

141
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,829
 How did you live your life all this time? 

142
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:44,529
 Live however you want. 

143
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:46,509
 Instead, 

144
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:49,529
 don't ever show up in front of me again. 

145
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:17,239
Gosh, why is that meanie not coming back with the medicine?

146
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:22,449
Ji Yeong, what's wrong?

147
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,449
What's wrong? What's wrong?

148
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:26,049
My gosh.

149
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:28,909
Ji Yeong, what's wrong? Gosh.

150
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:30,859
Grandma.

151
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:33,359
Gosh.

152
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,409
Grandma!

153
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:37,639
Aigoo, Ji Yeong.

154
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,149
Aigoo.

155
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:43,329
- What do we do? 
 - Grandma.

156
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:45,109
What's wrong?

157
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:47,599
Grandma!

158
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,399
- Grandma. 
 - Aigoo, Ji Yeong.

159
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:01,769
I decided not to...

160
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:04,499
divorce her.

161
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:11,939
Wait, what are you talking about?

162
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,079
Did you eat something funny, Jin Taek?

163
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:17,319
You no longer want to get divorced?

164
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:21,349
Yes, I canceled everything through Attorney Kang.

165
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:24,959
Gosh. So, do you mean

166
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,759
you'll try to keep living with this woman?

167
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,649
She's been hiding someone else's child for so long.

168
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:37,130
She deceived you and the rest of us.

169
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,380
Are you serious?

170
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:42,989
I know she definitely is to blame.

171
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:46,969
But I'll forgive her.

172
00:12:46,969 --> 00:12:51,079
So, just keep that in mind.

173
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,609
What's wrong with him?

174
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:11,989
He'll forgive her?

175
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:14,459
How is that possible?

176
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:18,089
Auntie, how does this make sense?

177
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,579
He'll no longer want to adopt Jin Dan, I'm sure.

178
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:30,819
Chairman Gong, how about the adoption, then?

179
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:34,299
I'm talking about adopting Jin Dan.

180
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:37,529
- Auntie. 
 - Yes,

181
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:40,719
I can't stop you two from getting back together.

182
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:44,629
You still like her, no matter how tainted she is.

183
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:50,309
But if you hesitate to adopt him,

184
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:53,389
 I'll not tolerate it at all. 

185
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:55,119
 Yes, that's right. 

186
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:57,039
 You're so right, Auntie. 

187
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:02,189
Auntie, adopting Jin Dan won't just affect the family.

188
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:06,699
It'd affect the company for ten or a hundred years.

189
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:11,559
So we need to take time and consider it carefully.

190
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:16,239
So you mean you're still working on it, right?

191
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:18,889
Yes, I'm thinking about it.

192
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:22,269
I need to discuss it with Soo Yeon, too.

193
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:25,019
What did you say? Discuss?

194
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:29,189
Why would you bring up that woman without conscience?

195
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:32,639
We're talking about adopting Jin Dan as our child.

196
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,759
- Of course, we should discuss it. 
 - What...

197
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,829
What did you say?

198
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,359
 Gosh, I guess that's true. 

199
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:45,169
 If Chairman Gong adopts Jin Dan, he'd become Soo Yeon's son. 

200
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:47,759
 Since they're no longer getting divorced. 

201
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:52,879
 Gosh, no way. 

202
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:56,529
 No. 

203
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,899
 It's still better for him to get adopted quickly. 

204
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:04,289
 That's the only way for Jin Dan and I to survive. 

205
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,949
 Everything Ahjumma said was true. 

206
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,919
 I died because of Director. 

207
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:10,699
 Without knowing that, I foolishly liked him... 

208
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:13,829
 missed him and felt tempted. 

209
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,089
 Director is... 

210
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:21,509
 really a bad person. 

211
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:27,589
 How could he shake me up again after all that? 

212
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:04,809
Ji Yeong,

213
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:09,929
I contemplated calling you so many times.

214
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:14,209
You remembered something else earlier, right?

215
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,669
What did you remember?

216
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:21,699
You're right.

217
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:26,049
I remembered something else.

218
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:33,249
I remembered why you apologized to me.

219
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:36,690
I remembered...

220
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:39,289
what happened that day.

221
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:51,839
Ji Yeong.

222
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:54,959
The day I died...

223
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:58,419
I went to see you, didn't I?

224
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:01,069
Right?

225
00:18:02,729 --> 00:18:06,309
I begged you to believe me.

226
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:11,749
I asked you not to misunderstand me

227
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:15,369
even if the rest of the world does.

228
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:20,519
I begged you so desperately,

229
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:23,409
but you turned your back on me.

230
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:28,499
Is my memory...

231
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:32,039
really true?

232
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:36,339
Yes.

233
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,119
It's true.

234
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:45,379
I did that.

235
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:49,219
♫  Love is so difficult  ♫

236
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:52,839
"Why didn't you hold my hand?

237
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:58,289
Why did you hurt me when I was so desperate?

238
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:02,169
Why did you do that?" I'm not here to ask you that.

239
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:06,719
I no longer want to hate you

240
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:10,379
and I don't want to think of you as a bad person, either.

241
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:14,369
I'm living as Kim Ji Yeong right now.

242
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:17,889
Blaming you for what happened then

243
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,489
would be meaningless.

244
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:24,579
♫  Love is so difficult, challenging  ♫

245
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:27,729
The reason I'm here is...

246
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:29,689
because...

247
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:34,699
I want to end our relationship right now.

248
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:37,779
Director,

249
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:42,509
let's no longer have feelings for each other.

250
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,969
To be honest,

251
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:50,469
it was difficult because of my fond memories of you.

252
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:53,409
But now...

253
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:00,259
because of the memory of you

254
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:08,119
abandoning me cruelly,

255
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:12,529
I can no longer like you.

256
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:18,959
Because I finally learned what kind of person you are.

257
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:22,959
Ji Yeong...

258
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,989
I'll leave now.

259
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:37,639
♫  I gave my everything, but it's still not enough  ♫

260
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:01,047
I'm thinking of inviting President Go Pil Sung for dinner tonight.

261
00:21:02,157 --> 00:21:03,877
Who?

262
00:21:03,877 --> 00:21:05,717
You'll invite whom?

263
00:21:05,717 --> 00:21:10,427
Ma Ri's brother, President Go, helped her recover a lot.

264
00:21:10,427 --> 00:21:13,897
What did you say? M-Ma Ri's brother?

265
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:16,937
So are you saying...

266
00:21:16,937 --> 00:21:21,127
you'd acknowledge the son she's been hiding

267
00:21:21,127 --> 00:21:23,827
as Ma Ri's brother or something?

268
00:21:23,827 --> 00:21:26,320
Auntie, Ma Ri is here.

269
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,770
Please watch what you say.

270
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:32,597
Chairman Gong, what's wrong with you?

271
00:21:32,597 --> 00:21:38,477
I let you cancel the divorce, but this isn't right. It isn't.

272
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:40,147
Why, Great Aunt?

273
00:21:40,147 --> 00:21:41,907
It's true Pil Sung Oppa is my brother.

274
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:45,917
What's wrong with my brother eating at our house?

275
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:47,967
Ma Ri.

276
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:51,487
Yes, I knew this would happen.

277
00:21:51,487 --> 00:21:54,587
I knew our family would become a mess.

278
00:21:54,587 --> 00:21:56,290
I have a dinner plan.

279
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,330
Feel free to invite him or not.

280
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:05,777
I have a plan tonight, too.

281
00:22:12,057 --> 00:22:14,397
I'll go to work now.

282
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,127
Why are you doing this, Honey?

283
00:22:23,127 --> 00:22:26,277
You can't bring that up without discussing it with me.

284
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:30,907
I'm inviting someone I want to invite to my house. What's the problem?

285
00:22:30,907 --> 00:22:33,917
Please focus on dinner preparation later.

286
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:36,607
Don't worry about what they say.

287
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:39,147
I think my dad is the coolest.

288
00:22:39,147 --> 00:22:40,747
You're the best.

289
00:22:41,317 --> 00:22:46,117
I'm so happy that you call me cool.

290
00:22:46,757 --> 00:22:48,707
Let's eat.

291
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:10,757
 Because of the memory of you 

292
00:23:12,377 --> 00:23:14,587
 abandoning me cruelly, 

293
00:23:15,617 --> 00:23:18,997
 I can no longer like you. 

294
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:25,667
 Because I finally learned what kind of person you are. 

295
00:23:37,037 --> 00:23:39,477
- Yes, Chairman. 
 -  Yes, Director Go. 

296
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:42,447
 Are you free this evening? 

297
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:44,797
This evening?

298
00:23:44,797 --> 00:23:47,007
Yes, I don't have any plans.

299
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:48,817
 That's good to hear. 

300
00:23:48,817 --> 00:23:51,827
 I'd like to invite you to my house tonight. 

301
00:23:51,827 --> 00:23:55,057
-  You'll come, right?  
 - To your house?

302
00:23:57,087 --> 00:23:59,677
Yes, I'll be there.

303
00:24:18,127 --> 00:24:21,867
 Ma Ri, put your arm around my neck. 

304
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:27,687
 All right. 

305
00:24:39,637 --> 00:24:44,047
How did Do Jun lift me up like that?

306
00:24:44,597 --> 00:24:47,377
He's so strong.

307
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:58,577
By the way, why is my heart suddenly racing?

308
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,857
Gong Ma Ri.

309
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,117
What are you doing here?

310
00:25:25,117 --> 00:25:27,627
Why were you peeping at me?

311
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:29,467
I wasn't.

312
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:31,597
I wasn't peeping at you.

313
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,557
I was just looking at you.

314
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:35,447
Is that so?

315
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:37,357
Are you going somewhere?

316
00:25:37,357 --> 00:25:38,897
No.

317
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:41,017
Yes.

318
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:45,957
Do Jun, should we go play badminton?

319
00:25:45,957 --> 00:25:47,827
Badminton?

320
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,837
What are you doing? Why are you zoning out?

321
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:14,507
What?

322
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,147
Well...

323
00:26:17,147 --> 00:26:20,517
I was definitely looking at the ball.

324
00:26:21,187 --> 00:26:23,397
Where did it go?

325
00:26:25,157 --> 00:26:30,827
♫  After I become an adult  ♫

326
00:26:30,827 --> 00:26:35,107
♫  Just looking at you makes me happy  ♫

327
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:36,457
Ow!

328
00:26:36,457 --> 00:26:38,207
Ma Ri!

329
00:26:38,737 --> 00:26:40,487
Ma Ri, are you okay?

330
00:26:40,487 --> 00:26:43,407
No, I don't think I'm okay.

331
00:26:43,407 --> 00:26:45,207
What do we do?

332
00:26:45,207 --> 00:26:47,607
Hold my hand and get up.

333
00:26:48,387 --> 00:26:50,777
♫  My first love  ♫

334
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:53,117
Are you okay? Does it hurt a lot?

335
00:26:53,117 --> 00:26:55,547
Can you walk, Ma Ri?

336
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,867
No, I can't.

337
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:03,147
Do Joon, I think you should lift me up like last time.

338
00:27:03,147 --> 00:27:05,427
Okay. Just one moment.

339
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:11,317
I hope you didn't get hurt too much.

340
00:27:14,327 --> 00:27:16,787
Do Joon, I think I'm okay now.

341
00:27:16,787 --> 00:27:19,947
- You can put me down now. 
 - It's hard for you to walk.

342
00:27:19,947 --> 00:27:21,907
Hang in there. We're almost there.

343
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:24,957
No, you can put me down. I think I'd be okay.

344
00:27:24,957 --> 00:27:26,707
I'm okay.

345
00:27:26,707 --> 00:27:29,407
I'm worried about you. You look so tired.

346
00:27:29,407 --> 00:27:32,917
I'm really okay. I think I can walk.

347
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,117
Okay, then.

348
00:27:37,317 --> 00:27:40,017
♫  The changing heart  ♫

349
00:27:40,017 --> 00:27:43,337
You're okay? Already?

350
00:27:43,337 --> 00:27:44,937
What?

351
00:27:44,937 --> 00:27:46,417
Yes.

352
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:48,737
I feel fine.

353
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:51,297
You couldn't even stand earlier.

354
00:27:51,297 --> 00:27:54,247
How come you're already fine?

355
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:58,267
By chance, did you lie that you were in pain?

356
00:27:58,267 --> 00:27:59,867
Huh?

357
00:28:01,237 --> 00:28:04,257
Yes, I did.

358
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:06,737
To be honest, it was a lie.

359
00:28:06,737 --> 00:28:10,017
- I'm sorry! 
 - What?

360
00:28:17,577 --> 00:28:20,817
Hey, Director Go. No, I mean...

361
00:28:20,817 --> 00:28:23,187
President Go. Welcome.

362
00:28:24,447 --> 00:28:26,087
Here.

363
00:28:27,097 --> 00:28:31,097
You shouldn't have. You don't have to bring anything.

364
00:28:31,097 --> 00:28:33,897
Ma Ri likes cakes.

365
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,537
Thank you.

366
00:28:37,657 --> 00:28:39,237
Oppa!

367
00:28:39,237 --> 00:28:41,087
- Ma Ri, be careful. 
 - Oppa!

368
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:44,537
Welcome! I missed you. I'm glad you came.

369
00:28:44,537 --> 00:28:47,027
- Yes, have you been well? 
 - Yes.

370
00:28:47,027 --> 00:28:49,917
Ma Ri, you don't hug me when I come home from work.

371
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:51,850
Are you only doing that to President Go?

372
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,710
You're making me jealous.

373
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:09,017
Is the food to your liking?

374
00:29:09,017 --> 00:29:12,347
- Yes, it's delicious. 
 - I'm glad.

375
00:29:12,347 --> 00:29:14,237
Oppa, isn't this so good?

376
00:29:14,237 --> 00:29:16,327
My mom made it.

377
00:29:16,867 --> 00:29:18,507
It's tasty.

378
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:24,957
Dad, I'll give you a riddle. Try to guess correctly.

379
00:29:24,957 --> 00:29:28,067
You're a genius if you get it right.

380
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:29,677
Okay, go ahead.

381
00:29:29,677 --> 00:29:32,707
I'll prove that I'm a genius.

382
00:29:32,707 --> 00:29:34,727
Listen.

383
00:29:34,727 --> 00:29:39,197
What do you call the poop from someone who's dangling on a tree on a cliff?

384
00:29:39,197 --> 00:29:42,207
A cliff... What? Poop?

385
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:47,017
- Ma Ri, don't do this while we're eating. 
 - Gosh, Mom.

386
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:49,567
You can't tell him, either.

387
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:53,287
What's that? I don't know. Do you know, Honey?

388
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:55,587
Poop or get off the pot.

389
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:56,917
I got it!

390
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:59,027
Poop or get off the pot!

391
00:29:59,747 --> 00:30:03,367
You can't tell him. That's cheating.

392
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:06,887
Here's one even Mom doesn't know.

393
00:30:10,497 --> 00:30:14,817
What do you call a chicken that died out of fear?

394
00:30:14,817 --> 00:30:17,447
What? Chicken that died out of fear?

395
00:30:17,447 --> 00:30:20,927
What's that? Is there such a chicken?

396
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:23,607
- It's a riddle. 
 - Right.

397
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:26,507
President Go, you know, right? Give me a hint.

398
00:30:26,507 --> 00:30:29,227
- I don't know this one, either. 
 - Seriously.

399
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,027
Why don't you know this?

400
00:30:31,027 --> 00:30:35,047
A chicken that died out of fear is...

401
00:30:35,047 --> 00:30:36,567
chickened out.

402
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,257
Chickened out?

403
00:30:38,257 --> 00:30:40,707
 Chickened out, you said? 

404
00:30:41,237 --> 00:30:44,347
Auntie, I think Chairman Gong lost his mind.

405
00:30:44,347 --> 00:30:47,967
There isn't a bigger fool than him.

406
00:30:58,447 --> 00:31:03,857
President Go, I wanted to talk to you briefly about something.

407
00:31:03,857 --> 00:31:05,697
Yes, Chairman.

408
00:31:06,597 --> 00:31:10,787
I know you were hurt and suffered as much as me

409
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:13,497
because of Soo Yeon.

410
00:31:14,227 --> 00:31:16,717
I also found it...

411
00:31:16,717 --> 00:31:18,617
very...

412
00:31:18,617 --> 00:31:21,677
difficult to take her back.

413
00:31:21,677 --> 00:31:27,407
But we've spent all this time together and there's Ma Ri, too.

414
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,297
That's why I decided to take her back.

415
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:34,767
I see.

416
00:31:35,337 --> 00:31:40,027
Feel free to come over whenever you want to see Ma Ri.

417
00:31:40,027 --> 00:31:42,167
That's what I wanted to tell you.

418
00:31:44,717 --> 00:31:47,897
Got it. Thank you, Chairman.

419
00:31:47,897 --> 00:31:50,217
I had fun tonight.

420
00:31:57,647 --> 00:31:59,467
- Honey. 
 - Yes.

421
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:00,927
Take your medicine.

422
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:03,207
You removed the cast, but you still need to take medicine.

423
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:04,967
Thank you.

424
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,807
Thank you so much...

425
00:32:18,807 --> 00:32:21,097
for today and...

426
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:23,587
I'm sorry.

427
00:32:24,747 --> 00:32:27,907
Why would you be sorry?

428
00:32:27,907 --> 00:32:32,267
Ma Ri improved thanks to Pil Sung.

429
00:32:33,257 --> 00:32:37,717
Ma Ri was so happy to have...

430
00:32:37,717 --> 00:32:40,817
Pil Seung over dinner and...

431
00:32:40,817 --> 00:32:43,897
the house felt so full.

432
00:32:43,897 --> 00:32:48,047
Anyway, I find Pil Sung so dependable.

433
00:32:48,707 --> 00:32:50,917
Yes.

434
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:55,997
Strangely, the more I see him, the more I want him.

435
00:32:55,997 --> 00:32:59,487
I keep wondering what it would've been like...

436
00:32:59,487 --> 00:33:02,427
if he were my son.

437
00:33:03,657 --> 00:33:06,707
- Honey, what do you— 
 - Why are you so surprised?

438
00:33:06,707 --> 00:33:09,597
That's just how I feel.

439
00:33:09,597 --> 00:33:11,877
I was just saying that.

440
00:33:11,877 --> 00:33:13,807
I'll take a shower.

441
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:25,407
 I'm home. 

442
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:27,607
- Pil Sung. 
 - You're home.

443
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:30,867
- Did you have a good day? 
 - Hey, how's Ma Ri?

444
00:33:30,867 --> 00:33:33,237
She improved a lot. She has a good appetite now, too.

445
00:33:33,237 --> 00:33:34,827
I see.

446
00:33:34,827 --> 00:33:37,037
That's a relief.

447
00:33:37,037 --> 00:33:38,697
Pil Sung.

448
00:33:39,277 --> 00:33:41,087
What kind of food do they eat?

449
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:42,997
What did you eat?

450
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:46,077
Fish, grilled abalone,

451
00:33:46,077 --> 00:33:49,297
pollock roe, gim, tofu stew, and stuff like that.

452
00:33:49,297 --> 00:33:51,317
They're just like us.

453
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:53,917
I thought they ate differently since they are rich.

454
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:57,047
They're basically like us. What they eat can't be that different.

455
00:33:57,047 --> 00:34:00,307
Hey, hey, hey. What do you mean, they're like us?

456
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:02,417
You think all fish are the same?

457
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:05,697
They couldn't have had saury or mackerel. That's what we eat.

458
00:34:05,697 --> 00:34:09,287
They must've had brown croaker or tilefish.

459
00:34:09,287 --> 00:34:13,317
They must use top-quality beef for bulgogi, too.

460
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:18,457
By the way, did the Chairman say anything to you?

461
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:22,287
Did he just invite you for dinner?

462
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,927
He asked me to feel free to visit whenever I miss Ma Ri.

463
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,967
Pil Sung, you must be tired. Go rest upstairs.

464
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:33,767
- Okay. I'll go upstairs. 
 - Okay.

465
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:34,807
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

466
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:37,077
That means...

467
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:41,417
the Chairman acknowledges Pil Sung as Ma Ri's brother.

468
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:47,407
I thought he was just treating him to a dinner to thank him for helping Ma Ri.

469
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:53,997
What if he thinks Pil Sung as his stepson?

470
00:34:53,997 --> 00:34:56,207
Stepson, my foot.

471
00:34:56,207 --> 00:34:58,817
Pil Sung is my son. My son, Mom.

472
00:34:58,817 --> 00:35:02,987
I know. Everyone agrees he's your son.

473
00:35:02,987 --> 00:35:07,237
Anyway, I'm glad they aren't getting divorced.

474
00:35:07,237 --> 00:35:10,897
That's a great thing for Pil Sung, too.

475
00:35:10,897 --> 00:35:12,327
What are you talking about?

476
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:16,217
What does their divorce have to do anything with Pil Sung?

477
00:35:16,217 --> 00:35:19,947
Of course, it has to do with him. They say even arms bend inward.

478
00:35:19,947 --> 00:35:24,207
Why did he give Pil Sung such a high position, then?

479
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:25,947
He made him the CEO.

480
00:35:25,947 --> 00:35:28,687
He did that because he's considering it.

481
00:35:28,687 --> 00:35:32,347
It's because he's good at his job, Mother.

482
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:34,907
Stop with all this nonsense.

483
00:35:34,907 --> 00:35:37,277
I'm listening to you because you're my mom.

484
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:40,647
If you were my neighbor, I would've flipped out.

485
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:46,517
Mom, I think they feel uncomfortable that they invited Pil Sung for dinner.

486
00:35:46,517 --> 00:35:50,367
Like sharing their son with them. I'd be uneasy about it, too.

487
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:52,037
What's so bad about it?

488
00:35:52,037 --> 00:35:55,517
I'd be dancing to celebrate.

489
00:35:55,517 --> 00:36:00,357
A chaebol family acknowledged him as Ma Ri's brother.

490
00:36:00,357 --> 00:36:04,967
Pil Sung's future is bright from now on.

491
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:07,937
It's not like they want to split him in half.

492
00:36:07,937 --> 00:36:10,577
What's the big deal, exactly?

493
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:19,925
I thought you were seriously injured. Do you know how scared I was?

494
00:36:19,925 --> 00:36:22,815
I was so worried while carrying you.

495
00:36:22,815 --> 00:36:25,545
Why would you lie about that?

496
00:36:25,545 --> 00:36:31,015
I know I'm your driver and bodyguard, but the more I think about it, the angrier I get.

497
00:36:31,015 --> 00:36:33,535
A-Angry?

498
00:36:33,535 --> 00:36:39,331
I'm sorry, Do Jun. I just wanted you to hold me again.

499
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:43,141
When I was upset and sick, you held me.

500
00:36:43,141 --> 00:36:45,281
I kept thinking about that.

501
00:36:45,281 --> 00:36:47,351
That's why I did that.

502
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:52,401
Then, you should've told me that instead.

503
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:59,281
Would you hold me anytime if I asked you to?

504
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,981
What?

505
00:37:00,981 --> 00:37:03,051
See? You aren't going to.

506
00:37:03,051 --> 00:37:05,001
That's why I lied.

507
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,571
But...

508
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,841
why do you want me to hold you?

509
00:37:11,841 --> 00:37:13,061
What?

510
00:37:13,061 --> 00:37:14,521
That's...

511
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,551
Do you want to hear the reason?

512
00:37:24,581 --> 00:37:25,921
Yes.

513
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,831
Well...

514
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,891
I think I must like you.

515
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:38,351
What?

516
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,081
What do you mean, "What"? I said I think I like you! Whatever!

517
00:37:52,161 --> 00:37:54,001
What do you think, Director? She improved a lot, right?

518
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:55,881
Yes, she did.

519
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:58,671
Ji Yeong, that was amazing. You can graduate now.

520
00:37:58,671 --> 00:38:00,021
Really?

521
00:38:00,021 --> 00:38:02,071
Thank you.

522
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,381
Ji Yeong, take this umbrella. It's raining a lot.

523
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,991
I'm okay.

524
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,631
I'll get going now.

525
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,091
 Do Ra, try the shrimp, too. 

526
00:38:55,091 --> 00:38:56,731
 It's delicious. 

527
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,411
 I see. 

528
00:39:02,411 --> 00:39:05,181
 I'll always be your fan, no matter what. 

529
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:10,561
 Let me know if anyone's giving you a hard time. I'll... take care of everything for you. 

530
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,751
What are these memories?

531
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,001
Ahjumma was right about everything.

532
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:33,351
President Gong's feelings were sincere.

533
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,711
Because I didn't remember,

534
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:40,381
I mistook the person who was devoted to me.

535
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,781
And I turned against him.

536
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:59,220
   

537
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,011
   

538
00:40:07,011 --> 00:40:09,841
Why is this woman calling me?

539
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,081
She should call Go Pil Sung instead.

540
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,391
Hello?

541
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:24,051
Yes.

542
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,631
What is it?

543
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:31,361
What made you suddenly call me?

544
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,881
Dinner?

545
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:38,941
I don't have a dinner plan tonight.

546
00:40:38,941 --> 00:40:41,221
 My grandma is making dumplings today. 

547
00:40:41,221 --> 00:40:44,351
 Would you like to come over for dumpling soup? 

548
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,031
Yes, I'll be there, then.

549
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:50,581
Okay.

550
00:40:56,451 --> 00:41:00,731
Can't believe she's inviting me to eat dumpling soup.

551
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:05,261
 Director Go Pil Sung and Writer Kim Oh Gyeong's new drama, 

552
00:41:05,261 --> 00:41:07,681
 - "Seoul Lady" has a cast now...  
 - My goodness.

553
00:41:07,681 --> 00:41:12,401
The country bumpkin from the rental unit is the female lead?

554
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:16,101
 The female lead is the rising star, Kim Ji Yeong. 

555
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:19,801
 The viewers are excited about the great cast. 

556
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:21,711
 Especially Kim Ji Yeong, the female lead... 

557
00:41:21,711 --> 00:41:24,571
Why are you watching that? How annoying.

558
00:41:24,571 --> 00:41:27,671
 She surprised us with her acting... 

559
00:41:27,671 --> 00:41:28,971
What?

560
00:41:28,971 --> 00:41:32,241
Why are you turning that off, huh?

561
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:36,171
That little... They were talking about Pil Sung's drama!

562
00:41:36,171 --> 00:41:38,891
That brat.

563
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:42,601
M-Myeong Dong, Myeong Dong.

564
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:45,611
Give me five minutes... I mean, one minute. Hear me out.

565
00:41:45,611 --> 00:41:47,581
Hey, get out of the way.

566
00:41:47,581 --> 00:41:52,081
Yes, you could be mistaken if you saw me with Ji Yeong, then.

567
00:41:52,081 --> 00:41:55,871
But Myeong Dong, Ji Yeong is my sister, Do Ra.

568
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:57,721
Park Do Ra.

569
00:42:00,211 --> 00:42:01,761
What?

570
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:07,631
Because she lost her memory and her face changed from the accident,

571
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:10,831
Ji Yeong didn't even know she was Do Ra.

572
00:42:11,881 --> 00:42:17,391
Did everyone find out because of the DNA test, then?

573
00:42:18,101 --> 00:42:21,241
You know, no one can find out she's Do Ra.

574
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:23,351
So, she decided to live as Kim Ji Yeong.

575
00:42:23,351 --> 00:42:26,811
We don't call her Do Ra, either. We call her Ji Yeong.

576
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:30,351
My goodness. How could that happen?

577
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:33,981
Gosh, that makes no sense.

578
00:42:33,981 --> 00:42:37,461
If you don't believe me, ask Pil Sung. It's true.

579
00:42:37,461 --> 00:42:39,761
Does Pil Sung know, too?

580
00:42:45,581 --> 00:42:47,351
   

581
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:52,241
Hey, Sang Gu.

582
00:42:52,241 --> 00:42:54,641
Did you arrive in the Philippines safely?

583
00:42:54,641 --> 00:42:57,781
 No, I haven't left Seoul yet. 

584
00:42:57,781 --> 00:42:59,481
W-What did you say?

585
00:42:59,481 --> 00:43:01,411
You're still in Seoul?

586
00:43:01,411 --> 00:43:05,361
You agreed to go to the Philippines. Why are you still in Seoul?

587
00:43:05,361 --> 00:43:07,221
Sang Gu, what's wrong with you?

588
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:09,911
I gave you money to stay in the Philippines.

589
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:11,961
What are you still doing here?

590
00:43:11,961 --> 00:43:15,641
Ae Gyo, that's not important to me right now.

591
00:43:15,641 --> 00:43:18,131
So be honest with me.

592
00:43:18,131 --> 00:43:21,451
Your son, Jin Dan, is my son, isn't he?

593
00:43:21,451 --> 00:43:24,251
W-What did you say?

594
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:26,231
Why would you say something so silly?

595
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:27,901
I told you he's not.

596
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:30,081
Are you sure? Really?

597
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:33,761
What's wrong with you? What are you trying to say about him?

598
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:36,021
It's not true. No, never.

599
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:37,311
Fine.

600
00:43:37,311 --> 00:43:40,141
I'll meet with President Gong myself.

601
00:43:40,141 --> 00:43:43,491
We'll do a DNA test together, too.

602
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:46,951
Angel Investment is in the APP Group building, right?

603
00:43:46,951 --> 00:43:49,931
No, Sang Gu. Don't do that.

604
00:43:49,931 --> 00:43:53,121
Jin Dan doesn't know anything.

605
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:57,291
He thinks he's the chairman's son.

606
00:44:04,581 --> 00:44:06,121
Was...

607
00:44:07,571 --> 00:44:10,661
Was Jin Dan really my son?

608
00:44:10,661 --> 00:44:13,001
S-Sang Gu...

609
00:44:18,961 --> 00:44:20,961
Until now...

610
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:24,221
I've been living without knowing I had a son.

611
00:44:24,221 --> 00:44:26,041
Hong Ae Gyo,

612
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:30,871
how could you fool me this entire time?

613
00:44:30,871 --> 00:44:35,321
No, no. I didn't know, either.

614
00:44:35,321 --> 00:44:38,351
Since I had him and until now,

615
00:44:38,351 --> 00:44:43,601
I believed he was the late Chairman Gong Dae Gil's son.

616
00:44:44,051 --> 00:44:49,531
But because you said he resembles your father last time,

617
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:52,031
I tried taking the test.

618
00:44:52,031 --> 00:44:54,441
It turns out he really is your son.

619
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:58,591
I had no idea this would be the case.

620
00:44:59,211 --> 00:45:01,931
You're talking about a DNA test, right?

621
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:05,291
The result actually said he is my son?

622
00:45:06,201 --> 00:45:07,761
Yes.

623
00:45:07,761 --> 00:45:11,491
Ae Gyo, please let me meet our son.

624
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:14,701
- My son, Jin Dan. 
 - What are you talking about?

625
00:45:14,701 --> 00:45:16,231
You can't do that. Never.

626
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:17,961
No? Why not?

627
00:45:17,961 --> 00:45:19,311
Why can't I see my son?

628
00:45:19,311 --> 00:45:21,851
I told you last time.

629
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:27,521
He's about to become Chairman Gong's adoptive son.

630
00:45:27,521 --> 00:45:31,151
He's about to become the successor of APP Group.

631
00:45:31,151 --> 00:45:33,931
What if they found out you were his biological father?

632
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:38,161
Not to mention he won't be adopted, they'd kick both of us out.

633
00:45:38,161 --> 00:45:41,001
We'd be left with nothing overnight, and it'd all be over.

634
00:45:41,001 --> 00:45:43,121
Will you still do this? You want all of us to die?

635
00:45:43,121 --> 00:45:45,051
What else will I do, then?

636
00:45:45,051 --> 00:45:46,691
What do you want me to do?

637
00:45:46,691 --> 00:45:49,201
Don't you know already?

638
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:50,721
I told you to stay in the Philippines.

639
00:45:50,721 --> 00:45:52,641
Ae Gyo, that's not right.

640
00:45:52,641 --> 00:45:55,991
My son is somewhere in Seoul right now.

641
00:46:00,681 --> 00:46:05,321
You have to stay absolutely silent, then.

642
00:46:05,321 --> 00:46:08,701
Do it for Jin Dan and nothing else.

643
00:46:08,701 --> 00:46:11,251
Unless you want to ruin his life.

644
00:46:11,251 --> 00:46:13,991
Okay, okay. I promise you, then.

645
00:46:13,991 --> 00:46:16,081
I'll never say I'm his father.

646
00:46:16,081 --> 00:46:18,351
I'll stay silent.

647
00:46:19,121 --> 00:46:23,261
You really... need to keep that promise.

648
00:46:24,021 --> 00:46:25,411
Okay.

649
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:28,601
Thank you, Ae Gyo.

650
00:46:29,651 --> 00:46:32,711
Can't believe my son is living in this world.

651
00:46:49,231 --> 00:46:53,491
On a second look, he resembles me. He really does.

652
00:46:53,491 --> 00:46:56,161
He's my son. He really is.

653
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:59,321
Can't believe my offspring existed in this world.

654
00:47:02,641 --> 00:47:06,281
Jin Dan, you aren't Gong Jin Dan.

655
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,841
You're Jin Jin Dan.

656
00:47:07,841 --> 00:47:09,721
Jin Jin Dan.

657
00:47:17,681 --> 00:47:19,601
   

658
00:47:22,751 --> 00:47:24,131
Yes, Tae Hee.

659
00:47:24,131 --> 00:47:27,091
 My friend So Hee and her boyfriend are coming tomorrow, too. 

660
00:47:27,091 --> 00:47:28,511
 Would you be okay with it? 

661
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,221
Of course, it's okay.

662
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:32,731
I rented the whole restaurant for tomorrow.

663
00:47:32,731 --> 00:47:36,461
You can invite more friends if you want.

664
00:47:36,461 --> 00:47:38,321
 See you tomorrow, then, Jin Dan. 

665
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:40,841
All right. See you.

666
00:47:43,851 --> 00:47:45,561
Come on in.

667
00:47:45,561 --> 00:47:46,891
Gosh, President Gong.

668
00:47:46,891 --> 00:47:48,811
Gosh, what's all this?

669
00:47:48,811 --> 00:47:51,031
My gosh, why did you bring so much?

670
00:47:51,031 --> 00:47:54,461
- My goodness. 
 - It's nothing.

671
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:57,301
It's for President Baek and Grandma.

672
00:47:57,301 --> 00:48:01,701
I got you skincare sets and clothes. This and that.

673
00:48:01,701 --> 00:48:04,751
- It's not much. 
 - Gosh, thank you, President Gong.

674
00:48:04,751 --> 00:48:08,411
Hold on, hold on. I'll make you a delicious dumpling soup.

675
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:11,911
Have a seat here. Wait a moment.

676
00:48:11,911 --> 00:48:13,611
Have a seat here.

677
00:48:13,611 --> 00:48:15,611
Well, okay.

678
00:48:23,361 --> 00:48:25,811
 The fruit looks great. 

679
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:29,120
 It's clearly expensive stuff. 

680
00:48:29,901 --> 00:48:33,971
I just wiped the floor with a rag.

681
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:36,011
Is there something on it?

682
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:37,741
No, it's not that.

683
00:48:37,741 --> 00:48:42,101
I'm not used to sitting on a bare floor.

684
00:48:42,661 --> 00:48:47,351
I guess chaebols only sit on sofas.

685
00:49:04,751 --> 00:49:06,311
Well...

686
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:09,291
What is it? Does it taste bad?

687
00:49:10,091 --> 00:49:11,541
No, no. It's tasty.

688
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:15,411
It's because I had a late lunch.

689
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,291
President Gong, it's okay.

690
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:22,751
Eat only as much as you'd like. Don't feel pressured.

691
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:27,901
My dumplings and kimchi are famous in my neighborhood.

692
00:49:27,901 --> 00:49:31,370
Then... try some of this.

693
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:32,990
It's baby napa.

694
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:37,561
I'm sure it will give you a good appetite.

695
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:41,651
Yes. Let me rip it off for you.

696
00:49:41,651 --> 00:49:45,521
Here. Eat it with the soup.

697
00:49:45,521 --> 00:49:47,261
So tasty.

698
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:51,901
Gosh, Grandma!

699
00:49:51,901 --> 00:49:54,451
You can't rip kimchi with your hand. It's dirty.

700
00:49:54,451 --> 00:49:56,521
You can't just do that.

701
00:49:56,521 --> 00:49:59,091
What? Dirty?

702
00:49:59,091 --> 00:50:01,671
I just washed my hand, you bitch.

703
00:50:01,671 --> 00:50:05,041
How dare you speak up? You mean stepmother.

704
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:08,471
Look, my hands are way cleaner than yours.

705
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:09,991
Did you call them dirty?

706
00:50:09,991 --> 00:50:12,341
- She called me dirty. 
 - Gosh, Grandma.

707
00:50:12,341 --> 00:50:14,751
- What do you mean, dirty? 
 - Are you serious right now?

708
00:50:14,751 --> 00:50:16,921
Just eat your dumpling soup!

709
00:50:16,921 --> 00:50:18,541
- Stuff my face? 
 - Yes!

710
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:19,881
Grandma.

711
00:50:19,881 --> 00:50:20,951
She has dementia.

712
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:24,261
She thinks I'm Ji Yeong's stepmother. Don't worry.

713
00:50:24,261 --> 00:50:27,511
Go on and eat! Seriously. Eat.

714
00:50:27,511 --> 00:50:30,281
Seriously. Why would you touch the kimchi?

715
00:50:30,281 --> 00:50:33,001
Look what you did! Seriously.

716
00:50:33,001 --> 00:50:35,021
I'm sorry, President Gong.

717
00:50:35,021 --> 00:50:38,891
You couldn't even eat much because of my grandma.

718
00:50:38,891 --> 00:50:42,261
It's okay. I ate enough.

719
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:46,861
By the way, what made you invite me to your home?

720
00:50:47,801 --> 00:50:52,351
Because I wanted to apologize to you.

721
00:50:54,111 --> 00:50:58,091
I'm sorry... about everything.

722
00:50:59,071 --> 00:51:02,661
Sorry? What do you mean, all of a sudden?

723
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:05,761
Seriously.

724
00:51:07,241 --> 00:51:10,291
What are you trying to say after feeding me dumpling soup?

725
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:12,211
It's not that.

726
00:51:12,811 --> 00:51:17,111
I mistook your intentions all this time.

727
00:51:17,111 --> 00:51:20,671
You were sincerely nice to me.

728
00:51:21,851 --> 00:51:25,291
But I think I mistook it.

729
00:51:27,341 --> 00:51:29,021
Ji Yeong.

730
00:51:34,581 --> 00:51:38,330
I was upset because you hurt me so much.

731
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:42,271
But you're finally understanding me.

732
00:51:42,271 --> 00:51:45,161
I'll be good to you from now on.

733
00:51:45,161 --> 00:51:46,621
I'll be better.

734
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:49,701
Ji Yeong.

735
00:52:09,971 --> 00:52:12,611
I actually need to go back to the office.

736
00:52:12,611 --> 00:52:16,281
I'll take care of this and call you.

737
00:52:16,281 --> 00:52:18,821
Let's talk later, okay? Bye.

738
00:52:42,401 --> 00:52:45,451
 Ji Yeong, I need to talk to you. 

739
00:52:45,451 --> 00:52:47,571
 Let's meet up for a moment. 

740
00:52:56,581 --> 00:52:58,161
I'm sorry.

741
00:52:59,941 --> 00:53:02,571
I won't make any excuses.

742
00:53:03,371 --> 00:53:06,231
All of your memories are true.

743
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:12,771
Since that day and until this very moment,

744
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:16,981
I've regretted not reaching out to you that day

745
00:53:18,961 --> 00:53:22,001
countless times every day...

746
00:53:23,231 --> 00:53:25,491
over and over again.

747
00:53:28,931 --> 00:53:30,571
I'm sorry.

748
00:53:32,141 --> 00:53:34,101
I'm so sorry.

749
00:53:34,901 --> 00:53:37,001
I don't see the point...

750
00:53:37,931 --> 00:53:40,891
of having this talk now.

751
00:53:42,371 --> 00:53:44,961
Instead of telling me this now,

752
00:53:44,961 --> 00:53:49,611
you should have told me when you found out I was Park Do Ra.

753
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:56,121
If I hadn't regained my memory, you would never have told me this.

754
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:59,351
If so, I would've still been in the dark

755
00:53:59,351 --> 00:54:04,371
and kept falling for you and loving you.

756
00:54:06,781 --> 00:54:08,601
Like a fool.

757
00:54:13,261 --> 00:54:14,831
Yes.

758
00:54:17,561 --> 00:54:20,281
Even if you blame me and hate me,

759
00:54:21,811 --> 00:54:23,851
I have nothing to say.

760
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:28,801
I guess I'm being punished for...

761
00:54:30,131 --> 00:54:32,261
letting go of your hand, then.

762
00:54:33,381 --> 00:54:37,381
I'm willing to be punished.

763
00:54:42,381 --> 00:54:44,961
But with this project,

764
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:48,650
I sincerely want you to become a good actor

765
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:51,881
and I'm rooting for you.

766
00:54:51,881 --> 00:54:56,901
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable on set because of this.

767
00:54:56,901 --> 00:55:00,861
I wanted to see you to tell you this.

768
00:55:01,611 --> 00:55:03,621
Okay, got it.

769
00:55:04,751 --> 00:55:07,761
I'll do my best to prepare for the drama.

770
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:13,101
And I'll talk to you on set if I need to.

771
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,561
I'll get going now.

772
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:35,931
 Yes, thank you. 

773
00:55:35,931 --> 00:55:38,000
Hello.

774
00:55:38,451 --> 00:55:40,411
I'll see you inside.

775
00:55:42,371 --> 00:55:46,491
 Feel free to use this place for company workshops. 

776
00:55:46,491 --> 00:55:48,831
Gosh, thank you so much.

777
00:55:48,831 --> 00:55:51,421
I'll sign up for a lesson, then.

778
00:55:51,421 --> 00:55:52,731
I'll pay for it.

779
00:55:52,731 --> 00:55:55,411
 Wow, so cool. 

780
00:55:55,411 --> 00:55:56,751
 If you're interested... 

781
00:55:56,751 --> 00:55:59,181
 Yes. Of course. 

782
00:56:01,741 --> 00:56:04,991
Mom, Dad, what's all this?

783
00:56:04,991 --> 00:56:06,601
This?

784
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:11,391
Mom stayed up all night to prepare for the good-luck ritual.

785
00:56:11,391 --> 00:56:12,781
Seriously.

786
00:56:12,781 --> 00:56:15,241
The company prepared for it. You didn't have to do this.

787
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:16,591
I wanted to do it.

788
00:56:16,591 --> 00:56:19,681
- This doesn't compare to the company doing it. 
 - Of course.

789
00:56:19,681 --> 00:56:22,961
Your next drama needs to be a success, too.

790
00:56:22,961 --> 00:56:25,111
Hurry and take these outside.

791
00:56:25,111 --> 00:56:28,831
Thank you. It's all thanks to you if it becomes a success.

792
00:56:28,831 --> 00:56:33,031
- Come on. 
 - It'd be because you're talented.

793
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:43,551
 You know no one can find out she's Do Ra. 

794
00:56:43,551 --> 00:56:45,311
 So she decided to live as Kim Ji Yeong. 

795
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,421
 We don't call her Do Ra, either. We call her Ji Yeong.
 

796
00:56:49,611 --> 00:56:53,001
The tenant lady was Park Do Ra?

797
00:56:53,001 --> 00:56:55,701
And she lost her memory?

798
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:58,381
I can't believe she's alive.

799
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:00,691
That famous Park Do Ra...

800
00:57:00,691 --> 00:57:02,241
What about Park Do Ra?

801
00:57:02,241 --> 00:57:04,161
You scared me, Mom!

802
00:57:04,161 --> 00:57:08,181
Why are you suddenly talking about the late Park Do Ra?

803
00:57:08,181 --> 00:57:09,741
When did I?

804
00:57:09,741 --> 00:57:12,241
You just said something about Park Do Ra.

805
00:57:12,241 --> 00:57:14,051
Well...

806
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:16,261
I thought her role...

807
00:57:16,261 --> 00:57:20,941
would've suited Park Do Ra, too. That's what I said.

808
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:22,431
Is that so?

809
00:57:23,181 --> 00:57:25,081
By the way,

810
00:57:25,081 --> 00:57:31,381
why are the In-law's gold digger and the tenant lady together?

811
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:36,970
Ji Yeong is represented by that lady. That's why.

812
00:57:37,461 --> 00:57:39,691
How did you know that?

813
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:42,881
Well...

814
00:57:42,881 --> 00:57:45,530
A writer friend of mine is friends with the film crew.

815
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:47,380
That's where I heard it.

816
00:58:06,281 --> 00:58:12,001
Please let us finish "Seoul Lady" without any problems.

817
00:58:12,001 --> 00:58:15,621
Please let it be loved by the viewers, too.

818
00:58:22,861 --> 00:58:24,881
I brought the big bill.

819
00:58:24,881 --> 00:58:26,421
A very big one.

820
00:58:26,421 --> 00:58:28,041
Applause.

821
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:33,141
Here we go.

822
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:47,551
Team Leader, I thought we were having a meeting here.

823
00:58:47,551 --> 00:58:49,301
Where are the buyers?

824
00:58:49,301 --> 00:58:51,881
Didn't I tell you?

825
00:58:51,881 --> 00:58:54,631
- It was canceled. 
 - Pardon?

826
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:57,841
Since you're already here,

827
00:58:57,841 --> 00:59:00,051
let's have a drink together.

828
00:59:04,401 --> 00:59:06,041
I'll get going now.

829
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:08,381
Where are you going?

830
00:59:10,911 --> 00:59:12,751
Let go.

831
00:59:12,751 --> 00:59:15,401
Let go! I'll scream!

832
00:59:15,401 --> 00:59:18,331
Go ahead. Scream!

833
00:59:18,331 --> 00:59:20,541
There's no one here.

834
00:59:22,261 --> 00:59:25,861
 You came in here of your own volition, 

835
00:59:25,861 --> 00:59:28,291
 but not when you leave. 

836
00:59:28,291 --> 00:59:30,231
 No, no! 

837
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:32,801
 No, let go of me! 

838
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:48,971
Cut, okay!

839
01:00:04,311 --> 01:00:06,691
Are you okay, Ji Yeong?

840
01:00:07,391 --> 01:00:09,401
Here. Have some water.

841
01:00:18,761 --> 01:00:20,461
 Like this? 

842
01:00:30,091 --> 01:00:31,751
Ji Yeong.

843
01:00:35,401 --> 01:00:36,991
What's wrong with Ji Yeong?

844
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:39,301
- Ji Yeong! 
 - Ji Yeong!

845
01:00:42,531 --> 01:00:44,041
Ji Yeong!

846
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:45,561
Ji Yeong!

847
01:00:45,561 --> 01:00:47,271
Ji Yeong!

848
01:00:48,041 --> 01:00:49,521
Ji Yeong!

849
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:51,101
Ji Yeong!

850
01:01:10,021 --> 01:01:12,111
 What are you doing? 

851
01:01:12,111 --> 01:01:13,421
 I don't want to hurt you. 

852
01:01:13,421 --> 01:01:16,771
 So don't make me go crazy, okay? 

853
01:01:19,431 --> 01:01:22,191
 Open the door. Open the door! 

854
01:01:22,191 --> 01:01:24,661
 Open the door! Help! 

855
01:01:24,661 --> 01:01:27,721
 Someone's trapped in here! 

856
01:01:27,721 --> 01:01:29,031
Ji Yeong!

857
01:01:29,031 --> 01:01:30,871
Ji Yeong!

858
01:01:30,871 --> 01:01:32,811
Kim Ji Yeong!

859
01:01:33,201 --> 01:01:35,121
 Park Do Ra! 

860
01:01:35,121 --> 01:01:36,471
 Where are you, Park Do Ra? 

861
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:39,481
 You think you can just leave like this? 

862
01:01:52,441 --> 01:01:54,181
Ji Yeong!

863
01:01:55,401 --> 01:01:57,191
Ji Yeong!

864
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:00,661
- Ji Yeong! 
 - Ji Yeong!

865
01:02:00,661 --> 01:02:03,021
- Ji Yeong! 
 - The rain!

866
01:02:03,021 --> 01:02:04,581
Ji Yeong!

867
01:02:04,581 --> 01:02:07,420
Ji Yeong! Please...

868
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:16,480


869
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,421
 Park Do Ra! Park Do Ra! 

870
01:02:19,421 --> 01:02:21,221
 Unni! 

871
01:02:29,471 --> 01:02:31,611
 Hold on! Unni! 

872
01:02:31,611 --> 01:02:34,191
 Unni! 

873
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:45,941
 You're my star, and I'm your moon. 

874
01:02:45,941 --> 01:02:47,841
 I'm sorry. 

875
01:02:49,951 --> 01:02:51,291
 I can't do it. 

876
01:02:51,291 --> 01:02:54,121
 I'll make two billion if I do this for a few hours. 

877
01:02:54,121 --> 01:02:56,511
 Can you give me that money? 

878
01:02:57,141 --> 01:02:59,051
 I'll be the one who'd regret it. 

879
01:02:59,051 --> 01:03:02,381
 So, shut up and leave unless you have two billion! 

880
01:03:07,781 --> 01:03:09,411
I...

881
01:03:12,551 --> 01:03:15,651
I understand everything now.

882
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,311
Everything.

883
01:03:24,691 --> 01:03:26,431
Ji Yeong!

884
01:03:28,181 --> 01:03:29,891
Ji Yeong!

885
01:03:30,951 --> 01:03:32,771
Ji Yeong!

886
01:03:35,321 --> 01:03:37,161
Ji Yeong!

887
01:03:38,251 --> 01:03:41,351
- Ji Yeong! 
 - Oppa.

888
01:03:42,241 --> 01:03:44,161
Ji Yeong!

889
01:03:46,101 --> 01:03:48,001
Ji Yeong!

890
01:03:53,151 --> 01:03:55,031
Ji Yeong!

891
01:03:59,641 --> 01:04:01,511
Ji Yeong!

892
01:04:03,481 --> 01:04:05,391
Ji Yeong!

893
01:04:07,001 --> 01:04:09,001
Ji Yeong!

894
01:04:12,131 --> 01:04:14,051
Ji Yeong!

895
01:04:15,021 --> 01:04:16,771
Ji Yeong!

896
01:04:17,971 --> 01:04:19,911
Ji Yeong!

897
01:04:21,121 --> 01:04:23,181
Ji Yeong!

898
01:04:27,921 --> 01:04:30,481
Not him, but I...

899
01:04:32,591 --> 01:04:35,471
I betrayed him.

900
01:04:36,981 --> 01:04:39,791
I did nothing but hurt him.

901
01:04:39,791 --> 01:04:42,291
I wounded him.

902
01:04:46,511 --> 01:04:51,401
Why are you still by my side like a fool, Oppa?

903
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:56,641
♫  I close my eyes and feel sad  ♫

904
01:04:56,641 --> 01:05:00,911
You should've forgotten about a terrible woman like me.

905
01:05:03,061 --> 01:05:05,821
You should've erased me.

906
01:05:09,681 --> 01:05:12,151
You should've moved on.

907
01:05:14,151 --> 01:05:17,001
I'm sorry, Oppa.

908
01:05:20,231 --> 01:05:23,051
   

909
01:05:23,051 --> 01:05:27,551
♫  Even if fate tears us apart  ♫

910
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:33,981
♫  Don't let go of my hand you're holding tightly  ♫

911
01:05:33,981 --> 01:05:44,711
♫  The shiny stars of this love don't fade  ♫

912
01:05:48,651 --> 01:05:51,341
♫  One love  ♫

913
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:56,811
 Why are you suddenly packing? 

914
01:05:56,811 --> 01:05:57,961
 Where are you going? 

915
01:05:57,961 --> 01:05:59,921
 What do you mean, you got yourself a place? 

916
01:05:59,921 --> 01:06:02,701
 I want to live as Kim Ji Yeong, not your daughter, Park Do Ra. 

917
01:06:02,701 --> 01:06:05,021
 Our love forever. 

918
01:06:05,021 --> 01:06:06,641
 They say people don't change. 

919
01:06:06,641 --> 01:06:08,641
 You try to win people over like this. 

920
01:06:08,641 --> 01:06:11,861
 How come you haven't changed at all? 

921
01:06:11,861 --> 01:06:14,661
 What will you do about this? What will you do with this great loss? 

922
01:06:14,661 --> 01:06:15,801
 Don't worry. 

923
01:06:15,801 --> 01:06:18,271
 It will end up with me after all. 

924
01:06:18,271 --> 01:06:20,451
 What happened that day, anyway? 

925
01:06:20,451 --> 01:06:22,321
 You remembered something else, right? 

926
01:06:22,321 --> 01:06:24,781
 Tell me if you remembered something.
