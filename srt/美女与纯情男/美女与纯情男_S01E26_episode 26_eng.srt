1
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,080
Hey. 
    

2
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,320
You cocky bastard.

3
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,920
What did you say?

4
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,030
What? Piece of trash?

5
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,140
Hey.

6
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,240
How dare you hit me?

7
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,920
Coming onto another woman when you have a fiancee.

8
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,380
That's a piece of trash. What else?

9
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,200
What kind of man does that?

10
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,850
Whether I date one woman or two, what do you care?

11
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,220
I chose Ji Yeong first.

12
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,130
You're the one who stole my woman, you bastard!

13
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,350
How dare someone like you try to steal mine?

14
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,990
Kim Ji Yeong is mine, you bastard!

15
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,760
Pil Sung!

16
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,610
Don't hit my Oppa!

17
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,570
- Pil Sung! 
 - Don't hit my Oppa!

18
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,380
Pil Sung is my oppa!

19
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,010
Stop!

20
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,440
Stop!

21
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,780
He's my oppa! Stop hitting him!

22
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,720
Stop hitting him!

23
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,830
Let go!

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,830
Stop!

25
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,990
What's going on?

26
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,130
What are you doing right now?

27
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,700
Pil Sung, are you okay? My gosh.

28
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,680
Pil Sung, why are you two fighting?

29
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,400
Are you two fighting because of the tenant lady?

30
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,350
Aigoo, why are you fighting over that country bumpkin?

31
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,810
Aigoo! Seriously!

32
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,490
Gong Jin Dan, don't call me from now on.

33
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,970
Let's never see each other again.

34
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,470
My gosh, Tae Hee! Tae Hee!

35
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,950
Gosh, what's going on right now?

36
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,430
- Aigoo. 
 - Aunt, are you okay?

37
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,440
Are you okay?

38
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:29,090


39
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,630
Aunt, what are you doing?

40
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,510
How could you still slap him?

41
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,540
They say you can't lie about your origin.

42
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,040
This is why you're called the mistress' son.

43
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,820
Aunt!

44
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,790
How dare you yell after dragging our family through crap?

45
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,440
Don't you know what kind of family Ilyoo Foods is?

46
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,710
It was so hard for me to arrange this. How dare you ruin it?

47
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,420
At your sister-in-law's foundation ceremony, even.

48
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,820
You brash bastard!

49
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,210
Chairman Gong, we shouldn't have given him Angel Investment.

50
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,720
How am I supposed to overcome this humiliation?

51
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,800
Aunt, I'm sorry.

52
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,300
I'll scold him.

53
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,630
I know you're thoughtless,

54
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,590
but you chase after another woman when you have a fiancee?

55
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,060
Not to mention that she was taken?

56
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,820
You pathetic bastard.

57
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,920
Uncle, I want to say something, too.

58
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,430
If you touch Pil Sung again, I won't forgive you.

59
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,680
Hey, Gong Ma Ri!

60
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,620
How could you defend Pil Sung instead of your uncle?

61
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,250
What? "My Pil Sung Oppa?"

62
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,370
Is he your biological brother or something?

63
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,110
Is she out of her mind?

64
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,790
Hey, Jang Soo Yeon. Why don't you say something when she's talking nonsense?

65
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,270
I-I'll talk to her.

66
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,330
Gosh, the foolish kid will always act foolish.

67
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,020
See?

68
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,470
Even Ma Ri is looking down on us now.

69
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,920
What will you do now? Huh?

70
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,310
Your brother and aunt are dissatisfied with you.

71
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,210
How could you ruin what we've worked on overnight?

72
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,480
Do you want to see me die?

73
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,160
Go to your aunt and brother, kneel, and beg for forgiveness.

74
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,220
Tell them you'd fix things somehow. No matter what.

75
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,670
Hurry!

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,160
Shit!

77
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,700
Gong Jin Dan!

78
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,350
Hey, where are you going?

79
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,810
Ma Ri. Gong Ma Ri, look at Mom.

80
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,070
You said that earlier,

81
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,510
and in front of people at the event, too.

82
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,270
You can't call Pil Sung "my Oppa."

83
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,910
What if people find out?

84
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,450
How could I do nothing when my uncle and brother are fighting?

85
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,980
I can't stand my brother falling victim.

86
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,890
I won't tolerate even my uncle.

87
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,950
But still, if you keep doing this,

88
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,630
people might realize that Pil Sung is your biological brother.

89
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,650
I explained why that can't happen already.

90
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,490
Dad, Seon Yeong, Pil Sung,

91
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,940
and everyone will be in shock and pain.

92
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,060
I know.

93
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,070
But Mom, don't worry.

94
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,980
No matter how much I say, "oppa," people won't notice it.

95
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,970
They'd just think I like him.

96
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,100
People don't abandon their child at their friend's house, even in dramas.

97
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,920
So, people won't be able to even imagine that

98
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,090
Pil Sung is your son you abandoned.

99
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,350
You're the only one who's worried about it.

100
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,110
Do you know what they say in this situation?

101
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,500
"A guilty conscience needs no accuser."

102
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,420
Gosh, I was so shocked that... my heart is still racing even now.

103
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:20,030
I mean, perfectly fine two guys... fighting over that country bumpkin.

104
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,800
Does that even make sense?

105
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,240
I know.

106
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,570
I can understand Pil Sung,

107
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,140
but President Gong is a chaebol's son, and he has a fiancee, too.

108
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,610
How could he have a fight at his sister-in-law's foundation ceremony?

109
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,310
What kind of nonsense is that?

110
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,890
That bastard is even crazier. I'm telling you.

111
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,340
His fiancee looked furious earlier.

112
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,310
Why wouldn't she be? She was very pretty and elegant.

113
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,500
She said, "Let's never see each other again" for a reason.

114
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,170
I would've done the same. Seriously.

115
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,230
Pil Sung doesn't just punch anyone.

116
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,890
That's what I'm talking about!

117
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,590
What did that country bumpkin tenant do that two perfectly fine men would fight like that?

118
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,460
that two perfectly fine men would fight like that?

119
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,130
Welcome back.

120
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,080
Lady, you'd better behave properly while going around.

121
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,990
Do you know what happened today?

122
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,470
Pardon?

123
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,680
Grandma, why are you yelling at Ji Yeong?

124
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,710
She didn't do anything wrong.

125
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,040
What happened?

126
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,500
Director, what happened to your face?

127
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,760
It's nothing.

128
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,770
What do you mean, "It's nothing"?

129
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,910
Because of you, Pil Sung and that President Gong or whatever fought today.

130
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,060
That's why his face looks like this!

131
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,000
- Is that true? 
 - No, no. Let's go, Ji Yeong.

132
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,190
Lady! Stop tempting random men like that!

133
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,240
I said it's not like that, Grandma!

134
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,960
Ji Yeong isn't that kind of a person!

135
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,250
Hey, Go Pil Sung! How dare you yell at your grandmother?

136
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,850
What do we do with that bastard?

137
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,010
He's totally crazy right now. Crazy!

138
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,040
This is crazy...

139
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,780
You swing your fist around all the time.

140
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,310
I didn't know you were such a coarse man.

141
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,380
President Gong punched me first. I had no choice.

142
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,370
You still should've held back.

143
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,070
You should've just avoided it.

144
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,870
President Gong is a weirdo.

145
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,650
You're making yourself look weird by doing that.

146
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:34,500
And you did that in front of families and everyone at the foundation ceremony.

147
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,300
How would that make me look?

148
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,630
I thought you were sensible and wise.

149
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,840
I'm so disappointed.

150
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,650
He said all sorts of nonsense about you.

151
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,500
Was I supposed to tolerate that? Do you want me to be like that?

152
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,810
You might've done that for me,

153
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,250
but you're only making me look worse. Don't you see that?

154
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,780
Same with what you did earlier.

155
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,560
You exploded on Grandma just because she said something.

156
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,830
Did you think you were doing that for me?

157
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:11,230
No, I didn't explode. I just yelled a bit because it was unfair.

158
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,390
She was being too unreasonable.

159
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,280
O-Okay.

160
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,330
I'll be careful from now on. I was careless today.

161
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,520
No.

162
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:30,580
This is all my fault for spilling coffee on President Gong's jacket like a klutz.

163
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:35,290
And it's my fault for having meals with him instead of paying for the jacket.

164
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,240
How could I blame anyone else?

165
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,140
I think I'll get sick if I keep talking to you.

166
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,600
Wait, Ji Yeong!

167
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,000
Don't follow me. I don't want to see you.

168
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,080
What do I do?

169
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,330
Ji Yeong is really angry.

170
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,500
Gosh, what do I do?

171
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,000
 Ji Yeong! 

172
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,320
 Ji Yeong! 

173
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,510
 I got you tteokbokki, your favorite. 

174
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,700
 Open the door. 

175
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,100
I'm fine! I won't eat it!

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,880
 Ji Yeong, it's okay to be mad at me, 

177
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,570
 but you should still eat the tteokbokki. It didn't do anything wrong. 

178
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,280
 I'll leave it here, then. Eat it before it gets cold. 

179
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,490
 It'd get all bloated if it cools. Okay? 

180
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,610
Did he just leave the tteokbokki there?

181
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,360
Yes, the tteokbokki is innocent.

182
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,630
Letting it get bloated would be wrong.

183
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,180
Oh, my gosh!

184
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,940
What are you doing?

185
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,880
You said you'd leave the tteokbokki and go.

186
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,750
Did you scam me just now?

187
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,840
What are you doing?

188
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:30,350
I got angry that President Gong was saying stuff about you that's completely false.

189
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,840
But from now on, I'll hold back every time.

190
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,510
And even if he punches me again,

191
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,670
I won't fight him and run away instead.

192
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,550
That would be okay, right?

193
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,070
I was rash today. I'm sorry.

194
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,660
It's okay.

195
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,870
I'm sorry.

196
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,430
No, I said I was sorry.

197
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,930
Okay.

198
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,080
We're same-same.* 
  (Means "even") 

199
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,670
What did you say? Same-same?

200
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,820
Yes. Don't you know that expression?

201
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,800
Look at your face.

202
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,780
Blow on it, then.

203
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,000
Leave now!

204
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:56,450
What kind of woman is she that... Pil Sung punched someone for her?

205
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,900
Could it be her, by chance?

206
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,590
Did Pil Sung and Jin Dan fight like that over that lady?

207
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,410
Gosh.

208
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,150
Soo Yeon, I'm so sorry about yesterday.

209
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:36,210
Pil Sung did something unforgivable at such an important event.

210
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,540
No, it was Jin Dan's fault.

211
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,790
No one in my family blames Pil Sung.

212
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:49,700
I heard that it sounds like he punched Pil Sung first.

213
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,350
I suppose Pil Sung had no choice.

214
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:00,780
By the way, you haven't told me he has a girlfriend.

215
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,460
When did he start seeing her?

216
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,920
She was a junior staff member for his last drama.

217
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,450
She had nowhere to stay since she moved from the countryside.

218
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,450
So, I let her live in our rental unit.

219
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,880
I suppose it happened when they started driving to work together.

220
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,720
But you didn't know about it?

221
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,600
I couldn't even imagine he'd date her.

222
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,870
I didn't even think of it.

223
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,400
Gosh.

224
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,980
But she was two-timing with your brother-in-law.

225
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,510
Gosh, I can't believe it.

226
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:46,200
I couldn't tell you since I was too embarrassed and upset about it.

227
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,250
So, will you just let him be?

228
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,130
Well, you know how stubborn he can be.

229
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,550
Once he decides, he doesn't care about anything else.

230
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,380
He won't budge, no matter how much we oppose it.

231
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,920
We can't do anything since opposing it might encourage him even more.

232
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,360
But you can't just leave him. You should stop him somehow.

233
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,720
I don't want to judge someone else's daughter,

234
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,100
but I don't think she's right for Pil Sung.

235
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,190
You didn't work so hard to raise Pil Sung to give him to a woman like her.

236
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:28,960
By the way, Soo Yeon, have you met our tenant?

237
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,410
Yes, yes.

238
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,400
I saw her briefly when I came by to get Ma Ri.

239
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,920
I see.

240
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,560
Soo Yeon, what do we do with Pil Sung?

241
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,970
I'm so upset, I could die.

242
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,540
   

243
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,350
Gosh, Tae Hee. Welcome.

244
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,730
- Hello. 
 - Thank you for coming, Tae Hee.

245
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,310
Have a seat.

246
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,440
I'm tearing up because I'm so moved.

247
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,340
You've been so good to me, Mother.

248
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,210
I thought I should say goodbye, at least.

249
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,860
"Goodbye"?

250
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,810
Don't say that. That's so upsetting.

251
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:25,460
Tae Hee, please don't do this to me.

252
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,620
And there was a misunderstanding.

253
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:33,080
He wouldn't do that to someone else's woman. Unless he went totally insane.

254
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,440
He looked after her since she was from the countryside.

255
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,250
But I guess that Director Go Pil Sung was her boyfriend.

256
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,980
I suppose he was mistaken and started a fight.

257
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,800
According to his explanation, it was nothing.

258
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,830
If you and Jin Dan break up over something like this,

259
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,980
I'd be so devastated because it's so unfair.

260
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,910
And our Jin Dan would be heartbroken, too.

261
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,400
Still, he was supposed to marry me.

262
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,800
But he caused an outrageous scene involving another woman.

263
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,160
It was so disappointing, and I can't forgive him for that.

264
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,090
I'll get going now, Mother. Be well.

265
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,950
Tae Hee! Tae Hee! Tae Hee!

266
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,990
What are you doing here now?

267
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,260
Tae Hee stopped by the store just now.

268
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,870
Really? What did she say?

269
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:37,200
I suggested meeting her first, but she decided to come to say goodbye to me.

270
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,030
She must still have feelings for you.

271
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:43,100
And she even teared up when I saw her off.

272
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,100
- Really? 
 - Yes.

273
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,860
So, go and hang onto her. Kneel if you have to.

274
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,690
Otherwise, you'd end up with nothing.

275
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,490
You have to win your brother and aunt back by getting her back. Okay?

276
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,350
I'll try meeting her.

277
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,270
I told her that awful woman was clinging to you.

278
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,490
Come up with an excuse, okay?

279
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:08,080
Okay, I said. You can go now.

280
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,630
By the way, let me ask you something.

281
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,260
Why are you so into her? I'm really curious.

282
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,410
Mom!

283
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,190
How mysterious. I just don't get it.

284
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,030
By chance, are you like that?

285
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,700
- Do you like any woman you come across? 
 - Mom!

286
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,780
I wouldn't be like this if she weren't so terrible.

287
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,680
I can't be out in public since she's so unspeakably humiliating.

288
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,060
Pil Sung, since you've decided this,

289
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,590
you'd better become successful, okay?

290
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,280
I will. Thank you.

291
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,330
And make sure to bring your future projects to us first.

292
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,760
Of course.

293
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,710
No matter where I am, I won't forget that this is my family.

294
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,640
Yes, you can't forget that.

295
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:13,710
And come to me anytime you have any worries or struggles.

296
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,380
- Okay. 
 - And...

297
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,810
make sure to wrap things up as you should before you go.

298
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,580
The business trip to Paris in two days.

299
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,290
Your drama was nominated for the Juniper Award. You'd better go.

300
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:30,350
That way, I get to see Paris, too.

301
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,970
Of course, I'll go.

302
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,540
   

303
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,950
You went through a lot here.

304
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:45,420
Get settled quickly and help me out later, too.

305
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,190
Okay, Hyung.

306
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,550
Gosh, I won't be able to see you starting tomorrow.

307
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,450
It feels like I'm saying goodbye to my kid.

308
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,320
Stop overreacting, Hyung.

309
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,420
I'm serious, man!

310
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,010
Okay. I'll visit you often.

311
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,680
Come by my office for some tea, too.

312
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,170
Of course. Don't complain that I visit too often.

313
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,460
Thank you so much, everyone.

314
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,760
You've worked hard. Thank you.

315
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,700
- I hope we meet again. 
 - Make sure to become successful!

316
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,070
Go Pil Sung, fighting!

317
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,910
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

318
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,180
Let's go!

319
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,470
How bitter-sweet.

320
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,600
   

321
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,370
Thank you!

322
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,060
What am I supposed to do with that bastard?

323
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,600
Do I have to punch him again?

324
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,740
Geez.

325
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,930
Wow...

326
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,490
Is this really my office?

327
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,820
Why is it so huge?

328
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,260
Director Go, what do you think?

329
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,880
Do you like the office? I tried to make it nice.

330
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,270
President Jang, is this really my office?

331
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,260
I don't need such a big office. I think it's too much.

332
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,560
Too much? It's the least I can do.

333
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,580
You're the face of our company, Director Go.

334
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,920
What is it? Do you not like it?

335
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,370
Of course, I like it, but—

336
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,010
That's good to hear, then.

337
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:41,050
You just need to create great projects here.

338
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,490
Thank you.

339
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,170
I'll work myself to the bone and do my best from now on!

340
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,810
Okay! I'll be looking forward, Director Go.

341
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:56,920
Didn't you say there was a project you wanted to work on last time?

342
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,780
Yes, I'm trying to choose between the two.

343
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,480
I'll let you know once I decide.

344
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,450
And I want to start casting right away.

345
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,050
It's hard to cast actors these days.

346
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,640
Really? I'm eager, but I don't know anything.

347
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,300
I'll leave it up to you.

348
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,900
I'll follow your lead, no matter what.

349
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,880
Instead, I'll support you as much as I can.

350
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,700
Thank you. I'll do a good job.

351
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,660
I'll do a good job.

352
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,870
- I'll leave you to it, then. 
 - Okay.

353
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,890
Oh, right...

354
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,910
your mom seemed very worried.

355
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,430
Pardon?

356
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,650
I heard about the tenant lady.

357
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,820
Oh, I see.

358
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:49,040
But according to what I heard, I don't think you should see her, either.

359
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:56,090
Of course, you might be offended I'm saying this,

360
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,590
but I've known you since you were a baby.

361
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,320
I feel like you're my son. So I'm just worried about you.

362
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,090
I can't explain everything,

363
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,820
but Ji Yeong and President Gong's issue was a misunderstanding.

364
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,520
And it's my personal life. I can manage it myself.

365
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,970
Yes, o-of course. Yes.

366
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:24,480
I was just worried that your mom was worried.

367
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,400
Don't worry.

368
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,560
Okay. Get back to it, then.

369
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,010
Okay.

370
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,420
 Why are you two fighting? 

371
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:53,070
 Are you two fighting because of the tenant lady? 

372
00:24:53,070 --> 00:25:00,380
 Aigoo, why are you fighting over that country bumpkin? Seriously! 

373
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,590
Right. Why did I think of that now?

374
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,820
The tenant lady? By chance, is it...

375
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,150
 Oh, our tenant lady. 

376
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,100
 You should have some fried chicken, too. Hurry. 

377
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,310
 Hello. 

378
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,790
She seemed like a nice lady.

379
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,070
Was she seeing both Oppa and Uncle?

380
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,540
Is that why they got into a fight?

381
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,640
I can't believe her.

382
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,220
Who is it?

383
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,730
We need to talk.

384
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,380
Aren't you Ma Ri?

385
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,810
You brought fried chicken last time.

386
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,840
So, what brings you here?

387
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,630
Unni, are you seeing both Pil Sung and Uncle Jin Dan or did you switch from one to the other?

388
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,990
If you switched, who did you switch to?

389
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,030
What are you talking about?

390
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:10,360
See them both? Switch?

391
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,770
Ma Ri, I think you came here mistaken about something.

392
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:19,890
Listen carefully. I'm neither two-timing nor switching.

393
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:24,630
The only person I like is Director Go Pil Sung.

394
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,680
So, what did you do exactly that those two men are fighting over you?

395
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,750
I'm against it, no matter who you date.

396
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,750
I really hate people like you.

397
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:41,790
So, you'd better not see either Oppa or Uncle, okay?

398
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:45,660
I'll pluck all of your hair out if I see you with them again.

399
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,500
Gong Ma Ri!

400
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,760
Ji Yeong, take this.

401
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,730
O-Okay.

402
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:59,500
Gong Ma Ri, talk to me for a second.

403
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,560
Oppa, is that all true?

404
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,190
Yes, it is.

405
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,620
Why? Do you not believe me?

406
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,280
No, I believe everything you say.

407
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,410
Thank you for believing me.

408
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,950
I thought she was two-timing.

409
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,920
It's a bad thing to do. One should be criticized for doing something bad.

410
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,780
Deceiving someone is bad.

411
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,150
I can't stand you seeing a woman who cheats.

412
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,040
That's why I did that.

413
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,610
But since she wasn't,

414
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:47,980
I'll support your relationship with her from now on.

415
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,840
- Do you mean it? 
 - Yes.

416
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,280
Nothing makes me happier than you being happy.

417
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,840
Wow, that's so touching.

418
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,950
Ma Ri, you're really like my little sister.

419
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:08,750
Pil Sung, thank you so much...

420
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,040
for saying that to me.

421
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,910
Ji Yeong, why did you want to meet here?

422
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,780
Just because.

423
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,330
I wanted to tell you something.

424
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:34,040
And the breeze is nice, too.

425
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,200
I wanted to hold hands with you and take a walk.

426
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,370
Wow, what a relief.

427
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,230
I thought you were scolding me. I got so scared.

428
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,710
Director, thank you for earlier today.

429
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,280
thank you for earlier today.

430
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,970
I saw you talking to Ma Ri in the front yard.

431
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,430
You did?

432
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,650
I guess she was mistaken.

433
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,550
But I cleared up her misunderstanding.

434
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,980
She said she'd be on our side.

435
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:21,380
I said I trusted you, but I guess I still felt anxious.

436
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,870
I reflected on my actions, looking at Ma Ri earlier

437
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:29,040
She believes you unconditionally.

438
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:36,670
I'll believe you from now on and... wait, no matter what.

439
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,790
Do you mean it?

440
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,450
Yes.

441
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,990
Like you said, your mother, father, and grandmother

442
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:54,180
will understand my intention as time goes by.

443
00:29:54,180 --> 00:30:00,730
Even if it takes time, I'll have faith in you and wait.

444
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,820
♫  I'll hold you tightly and let you go  ♫

445
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,280
♫  I call for you again  ♫

446
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,040
Thank you.

447
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,100
I'll try my best, too.

448
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:21,880
I'm so happy that you're by my side like this.

449
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,820
Me, too.

450
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,130
   

451
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,730
Do Do, wait at the audition waiting room. Hurry.

452
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,750
Okay, President Baek.

453
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,350
Yes.

454
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,680
Director Go!

455
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,390
Congratulations on joining Go Go Entertainment.

456
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,670
This is to congratulate you.

457
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,970
Yes, thank you.

458
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,100
What brings you here, by the way?

459
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,110
I stopped by on the way to Do Do's audition.

460
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,200
I'm so sorry about last time, Director Go.

461
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,770
To be honest, I mistakenly thought you refused to

462
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:26,500
cast Do Do because of your personal feelings.

463
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,460
That's why I did something so awful.

464
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:33,650
But I apologized to your elders last time already.

465
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,820
Yes, I heard.

466
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:41,670
So, just to let you know, I've been suffering so much since Do Ra died.

467
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:45,980
So, I got back into this business to make a living.

468
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,490
Director Go, please give Do Do a second chance.

469
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:55,100
Please help me stay alive, considering the late Do Ra.

470
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,480
The audition today is open to the public.

471
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,930
If Do Do suits the character, I'd have no reason to reject her.

472
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,890
Prepare for the audition well.

473
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,590
 Gosh, he's so uptight and a stickler. 

474
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,970
Aigoo, you're even encouraging me now?

475
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:17,390
I'll keep that in mind and get going. Thank you.

476
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,600
We're in your care.

477
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,570
   

478
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,300
Don't get nervous, Ji Yeong.

479
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,470
Just watch your accent. Fighting.

480
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:39,470
Okay. I practiced a lot.

481
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,920
Are you nervous?

482
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,830
Relax.

483
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,860
I'll start now.

484
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,120
Okay. 
    

485
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:05,300
Hey, why did you go to the villa?

486
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,510
What were you thinking when you went there?

487
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,940
I don't even go there, and I'm his fiancee. Why would you?

488
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,300
What did you try to get by going there?

489
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,410
You went there on purpose, didn't you?

490
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:20,540
You tried to seduce the Chairman, right?

491
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,480
That's adultery.

492
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,890
Should I post on social media that you're the other woman?

493
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,610
Do you want to be labeled as the other woman at the age of 27?

494
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:37,600
Do you want Chairman to get labeled as a cheater because of you?

495
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,430
Is that really what you want?

496
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,650
Yes, thank you.

497
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,260
Wow!

498
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,200
She's crazy. Crazy.

499
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,000
Wow! How can she act like she was possessed?

500
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:09,270
Oh, no, I think she'll get the part.

501
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:12,220
What would our Do Do do?

502
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,280
Hey! Do Do! Hey! Hey!

503
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,280
How could you make a mistake there?

504
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,890
I told you to focus, not forget the line.

505
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:23,620
I tried to do well, too,

506
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,070
but I ended up messing up. What can I do?

507
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,000
This is all your fault.

508
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,200
You're pressuring me by pushing me like this.

509
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,060
My gosh! She's blaming me?

510
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,290
Where are you going? Do you know how much I spent on you today?

511
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,610
Hey! Hey—

512
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,350
Wow, she's making this impossible to do!

513
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,570
Wow, seriously!

514
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,200
 Aren't you Myeong Dong's boyfriend? 

515
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,480
She really looked like Do Ra.

516
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,890
Can't believe she was the tenant lady.

517
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,380
Why did I get confused?

518
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,850
I don't know what's going on.

519
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,670
Hey, you were home.

520
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,650
Hey, I just got back to have ramen. I need to go again.

521
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,970
Bring me some water, Do Sik.

522
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,590
Okay.

523
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,800
Here.

524
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,550
Thank you.

525
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:56,720
Mom, you said you know the tenant at Go Pil Sung's house, right?

526
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,370
That girl? What about her?

527
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,230
The thing is...

528
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:11,840
Whenever I see that tenant lady, I think of Do Ra for some reason.

529
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:15,630
I keep thinking she's Do Ra somehow.

530
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,650
Whoa, seriously! Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo! Seriously!

531
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:25,040
I know it makes no sense, but I keep thinking she's Do Ra.

532
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:32,270
Mom, maybe her soul couldn't leave this world and stayed at that house.

533
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,690
We once lived in that house.

534
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,880
And now she's living there. Is that why?

535
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,700
Aigoo, Park Do Sik! I'm about to go crazy right now.

536
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,700
I'm annoyed because Do Do didn't pass the audition.

537
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,510
So, stop talking nonsense and leave. Leave.

538
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,360
Or keep your mouth shut. Seriously.

539
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,830
Gosh, what utter nonsense.

540
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:53,940
Seriously. Gosh, really.

541
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,860
Gosh, my head hurts. I'm going crazy.

542
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:09,120
Do Jun, the pasta is amazing.

543
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,900
- Really? 
 - Yes.

544
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,410
The soup and risotto were good last time, too.

545
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,060
I think you're an amazing cook.

546
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,580
Yes, I'm pretty good.

547
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,320
Teach me how to make this pasta. I want to make it for Oppa.

548
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,620
Okay, I will. It's easy.

549
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:34,150
By the way, when you came to Korea on a break,

550
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:37,620
you said you had a mom, older brother, and older sister, too.

551
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,970
But why are you always here instead of going home on your days off?

552
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,160
Don't you miss your family?

553
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,760
The thing is...

554
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,140
I don't miss my mom and brother.

555
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,340
But I miss my sister.

556
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,920
Visit your sister, then.

557
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,540
I can't.

558
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,070
Why not?

559
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,080
My sister is... in heaven.

560
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,380
I-I'm sorry, Do Jun. My gosh.

561
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:20,310
No, no. It's okay. I believe she's alive somewhere.

562
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,490
So, I'm not sad.

563
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,210
   

564
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,630
What did you all think?

565
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:40,800
I thought Kim Ji Yeong was the perfect fit for the character.

566
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,250
To be honest, I want her to be our supporting actress.

567
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,130
She was my favorite, too. She's subtly charismatic.

568
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,750
I vote for her, too.

569
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:55,570
Her acting was good, but she looked great on screen, too.

570
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,530
What did you think, Director?

571
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,380
I thought she was the best, too.

572
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,940
The only thing is that she doesn't have enough experience.

573
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,270
But I don't think that would be such an issue.

574
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:09,180
Since Cha Bong Soo and Na Bi are the lead actors,

575
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,820
a starting actress would be okay as the supporting actress.

576
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,240
It could be a breath of fresh air, too.

577
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,050
Then, everyone wants Ms. Kim, right?

578
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,680
I'm...

579
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,000
against casting Ms. Kim.

580
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:27,190
This is such an important project, but she has no experience.

581
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,130
I'm against it.

582
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:34,660
President Jang, I haven't had bad luck with actors throughout my career.

583
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,960
I have a good feeling this time, too.

584
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,240
You should try trusting my gut feeling, too.

585
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,440
Yes, I know you're very experienced.

586
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,530
But it's too risky to cast a new actress.

587
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:51,790
And to cast her as the supporting actress purely based on what we saw today?

588
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,330
I don't quite understand it.

589
00:39:54,330 --> 00:40:00,190
President Jang, when we shot "Don't Lie to Me," Ms. Kim played a small role.

590
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:06,110
It was such a short scene, but so many viewers left comments asking who she was.

591
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:11,280
Viewers know better who a good actor is these days.

592
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,280
Ms. Kim has natural talent.

593
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,820
- But still— 
 - And in our drama, "Jang Mi's House,"

594
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,470
two women fight fiercely over a man.

595
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:26,880
Her character makes herself look unattractive and innocent,

596
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,010
approach the female lead, steal her man, and take revenge.

597
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:35,200
She hides her identity and lives a lie.

598
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,350
Just look at Ji Yeong's eyes.

599
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:41,280
Her eyes seem to be full of secrets.

600
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,140
That's why I want to cast Ms. Kim.

601
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,100
The actors' eyes are very important.

602
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:55,380
And her face is very different from our female lead, Na Bi.

603
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,710
She appears pure, but she has a burning desire within.

604
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:05,470
She's a villain who tries to win love by hiding her identity.

605
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,390
Ms. Kim would be perfect for it.

606
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:12,580
I think she can definitely pull it off.

607
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,170
Let's think about it for a few days and regroup—

608
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,960
President Jang,

609
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,280
I need to go to Paris with Director Go to receive the Juniper award in two days.

610
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,910
There's no time.

611
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:28,320
Why did you want to hold the audition today if you were going to drag on like this?

612
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,660
Let's decide now.

613
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,740
Let's take a break and continue.

614
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,780
Director Go, let's talk for a moment.

615
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,350
Director Go, this isn't right.

616
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,830
Pardon?

617
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:01,130
Ms. Kim is the tenant lady who lives in your rental unit.

618
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:03,980
You fought with President Gong because of her, too.

619
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,090
I don't want someone problematic like her to work on our project.

620
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,980
She might hurt our project, too.

621
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,020
President Jang, I told you that was a misunderstanding.

622
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,810
And this is work.

623
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:19,270
Our priority is to find the actor who fits the character.

624
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,810
That's why I'm saying this.

625
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:27,880
You say this is work, but personal feelings could get involved.

626
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,540
I don't like taking a risk like this from the beginning.

627
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,580
I don't know why the writer likes Ms. Kim so much,

628
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:40,350
but I want you to persuade her to choose someone else.

629
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:46,450
President Jang, I think you're the one who's getting personal feelings involved.

630
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:51,260
If I let my feelings dictate things, I wouldn't have agreed to have the audition today.

631
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,600
Was there someone who was better and suited the character more than her today?

632
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,890
It's true that Kim Ji Yeong was the best one.

633
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:03,930
Not casting her because of the personal relationship would actually be unfair.

634
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:10,570
She auditioned today as an actor, not as my girlfriend.

635
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:15,420
And President Jang, I can't change Writer Kim's mind.

636
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,090
Once she gets into something, she needs to pursue it.

637
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,390
She created the character herself.

638
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:24,980
She must know who fits the character the most.

639
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,560
President Jang, please trust our decision.

640
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,570
And you told me that you'd trust me and count on me.

641
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:50,570
You must've worked hard for the audition today.

642
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,750
I'm sorry I can only get you kalguksu that costs 9,000 won.

643
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,780
Once Popcorn Entertainment gets established,

644
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,590
I'll get you a steak at a restaurant.

645
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:04,140
Gosh, why would you say that?

646
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,560
I love kalguksu.

647
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:12,090
And you need to eat hot food like this to feel better on days like this.

648
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,350
Yes, this is Popcorn Entertainment.

649
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:25,410
W-What did you say? Really?

650
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,520
Thank you. Thank you. Yes.

651
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,330
- What did they say? 
 - Ji Yeong, we did it.

652
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:37,560
Ji Yeong, we did it.

653
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,390
You did it!

654
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,930
- Is that true? 
 - Yes.

655
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,680
This isn't a dream, right?

656
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,000
It's not a dream. You really did it.

657
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,840
What?

658
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,950
Our tenant passed the audition for Pil Sung's drama?

659
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,920
Yes. We even signed the contract just now.

660
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,420
Soo Yeon! How could you let that happen? You should've stopped him!

661
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,320
You should've said no!

662
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:13,030
I hate how they see each other at home every day.

663
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:15,080
But they'd be working together all the time now.

664
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,540
I really hate it. I hate it so much!

665
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,470
Seon Yeong, I tried to stop him, too.

666
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:24,190
I talked to Pil Sung privately, too.

667
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:27,550
I tried not to let her audition, too.

668
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:30,350
But everyone said they wanted her.

669
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,460
And the writer kept insisting. I had no choice.

670
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:37,220
This project would've gotten canceled if the writer didn't want to work with us.

671
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:40,750
What are we supposed to do, then?

672
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:45,460
Seon Yeong, you should tell her to quit.

673
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,110
Tell her we won't charge her a fee or anything.

674
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:52,430
The only thing we can do now is to make her quit.

675
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:56,210
Hey, well. Okay.

676
00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:03,100
Hey, so that country bumpkin will be on Pil Sung's drama?

677
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,760
Gosh, what's going on?

678
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,010
This is just getting worse and worse.

679
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,810
Who is it?

680
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,060
- Hello. 
 - Cut the crap.

681
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,500
Do you have any conscience?

682
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,770
How could you audition for a role in Pil Sung's drama?

683
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:32,880
You think we approved you because we didn't say anything?

684
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,400
Mother, please be quiet.

685
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,740
Ms. Kim, can you not be in that drama?

686
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,320
The CEO of the production company is my friend.

687
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,640
I'll talk to her and make sure you don't have to pay a fee.

688
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,160
Please quit now.

689
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,280
I got the role by auditioning.

690
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,410
Ms. Kim! You said you like Pil Sung.

691
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:57,520
You can't be doing this!

692
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,480
Pil Sung is just getting started.

693
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,350
What if people find out he was dating you?

694
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:05,880
They'd say he cast his girlfriend, then.

695
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,360
Think about how that'd make him look.

696
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,860
Do you have any thoughts at all?

697
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,440
Quit immediately!

698
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,800
Seon Yeong, why bother talking so much?

699
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,300
If you want to play the role so much, break up with Pil Sung first.

700
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,920
Instead of getting in his way!

701
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,890
What do you mean by break up?

702
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:29,970
Who's getting in whose way right now?

703
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:33,270
Grandma, what are you talking about?

704
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:35,900
Aigoo, you're out of your mind.

705
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,660
You quit the broadcasting station to become successful,

706
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,380
and how could you cast your girlfriend?

707
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,510
I didn't just cast her on my own.

708
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:48,820
She auditioned fair and square, and everyone agreed to cast her.

709
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,730
She might be dating me, but she's an actor first.

710
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:55,630
Actor, my foot!

711
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:58,590
You'd better keep work and personal life separate.

712
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:04,310
If you hire someone based on personal feelings, you'd get in trouble someday!

713
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:07,750
You're the one who can't keep work and personal life separate!

714
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,520
That's not how I do my job.

715
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,910
Her getting the part had nothing to do with my personal feelings.

716
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:20,340
That's enough. Stop fighting because of me.

717
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,740
How dare you cry right now?

718
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,970
Are you crying because Pil Sung is here?

719
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,560
Are you trying to get him to pity you?

720
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:35,400
- Grandma! 
 - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about everything.

721
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,620
That's enough, Mother.

722
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,260
I'm sorry.

723
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,340
I'm so sorry.

724
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:49,820
I'm sorry, Ji Yeong.

725
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,670
You were treated unfairly because of me.

726
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:56,210
No, I'm sorry.

727
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:58,630
I wasn't thinking clearly.

728
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:01,430
I shouldn't have auditioned.

729
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:05,090
Someone like me can't become an actor.

730
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,770
What are you talking about, Ji Yeong?

731
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:09,920
More than 20 people auditioned today.

732
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,630
You were the best one out of all of those people.

733
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:18,010
Do you know how all the judges praised you today?

734
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,320
So feel confident.

735
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:24,780
I promised I wouldn't let you be treated like this.

736
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,440
I'm sorry this happened again.

737
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,490
I'll persuade my parents and grandma, no matter what.

738
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:35,080
You can solely focus on acting.

739
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:38,530
You said you'd trust me.

740
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,300
I trust you, Director.

741
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:56,000
Baby chick.

742
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,630
How could you say that in this situation?

743
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,750
Baby chick.

744
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,100
Chirp, chirp.

745
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:17,030
I feel nervous going on the business trip without you.

746
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:18,990
Should I not go?

747
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:20,690
Come on.

748
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:25,800
Your family hates me because you say immature things like this.

749
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,180
I was kidding. I was kidding.

750
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:32,330
I'm worried something might happen to you while I'm gone.

751
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,410
You think I'm a child?

752
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:38,740
I'll be doing well while you're gone.

753
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,640
So, don't worry and have a nice trip.

754
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:46,600
I want to see you receive the major award.

755
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,770
It's so cool.

756
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,500
Okay, I'll make sure I win.

757
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:57,140
Right, you're shooting tomorrow morning, right?

758
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:01,390
Yes. I need to go after sleeping only three hours.

759
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:07,270
You need to leave early for your flight, too.

760
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:10,150
I guess you'll leave before me.

761
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,800
See you when I get back.

762
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,210
Let's get going. For our tomorrow.

763
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:36,810
Mom, why did you get up? I said I'd be okay with leaving by myself.

764
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:40,490
I had to see you off. You can't just leave.

765
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,970
You really are the best, Mom.

766
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:47,640
Good luck, then.

767
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,500
Thank you.

768
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,840
By the way, Mom.

769
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:02,030
Don't say anything weird to Ji Yeong while I'm gone.

770
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:03,480
I beg you.

771
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,600
Just go on your business trip.

772
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,620
Don't think about her while you're there.

773
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:12,430
It's such a glorious moment in your life.

774
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,050
Okay. I'll be back.

775
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,180
Have a nice trip.

776
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,580
Can't believe we're shooting at four in the morning.

777
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,500
You didn't get any sleep, did you?

778
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,520
I'm okay. I'm totally fine.

779
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,300
- I'll say hello really quickly. 
 - Okay.

780
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,760
Hello.

781
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:51,310
Hello.

782
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,790
Hello, Director.

783
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:56,680
You came, Ji Yeong.

784
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,200
What?

785
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,420
Didn't he come home last night?

786
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:11,080
I begged him so much, but he hasn't learned his lesson yet?

787
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,520
He's definitely with that bitch.

788
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,850
That country bumpkin. I won't forgive her.

789
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:26,050
Hey! Open the door! Open the door, I said!

790
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:29,840
Open the door right now! Hey!

791
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,710
Gosh, look at this. She's not home, either.

792
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:37,060
I wasn't sure, but they're definitely together.

793
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:40,220
Gosh, how will I kill her?

794
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:43,380
Ae Gyo, what's going on this time?

795
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,220
Why are you being so loud so early?

796
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:49,220
Seon Yeong, Jin Dan didn't come home last night.

797
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,330
I thought he might be with her.

798
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:53,290
So, I came as soon as the sun came up.

799
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:55,340
And lo and behold, she isn't home, either.

800
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:58,600
- They must be together right now. 
 - What?

801
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,650
Seon Yeong, you saw Tae Hee that day, right?

802
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:04,040
Jin Dan's fiancee.

803
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,490
She's so classy and elegant.

804
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:09,040
But because of this bitch...

805
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:15,230
Because of this gold digger, Jin Dan's engagement is about to be broken.

806
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:18,450
Broken? Are you serious?

807
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:21,090
I swear I won't forgive this bitch.

808
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,140
I have nothing to lose anymore.

809
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,020
The tenant lady is coming home now.

810
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:32,350
Tenant Lady. Did you not come home last night?

811
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:35,690
Who were you with just now? Who were you with?

812
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:39,310
Hey, hey! Use words.

813
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,680
What's going on so early in the morning?

814
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,010
"What's going on?" You bitch.

815
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:46,690
You were with Jin Dan until now, right?

816
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:49,270
Jin Dan's engagement is about to be broken.

817
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:51,950
How dare you shamelessly ask what's going on?

818
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:53,820
You bitch!

819
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:56,860
Seriously!

820
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,750
Excuse me, Lady!

821
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:01,860
I said I have nothing to do with President Gong!

822
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,030
Why are you doing this again?

823
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:06,720
I had a shoot at dawn.

824
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,990
What are you accusing me of?

825
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:11,430
Shoot, my foot.

826
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:14,240
Hey, let me warn you one more time.

827
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,750
Try showing up in front of my son again.

828
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:19,750
I'll kill you then, okay?

829
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:23,480
Seon Yeong, kick this bitch out immediately.

830
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:33,840
If everything your friend said is true,

831
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,670
we should be doing something, too.

832
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:42,430
I'm afraid our neighbors might find out.

833
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:44,520
Gosh, how awful!

834
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:49,980
Mom, Ji Yeong had a shoot. And she said it's not true.

835
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,820
I also think Ae Gyo was wrong this time.

836
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,130
Our tenant is seeing Pil Sung.

837
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:59,450
Come on, Honey. That can't be true.

838
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:02,720
Aigoo, aigoo! Whether it's true or not,

839
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,540
we're getting sucked into it right now!

840
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,390
Seon Yeong,

841
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:15,890
we should kick out the tenant lady before Pil Sung comes back.

842
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:25,000
Yes, I never liked you that much.

843
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,610
But they say no parent can overcome their child.

844
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:32,540
Pil Sung likes you so much. What else can we do?

845
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:37,570
So, I tried to give it some time.

846
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,150
Because I might end up liking you, too.

847
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:45,000
But this isn't right.

848
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,600
How could you drag Pil Sung into something so shameful?

849
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:55,110
Ma'am, it's not true. I'm really innocent.

850
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:59,550
Ms. Kim, I don't believe everything President Gong's mom said.

851
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:02,780
But she happens to be my friend.

852
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:05,590
And President Gong's sister-in-law...

853
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:11,650
So, Pil Sung's boss, Soo Yeon, is also my friend.

854
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:16,660
All sorts of things about you and President Gong while you're dating Pil Sung...

855
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:21,980
I don't even want to think about such a situation. It makes me so angry.

856
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:27,560
You keep saying you're innocent, but it takes two to tango.

857
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,990
This can't be happening unless you are involved.

858
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:36,700
Since you did something to confuse him. That's why this is happening.

859
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:41,400
I know Pil Sung likes you, but this isn't right.

860
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,480
None of us thought of you that way,

861
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,610
but you're being way too shameless right now!

862
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:58,970
Ms. Kim, if you truly like Pil Sung, even for a bit,

863
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:02,140
could you please leave him now?

864
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:06,880
Yes, move out of this house, too. That's the least you could do.

865
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,620
And you'd better not say we kicked you out and say we were power-tripping,

866
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,940
and say, "Go Pil Sung's parents did this and that."

867
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,110
You'd better not say stuff like that on the internet.

868
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:23,830
I don't want to think you're that awful. Okay?

869
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:29,340
Find a place to move to immediately. We'll pay for your move.

870
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:35,370
Okay, Grandma.

871
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:39,260
I'll move out, Landlady.

872
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:42,210
Yes, I'll move out.

873
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:44,780
Don't worry.

874
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:03,080
Hello, I'm looking for an apartment.

875
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:14,240
Do Do is failing every single audition.

876
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,600
Seriously, why is life so hard?

877
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:26,220
The money from President Gong...

878
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:30,730
is almost gone, too. I have barely any left. 
    

879
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:33,390
Seriously.

880
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,200
 I can't work with you anymore. 

881
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,240
 You don't have to pay me since I owe you the contract cancelation fee. 

882
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:50,770
 If you demand the cancelation fee, talk to my dad since he's a lawyer. 

883
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:55,990
Wow, what kind of scoundrel is she? Do Do, you little...

884
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,870
Fine, just leave.

885
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:05,050
I don't want to stop you from leaving me, either.

886
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:08,570
What should I do now?

887
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:11,360
Gosh, what am I supposed to do now?

888
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,450
Gosh, is she out of her mind?

889
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:16,150
You want money?

890
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:18,200
Another 50 million?

891
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,640
Seriously.

892
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:24,210
How could you be this shameless?

893
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:28,230
CEO Gong, I'm not just demanding it.

894
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:30,360
I'm asking for a loan.

895
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,450
I know it's really shameless,

896
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:37,270
but the 50 million you gave me last time isn't enough to support an actor.

897
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:41,430
All I did was jump through hoops since I didn't have enough money.

898
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:45,480
I promise I'll pay you back. I'll pay in full, including the interest.

899
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,930
We agreed not to see each other again.

900
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:50,600
You should keep your promise.

901
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,340
Get out. I don't want to see you.

902
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:55,520
CEO Gong, if you help me this once,

903
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,840
my Do Ra would be so grateful to you in heaven.

904
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,040
Ahjumma!

905
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,070
Stop using the late Do Ra.

906
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:06,720
How dare you still bring her up?

907
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:13,360
You almost became my son-in-law if things worked out between you and Do Ra.

908
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:17,310
How could you be so mean to me?

909
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:21,290
Secretary Jo, get this crazy woman out of here.

910
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:22,530
- Right now! 
 - Yes.

911
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,540
CEO Gong, please...

912
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,920
Fine, I'll leave!

913
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,460
- CEO Gong... Let go! Let go of me! 
 - Let's go.

914
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,160
Geez.

915
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:48,420
Aigoo, what a pitiful fate you have...

916
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:54,180
How colorful. Very colorful.

917
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:57,780
Aigoo, how did you know?

918
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:01,710
Would I be able to get back on my feet?

919
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:05,410
I used to own a building in Gangnam...

920
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:08,630
and I had a good life everyone would be envious of.

921
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:12,900
But I'm hopeless since my daughter died.

922
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,520
One of my sons is working a pitiful part-time job

923
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,290
and I don't even know where the other son is.

924
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:23,000
My new business isn't working out at all.

925
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:29,120
I want to join my late daughter at this rate.

926
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,910
What are you talking about, Ahjumma?

927
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:36,160
Losing a child isn't a part of your fate.

928
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,690
Pardon?

929
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:40,000
My daughter died two years ago.

930
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,160
She's not dead.

931
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:46,380
Here. She's this close to you. What do you mean, she's dead?

932
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:50,950
What did you say? She's close to me?

933
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:54,520
That scam artist.

934
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,170
She would've come to see me if she were alive.

935
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:00,700
I wasted the precious 100,000 won for no reason.

936
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:03,890
Yes, I need to hang onto Do Do.

937
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:06,840
She'll come back once she gets a role.

938
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,550
I'll lie down in the station director's office.

939
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:13,010
I'll say bite my tongue and die there if he doesn't cast her.

940
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:17,430
They can't treat me like this. Seriously.

941
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,780
   

942
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,070
Do Ra... Do Ra!

943
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,380
Do Ra.

944
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:52,360
Do Ra! Do Ra! Do Ra!

945
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,510
- Do Ra. 
 - Geez.

946
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:57,840
You scared me. What are you doing?

947
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,810
You were definitely Do Ra.

948
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:02,570
You were definitely my daughter, Do Ra.

949
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,680
You reek of alcohol.

950
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:08,380
Lady, you must be very drunk.

951
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:11,590
Why did you drink so much during the day?

952
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:19,050
Yes, I must be drunk. I thought the country bumpkin was Do Ra.

953
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:27,840
 Whenever I see that tenant lady, I think of Do Ra for some reason. 

954
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,170
 I keep thinking she's Do Ra somehow. 

955
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:33,190
 What are you talking about, Ahjumma? 

956
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:36,250
 Losing a child isn't a part of your fate. 

957
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:39,820
 Pardon? My daughter died two years ago. 

958
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:41,960
 She's not dead. 

959
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:46,340
 Here. She's this close to you. What do you mean, she's dead? 

960
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:54,740
Where did she go?

961
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:08,060


962
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,250
Oh, my gosh! My gosh!

963
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:18,060
Gosh, what are you doing?

964
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:21,180
Let me see!

965
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,810
What are you doing?

966
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:27,720
What are you doing right now?

967
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,170
You're Do Ra.

968
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:34,620
You really are Do Ra.

969
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:37,760
What did you say?

970
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,880
   

971
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,910
♫  And tell you  ♫

972
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:53,220
♫  I shout out your name  ♫

973
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:55,510
♫  My love  ♫

974
01:05:55,510 --> 01:06:00,660
♫  My last tears you won't get to see  ♫

975
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:06,030
♫  I'll hold you tightly and let you go  ♫

976
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:11,460
♫  I call for you again  ♫

977
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,750
♫  My love  ♫

978
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:17,470
♫  I say, "I love you," but you can't  ♫

979
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:21,160
 You're fighting over someone ridiculous. I don't ever want to see you again. 

980
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,150
 Why do you have to like someone like her? 

981
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:25,870
 Is there a reason why you can't help it? 

982
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:29,050
 Ji Yeong resembles Do Ra. 

983
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:32,040
 No, she can't be Do Ra. Just look at her. 

984
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,390
 Yes, Do Ra used to be allergic to walnuts. 

985
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:36,920
 But if the country bumpkin is allergic to walnuts... 

986
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,780
 By the way, are walnuts in this? 

987
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:41,200
 I'm sorry. I need to hurry home. 

988
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,650
 Why can't I reach Ji Yeong? 

989
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:45,780
 She didn't reply to my text since yesterday. Is something going on? 

990
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:49,420
 Why is this empty? Did Ji Yeong move out?
