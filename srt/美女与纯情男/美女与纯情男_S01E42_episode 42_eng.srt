1
00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:49,796
   

2
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:53,816
You got all of your memory back, right?

3
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:56,100
You're Park Do Ra now, right?

4
00:00:56,626 --> 00:00:59,426
You got your memory back when we shot at the villa, right?

5
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,866
Why didn't you tell me?

6
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:04,476
You should've told me first when you got your memory back.

7
00:01:04,476 --> 00:01:06,246
Why didn't you tell me? Why?

8
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:09,406
It was because I felt bad for you.

9
00:01:11,476 --> 00:01:13,356
Because I felt bad.

10
00:01:15,316 --> 00:01:16,786
What?

11
00:01:17,946 --> 00:01:20,836
Since I got my memory back,

12
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:24,626
I only remembered how I mistreated you.

13
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,366
I betrayed you, hurt you,

14
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:31,116
and broke your heart.

15
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:36,126
But instead of blaming me after I did that,

16
00:01:36,126 --> 00:01:38,966
you continued to love me.

17
00:01:39,856 --> 00:01:43,490
I felt so bad and shameful.

18
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:47,326
That's why I couldn't tell you.

19
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:54,776
I'm the one who did the wrong thing.

20
00:01:55,826 --> 00:01:58,220
I'm the one who should feel bad.

21
00:01:58,706 --> 00:02:01,476
I'm the one who let go of your hand, Do Ra.

22
00:02:01,476 --> 00:02:03,856
Why should you feel bad, then?

23
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:06,686
Are you a fool, Oppa?

24
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:11,186
You didn't let go of my hand.

25
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:14,206
I let go of your hand first.

26
00:02:14,206 --> 00:02:16,346
You know that, too.

27
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:18,916
That I abandoned you...

28
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:23,586
and I put a dagger in your heart.

29
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:26,456
You know what I chose after that.

30
00:02:28,676 --> 00:02:32,986
♫  I shouldn't have given you my heart at all  ♫

31
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,056
I'm okay.

32
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:41,096
You came back alive like this. So it's all okay.

33
00:02:42,486 --> 00:02:44,796
And I'm even more sorry.

34
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:46,320
I'm sorrier.

35
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:54,040


36
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,026
Don't do this, Oppa.

37
00:02:57,966 --> 00:03:02,136
If you do this, you'd be in danger, too.

38
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:05,986
What if people found out I'm Park Do Ra?

39
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,276
What would happen?

40
00:03:09,226 --> 00:03:13,916
That's why I didn't tell you that I got my memory back.

41
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:20,356
You'd suffer if you stayed by my side.

42
00:03:21,256 --> 00:03:24,240
I don't want to do that to you.

43
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:26,736
So, Oppa,

44
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:29,506
let's just...

45
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:35,156
go separate ways.

46
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:39,816
I'm saying I'm okay. I am.

47
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:41,636
Oppa,

48
00:03:43,176 --> 00:03:45,316
look at me.

49
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:48,336
Take a good look at me.

50
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,596
I'm not Park Do Ra.

51
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:54,326
I'm Kim Ji Yeong.

52
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:58,586
Park Do Ra died then.

53
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:02,346
And we broke up then, too.

54
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:07,396
What?

55
00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:11,866
So, Oppa,

56
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:17,576
please keep treating me as Kim Ji Yeong, not Park Do Ra.

57
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:21,886
I beg you.

58
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:39,276
You son of a bitch!

59
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:41,766
No, Jin Dan! No!

60
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:46,356
You're not supposed to hurt him. You can't do that!

61
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,426
I'm not supposed to hurt him?

62
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,836
Who is he, exactly?

63
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,866
Who is he?

64
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,636
He'll be marrying me. He'll be marrying me.

65
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:04,736
He'll be your stepfather, then. Stepfather.

66
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:07,346
That's why you can't, Jin Dan.

67
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:11,246
Mom, what did you just say?

68
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:13,046
Marry?

69
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,566
Are you crazy? Are you insane?

70
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:20,716
You'll marry this lowly scammer who takes money from women?

71
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:23,346
Are you out of your mind, Mom?

72
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:29,616
Excuse me, but... I'm not a scammer like that.

73
00:05:31,476 --> 00:05:34,326
Hey, why would you take money from her if you aren't?

74
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:36,746
Come back here! Hey, how dare you run away?

75
00:05:36,746 --> 00:05:38,496
Don't, Jin Dan!

76
00:05:38,496 --> 00:05:39,886
Jin Dan...

77
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:42,436
Mom, are you out of your mind?

78
00:05:42,436 --> 00:05:44,316
How could you be this crazy?

79
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:47,196
You always tell me to marry a woman from a good family.

80
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:49,286
Why are you dating that scammer bastard, then?

81
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:52,006
He's not a scammer, I said.

82
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:57,056
T-To be honest, he's my first love.

83
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:00,406
What? First love?

84
00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:08,176
Don't you know what situation I'm in right now?

85
00:06:08,176 --> 00:06:10,456
Hyung and Aunt are looking down on me already.

86
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:12,396
What if they find out about this?

87
00:06:12,396 --> 00:06:15,516
How would that make me look?

88
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:20,126
Well, anyway,

89
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:23,226
Mom, you'd better not see him ever again.

90
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:25,016
Let me be clear.

91
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:29,770
If you see him one more time, I'll beat him up to a pulp.

92
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,460
Got it?

93
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:35,246
Has she gone blind or something?

94
00:06:37,126 --> 00:06:41,026
I know he's upset, but how could he say he'd beat up his dad?

95
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,916
What a bastard.

96
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:46,136
But what am I supposed to do now?

97
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:48,186
Wait...

98
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:51,616
What's wrong with Jin Dan?

99
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:53,466
What's going on?

100
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:56,206
Did he cause trouble with a woman again?

101
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:58,276
No.

102
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:03,976
Aunt, you think that's what Jin Dan does?

103
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:06,816
People can make mistakes in life.

104
00:07:06,816 --> 00:07:09,196
Humans are weak by nature.

105
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,596
That leads to making mistakes sometimes.

106
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:13,556
Family is supposed to show support at times like that.

107
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:18,058
But you always try to eat him alive. How could Jin Dan have any confidence?

108
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:19,806
What's wrong with you?

109
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,106
What did I do?

110
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,220
I think I'll definitely win if I play today.

111
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,120
Life is all about taking a shot at it.

112
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,930
I can do it as long as I have some money.

113
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,880
 Yes, it's just today. Just once. 

114
00:08:32,118 --> 00:08:37,358
 I swear I saw that old lady putting them somewhere here. 

115
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:51,939
 That man was a reenactment actor named Hwang Jeong Shik. 

116
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:54,519
 But he said he was hired to do it, too. 

117
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:57,749
 Do Ra was framed. 

118
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:01,179
 She would've never done such a thing. 

119
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:04,209
 I believe Do Ra. 

120
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:11,309
Yes.

121
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:15,619
I'll clear my name from the dirty accusation.

122
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:18,909
Even if I live as Kim Ji Yeong,

123
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:23,129
I'll clear Park Do Ra's name from that dirty accusation.

124
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:44,389
You look terrible. Are you sick?

125
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:45,909
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

126
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:48,919
You got even shabbier overnight.

127
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,649
You can't get married at this rate.

128
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:55,269
I can't live because I'm worried about you.

129
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:58,059
J-Ji Yeong, are you leaving now?

130
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:00,289
I'll go now.

131
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:03,179
- Okay. 
 - Gosh, my head...

132
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:05,509
Who's that?

133
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:09,039
Who is it?

134
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:16,209
President Gong Jin Dan sent this.

135
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:27,119
My gosh, he sent a designer purse.

136
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,139
Flowers, too? My gosh.

137
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:31,919
Yes, President Gong is so sweet.

138
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,729
Look, there's a card, too.

139
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:35,519
Read it. Read it. Read it.

140
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,229
Gosh, look at this. My goodness...

141
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:42,419
Let's see. Let's see.

142
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:44,729
   

143
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:47,909
 I hope your show, "Seoul Lady," becomes a hit. 

144
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:53,069
 Forever your man, Gong Jin Dan. 

145
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:07,539
By the way, she must've received the purse. Why won't she say anything?

146
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:14,249
She won't just accept the purse and ignore me, right?

147
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:17,919
Even if she gives it back, she should still see me.

148
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:27,939
President Gong, we got a delivery.

149
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:29,759
Ms. Kim Ji Yeong sent these.

150
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,119
- What? 
 - There's a card inside, too.

151
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:48,569
 President Gong, don't send me stuff like this anymore. 

152
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:51,469
 I have no reason to receive gifts like this from you. 

153
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:54,489
 I won't accept them even if you send them. 

154
00:12:54,489 --> 00:12:57,319
She sent these back without keeping them?

155
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:04,459
Damn it!

156
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,909
Kim Ji Yeong, that girl...

157
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:14,899
Is she really breaking up with me?

158
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,439
Seriously.

159
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:20,889
Who says she can?

160
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:26,589
   

161
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:33,819
What's the name of the actor again?

162
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:35,399
Hwang Jeong Shik.

163
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,689
- Hwang Jeong Shik? 
 - Yes.

164
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:42,679
Hwang Jeong Shik.

165
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:48,419
Here you go.

166
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:51,089
Here. Have a look.

167
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:53,589
   

168
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,009
 - Do Ra. 
 - Gosh. 

169
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,219
 Let go of me! 

170
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:09,909
Excuse me, are you okay?

171
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:13,139
Yes.

172
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,899
Yes, I'm okay.

173
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:21,319
B-By chance, has he been in anything recently?

174
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,999
The resume only mentions old projects.

175
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,539
We update information once a year.

176
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:31,389
Looks like he isn't working anymore since it hasn't been updated.

177
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:35,429
Why are you looking for this actor?

178
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:41,249
It's just a personal matter.

179
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:45,199
You don't mind if I took a photo of the resume, right?

180
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,289
No, of course not.

181
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:57,409
Thank you. Have a nice day.

182
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:00,239
   

183
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,839
Is the chairman inside? We're having lunch together today.

184
00:15:07,979 --> 00:15:10,359
He stepped out for a second, but he'll be back soon.

185
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,249
Okay.

186
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:18,129
The woman who just left looked like Kim Ji Yeong.

187
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:22,199
She must be busy with the shoot. What brought her here?

188
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:27,559
   

189
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,659
 The number you dialed does not exist. 

190
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:38,299
 Please check and dial again. 

191
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:41,439
 The number you have dialed is not in service. 

192
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:43,899
 Please check the number and... 

193
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,659
How did you get my number?

194
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:05,519
Did Ae Gyo tell you?

195
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,829
What? "Ae Gyo"?

196
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:12,679
How dare you call my mom's name like that?

197
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:18,209
If you mention her name one more time, I won't forgive you then.

198
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,619
Mr. Jin Sang Gu,

199
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:28,149
how much would it take for you to get lost?

200
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:34,329
What are you talking about? "How much?"

201
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:37,279
I already did a background check on you.

202
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,489
Your business in the Philippines failed miserably,

203
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:44,759
so you've been scamming people and ran away to Korea.

204
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,189
That's why you approached my mom, right?

205
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:50,809
You seduced my innocent mom using the fact you're her first love.

206
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:53,669
So, how much do you need?

207
00:16:53,669 --> 00:16:57,139
I'll pay you. How much do you need?

208
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:59,149
No, I'm not dating your mom for money.

209
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:00,999
I don't need money.

210
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:03,679
I swear I'm not, Jin Dan.

211
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,899
What? "Jin Dan"?

212
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:09,019
"Jin Dan"?

213
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:12,309
How dare you talk casually to me, you son of a bitch?

214
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:15,009
Why did you have to meet Jin Dan?

215
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:17,949
He's out of his mind right now.

216
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:22,839
He called me first and asked to meet. That's why I met him.

217
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,769
I thought he wanted to apologize for last time.

218
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:30,099
But he asked me how much money I needed. That he'd pay me so I'll leave you.

219
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:32,969
He said he won't sit back if I didn't.

220
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:36,819
He cursed at me, calling me a son of a bitch.

221
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:39,929
I was called that by my son.

222
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:43,639
I really want to die, Ae Gyo.

223
00:17:43,639 --> 00:17:46,729
Did Jin Dan really say that?

224
00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:48,529
Yes.

225
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:54,449
Ae Gyo, can we just tell him the truth? That I'm his dad?

226
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:58,059
Sang Gu, are you crazy? Are you insane?

227
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:03,469
If he finds out later that I'm his father, he'll feel so sad and hurt.

228
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:05,049
We still can't.

229
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:09,399
If he finds out you're his dad, he'd die from shock.

230
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:11,579
Do you want something bad to happen to him?

231
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:13,409
No, that can't happen.

232
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:14,939
My son needs to be happy.

233
00:18:14,939 --> 00:18:20,779
Sang Gu, just pretend he's not your son.

234
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:23,160
I mean, don't just think that.

235
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,149
He's not your son.

236
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:29,909
Jin Dan is Chairman Gong's son, okay?

237
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,929
Okay, don't worry.

238
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:38,219
I don't say anything even though my son called me a son of a bitch.

239
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:42,359
I'm sorry, Sang Gu.

240
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,469
Gosh.

241
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:47,249
Excuse me.

242
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:54,229
What?

243
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:58,809
It's our tenant, Hyeon Cheol's hoobae, and President Gong's mom.

244
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:02,259
Why are they facing each other like that?

245
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:10,349
What's their relationship? Why are they crying together like that?

246
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,799
Gosh.

247
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,479
My gosh.

248
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,379
Seon Yeong. Hey, Seon Yeong. Seon Yeong.

249
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:25,719
- Hey. 
 - What is it, Mother?

250
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:27,459
- Is something going on? 
 - Hey, hey.

251
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:31,629
I was just at the hospital because of joint pain and...

252
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:35,379
I saw Sang Gu, our tenant, Hyeon Cheol's hoobae,

253
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:38,059
with your friend, President Gong's mom.

254
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:40,629
The two of them were crying at a cafe.

255
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:44,459
They were crying, looking at each other so longingly.

256
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:46,099
Mom, really?

257
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:48,579
Yes, I'm telling you.

258
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:51,729
It can't be. You must be mistaken.

259
00:19:51,729 --> 00:19:54,029
Why would Ae Gyo be with that man?

260
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:55,949
Come on, I'm telling the truth.

261
00:19:55,949 --> 00:19:58,759
I saw them with my own eyes just now.

262
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:01,089
Are you sure it was President Gong's mom?

263
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:03,739
Aigoo! It was her, I'm telling you.

264
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:07,049
They were staring at each other longingly at the cafe nearby.

265
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:11,469
They were crying, looking at each other like this.

266
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:16,369
By the way, Sang Gu said he met his first love.

267
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:19,499
Could that be President Gong's mom?

268
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:21,519
Gosh, no way.

269
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,289
Wow, I'm really curious.

270
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:28,459
If that were true, that's a refreshing combination.

271
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:36,949
Ma Ri, stop being angry. I'll explain everything.

272
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:39,829
Okay, go ahead and explain.

273
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:43,619
I've told you once before.

274
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:46,169
That I want to cut ties with my mom.

275
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:50,179
That's why I didn't want to tell her you were my girlfriend.

276
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:54,119
I didn't want her to be interested in us.

277
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:58,749
Do Jun, is that true?

278
00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:01,509
But how could you not want to see your mom?

279
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:04,029
You can't be like that.

280
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:09,499
Ma Ri, you have a good mom,

281
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:11,469
but not all the moms are good.

282
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:12,889
But still, she's your mom.

283
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:15,739
You should like her because she's your mom.

284
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:18,119
You hate some people, too, right?

285
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:23,359
How would you feel if I said you can't hate them?

286
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,759
I don't think I'd like it.

287
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:26,849
I feel the same way.

288
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:29,619
I can't like her just because she's my mom.

289
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:33,769
Okay.

290
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,249
I hear you.

291
00:21:36,949 --> 00:21:43,349
I don't understand you 100%, but maybe a little bit.

292
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:45,889
Thank you for understanding.

293
00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:51,079
Are you no longer angry, then?

294
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:55,509
Yes. I know why you did that now.

295
00:21:55,509 --> 00:21:57,559
I should stop being angry.

296
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:00,359
Should I make you roe pasta since you're no longer angry?

297
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,029
I know you love it.

298
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,339
Yes, sounds good.

299
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:05,139
Wait just a moment.

300
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:18,389
 How could he not get along with his mom? 

301
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:22,769
 It must be so sad not getting along with your mom. 

302
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:24,889
 This is no good. I should let them make up. 

303
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:27,839
 I'm sure that'd make Do Jun happy. 

304
00:22:35,384 --> 00:22:39,354
You're Do Jun's girlfriend?

305
00:22:39,354 --> 00:22:43,404
Yes, I'm Gong Ma Ri.

306
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:47,551
- How old are you? 
 - I'm 28 years old.

307
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:49,511
28 years old?

308
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:52,661
You're older than Do Jun.

309
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:54,391
Are you really 28?

310
00:22:54,391 --> 00:22:55,991
You look very young.

311
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:58,851
My mental age is 12.

312
00:22:58,851 --> 00:23:02,051
That's why people think I look younger.

313
00:23:03,121 --> 00:23:05,720
You're mentally 12?

314
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,420
What does that mean?

315
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,691
I was in a serious car accident when I was a kid.

316
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,031
That's why. But don't worry.

317
00:23:15,031 --> 00:23:16,881
I still know everything I need to know.

318
00:23:16,881 --> 00:23:20,281
And Do Jun said he doesn't mind the way I am.

319
00:23:21,411 --> 00:23:24,401
What is she saying right now?

320
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:29,321
By the way, I heard you and Do Jun don't get along.

321
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:34,311
I want to be like a bridge that connects you two.

322
00:23:34,311 --> 00:23:38,421
That's why I wanted to see you. To figure out a solution with you.

323
00:23:39,561 --> 00:23:42,951
Wow, I can't believe this. I'm speechless.

324
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:45,521
Hey, you can't date my Do Jun.

325
00:23:45,521 --> 00:23:48,131
You aren't a good match for him.

326
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,521
Why?

327
00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:54,391
Do Jun and I like each other.

328
00:23:55,881 --> 00:24:00,411
Although he had to come back in the middle,

329
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:02,751
he even studied in the US.

330
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:06,171
He'll become a world-renowned architect.

331
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:11,071
But it wouldn't be good if someone like you were by his side.

332
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:16,671
If you care about his future, you can't be dating him.

333
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:20,101
Do you understand what I'm saying?

334
00:24:20,101 --> 00:24:25,741
Ahjumma, of course, I'm not good enough, but Do Jun said he likes the way I am.

335
00:24:25,741 --> 00:24:28,821
He said he'd protect me for the rest of his life.

336
00:24:29,391 --> 00:24:32,151
Why would he protect you? What are you?

337
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:36,011
I know you're slow, but how could you be so shameless?

338
00:24:36,011 --> 00:24:38,331
I am not shameless.

339
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:39,921
What?

340
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:43,551
Fine. You say you're not shameless.

341
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:48,551
If you really are, don't get in the way of Do Jun's future.

342
00:24:48,551 --> 00:24:52,671
You have to break up with him, okay?

343
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,971
Ma Ri. Why are you crying?

344
00:25:08,971 --> 00:25:11,891
Where did you go without letting me know?

345
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:14,220
Do Jun,

346
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,660
your mom told me not to get in your way.

347
00:25:18,661 --> 00:25:22,021
She told me to break up because we weren't a good match.

348
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,651
What?

349
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:25,861
Did you meet my mom?

350
00:25:25,861 --> 00:25:27,931
Why did you do that?

351
00:25:27,931 --> 00:25:32,301
Because you didn't seem to get along with your mom,

352
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:35,381
I met with her so you two can make up.

353
00:25:35,381 --> 00:25:39,641
She said it's shameless for someone like me to date you.

354
00:25:39,641 --> 00:25:42,081
And she said I should break up.

355
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:54,521
Ma Ri, why should we break up?

356
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:57,160
I said I'll be by your side forever.

357
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,380
Really?

358
00:25:58,381 --> 00:26:02,291
Will you do that even though your mom hates me?

359
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:05,751
Yes. I'll do that because I want to.

360
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:08,021
So, don't cry.

361
00:26:08,021 --> 00:26:10,231
Do Jun.

362
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:13,941
It's okay.

363
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:15,741
Don't cry.

364
00:26:18,881 --> 00:26:21,141
Ms. Kim went to the Actors' Association?

365
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:24,661
Yes, I had lunch with the chairman today.

366
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:28,061
I noticed Ms. Kim at the office.

367
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:31,891
Why was she there...

368
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:35,801
I asked an employee there because I found it strange, too.

369
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:39,761
You remember the reenactment actor, right?

370
00:26:39,761 --> 00:26:43,181
The one who paid to have sex with Park Do Ra.

371
00:26:43,181 --> 00:26:45,111
Was it Hwang Jeong Shik?

372
00:26:45,111 --> 00:26:48,741
She apparently came to inquire about him.

373
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,511
Really?

374
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:56,361
By the way, why would she look into that man?

375
00:26:56,361 --> 00:26:58,581
It's not like she'd cast him or anything.

376
00:26:58,581 --> 00:27:01,541
Does she know him personally?

377
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:04,120
I'm not sure.

378
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,850
She must have a reason.

379
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,491
I suppose.

380
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:12,921
But you haven't heard about Hwang Jeong Shik since then, right?

381
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:16,331
No, I haven't found him yet.

382
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:19,571
I think he changed his name in the Philippines.

383
00:27:20,211 --> 00:27:22,700
Yes. He ran away on purpose.

384
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,820
How could we find him?

385
00:27:26,991 --> 00:27:29,621
I just feel sorry for the late Park Do Ra.

386
00:27:29,621 --> 00:27:31,561
She was framed for something so shameful.

387
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:34,191
Who could alleviate her pain?

388
00:27:41,241 --> 00:27:43,061
Hey, over here.

389
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:52,471
Director, what did you find out about Hwang Jeong Shik?

390
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:57,361
I heard you inquired about him at the Actors' Association today.

391
00:27:57,941 --> 00:28:00,951
How do you know that?

392
00:28:01,851 --> 00:28:04,111
Don't you know how small this field is?

393
00:28:04,111 --> 00:28:09,361
What if people find out you're Park Do Ra while you're looking him up?

394
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:13,361
You might get in trouble even before you clear your name.

395
00:28:13,361 --> 00:28:15,921
What else can I do?

396
00:28:15,921 --> 00:28:19,581
I need to do everything I can.

397
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:22,371
I'm looking into it. I'll help you.

398
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:24,361
So, don't do anything.

399
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:26,781
It's my business.

400
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:28,431
I'll do it.

401
00:28:28,431 --> 00:28:31,751
A reporter friend of mine is looking into it, too.

402
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,921
Just trust me and wait.

403
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:38,621
I'm worried people will find out you're Park Do Ra by you stepping forward.

404
00:28:38,621 --> 00:28:43,461
They might think you faked your death, fooled people, and became Kim Ji Yeong.

405
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:45,851
They might mistake and criticize you.

406
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:49,171
So, until you clear your name after we find Hwang Jeong Shik,

407
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:52,141
you can't let people find out you're Park Do Ra.

408
00:28:55,721 --> 00:28:57,741
Okay, Oppa.

409
00:28:57,741 --> 00:29:00,451
I understand what you mean.

410
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:09,151
I'll go if you're finished talking.

411
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:16,861
Y-You'll just leave after meeting up with me?

412
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:20,761
What else am I supposed to do, then?

413
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:24,231
I'll see you on set, Director.

414
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:31,091
Gosh, my surgical wound suddenly...

415
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:35,311
What's this now?

416
00:29:35,931 --> 00:29:38,131
You think the stitches burst again?

417
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:39,721
Huh?

418
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:41,461
Yes.

419
00:29:42,361 --> 00:29:44,631
Could you hold me?

420
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:49,351
Oppa, I know you're lying.

421
00:29:49,351 --> 00:29:51,301
I know you got the stitches removed, too.

422
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:56,811
I saw you running around with the film crew after lunch, too.

423
00:30:00,651 --> 00:30:04,281
Yes. I was lying.

424
00:30:04,281 --> 00:30:06,921
But why do you think I'm doing this?

425
00:30:07,831 --> 00:30:10,501
Once you got your memory back,

426
00:30:10,501 --> 00:30:14,901
I had many things I wanted to do and many places I wanted to visit with you.

427
00:30:14,901 --> 00:30:18,281
But you're treating me so coldly.

428
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:21,101
That's why I pretended to be in pain.

429
00:30:27,601 --> 00:30:29,721
Fine.

430
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:32,861
Since we're already here,

431
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:37,631
tell me one thing you want to do.

432
00:30:38,691 --> 00:30:40,731
Just one thing.

433
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:45,271
- Let's go. 
 - Gosh! Why are you holding my hand?

434
00:30:46,321 --> 00:30:49,301
   

435
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:58,701
Is this the place you wanted to come with me?

436
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:01,281
Yes.

437
00:31:01,281 --> 00:31:07,261
Because since we were kids, ever since I was Dae Choong, we've built memories here.

438
00:31:07,261 --> 00:31:12,321
Do you remember I brought you here to get your memory back when you were Ji Yeong?

439
00:31:13,561 --> 00:31:14,991
Yeah.

440
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:21,821
So, you remember when you were Do Ra and Ji Yeong, right?

441
00:31:30,231 --> 00:31:32,301
 I'm saying all this for your future. 

442
00:31:32,301 --> 00:31:35,751
 Study hard and come home early from now on. 

443
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:37,581
 Okay? 

444
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:40,891
 Okay, I said. 

445
00:31:40,891 --> 00:31:44,841
 So, just stuff yourself with this tteokbokki. 

446
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:48,431
 I haven't been to this neighborhood in 15 years since then. 

447
00:31:48,431 --> 00:31:50,261
 Looks like nothing has changed at all. 

448
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:53,001
 The grocery in the alley and the laundromat haven't changed. 

449
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:55,481
 This tteokbokki shop hasn't changed, either. 

450
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:58,321
 It reminded me of the old days a lot. 

451
00:32:07,651 --> 00:32:09,661
What's wrong?

452
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:18,471
I think I was happier when I had no memory.

453
00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:23,311
Thinking about the old days makes me cry.

454
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:31,671
Clearing your name...

455
00:32:33,421 --> 00:32:35,510
Do that with me.

456
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,331
Stay by my side.

457
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:47,430
I don't want you to be alone anymore.

458
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:52,671
I'll stay by your side no matter what happens.

459
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,051
So, don't run away anymore.

460
00:32:56,051 --> 00:33:00,811
I'll find you, no matter how far you run.

461
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:03,611
I'll never let you go anywhere.

462
00:33:04,231 --> 00:33:06,171
Oppa.

463
00:33:06,971 --> 00:33:09,251
I told you.

464
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:12,941
You'd suffer if you stayed by my side.

465
00:33:13,531 --> 00:33:17,161
Did you forget what I've done to you already?

466
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,161
You're such a good person.

467
00:33:21,671 --> 00:33:25,411
Why do you try to be with someone bad like me?

468
00:33:26,491 --> 00:33:28,861
Do you really not know how I feel?

469
00:33:32,101 --> 00:33:35,100
I've been waiting for you to come back all this time.

470
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,181
You said you feel bad for me.

471
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:40,391
You said you've only hurt me.

472
00:33:41,091 --> 00:33:46,031
If you really feel bad for me, you can't do this.

473
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:49,691
Do you want to hurt me more?

474
00:33:49,691 --> 00:33:53,731
- Is that why you're doing this? 
 - No.

475
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:58,661
No, you know it's not like that.

476
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:01,221
Stop pushing me away, then.

477
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:04,501
Don't say anything.

478
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,471
Trust me...

479
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:08,961
and stay right by my side.

480
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:27,921
Do Ra...

481
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:35,031
No, I can't keep calling you that.

482
00:34:35,611 --> 00:34:40,200
But I think I've been wanting to call you that so much.

483
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,690
But I think I've been wanting to call you that so much.

484
00:34:42,691 --> 00:34:44,811
I keep calling you that.

485
00:34:46,341 --> 00:34:49,341
Did you want to call my name so badly?

486
00:34:49,341 --> 00:34:51,461
Of course, I did.

487
00:34:52,141 --> 00:34:54,331
After what happened to you,

488
00:34:54,331 --> 00:34:58,981
I've been calling your name so much every day, all alone.

489
00:35:01,081 --> 00:35:05,061
So, could you let me call you Do Ra

490
00:35:05,961 --> 00:35:10,751
just 10 times, I mean, just five times?

491
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:16,671
Okay.

492
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:20,631
Call my name as many times as you want.

493
00:35:27,311 --> 00:35:28,881
Do Ra.

494
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:33,261
Do Ra.

495
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:38,871
Do Ra.

496
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:46,141
I missed you so much.

497
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:50,081
Do Ra.

498
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,811
Do Ra...

499
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:01,681
That's enough.

500
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,081
It's okay because you're by my side.

501
00:36:17,931 --> 00:36:21,771
I heard you're a drama writer. What did you write?

502
00:36:21,771 --> 00:36:23,561
It hasn't been aired yet.

503
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:27,841
I won a writing competition... and I'm currently working on a mini-series.

504
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:30,691
Oh, I see.

505
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:33,091
I've never met a drama writer.

506
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:37,021
Wow, I can't believe I'm seeing one. It's neat.

507
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:40,871
How could you create so many characters in your head?

508
00:36:40,871 --> 00:36:43,091
It's so impressive.

509
00:36:43,091 --> 00:36:47,001
I find you way more impressive, Yeong Hun.

510
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:49,571
How did you become a currency trader?

511
00:36:49,571 --> 00:36:53,731
I heard billions or tens of billions of won depend on a click.

512
00:36:53,731 --> 00:36:55,571
Is that really true?

513
00:36:55,571 --> 00:36:57,911
Yes, it happens.

514
00:36:58,811 --> 00:37:03,041
I heard drama writers make a lot of money.

515
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:07,431
I'm still a newbie... and they don't make as much as you think.

516
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:12,901
TV dramas aren't factory-made products that can be sold.

517
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:15,341
You make one once in a while.

518
00:37:15,341 --> 00:37:19,971
You don't write dramas purely for money.

519
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,641
Is that so?

520
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:25,391
I heard they make hundreds of millions.

521
00:37:25,391 --> 00:37:27,581
I suppose it's not true.

522
00:37:29,231 --> 00:37:32,621
Isn't it the same with currency traders?

523
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:34,841
Only 0.1% of them make that much.

524
00:37:34,841 --> 00:37:37,471
Not everyone makes that much.

525
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:40,381
Well, it's true, but...

526
00:37:41,271 --> 00:37:43,001
Honey!

527
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:45,391
Gosh.

528
00:37:51,341 --> 00:37:54,401
The baby is crying at home. What are you doing here?

529
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:59,011
Do Sik, are you crazy?

530
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:02,151
Let's go. I made food at home.

531
00:38:02,151 --> 00:38:03,581
- Let's go. 
 - Let go of me!

532
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,131
Let's go.

533
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:12,605
What's the deal?

534
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,388
Do Sik, what are you doing?

535
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,563
How about you? What are you doing?

536
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:21,433
How could you go on a blind date when you have a boyfriend?

537
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:25,683
I can't even tell anyone about you. What kind of boyfriend is that?

538
00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:30,803
Myeong Dong, this still isn't right.

539
00:38:30,803 --> 00:38:32,723
My mom forced me to do it.

540
00:38:32,723 --> 00:38:37,093
And his occupation is the same as the character I'm writing.

541
00:38:37,093 --> 00:38:39,553
I thought I might as well do research. So what?

542
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:43,873
How did you know I was here?

543
00:38:43,873 --> 00:38:45,323
Did you follow me by chance?

544
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:49,583
No, I'm not like that! I—

545
00:38:51,403 --> 00:38:55,113
I saw you while I was delivering a package.

546
00:38:55,948 --> 00:38:59,663
And you didn't seem to want to be there.

547
00:38:59,663 --> 00:39:02,503
And he doesn't seem to like you, either—

548
00:39:02,503 --> 00:39:05,713
Thinking about it upsets me. How dare he not like you?

549
00:39:05,713 --> 00:39:08,893
You're wrong, okay? You're upsetting me even more.

550
00:39:08,893 --> 00:39:11,483
Myeong Dong, Myeong Dong.

551
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:13,143
Don't be like that.

552
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:15,167
You probably haven't had dinner.

553
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:17,527
Do you want to have ramen at my place?

554
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:20,333
What did you say?

555
00:39:32,753 --> 00:39:35,373
B-By the way, why is no one home?

556
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,603
Well, I live here alone now.

557
00:39:38,603 --> 00:39:42,173
My mom and Ji Yeong moved out.

558
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:48,017
So, if you want to, feel free to...

559
00:39:48,017 --> 00:39:51,187
come by and have ramen.

560
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:57,663
Should I boil water, then?

561
00:40:00,623 --> 00:40:02,073
Yeah.

562
00:40:12,663 --> 00:40:14,017
By the way,

563
00:40:14,823 --> 00:40:18,027
does your family know you got your memory back?

564
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,563
Only Do Jun knows.

565
00:40:20,563 --> 00:40:22,753
Mom and Oppa don't know.

566
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:30,253
Did you suddenly move because of President Baek, then?

567
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:32,533
Yes.

568
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:38,943
I couldn't stand to see Mom's face after I got my memory back.

569
00:40:38,943 --> 00:40:41,133
So I moved out,

570
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:45,763
but I live with her again now.

571
00:40:47,493 --> 00:40:50,793
Really? What happened?

572
00:40:50,793 --> 00:40:54,907
My grandma thinks Mom is her daughter.

573
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:59,373
And I think she's been more careful.

574
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,723
And I feel sorry for her, too.

575
00:41:02,953 --> 00:41:05,083
She's still my mom, after all.

576
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:08,563
Would you be okay?

577
00:41:08,563 --> 00:41:12,203
To be honest, it's hard to see her face,

578
00:41:14,743 --> 00:41:16,383
but it's okay.

579
00:41:16,383 --> 00:41:19,143
I'm no longer the old Park Do Ra.

580
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,123
I just need to make sure she doesn't use me again.

581
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:27,253
Goodness...

582
00:41:27,253 --> 00:41:30,933
My Do Ra. You got a lot stronger.

583
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,413
Don't suffer alone if anything happens.

584
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:39,417
You need to tell me everything, okay?

585
00:41:40,013 --> 00:41:43,143
Okay, I will.

586
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:48,463
You should get going. It got too late.

587
00:41:50,323 --> 00:41:51,853
Okay.

588
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,833
Will you stay up all night here?

589
00:42:07,253 --> 00:42:08,933
Okay.

590
00:42:10,923 --> 00:42:12,313
I'll go.

591
00:42:27,793 --> 00:42:29,273
Bye.

592
00:42:46,753 --> 00:42:48,733
   

593
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:54,463
What's wrong, everyone?

594
00:42:54,463 --> 00:42:56,123
Did something happen?

595
00:42:56,123 --> 00:42:59,083
Director, haven't you seen this article?

596
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:01,683
It says Ms. Kim is engaged.

597
00:43:01,683 --> 00:43:05,173
W-What did you say? Ms. Kim Ji Yeong?

598
00:43:05,173 --> 00:43:08,823
Yes, here's the article.

599
00:43:11,293 --> 00:43:13,768
   

600
00:43:13,768 --> 00:43:15,443
 Director! 

601
00:43:15,443 --> 00:43:17,773
Director Go!

602
00:43:17,773 --> 00:43:22,243
- Writer Kim. 
 - I heard Ms. Kim and President Gong are engaged.

603
00:43:22,243 --> 00:43:24,443
Is that true?

604
00:43:24,443 --> 00:43:26,603
No, she never mentioned that.

605
00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:28,343
This article is wrong.

606
00:43:28,343 --> 00:43:30,723
Why would they say that if it weren't true?

607
00:43:30,723 --> 00:43:33,053
What's with Ms. Kim?

608
00:43:33,053 --> 00:43:35,063
Our drama is a romantic drama.

609
00:43:35,063 --> 00:43:39,573
If the engagement article comes out before it airs, the viewers won't engage emotionally.

610
00:43:39,573 --> 00:43:44,973
And if she wants to marry into a chaebol family, she should announce it after the drama ends.

611
00:43:44,973 --> 00:43:47,443
Why does she keep causing trouble?

612
00:43:47,443 --> 00:43:50,283
And President Gong or whatever his name is...

613
00:43:50,283 --> 00:43:53,173
How could he release an article like this when he's an investor?

614
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:54,943
Is he trying to ruin our drama?

615
00:43:54,943 --> 00:43:59,873
Seriously. Are they enemies of our drama? They take turns causing trouble.

616
00:43:59,873 --> 00:44:02,833
Seriously! They're making me swear.

617
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:05,533
No, Ms. Kim wouldn't do this.

618
00:44:05,533 --> 00:44:08,063
I'll confirm with her.

619
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,753
Seriously.

620
00:44:10,783 --> 00:44:13,513
What's going on here?

621
00:44:20,403 --> 00:44:23,033
Ji Yeong, welcome.

622
00:44:23,033 --> 00:44:26,723
President Gong, you released those articles, didn't you?

623
00:44:26,723 --> 00:44:29,653
Why would I be engaged to you?

624
00:44:29,653 --> 00:44:33,543
I'm proposing to you officially right now.

625
00:44:33,543 --> 00:44:37,233
Let's get engaged and get married as soon as possible.

626
00:44:37,233 --> 00:44:39,733
What are you talking about?

627
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:42,453
Why would we get engaged or get married?

628
00:44:42,453 --> 00:44:44,013
There's nothing between us.

629
00:44:44,013 --> 00:44:47,103
Why are you doing this on your own?

630
00:44:52,533 --> 00:44:54,993
On my own?

631
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:57,513
There's nothing going on?

632
00:44:57,513 --> 00:44:59,823
We're dating.

633
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:04,503
I'm the one who wants to ask you.

634
00:45:04,503 --> 00:45:08,183
Why are you doing this to me on your own?

635
00:45:08,183 --> 00:45:12,313
We had good times together while we were dating.

636
00:45:12,313 --> 00:45:14,793
When I held your hand...

637
00:45:14,793 --> 00:45:18,423
and hugged you, you just let me.

638
00:45:18,423 --> 00:45:22,493
You invited me to your home and gave me dumpling soup.

639
00:45:22,493 --> 00:45:25,033
But you're saying I'm doing this on my own?

640
00:45:25,033 --> 00:45:30,233
I told you... already.

641
00:45:30,233 --> 00:45:34,643
I was trying to make things work with you then.

642
00:45:34,643 --> 00:45:37,293
But I told you I changed my mind.

643
00:45:37,293 --> 00:45:38,733
We're over.

644
00:45:38,733 --> 00:45:40,923
I paid you back in full, too!

645
00:45:40,923 --> 00:45:43,543
We didn't do anything. Why are you doing this?

646
00:45:43,543 --> 00:45:46,713
Why do you think I broke up with the daughter of Ilyoo Foods?

647
00:45:46,713 --> 00:45:49,463
I did that so I could marry you.

648
00:45:49,463 --> 00:45:53,253
I ended everything for only you.

649
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:57,853
But how does that make me look if you keep doing this?

650
00:45:57,853 --> 00:46:02,093
Ji Yeong, don't look elsewhere, okay?

651
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,033
That'd be cheating.

652
00:46:04,033 --> 00:46:06,783
I'll also make myself clear.

653
00:46:06,783 --> 00:46:10,563
I'm not interested in getting engaged to you, let alone marrying you.

654
00:46:10,563 --> 00:46:13,873
I'm not interested in seeing you anymore, either.

655
00:46:13,873 --> 00:46:19,343
If you don't take down the articles today, I won't just sit and watch, either.

656
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:32,423
What would she do, exactly, then?

657
00:46:33,343 --> 00:46:37,833
Geez. Is she really the Kim Ji Yeong I knew?

658
00:46:38,773 --> 00:46:42,283
She's making me angrier and angrier.

659
00:46:52,153 --> 00:46:55,113
By the way, this is...

660
00:46:55,113 --> 00:46:57,613
Let's go in, Ae Gyo.

661
00:46:57,613 --> 00:46:59,913
I-Is this where you live?

662
00:46:59,913 --> 00:47:01,253
Yes. What's wrong?

663
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:03,273
My gosh.

664
00:47:03,273 --> 00:47:06,213
I can't. I can't. I can't go in there.

665
00:47:06,213 --> 00:47:09,863
You wanted to see me at my place to avoid Jin Dan.

666
00:47:09,863 --> 00:47:11,013
Why can't you go in?

667
00:47:11,013 --> 00:47:15,553
Sang Gu, this is my friend's house. Her name is Kim Seon Yeong.

668
00:47:15,553 --> 00:47:17,233
- Really? 
 - Yes.

669
00:47:17,233 --> 00:47:20,003
My gosh, what's going on?

670
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,953
What if people find out I'm seeing you?

671
00:47:22,953 --> 00:47:26,243
What if they doubt Jin Dan because of that?

672
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:30,013
No one would doubt Jin Dan because of that.

673
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:33,233
It's because you feel guilty about it.

674
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:35,153
- Y-You think so? 
 - Of course.

675
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:40,533
And I think it's good that this is your friend's house.

676
00:47:40,533 --> 00:47:44,813
Even if Jin Dan finds out, he'd think you're visiting your friend.

677
00:47:44,813 --> 00:47:47,257
Is that how it works?

678
00:48:03,963 --> 00:48:08,383
M-My gosh, isn't that President Gong's mom?

679
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,983
Gosh. My goodness.

680
00:48:12,983 --> 00:48:16,763
Seon Yeong! Seon Yeong, Seon Yeong, Seon Yeong.

681
00:48:16,763 --> 00:48:20,643
I told you I saw our tenant and your friend together.

682
00:48:20,643 --> 00:48:22,323
I wasn't hallucinating.

683
00:48:22,323 --> 00:48:25,733
I really saw them for real.

684
00:48:25,733 --> 00:48:28,293
What are you talking about, Mother?

685
00:48:30,883 --> 00:48:33,663
Let's eat. Let's eat.

686
00:48:34,733 --> 00:48:36,653
Gosh, it looks tasty.

687
00:48:36,653 --> 00:48:39,063
A long time ago, in your room,

688
00:48:39,063 --> 00:48:43,373
we used to make one ramen and fight over it.

689
00:48:43,373 --> 00:48:46,883
We don't have to fight today. I made two.

690
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:52,313
W-Who's there?

691
00:48:52,313 --> 00:48:56,113
 Sang Gu, it's me. Open the door. 

692
00:48:56,113 --> 00:48:59,473
W-Well, w-what is it, ma'am?

693
00:48:59,473 --> 00:49:03,373
I-I'm sorry, but could you just talk to me from there?

694
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:06,413
 Sang Gu, this is too heavy. 

695
00:49:06,413 --> 00:49:09,373
 Hurry up and open the door. 

696
00:49:14,503 --> 00:49:16,393
Okay.

697
00:49:17,223 --> 00:49:19,253
Gosh, seriously.

698
00:49:19,253 --> 00:49:21,463
Here's shikhye. Take it.

699
00:49:21,463 --> 00:49:23,233
Okay.

700
00:49:23,233 --> 00:49:26,593
Seon Yeong, bring the kimchi inside.

701
00:49:26,593 --> 00:49:27,883
Gosh.

702
00:49:27,883 --> 00:49:30,513
T-The scallion kimchi turned out so well.

703
00:49:30,513 --> 00:49:34,983
Aigoo, you need to eat well even though you live alone.

704
00:49:34,983 --> 00:49:36,703
I smell ramen.

705
00:49:36,703 --> 00:49:39,373
Were you eating ramen?

706
00:49:40,153 --> 00:49:43,843
Huh? W-Who's over there?

707
00:49:48,283 --> 00:49:51,383
Well, it's me.

708
00:49:51,383 --> 00:49:54,253
My goodness. Look who's here.

709
00:49:54,253 --> 00:49:55,863
President Gong's mother?

710
00:49:55,863 --> 00:49:58,623
My gosh, A-A-Ae Gyo.

711
00:49:58,623 --> 00:50:04,523
What's your relationship that you're eating ramen together here?

712
00:50:04,523 --> 00:50:09,463
Gosh, Sang Gu. You mentioned your first love last time.

713
00:50:09,463 --> 00:50:13,423
Was your first love President Gong's mother?

714
00:50:13,423 --> 00:50:16,103
- N-No, it's not like that. 
 - No, no.

715
00:50:16,103 --> 00:50:19,273
Sang Gu is my... I mean...

716
00:50:19,273 --> 00:50:22,553
Sang Gu oppa is my cousin. My cousin.

717
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:26,653
Yes, I'm Ae Gyo's maternal cousin.

718
00:50:32,393 --> 00:50:36,033
Gosh, all of their clothes are for young people.

719
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:41,073
This isn't so bad.

720
00:50:41,073 --> 00:50:44,663
But what's the point? I can't afford it.

721
00:50:44,663 --> 00:50:47,103
I shouldn't bother.

722
00:50:48,153 --> 00:50:51,033
You bought a lot, Ma Ri.

723
00:50:51,033 --> 00:50:53,983
Mom and Dad, let's go get hamburgers now.

724
00:50:53,983 --> 00:50:55,243
What?

725
00:50:55,243 --> 00:50:58,453
All you wanted to eat was just a hamburger?

726
00:50:58,453 --> 00:51:02,033
Let's enjoy a hamburger, thanks to Ma Ri.

727
00:51:02,033 --> 00:51:04,493
- Let's go. 
 - Shall we?

728
00:51:08,123 --> 00:51:12,733
Those wealthy-looking people are her parents?

729
00:51:14,443 --> 00:51:16,423
Hold on.

730
00:51:16,423 --> 00:51:19,863
Her dad looks familiar.

731
00:51:19,863 --> 00:51:22,473
It can't be.

732
00:51:30,643 --> 00:51:31,683
   

733
00:51:31,683 --> 00:51:33,163
It's true.

734
00:51:33,163 --> 00:51:36,883
APP Group's Chairman Gong Jin Taek.

735
00:51:37,633 --> 00:51:39,533
Hold on. What does this mean?

736
00:51:39,533 --> 00:51:42,073
APP Group's only daughter...

737
00:51:42,073 --> 00:51:45,263
The daughter who was in an accident...

738
00:51:45,263 --> 00:51:46,523
was Gong Ma Ri?

739
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:50,043
- It's pretty. 
 - No, let's go. Let's go.

740
00:51:50,663 --> 00:51:52,023
My gosh, what's going on here?

741
00:51:52,023 --> 00:51:55,813
Is Do Jun dating a chaebol's daughter, then?

742
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:58,333
They say every dog has its day. My goodness.

743
00:51:58,333 --> 00:52:01,373
My goodness! How...

744
00:52:01,373 --> 00:52:03,393
You aren't even dating President Gong.

745
00:52:03,393 --> 00:52:06,963
But he released the article on his own?

746
00:52:06,963 --> 00:52:08,403
Is that true?

747
00:52:08,403 --> 00:52:11,273
Yes, it's true.

748
00:52:13,003 --> 00:52:14,893
How does this make sense?

749
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:17,263
Is Gong Jin Dan out of his mind?

750
00:52:17,263 --> 00:52:19,633
Or is he a stalker?

751
00:52:19,633 --> 00:52:24,693
I did... used to date him briefly.

752
00:52:24,693 --> 00:52:31,043
We ended up breaking up, but he released this article, unable to accept that fact.

753
00:52:31,043 --> 00:52:35,303
Gosh, how could this happen?

754
00:52:35,303 --> 00:52:39,123
Ji Yeong, this is an abuse.

755
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:41,493
Everyone had breakups before.

756
00:52:41,493 --> 00:52:44,333
Everyone experiences all sorts of breakups in life.

757
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:46,813
How dare he refuse to accept it?

758
00:52:46,813 --> 00:52:51,483
I'll release an article denying the engagement immediately.

759
00:52:52,183 --> 00:52:53,843
What are you doing?

760
00:52:53,843 --> 00:52:56,763
What was your intention for releasing this?

761
00:52:58,653 --> 00:53:02,243
As you can see, it's an innocent engagement announcement. What intention?

762
00:53:02,243 --> 00:53:03,703
How could you say that?

763
00:53:03,703 --> 00:53:06,173
What did you say? "Innocent"?

764
00:53:06,173 --> 00:53:08,503
You didn't even tell your family about it.

765
00:53:08,503 --> 00:53:12,403
We knew nothing about it. How could it be innocent?

766
00:53:12,403 --> 00:53:16,263
How could you be so careless without following basic steps?

767
00:53:16,263 --> 00:53:18,263
Chairman...

768
00:53:18,263 --> 00:53:23,203
I mean, Hyung, you aren't interested in me at all.

769
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:29,563
Do I have to get your approval for everything I do?

770
00:53:29,563 --> 00:53:32,303
You don't treat me like your brother and look down on me.

771
00:53:32,303 --> 00:53:35,303
You want to act like a big brother now?

772
00:53:35,303 --> 00:53:38,273
Hyung... I mean, Chairman,

773
00:53:38,273 --> 00:53:43,117
whatever I do is none of your business, okay?

774
00:53:43,117 --> 00:53:46,297
   

775
00:53:59,373 --> 00:54:00,993
Do Ra.

776
00:54:00,993 --> 00:54:02,533
Oppa.

777
00:54:03,943 --> 00:54:09,733
Oppa, we released a statement denying the engagement,

778
00:54:09,733 --> 00:54:12,563
but it disappeared immediately.

779
00:54:12,563 --> 00:54:17,933
We're asking for the articles to be removed, but it's only spreading all over the social media.

780
00:54:18,443 --> 00:54:21,563
There's nothing I can do.

781
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:27,653
Back when I had no memory,

782
00:54:29,143 --> 00:54:32,003
I was told President Gong was my fiance.

783
00:54:32,003 --> 00:54:35,163
So, I did try to make things work with him briefly.

784
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:39,273
But I realized everything was wrong since I got my memory back.

785
00:54:39,273 --> 00:54:45,533
So, I paid back my mom's debt... and broke up with him completely.

786
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:52,193
I didn't give him any hope, but I don't know why he's doing this.

787
00:54:52,193 --> 00:54:58,413
Oppa, everything he's saying is a lie.

788
00:55:00,717 --> 00:55:02,283
I know.

789
00:55:04,667 --> 00:55:07,433
You asked me before.

790
00:55:09,183 --> 00:55:12,473
About what happened at the villa.

791
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:15,647
You asked me...

792
00:55:16,273 --> 00:55:20,033
if I remembered something while shooting.

793
00:55:27,193 --> 00:55:29,963
President Gong trapped me...

794
00:55:31,337 --> 00:55:33,273
in that villa.

795
00:55:36,717 --> 00:55:38,373
What did you say?

796
00:55:40,497 --> 00:55:42,393
President Gong...

797
00:55:43,753 --> 00:55:45,963
trapped you?

798
00:55:45,963 --> 00:55:48,413
That's why I ran away.

799
00:55:48,943 --> 00:55:50,863
Back then...

800
00:55:51,663 --> 00:55:54,263
as well as at the shoot last time.

801
00:55:56,723 --> 00:56:01,983
Just being reminded of that incident gives me the chills, and I loathe him.

802
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:06,073
How could I possibly be engaged to someone like him?

803
00:56:06,903 --> 00:56:08,843
Oppa,

804
00:56:09,343 --> 00:56:11,853
it's not true.

805
00:56:11,853 --> 00:56:14,893
Please believe me, Oppa.

806
00:56:20,053 --> 00:56:22,123
I believe you.

807
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:24,703
I do.

808
00:56:24,703 --> 00:56:28,163
So, don't worry.

809
00:56:29,937 --> 00:56:33,903
Oppa, I want to get away from him.

810
00:56:36,343 --> 00:56:40,033
I really hate him so much.

811
00:56:41,483 --> 00:56:43,823
He's still doing this.

812
00:56:43,823 --> 00:56:46,073
If he finds out I'm Do Ra,

813
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:50,523
I shudder to think what he'd do.

814
00:56:53,593 --> 00:56:56,013
I couldn't tell you this before,

815
00:56:56,013 --> 00:57:01,423
but I think President Gong also hired that actor.

816
00:57:04,503 --> 00:57:05,903
What?

817
00:57:07,283 --> 00:57:09,563
You think the one who accused you of...

818
00:57:10,783 --> 00:57:12,883
prostitution was President Gong?

819
00:57:14,753 --> 00:57:17,543
Of course, there's no evidence.

820
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:21,413
I know I can't just doubt someone,

821
00:57:22,293 --> 00:57:25,123
but no matter how much I think about it,

822
00:57:25,843 --> 00:57:29,253
he's the only one who would've done that to me.

823
00:57:32,003 --> 00:57:33,903
To be honest...

824
00:57:36,003 --> 00:57:39,923
I was planning to leave with Grandma after this project.

825
00:57:41,267 --> 00:57:46,303
I didn't want to hurt you and my family.

826
00:57:47,903 --> 00:57:52,253
But I don't think running away would fix things.

827
00:57:53,353 --> 00:57:59,113
Oppa, I no longer want to run away.

828
00:57:59,113 --> 00:58:01,813
Please help me, Oppa.

829
00:58:01,813 --> 00:58:04,303
Oppa, please help me.

830
00:58:11,593 --> 00:58:13,813
I promised you.

831
00:58:15,483 --> 00:58:18,063
That I'll never let go of your hand.

832
00:58:20,673 --> 00:58:22,553
Just trust me.

833
00:58:23,473 --> 00:58:25,063
Trust me.

834
00:58:39,903 --> 00:58:44,547
 I think President Gong also hired that actor. 

835
00:58:45,073 --> 00:58:50,903
 Oppa, I no longer want to run away. 

836
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:53,433
 Please help me, Oppa. 

837
00:58:56,573 --> 00:58:58,153
Do Ra...

838
00:58:59,883 --> 00:59:02,123
I'll protect you.

839
00:59:04,223 --> 00:59:07,113
I won't let the same thing happen to you again.

840
00:59:14,503 --> 00:59:16,263
Yes.

841
00:59:17,063 --> 00:59:19,493
Hey, President Go.

842
00:59:19,493 --> 00:59:21,237
Welcome.

843
00:59:21,237 --> 00:59:22,747
   

844
00:59:22,747 --> 00:59:24,843
Have a seat.

845
00:59:29,923 --> 00:59:34,003
Yes, you said you wanted to tell me something.

846
00:59:35,293 --> 00:59:37,083
Yes, Chairman.

847
00:59:39,083 --> 00:59:44,653
You asked me to be your adoptive son. Is that still the case?

848
00:59:46,963 --> 00:59:48,383
Of course.

849
00:59:48,383 --> 00:59:52,583
I'm still waiting for your answer.

850
00:59:54,763 --> 01:00:00,093
If so, I agree to become your adoptive son.

851
01:00:03,293 --> 01:00:05,223
Do you mean it?

852
01:00:05,793 --> 01:00:07,253
Yes.

853
01:00:10,123 --> 01:00:12,703
You made the right decision.

854
01:00:12,703 --> 01:00:14,883
This is great.

855
01:00:16,073 --> 01:00:23,593
I've liked you very much for a long time.

856
01:00:23,593 --> 01:00:28,673
And at some point, I started wondering...

857
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:33,779
how nice it would be if you were my son.

858
01:00:34,853 --> 01:00:41,613
But I'm so thankful and happy you'll actually become my son.

859
01:00:44,426 --> 01:00:46,016
Thank you.

860
01:00:46,016 --> 01:00:51,356
I'll make sure to honor your will, Chairman.

861
01:00:53,336 --> 01:00:59,866
I'll make sure your decision will benefit not only my family

862
01:00:59,866 --> 01:01:02,996
but also your family. I'll take extra care.

863
01:01:06,126 --> 01:01:08,146
Thank you, Chairman.

864
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:12,826
But Chairman,

865
01:01:14,166 --> 01:01:16,566
I have a favor to ask you.

866
01:01:16,566 --> 01:01:18,996
Yes, ask me anything.

867
01:01:18,996 --> 01:01:21,646
I'll do anything for you.

868
01:01:27,486 --> 01:01:30,956
Father, Mom,

869
01:01:30,956 --> 01:01:33,856
Grandma, Aunt,

870
01:01:35,096 --> 01:01:41,516
I met with the Chairman and told him I'd be his adoptive son.

871
01:01:41,516 --> 01:01:44,116
- Aigoo. 
 - Gosh, really?

872
01:01:44,116 --> 01:01:46,536
Did you really agree to it?

873
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,786
Yes, Aunt.

874
01:01:47,786 --> 01:01:51,416
Aigoo, aigoo, yes! Good job. Good job.

875
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:55,286
Why would you refuse such a thing? Why take so long?

876
01:01:55,286 --> 01:01:59,986
Gosh, you did great, Pil Sung. You did the right thing.

877
01:02:01,736 --> 01:02:04,266
I made this decision,

878
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:08,206
but my feelings for you two won't change.

879
01:02:10,136 --> 01:02:13,656
I know. Of course, I know.

880
01:02:13,656 --> 01:02:16,596
Pil Sung, don't worry about us.

881
01:02:16,596 --> 01:02:18,576
Yes, Pil Sung.

882
01:02:18,576 --> 01:02:23,826
We'll trust and support you no matter what decision you make.

883
01:02:23,826 --> 01:02:28,156
We always have, but we will continue to.

884
01:02:29,806 --> 01:02:33,536
Mom, thank you.

885
01:02:33,536 --> 01:02:37,696
Father, Grandma, Aunt,

886
01:02:37,696 --> 01:02:39,556
thank you.

887
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:43,906
This is great.

888
01:02:43,906 --> 01:02:45,076
It's really great.

889
01:02:45,076 --> 01:02:46,816
What?

890
01:02:46,816 --> 01:02:48,726
What's this?

891
01:02:48,726 --> 01:02:52,626
What happened to all of our engagement articles? Nothing's there.

892
01:02:52,626 --> 01:02:56,316
Who did this? Who was behind this?

893
01:02:58,266 --> 01:02:59,930
Could it be?

894
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:02,616
Can't be...

895
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:11,176
President Gong, the Chairman's secretary just called.

896
01:03:11,176 --> 01:03:16,506
He removed all the engagement articles, so don't publish them again.

897
01:03:17,586 --> 01:03:21,486
So, Chairman was behind all this?

898
01:03:21,486 --> 01:03:24,336
Chairman removed all of my articles?

899
01:03:25,046 --> 01:03:27,406
Why would he?

900
01:03:29,466 --> 01:03:31,856
Secretary Jo, wait outside.

901
01:03:33,616 --> 01:03:36,366
You shouldn't worry about the silly articles right now.

902
01:03:36,366 --> 01:03:40,626
Go Pil Sung told your brother that he'll be his adoptive son.

903
01:03:40,626 --> 01:03:42,736
What?

904
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:43,926
What did you say?

905
01:03:43,926 --> 01:03:46,320
I-Is that true?

906
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,416
G-Go Pil Sung, that asshole, really agreed to it?

907
01:03:49,416 --> 01:03:53,436
Your brother told Attorney Kang to start the paperwork.

908
01:03:53,436 --> 01:03:56,196
Gong Jin Dan, you're over now.

909
01:03:56,196 --> 01:03:58,116
We're completely done for now.

910
01:03:58,116 --> 01:04:01,426
That ridiculous bastard took your position. What will you do now?

911
01:04:01,426 --> 01:04:04,046
What are you going to do now?

912
01:04:04,046 --> 01:04:12,526
This means Go Pil Sung was the one who removed my articles.

913
01:04:13,276 --> 01:04:15,606
Go Pil Sung...

914
01:04:15,606 --> 01:04:18,816
Gong Jin Dan, where are you going?

915
01:04:18,816 --> 01:04:20,596
Hey, Go Pil Sung!

916
01:04:20,596 --> 01:04:22,806
Where's Go Pil Sung?

917
01:04:22,806 --> 01:04:25,076
President Go went home.

918
01:04:28,636 --> 01:04:32,400
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

919
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,890
Whoa—

920
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:44,296
That crazy bastard.

921
01:05:02,976 --> 01:05:05,216
Hey, Go Pil Sung!

922
01:05:08,636 --> 01:05:10,526
Oppa!

923
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,366
Who do you think you are?

924
01:05:15,366 --> 01:05:17,906
How dare you take everything from me?

925
01:05:17,906 --> 01:05:20,456
What are you doing? What do you think you're doing?

926
01:05:20,456 --> 01:05:22,406
Get out of the way.

927
01:05:22,406 --> 01:05:24,066
Do Ra!

928
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:40,710


929
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:45,236
   

930
01:05:45,236 --> 01:05:48,856
♫  Why did I fall in love?  ♫

931
01:05:48,856 --> 01:05:54,226
♫  I shouldn't have given you my heart at all  ♫

932
01:05:54,226 --> 01:06:00,076
♫  I've already fallen for you  ♫

933
01:06:00,076 --> 01:06:05,866
♫  I'm not able to free myself anymore  ♫

934
01:06:05,866 --> 01:06:11,286
♫  But we're drifting apart  ♫

935
01:06:16,016 --> 01:06:19,306
 Their son took Jin Dan's spot by becoming the adoptive son. 

936
01:06:19,306 --> 01:06:21,526
 He's the slow Ma Ri's brother. Her brother. 

937
01:06:21,526 --> 01:06:23,466
 I didn't think you were this kind of a person. 

938
01:06:23,466 --> 01:06:26,146
 I know you like money, but how could you sell your son? 

939
01:06:26,146 --> 01:06:27,406
 It's not over yet. 

940
01:06:27,406 --> 01:06:30,466
 Find Go Pil Sung's flaws, no matter what. 

941
01:06:30,466 --> 01:06:32,666
 I'll use that and cancel the adoption. 

942
01:06:32,666 --> 01:06:34,906
 How did I get a beverage commercial deal? 

943
01:06:34,906 --> 01:06:36,946
 I know. Isn't it crazy? 

944
01:06:36,946 --> 01:06:39,196
 They're paying you a fortune for your appearance. 

945
01:06:39,196 --> 01:06:42,556
 When you break up with someone, you need to give them time. 

946
01:06:42,556 --> 01:06:45,456
 I need to see you while I try to give up on you. 

947
01:06:45,456 --> 01:06:47,896
 It's an abuse when the other person rejects it. 

948
01:06:47,896 --> 01:06:49,686
 I said no. Why do you keep doing this? 

949
01:06:49,686 --> 01:06:51,596
 I'll fix things one by one now. 

950
01:06:51,596 --> 01:06:54,476
 So, don't worry about anything.
