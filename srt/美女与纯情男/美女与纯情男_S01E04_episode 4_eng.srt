1
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:49,689
   

2
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:52,849
   

3
00:00:52,849 --> 00:00:55,399
   

4
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,429
 Noona! 

5
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:58,569
 Park Do Ra is here! 

6
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:03,679
 Unni! 

7
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:08,439
   

8
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:13,579
   

9
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,859
   

10
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:29,090


11
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:42,139
Unni, love you!

12
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:44,719
I love you, Unni!

13
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:48,089
You're so pretty!

14
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:55,369
I'm so tired, I could die.

15
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:57,259
Gosh, my tummy is cold.

16
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:03,089
What are you doing? Let's get going.

17
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,819
Will we stay here all night?

18
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:07,609
 I love you, Unni! 

19
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,059
 I love you! 

20
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:20,759
How could you make me wear such shabby clothes?

21
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,159
Let's switch the company.

22
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,859
When does our contract end?

23
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:26,919
There's just one term left, but they offered double for the renewal.

24
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:29,839
- Do you still want to cancel? 
 - Double?

25
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:31,449
Really?

26
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:35,069
I need to renew, then.

27
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,169
Ask them to get better clothes instead.

28
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:45,829
   

29
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,929
   

30
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:49,909
It will be sold out today, too.

31
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:52,499
It's selling out because I wore it.

32
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:05,189
Gosh, I'm so freaking tired.

33
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:07,289
So freaking tired.

34
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:10,509
Jae Dong, we're going home, right?

35
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,879
You have a photoshoot briefly.

36
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,599
You must be crazy.

37
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:19,339
I can't do a photoshoot looking like this.

38
00:03:19,339 --> 00:03:21,139
Did Mom schedule it again?

39
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:22,639
Yup.

40
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:26,829
She's driving me crazy.

41
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:29,049
I won't even get paid that much.

42
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:32,939
And Noona...

43
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:34,739
What is it now?

44
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,749
There's a lead actors' meeting for the series "Straightforward Romance."

45
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:42,649
I... I said I won't do that series.

46
00:03:42,649 --> 00:03:46,769
Hey. Do you think I should work for that pay?

47
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,669
And I heard the male lead is Cha Bong Soo.

48
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:50,479
He's not my type.

49
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,899
He's a greasy womanizer. I'm sure he smells greasy.

50
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:55,799
But they want me to do a romance with him?

51
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,609
The CEO had dinner with the CEO and director of the production company already.

52
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:03,639
- My mom did? 
 - Yes, what should we do, then?

53
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,739
Do you have to ask?

54
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,149
First of all, turn the car around to the broadcasting station.

55
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:13,979
Right now.

56
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:24,670
Pil Sung. Good morning, Sir. 
  (T/N: Pil Sung means victory) 

57
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,520
   

58
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:41,359
You want me to join Hong Jin Goo sunbae's "Straightforward Romance"?

59
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:46,369
Do Yeong was hospitalized because she might miscarry.

60
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,139
I nagged at her to be careful all the time.

61
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,639
She devoted herself too much to some silly drama.

62
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:56,439
What do we do?

63
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:59,879
You're the only one who could join...

64
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,329
"Straightforward Romance."

65
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:06,179
Yes, I know you worked yourself to death on a daily series

66
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:11,949
and you're finally going on vacation to backpacking to Europe since it ended yesterday.

67
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:13,519
Hey...

68
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:19,469
could you cancel that and do this... somehow?

69
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:28,529
Station Director, you don't have to beat around the bush to ask me that.

70
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,799
Do Yeong is my colleague, and she was hospitalized. Of course, I should do it.

71
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,169
I'll go backpacking in Europe after finishing "Straightforward Romance" successfully.

72
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:40,269
Feel free to ask me anything, Sir.

73
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:41,649
Gosh, man...

74
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:44,829
How come you always say the right thing?

75
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:48,499
Gosh, I like you. I like you.

76
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:55,299
Pil Sung, if you pull this off, I'll let you...

77
00:05:55,299 --> 00:06:00,079
debut a two-part series.

78
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,429
You mean it, right? You're serious.

79
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:06,779
Yes. But don't tell everyone about it.

80
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:10,019
So, good luck with this one.

81
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:12,239
You know what I mean, right?

82
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:15,699
Yes, got it! Salute!

83
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:26,239
Hey, you made it. I just got a call from the broadcasting station director.

84
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:29,059
Director, who's he?

85
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:30,879
Say hello, Director Go.

86
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,289
You know Ms. Park Do Ra, right?

87
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:38,439
He's Go Pil Sung, the assistant director who's joining our team starting today.

88
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,439
Hello.

89
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:50,069
Oh, h-hello.

90
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:52,169
Why are you so shocked?

91
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:53,749
Don't you know Ms. Park?

92
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:58,159
Oh, yes, yes. I know.

93
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:06,209
Looks like he's too shocked by your beauty, Ms. Park.

94
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,689
What are you doing? Have a seat.

95
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,529
Oh, okay.

96
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:17,359
 W-What happened? 

97
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:19,269
 Why is Park Do Ra here? 

98
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:21,359
 Was she cast for "Straightforward Romance"? 

99
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,639
The official meeting is tomorrow.

100
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,339
What did you want to talk to me about today?

101
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:31,729
Do you need to adjust the schedule, by chance? Or—

102
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:33,479
No.

103
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:38,179
Director Hong, I don't think I could join you for this project.

104
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:39,949
I wanted to tell you that.

105
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:44,559
M-Ms. Park, what do you mean? You can't join us?

106
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:46,879
I made it clear that I can't,

107
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,009
but there must've been a miscommunication while I was shooting abroad.

108
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:56,779
But I thought I should explain in person instead of talking over the phone.

109
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:02,719
Wait, Ms. Park, the filming starts this week. You can't do this to us out of the blue.

110
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:04,909
I'm so sorry.

111
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:08,039
I'll get going now, then.

112
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:12,329
Take care.

113
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:15,289
Take care. I'm sorry. Take care.

114
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:21,279
Ms. Park. M-Ms. Park!

115
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,959
Ms. Park! Ms. Park Do Ra!

116
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:28,009
Ms. Park! Ms. Park! Ms. Park Do Ra! Ms. Park!

117
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:31,199
H-Hold on, please hear me out. Yes, Ms. Park!

118
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,409
The filming starts this week—

119
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:38,009
Whoa, she's so unbelievable. She doesn't give a crap.

120
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:41,189
Who does she think she is?

121
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:44,559
What would happen if she's dropping out?

122
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,239
What do you mean? We can cast someone else.

123
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:50,769
There are plenty of actors out there.

124
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,649
I can't believe I ran into her here.

125
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,369
But she didn't recognize me.

126
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:02,219
I suppose, how could she?

127
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:06,519
My name changed, and we haven't met since she was a kid 15 years ago.

128
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,189
President Kim, didn't Park Do Ra sign the contract?

129
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:15,769
Didn't you tell me she did?

130
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:19,009
Come on!

131
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:21,889
A verbal agreement isn't the same as signing a contract.

132
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:25,389
She backed out. What will you do now?

133
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:30,619
Pardon? Where would we find another actor now?

134
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:33,589
I don't give a crap! You'd better fix this yourself!

135
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:43,839
Sunbae, I created a list of available female actors.

136
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,909
Sunbae, how about Bi Bi?

137
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:48,889
Park Do Ra's forever rival.

138
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,639
Look at her recent headshot. She's in great shape.

139
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:56,019
Her image is a bit different than Park Do Ra's, but she isn't too bad, is she?

140
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:59,949
I don't care if it's Bi BI or Mi Mi right now!

141
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:04,109
You can't do this right now. You should go get Park Do Ra back somehow.

142
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:09,049
Geez, how could this happen right now?

143
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:12,619
Hold on.

144
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:16,409
Go Pil Sung, go get a bouquet right now.

145
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:20,089
Get the most expensive one. A huge one. This big.

146
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:21,949
A bouquet?

147
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:26,359
Hurry up, Pil Sung!

148
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:31,109
Nice.

149
00:10:31,109 --> 00:10:33,709
Yes, slightly to the left.

150
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,449
Nice.

151
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,699
Great, thank you.

152
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:48,989
Thank you. Thank you.

153
00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:51,019
Thank you.

154
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:55,239
You did a great job. Seriously.

155
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:58,289
Look at it.

156
00:10:58,289 --> 00:10:59,819
Looks amazing, right?

157
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:01,369
Yes.

158
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,869
Gosh, great job, Ms. Park.

159
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:16,539
Director Hong, what brings you here?

160
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:18,389
Hey, hey, hey.

161
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:20,769
Yes?

162
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:25,359
Ms. Park, here.

163
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:29,869
Director Hong, I understand why you came all the way here,

164
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:32,829
but I can't join "Straightforward Romance."

165
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:38,769
I've worked without taking a day off since I debuted as a child actor at age 12.

166
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:41,079
I really want to take a break.

167
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:43,829
Goodness. I know, too.

168
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,609
But just this once, could you—

169
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:49,139
It must've been very difficult.

170
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,779
You've been working for 15 years without taking a day off.

171
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,569
Sounds like you do need a break.

172
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:03,849
I know you've been working hard all this time.

173
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:08,739
But this project was approved because you said you'll join.

174
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:13,269
But we'll be in serious trouble if you don't, so—

175
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:16,869
It's not like the pay is high enough.

176
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:20,469
To be honest, I felt disrespected and upset.

177
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:24,169
How could I get paid less than Jeon Ga Yeon?

178
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:27,709
Well, it's because our budget is a bit...

179
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,889
I wish I could pay you more.

180
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:33,069
And I heard Cha Bong Soo is the male lead.

181
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:36,409
I don't think we're a good match, either. For many reasons—

182
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:38,739
You must not like the male lead, either.

183
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:40,709
You really can't do it, then.

184
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,979
Romance is all about the chemistry between the leads.

185
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:51,149
Anyway, I'm sorry, Director Hong.

186
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:53,729
I hope you understand where I'm coming from.

187
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,329
I'll get going now.

188
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:57,919
Wait, Ms. Park.

189
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,919
Wait, Do Ra, Do Ra. Ms. Park...

190
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:10,029
Go Pil Sung, you crazy bastard. Are you out of your mind?

191
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:13,029
You came all this way to ruin things?

192
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:17,739
Instead of kneeling and begging, you say, "You need a break"?

193
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:22,919
Sunbae, this is beneath us. Why do this to someone who doesn't want to?

194
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,389
And for your information, you begged me to come with you.

195
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:31,209
- You didn't want to go alone. 
 - You bastard. Seriously!

196
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:33,409
Sunbae! Am I wrong?

197
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:35,599
Why are you beating me? What am I, a drum?

198
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,569
Geez! You can't hit someone, even with flowers.

199
00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:40,629
Hey, Go Pil Sung, shut your mouth.

200
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:44,349
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

201
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:50,299
Ms. Park!

202
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:52,989
Geez, thank goodness.

203
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:56,039
I almost got to work with Park Do Ra.

204
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,809
That won't be right.

205
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:04,569
My goodness.

206
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:09,849
Gosh, this is so luxurious and pretty.

207
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,219
My gosh!

208
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:16,389
Aigoo, my goodness.

209
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:22,650
How lucky are the women who buy stuff like this like it's nothing?

210
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:27,909
It suits you so well, Ma'am.

211
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,789
Really? Thank you. I'll be back soon.

212
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:33,059
Okay. I'll call you when we get new products.

213
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:35,349
That woman looks very familiar.

214
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:37,809
- See you. 
 - Okay.

215
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,999
Yes, Do Ra's mom. That gold digger.

216
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:48,649
Excuse me. Hold on.

217
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:50,819
Gosh! W-What are you doing?

218
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:52,269
It's you.

219
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:55,079
Gosh, look who's here.

220
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,739
They say the enemies reunite on a log bridge.

221
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:01,119
Ms. Baek, it's me.

222
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,989
Don't you recognize me?

223
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:05,329
Please let go. You're mistaken.

224
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:08,439
Come on, I'm not mistaken.

225
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:13,089
You're the gold digger who ran away from our house 15 years ago.

226
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:15,379
What are you doing? You'd better look carefully.

227
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:18,809
- That's not me. Let go! Let go. 
 - Oh, my gosh.

228
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:20,409
That gold digger. That gold digger.

229
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:22,729
Hey, catch that gold digger!

230
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:24,839
Hey, gold digger!

231
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:29,369
Gosh, that scamming gold digger.

232
00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:32,639
Where's she hiding exactly?

233
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,349
She definitely went this way.

234
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:43,999
Maybe she didn't go this way.

235
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:45,909
Did she go that way?

236
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:55,289
Gosh, what just happened?

237
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:58,589
How could I run into that woman here?

238
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:03,830
That crazy hag. How dare she call me a gold digger?

239
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:07,469
How come nothing works out these days?

240
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,659
Geez Louise.

241
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:16,809
What?

242
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,619
Mom, what is it? Is something going on?

243
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:22,469
No, what is it? What's this about?

244
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:25,600
What?

245
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:27,619
What do you mean by that?

246
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:32,419
Do Ra is refusing to join "Straightforward Romance"?

247
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,349
 Mom, you want me to do at least that? 

248
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:38,269
Don't you care about my sense of pride?

249
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:41,019
Why should I work for less pay than Jeon Ga Yeon?

250
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:43,699
That's not that bad of a pay.

251
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:45,829
It's not bad enough to hurt your pride.

252
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:47,509
And what would you do if you took a break?

253
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:49,419
You need to work hard while they still want you.

254
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:50,979
Mom, what do you mean by, "What would you do if you took a break?”

255
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,869
I can't work under such a term.

256
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:55,599
So don't just get me random stuff.

257
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:59,839
And I don't feel like working for some reason lately.

258
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,719
I'll rest for six months in New York, where Do Jun is, just so you know.

259
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:06,279
What? That long?

260
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:09,219
Are you crazy? That makes no sense.

261
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:12,239
How doesn't it make sense? I'll rest if I want to.

262
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,929
I've saved up a lot of money.

263
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:17,169
Hey, D-Do Ra. Ms. Park Do Ra.

264
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,569
I told the production company and director that you'll do it. So...

265
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:24,689
please try to save my face and do this one—

266
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:27,139
No, I don't want to, I said.

267
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:29,139
I made it clear that I didn't want to.

268
00:17:29,139 --> 00:17:31,359
Hey, Do Ra. Do Ra!

269
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,389
You get forgotten if you take a break for a year these days.

270
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:36,839
What will you do if no one hires you?

271
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:40,970
There will always be pretty and talented ones. You think you'll always be in your 20s?

272
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,779
You think you'll always be an A-list actor, girl?

273
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:49,459
You need to row when there's water. Grasshoppers only last a season, too, you brat.

274
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,969
Is Do Ra refusing to do "Straightforward Romance"?

275
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:55,490
What would happen if she didn't? We'd be in trouble if she didn't.

276
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,449
What would we do if she didn't? What would we do?

277
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:02,740
Oh, no, seriously. Hey, Do Sik, tell her to go do it. Tell her—

278
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,659
- She won't listen to me. 
 - Hey, hey, hey...

279
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:07,659
Gosh, seriously! How could she...

280
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:11,059
- It's so funny. 
  - I'm the greatest beauty of this town. 

281
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:13,439
I'm home.

282
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:17,279
- You're home, Son. Did you have dinner? 
 - I ate a little.

283
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,169
My gosh, my gosh.

284
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:21,539
Hey, I-I-I...

285
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,669
I saw that woman. That woman.

286
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,439
What's wrong, Mom?

287
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,919
W-Who did you see? Who's "that woman"?

288
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,049
Do Ra's mom. That cunning thing.

289
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:33,599
That gold digger.

290
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,810
What did you say? You saw Do Ra's mom? That woman?

291
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,269
Mom, where did you see her?

292
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:42,759
While I was out today,

293
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:46,129
I got a spicy naengmyeon pollock at the department store food court.

294
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:50,629
And I was browsing clothes at the designer shop upstairs to digest.

295
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:55,339
There was a woman dressed in designer clothes from head to toe

296
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:59,169
holding shopping bags in both hands coming out of there.

297
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:06,270
So I was all envious and staring at her, thinking how privileged she was.

298
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:12,030
It turns out that was Do Ra's mom, that cunning woman.

299
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,559
Really?

300
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:19,970
Yes, so I said, "Look who's here. You're Do Ra's mom."

301
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,989
But she said she wasn't, and I was mistaken.

302
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:24,759
And she ran away from me.

303
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:27,529
- She ran away? 
 - Yes, that's right.

304
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:29,739
She ran away because I was right.

305
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:32,259
Why would she run away otherwise?

306
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:38,199
Pil Sung, haven't you seen Do Ra at the broadcasting station?

307
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:41,199
Pardon? W-Why do you ask?

308
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:42,859
What do you mean, why?

309
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:45,499
Do Ra's mom took your grandfather's...

310
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:52,440
She seduced In-law and took 30 million. We need to get that back.

311
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,560
Pil Sung, you can get Park Do Ra's phone number since you work at the broadcasting station, right?

312
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,709
Go find out.

313
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:03,609
You don't have to, Pil Sung.

314
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:07,609
Pretend you don't know her even if you run into her.

315
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:10,189
Pretend he doesn't know? Why?

316
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:14,139
Mother, please stop bringing up that woman.

317
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:17,139
Why do you always have to remind me?

318
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:21,589
Hearing just the word "Do" makes my blood boil.

319
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:25,379
I know. That's why we need to get that money back.

320
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:29,989
Hey, 30 million won was a fortune 15 years ago.

321
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:34,029
If you add the interest, too, it'd be more than 100 million won by now.

322
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:37,749
I don't ever want to get involved with that woman anymore.

323
00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:42,860
And I don't want to ruin my dad's reputation by bringing up the past because of that money.

324
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,149
My gosh, my gosh. Hey, hey.

325
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:50,460
Do you think 100 million is a joke or something?

326
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,929
How could you give up on that much money?

327
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:55,589
We at least need to get the 30 million back. The original principal.

328
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:58,889
She was all dressed up in designer clothes.

329
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:00,769
Don't you find it unfair?

330
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:04,249
Enough is enough, Mom.

331
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:09,520
What do you mean, enough? We need every penny we could get.

332
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,539
Seon Yeong says she doesn't want to.

333
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:13,789
I wouldn't want to, either.

334
00:21:28,477 --> 00:21:31,727
Ma Ri, try this.

335
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:34,397
The tteokgalbi turned out so well today.

336
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:36,437
I know you like this stuff.

337
00:21:36,437 --> 00:21:38,377
No, Dad. Don't tempt me.

338
00:21:38,377 --> 00:21:41,477
I won't get tricked no matter how much you tempt me.

339
00:21:41,477 --> 00:21:45,587
I know you're on a diet, but you need protein.

340
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:48,677
- Just one. Here, here. 
 - I said I can't.

341
00:21:48,677 --> 00:21:50,507
Just leave her alone.

342
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:53,397
She'll learn her lesson when she passes out.

343
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,337
This won't last long.

344
00:21:55,337 --> 00:21:58,880
I would've become an idol, too, if all it takes is to be on a diet.

345
00:21:59,707 --> 00:22:04,327
My gosh, how dare you? Look at her eyes.

346
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:07,637
Ma Ri.

347
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:12,187
 The dummy will always be a dummy. 

348
00:22:12,187 --> 00:22:17,107
I heard Jin Dan is going on a blind date with Jeil Steel's daughter.

349
00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:18,667
Yes.

350
00:22:19,757 --> 00:22:23,667
The chairman of Jeil Steel is a man of character. I hope it works out.

351
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:28,177
It's not easy to get a blind date with their daughter.

352
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:33,237
They said yes because they knew Jin Dan would inherit Angel Investment.

353
00:22:35,627 --> 00:22:38,267
Why isn't Jin Dan coming downstairs?

354
00:22:38,267 --> 00:22:40,187
- Did he come home late? 
 - Huh?

355
00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:43,527
He left early this morning.

356
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:47,797
Grandma is always lying through her teeth. She's a total liar.

357
00:22:47,797 --> 00:22:53,090
Gosh, Ma Ri. How could you say something so awful with your pretty mouth?

358
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,527
Ma Ri, I told you not to talk like that.

359
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:58,817
Uncle didn't come home last night.

360
00:22:58,817 --> 00:23:01,387
Why do you lie he left in the morning?

361
00:23:01,387 --> 00:23:04,200
You just had to say he didn't come home.

362
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,800
I think your mouth is more awful than mine.

363
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,517
W-What?

364
00:23:15,347 --> 00:23:16,867
Cheers.

365
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:29,687
Why do you like me?

366
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:33,657
Just give me three reasons. Not too many.

367
00:23:33,657 --> 00:23:36,037
The reasons I like you?

368
00:23:36,037 --> 00:23:39,687
One. You're handsome.

369
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:42,287
Two. You buy me designer handbags often.

370
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:45,967
Three. You buy me clothes often.

371
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,407
Hey.

372
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:50,807
I like you a lot.

373
00:23:51,977 --> 00:23:56,597
I love people who are honest.

374
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:01,937
 Gong Jin Dan! Gong Jin Dan! 

375
00:24:01,937 --> 00:24:04,727
 Open the door! Open it! 

376
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:07,627
What? W-Who's that?

377
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:10,187
- It's my mom. 
   - Open the door! 

378
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:14,277
 Open the door, I said!  

379
00:24:14,277 --> 00:24:15,647
Mom, you came.

380
00:24:15,647 --> 00:24:19,197
What are you doing here instead of going to work?

381
00:24:19,197 --> 00:24:20,847
Well, the thing is, Mom—

382
00:24:20,847 --> 00:24:22,447
Which girl is it now?

383
00:24:22,447 --> 00:24:25,217
Where is she? Where are you hiding her?

384
00:24:25,217 --> 00:24:27,117
I'm not hiding anyone.

385
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:32,397
I'm on a staycation because I have some things to think through. Isn't this nice? Look.

386
00:24:32,397 --> 00:24:34,377
What's this?

387
00:24:34,377 --> 00:24:37,167
Hey, Gong Jin Dan. Is this what you call a staycation? Huh?

388
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:38,767
You drive me crazy.

389
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:40,637
Who is it this time? Come out right now!

390
00:24:40,637 --> 00:24:43,277
That's not mine. It must belong to the previous guest.

391
00:24:43,277 --> 00:24:44,927
I swear I came here alone. So you should wait in the lobby.

392
00:24:44,927 --> 00:24:47,337
So you should wait in the lobby.

393
00:24:47,337 --> 00:24:49,777
I'll get changed and come down right away. Okay?

394
00:24:49,777 --> 00:24:51,657
Mom. Gosh, Mom.

395
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:56,517
The makeup turned out great today. So pretty. Aigoo.

396
00:24:56,517 --> 00:24:58,807
My gosh!

397
00:25:03,227 --> 00:25:06,287
Hello, Ma'am.

398
00:25:14,937 --> 00:25:20,197
You have a blind date today. What are you doing in broad daylight with a lowly girl like her?

399
00:25:20,197 --> 00:25:23,047
I said I won't go on blind dates!

400
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:25,637
I hate stuff like that.

401
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:27,937
I seek NEs. NEs.

402
00:25:27,937 --> 00:25:30,737
NEs? What's that?

403
00:25:32,507 --> 00:25:35,397
I seek natural encounters.

404
00:25:35,397 --> 00:25:37,457
I seek encounters that were meant to be.

405
00:25:37,457 --> 00:25:39,697
NEs, my foot.

406
00:25:39,697 --> 00:25:42,087
When will you get your act together?

407
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:44,357
You think your brother doesn't know you're doing this?

408
00:25:44,357 --> 00:25:48,267
That's why he's not giving you Angel Investment. Because you're acting like this.

409
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:50,187
So what do you want me to do?

410
00:25:50,187 --> 00:25:53,097
I can't help myself, either.

411
00:25:53,897 --> 00:25:56,397
How could you do this to me?

412
00:25:56,397 --> 00:25:59,707
I've been living only for you all my life.

413
00:26:00,507 --> 00:26:06,447
When I was 21, just a young thing, I met your father, who was much older,

414
00:26:06,447 --> 00:26:09,527
and I was called all sorts of names.

415
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:13,097
I've been enduring humiliation all this time...

416
00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:22,587
Don't you pity me at all?

417
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:32,997
Okay, okay.

418
00:26:32,997 --> 00:26:35,987
Stop talking about when you were 21.

419
00:26:36,987 --> 00:26:38,757
I'll go on the blind date.

420
00:26:38,757 --> 00:26:41,307
I'll go, okay?

421
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:43,137
You mean it, right?

422
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:45,017
I said I'll go.

423
00:26:47,347 --> 00:26:51,897
Jin Dan, it was really difficult to arrange the blind date today.

424
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:56,647
If you marry the daughter of Jeil Steel, your brother will think of you differently, too.

425
00:26:56,647 --> 00:27:01,847
If you have dependable in-laws, he won't be able to look down on you, either.

426
00:27:01,847 --> 00:27:03,567
You know what I mean, right?

427
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:07,317
Okay, Mother. That's enough.

428
00:27:07,317 --> 00:27:11,147
Okay, Son. I made a hair appointment for you. Get ready.

429
00:27:11,147 --> 00:27:13,327
You can't be late.

430
00:27:37,687 --> 00:27:39,817
I'm sorry.

431
00:27:44,877 --> 00:27:46,827
I'm sorry, I didn't see you because I was looking at my phone.

432
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:50,227
It's okay. I was looking at my phone, too.

433
00:27:51,517 --> 00:27:53,937
I think I've seen you somewhere.

434
00:27:53,937 --> 00:27:57,917
Are you the Park Do Ra, by chance?

435
00:27:58,597 --> 00:28:01,457
Yes, I'm that Park Do Ra.

436
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:03,487
Thank you.

437
00:28:06,747 --> 00:28:08,567
Watch out!

438
00:28:13,847 --> 00:28:16,037
My goodness.

439
00:28:16,037 --> 00:28:17,857
Are you okay?

440
00:28:18,757 --> 00:28:22,307
Yes, I'm okay.

441
00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:25,747
What are you doing over there?

442
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:27,407
You almost hurt someone.

443
00:28:27,407 --> 00:28:30,107
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

444
00:28:30,107 --> 00:28:33,317
You almost got injured trying to save me.

445
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:34,957
Are you okay? You must be scared.

446
00:28:34,957 --> 00:28:37,117
No, I'm okay.

447
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:39,537
I'm glad you didn't get hurt.

448
00:28:39,537 --> 00:28:41,027
Well, then...

449
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:44,277
Excuse me.

450
00:28:46,027 --> 00:28:48,497
You saved my life.

451
00:28:50,257 --> 00:28:54,837
Could you give me your phone number? I'd like to treat you to a meal or something.

452
00:28:54,837 --> 00:28:58,347
Save your life? Not at all.

453
00:28:58,347 --> 00:29:01,887
It's okay. Well, then...

454
00:29:01,887 --> 00:29:03,457
Wait...

455
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:10,147
Is this a dream or reality?

456
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:11,777
Wow.

457
00:29:11,777 --> 00:29:13,807
   

458
00:29:19,277 --> 00:29:21,387
   

459
00:29:23,097 --> 00:29:27,287
   

460
00:29:38,087 --> 00:29:40,997
 Hey, Gong Jin Dan. Did you really reject Jeil Steel's daughter? 

461
00:29:40,997 --> 00:29:43,297
 You crazy bastard. Do you want to see me die? 

462
00:29:43,297 --> 00:29:46,177
 It was so difficult to arrange that date. How dare you reject her? 

463
00:29:46,177 --> 00:29:47,667
   

464
00:29:53,507 --> 00:29:57,157
Are you sure Park Do Ra isn't seeing anyone?

465
00:29:57,157 --> 00:29:58,897
Yes, I think so.

466
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,217
Should I find out more about Park Do Ra?

467
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:04,187
No, this is enough. You can leave.

468
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:05,677
Okay.

469
00:30:13,287 --> 00:30:15,427
Hold on, Secretary Jo.

470
00:30:16,287 --> 00:30:19,117
Why did we decide not to invest in this?

471
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,867
Pardon? Which one?

472
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:24,870
This one. "Straightforward Romance," the series Park Do Ra was cast in.

473
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:28,677
Oh, you're the one who rejected it.

474
00:30:28,677 --> 00:30:30,667
You said we shouldn't invest in something so small.

475
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:32,207
Did I?

476
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:36,257
Why would I say that?

477
00:30:36,257 --> 00:30:40,950
Don't you know the content industry is one of the most promising industries right now?

478
00:30:41,547 --> 00:30:43,057
I need to invest in this.

479
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:46,867
- Pardon? 
 - I think this drama will be a total hit.

480
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:48,857
I want to invest in it immediately.

481
00:30:48,857 --> 00:30:51,257
Schedule a meeting with the CEO of the production company right now.

482
00:30:51,257 --> 00:30:53,647
Okay, I will.

483
00:31:01,237 --> 00:31:04,097
 Yes, I'm that Park Do Ra. 

484
00:31:07,137 --> 00:31:09,067
My heart is fluttering.

485
00:31:10,657 --> 00:31:13,347
What's with Park Do Ra?

486
00:31:13,347 --> 00:31:15,977
She makes me feel dizzy...

487
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:18,147
and makes my heart flutter.

488
00:31:20,617 --> 00:31:23,747
Do I really have a crush on her?

489
00:31:27,937 --> 00:31:32,427
Have you thought about how to bring Park Do Ra back?

490
00:31:34,897 --> 00:31:37,127
Well, Sunbae...

491
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:41,377
Yes, Pil Sung. Tell me. Do you have a good idea?

492
00:31:42,177 --> 00:31:45,187
I tried contacting Bi Bi.

493
00:31:45,187 --> 00:31:48,107
She said she'd do it with the current pay.

494
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:53,227
Hey, man, I said come up with an idea to bring Park Do Ra back. Why change the subject?

495
00:31:53,227 --> 00:31:57,217
Sunbae, aside from everything else,

496
00:31:57,217 --> 00:32:00,147
I think obsessing over an actor who doesn't want the role isn't right.

497
00:32:00,147 --> 00:32:03,717
Even if one obsessed over our drama, she might not get it.

498
00:32:03,717 --> 00:32:07,287
The viewers can tell right away if they sincerely want the role,

499
00:32:07,287 --> 00:32:10,527
or they were forced to do it because of money.

500
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:14,837
Remember what she said yesterday? She eventually talked about money.

501
00:32:14,837 --> 00:32:18,287
I did some research. Apparently, she's money crazy.

502
00:32:18,287 --> 00:32:21,837
Everyone says she only cares about money.

503
00:32:21,837 --> 00:32:24,007
- Really? 
 - Yes.

504
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:26,217
And do you know what her nickname is?

505
00:32:26,217 --> 00:32:28,737
Bbakdora. Bbakdora.
  (T/N: means enraging) 

506
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:34,227
How much did she enrage people on set that they call her that?

507
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:39,057
Sunbae, let's just go with Bi Bi.

508
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:43,667
Park Do Ra is too skinny and unattractive. I really dislike her.

509
00:32:46,487 --> 00:32:48,097
Hey, Go Pil Sung!

510
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:49,277
- Pil Sung.
 - Salut.

511
00:32:49,277 --> 00:32:51,887
- Oh, Station Director.
 - Director Hong was here, too.

512
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,937
What brings you here, Station Director?

513
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:56,397
Where's Park Do Ra? Isn't she here yet?

514
00:32:56,397 --> 00:32:58,527
Pardon? P-Park Do Ra?

515
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:01,217
Yes, I'm supposed to meet her here.

516
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:08,017
Do Ra, you were already here.

517
00:33:10,517 --> 00:33:12,097
You came.

518
00:33:14,887 --> 00:33:18,437
By the way, what's wrong with the vibe here?

519
00:33:24,347 --> 00:33:26,267
- Station Director. 
 - Huh?

520
00:33:26,267 --> 00:33:28,517
I really wanted to take a break for a while,

521
00:33:28,517 --> 00:33:34,107
but since you, who started my career, asked me,

522
00:33:34,107 --> 00:33:37,977
I decided to join "Straightforward Romance" and be loyal to you.

523
00:33:37,977 --> 00:33:39,687
Yes, yes.

524
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:43,217
By the way, Station Director, I'm sorry.

525
00:33:43,217 --> 00:33:44,867
About what?

526
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:50,807
I can't work with people who don't trust me?

527
00:33:50,807 --> 00:33:52,597
Trust?

528
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,727
What trust?

529
00:33:54,727 --> 00:33:58,147
What's this about, anyway?

530
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:00,957
Excuse me.

531
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:07,587
Curly haired assistant director.

532
00:34:08,697 --> 00:34:12,027
Yes, I'm unattractive because I'm skinny.

533
00:34:12,027 --> 00:34:16,327
And my nickname is indeed Bbakdora because I have a horrible temper.

534
00:34:16,327 --> 00:34:18,457
And I...

535
00:34:21,897 --> 00:34:25,017
I'm really obsessed with money.

536
00:34:30,957 --> 00:34:36,287
So why don't you work with Bi Bi, who's not money-obsessed?

537
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:38,207
Good luck.

538
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:40,727
I'll get going now.

539
00:34:43,077 --> 00:34:44,637
Do Ra?

540
00:34:45,307 --> 00:34:47,737
Ms. Park. Seriously...

541
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:50,457
Ms. Park! Ms. Park Do Ra!

542
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:56,867
Geez, seriously!

543
00:34:57,797 --> 00:35:03,947
Hey, I might not have kneeled in front of her, but I begged her so much.

544
00:35:03,947 --> 00:35:06,607
I called her countless times to calm her down and persuade her.

545
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:10,457
I barely persuaded her using the fact we go way back.

546
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:14,747
Go Pil Sung. How dare you ruin that?

547
00:35:14,747 --> 00:35:16,557
What will you do now? Seriously...

548
00:35:16,557 --> 00:35:19,447
- Station Director, calm down. 
 - Let go of me!

549
00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:23,417
We just decided to go with Bi Bi. Calm down.

550
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:25,867
What? Bi Bi?

551
00:35:27,037 --> 00:35:30,097
- D-Did she agree to do it? 
 - Yes, yes, yes. She wants to join us.

552
00:35:30,097 --> 00:35:33,627
She agreed to get paid less than Park Do Ra, too.

553
00:35:33,627 --> 00:35:36,907
Really? Hold on. Hold on.

554
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:39,077
The chemistry between the leads is important, too,

555
00:35:39,077 --> 00:35:43,837
but Bi Bi is close to Cha Bong Soo. She's not a bad option.

556
00:35:45,217 --> 00:35:47,317
Geez.

557
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,967
I'm sorry, Sunbae...

558
00:35:58,207 --> 00:36:00,067
It's okay.

559
00:36:01,087 --> 00:36:03,487
What else can we do, right?

560
00:36:03,487 --> 00:36:05,210
It's okay.

561
00:36:05,787 --> 00:36:08,007
It's okay!

562
00:36:10,717 --> 00:36:12,807
I'm not okay!

563
00:36:14,587 --> 00:36:17,867
Why didn't Ae Gyo come today?

564
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:20,587
Something must be going on.

565
00:36:20,587 --> 00:36:22,957
Like what? Didn't she tell you?

566
00:36:22,957 --> 00:36:26,287
We live in the same house, but we don't see each other often.

567
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:27,837
I suppose that's for the better.

568
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:29,647
Soo Yeon, you're basically Buddha.

569
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:33,287
You tolerate her for all of her behavior.

570
00:36:34,227 --> 00:36:36,967
Right, is your son, Pil Sung, still busy these days?

571
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:41,057
Yes. He just finished the daily series,

572
00:36:41,057 --> 00:36:45,957
but another team snatched him right up again.

573
00:36:45,957 --> 00:36:50,497
Goodness. Can't the broadcasting station not operate without my son?

574
00:36:50,497 --> 00:36:53,827
I never get to see him since he's so busy with work.

575
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:56,157
He must be so competent.

576
00:36:56,157 --> 00:36:58,237
He's blessed with work.

577
00:36:58,237 --> 00:37:04,297
I heard even TV producers get paid over 100 million for a contract these days.

578
00:37:04,297 --> 00:37:06,427
Yes, I guess so.

579
00:37:06,427 --> 00:37:10,327
But he's still starting out as a producer. He has a long way to go.

580
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:12,987
He needs to get more experience.

581
00:37:12,987 --> 00:37:16,657
Your son must be really popular among women.

582
00:37:16,657 --> 00:37:19,957
There must be tons of pretty women at the broadcasting station.

583
00:37:19,957 --> 00:37:22,107
By the way, tell her to be careful of women.

584
00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:24,697
There are so many weird ones out there these days.

585
00:37:24,697 --> 00:37:27,317
I know. I'm worried about that, too.

586
00:37:27,317 --> 00:37:29,827
You know how handsome my Pil Sung is.

587
00:37:29,827 --> 00:37:34,507
Gosh, you're bragging again. You're so unbelievable.

588
00:37:34,507 --> 00:37:38,177
Seon Yeong, your son secured a good job now.

589
00:37:38,177 --> 00:37:40,597
My cousin's daughter is a bank teller.

590
00:37:40,597 --> 00:37:42,567
Should we set them up?

591
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:44,437
She's a bank teller?

592
00:37:44,437 --> 00:37:46,267
Sounds good.

593
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:55,647
You don't want me to set up dates for Pil Sung?

594
00:37:56,997 --> 00:38:01,147
A bank teller isn't so bad. Why do you say that?

595
00:38:01,147 --> 00:38:06,527
Isn't it too soon to arrange dates and plan for his marriage?

596
00:38:06,527 --> 00:38:11,687
He can meet plenty of better ladies once he builds his career and becomes a head producer.

597
00:38:11,687 --> 00:38:15,967
I'll set him up with someone from a better family, then.

598
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:20,007
- Really? 
 - Of course. He's your son.

599
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:24,477
And I've seen him since he was a kid.

600
00:38:24,477 --> 00:38:27,017
I want him to marry into a good family.

601
00:38:27,017 --> 00:38:29,827
Gosh, Soo Yeon.

602
00:38:29,827 --> 00:38:32,997
So tell him not to just date anyone.

603
00:38:32,997 --> 00:38:36,797
Okay. You promised me, okay?

604
00:38:38,227 --> 00:38:40,157
Okay, cheers.

605
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:42,367
Cheers.

606
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:44,307
Thank you.

607
00:38:47,877 --> 00:38:50,357
Director, thank you so much.

608
00:38:50,357 --> 00:38:52,897
I'll work as hard as I can.

609
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:58,097
I really love this role, and I'm confident I can do it.

610
00:38:59,097 --> 00:39:00,547
We should be thanking you.

611
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:03,147
You said yes as soon as we suggested.

612
00:39:03,147 --> 00:39:04,737
What's there to even think about?

613
00:39:04,737 --> 00:39:08,767
I loved the script, and the male lead is Cha Bong Soo.

614
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:13,097
And you're the one who's directing. How much more can I ask for?

615
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:15,297
I'll contact the production company, then.

616
00:39:15,297 --> 00:39:18,637
Okay. Tell them I'll sign immediately—

617
00:39:19,577 --> 00:39:23,317
Gosh, President Kim is unbelievable.

618
00:39:23,317 --> 00:39:26,997
Yes, President Kim, I was just talking to Bi Bi—

619
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:30,047
What did you say?

620
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:42,047
Just one second.

621
00:39:51,927 --> 00:39:53,967
Sunbae.

622
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:56,487
Sunbae, what's going on?

623
00:40:02,237 --> 00:40:05,397
Hyung, what's going on?

624
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:10,637
- Yes, Station Director. 
  - Hey, Go Pil Sung. 

625
00:40:10,637 --> 00:40:12,987
 You'd better come up here right now. 

626
00:40:12,987 --> 00:40:14,797
Pardon?

627
00:40:14,797 --> 00:40:16,497
Right now?

628
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:21,467
Sit, sit.

629
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:23,627
It's okay. Sit.

630
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:33,177
Pil Sung, what do we do?

631
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:37,707
"Straightforward Romance" is about to get canceled because of you.

632
00:40:37,707 --> 00:40:43,567
The new main investment company said they'll back out if it's not Park Do Ra.

633
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:49,517
There's the existing investment company, too. We can figure things out—

634
00:40:49,517 --> 00:40:51,997
Figure things out?

635
00:40:51,997 --> 00:40:54,557
Will you supply the production budget

636
00:40:54,557 --> 00:40:57,317
Since the new main investment company is backing out,

637
00:40:57,317 --> 00:41:01,177
the existing ones are threatening to back out, too.

638
00:41:01,177 --> 00:41:06,547
The drama is about to fail without Park Do Ra.

639
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:10,067
Hey. We don't even have another drama as a backup.

640
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,977
What do we do?

641
00:41:12,787 --> 00:41:15,547
I'll get Park Do Ra back no matter what it takes!

642
00:41:15,547 --> 00:41:17,357
Yes!

643
00:41:17,357 --> 00:41:19,987
You'd better clean up your own shit!

644
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:25,497
I'll go to Park Do Ra's management company since I can't reach her manager.

645
00:41:25,497 --> 00:41:28,047
Please find out her home address.

646
00:41:28,047 --> 00:41:31,017
Mr. Go, she's leaving for the U.S. right now.

647
00:41:31,017 --> 00:41:32,987
Pardon?

648
00:41:32,987 --> 00:41:35,237
T-The U.S.? What for?

649
00:41:35,237 --> 00:41:37,817
I called a manager who's close to Park Do Ra's manager.

650
00:41:37,817 --> 00:41:40,197
She's going to New York on a 7 p.m. flight tonight.

651
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:44,267
So her manager is taking her to Incheon Airport right now. What should we do?

652
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:46,750
   

653
00:41:50,337 --> 00:41:52,607
You've got to be kidding.

654
00:41:56,697 --> 00:42:00,147
This is nuts. I'm going to lose it.

655
00:42:00,147 --> 00:42:02,737
Why is there so much traffic?

656
00:42:06,647 --> 00:42:09,937
Excuse me, sir! Sir! Hold on, sir!

657
00:42:15,797 --> 00:42:19,757
Sir, please hurry up a bit.

658
00:42:21,967 --> 00:42:24,307
Thank you so much!

659
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,527
   

660
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:37,957
 The call is not going through. 

661
00:42:37,957 --> 00:42:41,137
 - You'll be connected to the voicemail.  
 - What do I do now?

662
00:42:41,137 --> 00:42:43,297
Do Ra.

663
00:42:43,297 --> 00:42:45,897
Park Do Ra, where are you?

664
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,187
Did she go in, by chance?

665
00:42:50,517 --> 00:42:52,357
Park Do Ra!

666
00:42:56,017 --> 00:42:57,817
Ms. Park Do Ra!

667
00:43:03,127 --> 00:43:05,137
Did you...

668
00:43:05,137 --> 00:43:08,657
Did you just call me "Park Do Ra"? By my name?

669
00:43:08,657 --> 00:43:13,167
I-I'm sorry. It just came out because I was so rushed.

670
00:43:13,167 --> 00:43:17,547
Ms. Park Do Ra, I'm so sorry. I must've been out of my mind.

671
00:43:17,547 --> 00:43:22,617
I sincerely apologize for saying weird things about you.

672
00:43:26,157 --> 00:43:29,997
Did you come all the way here to apologize for that?

673
00:43:29,997 --> 00:43:34,307
I wasn't trying to slander you with a malicious intention.

674
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:37,697
You said you've been working nonstop for 15 years.

675
00:43:37,697 --> 00:43:39,687
I felt so bad and wanted to let you take a break—

676
00:43:39,687 --> 00:43:43,317
Excuse me, curly-haired assistant director.

677
00:43:43,317 --> 00:43:46,877
Do you think that makes sense right now?

678
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:49,377
Because you felt bad for me, you called me "Bbakdora"

679
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:53,857
and money-obsessed behind my back, too?

680
00:43:53,857 --> 00:43:55,617
Pardon?

681
00:43:57,087 --> 00:44:00,987
Ms. Park, I apologize for everything.

682
00:44:00,987 --> 00:44:05,697
You can swear at me and hit me, but...

683
00:44:06,597 --> 00:44:11,387
please work on our drama, "Straightforward Romance."

684
00:44:11,387 --> 00:44:13,737
If you agree to take the role,

685
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:17,517
I'll do anything you want me to do.

686
00:44:17,517 --> 00:44:19,087
No, thank you.

687
00:44:19,087 --> 00:44:21,057
- Ms. Park. 
 - My gosh.

688
00:44:21,057 --> 00:44:23,617
- My gosh, how dare you touch me? 
 - Let go.

689
00:44:29,727 --> 00:44:31,977
If you leave like this,

690
00:44:32,637 --> 00:44:34,627
I'll get fired.

691
00:44:36,067 --> 00:44:40,837
Think of this as you saving my life. I beg you.

692
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:46,507
What's wrong with him?

693
00:44:52,267 --> 00:44:54,027
Yes, Mom.

694
00:44:56,547 --> 00:44:57,997
What?

695
00:44:58,867 --> 00:45:01,397
You signed the contract for "Straightforward Romance"?

696
00:45:02,387 --> 00:45:05,217
Why do you think you could do that for me?

697
00:45:05,217 --> 00:45:07,867
What's wrong with you, Mom?

698
00:45:10,447 --> 00:45:13,427
What? A blank check?

699
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,597
Really?

700
00:45:22,057 --> 00:45:25,757
They will really pay me whatever I want?

701
00:45:32,717 --> 00:45:36,147
Okay. Okay, I'm coming.

702
00:45:36,147 --> 00:45:38,917
I'm on my way. Hang up.

703
00:45:42,137 --> 00:45:44,027
Let's go back.

704
00:45:44,947 --> 00:45:47,547
- Go back? 
 - Yes.

705
00:45:59,127 --> 00:46:00,987
Ms. Park,

706
00:46:02,047 --> 00:46:07,447
thank you so much for deciding to join "Straightforward Romance."

707
00:46:10,697 --> 00:46:12,547
Excuse me.

708
00:46:16,987 --> 00:46:21,637
You'd better not let me see you going forward. Got that?

709
00:46:48,867 --> 00:46:51,737
Crazy bastard. Rotten bastard.

710
00:46:51,737 --> 00:46:54,637
He'd never find someone like the daughter of Jeil Steel.

711
00:46:54,637 --> 00:46:56,577
How dare he squander an opportunity like that?

712
00:46:56,577 --> 00:47:00,117
What a bastard. I won't just let this slide.

713
00:47:07,237 --> 00:47:10,807
What? Isn't that Ma Ri?

714
00:47:11,927 --> 00:47:14,527
My gosh, she's 26 years old.

715
00:47:14,527 --> 00:47:18,027
What's she doing with elementary schoolers?

716
00:47:19,037 --> 00:47:21,357
Hey, Gong Ma Ri!

717
00:47:23,497 --> 00:47:26,757
What are you doing with the elementary schoolers right now?

718
00:47:26,757 --> 00:47:29,837
We're on our way to a karaoke. Why?

719
00:47:29,837 --> 00:47:33,477
You're going to a karaoke with these little kids?

720
00:47:33,477 --> 00:47:37,587
Are you taking money from Ma Ri because she's slow?

721
00:47:37,587 --> 00:47:41,097
Grandma, what are you accusing my friends of?

722
00:47:41,097 --> 00:47:43,357
We're going Dutch, okay?

723
00:47:43,357 --> 00:47:44,857
Is she your grandma?

724
00:47:44,857 --> 00:47:47,747
- Apparently. 
 - Yes, she is.

725
00:47:47,747 --> 00:47:49,977
I'm not her grandma. I'm her aunt.

726
00:47:49,977 --> 00:47:51,957
I told you not to call me that.

727
00:47:51,957 --> 00:47:55,287
What? You yelled at me for not calling you that before.

728
00:47:55,287 --> 00:47:59,607
Ma Ri, is she your grandma or aunt?

729
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:02,467
To be honest,

730
00:48:03,277 --> 00:48:06,207
she was my grandpa's mistress. A concubine.

731
00:48:06,207 --> 00:48:07,357
Mistress? Concubine?

732
00:48:07,357 --> 00:48:10,917
But she was my mom's high school classmate.

733
00:48:10,917 --> 00:48:13,997
So I keep switching between Grandma and Aunt. I don't know, either.

734
00:48:13,997 --> 00:48:18,497
Hey, you little brat. What did you just say?

735
00:48:20,447 --> 00:48:22,247
- Stop, Grandma! 
 - Ahjumma!

736
00:48:22,247 --> 00:48:24,180
Auntie! Auntie!

737
00:48:24,807 --> 00:48:27,897
Mom! Dad! Mom!

738
00:48:27,897 --> 00:48:30,627
Ma Ri, what's wrong? What is it?

739
00:48:30,627 --> 00:48:33,077
What happened? Who did this to you?

740
00:48:33,637 --> 00:48:37,207
Ma Ri, what's going on?

741
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,477
Uncle Jin Dan's mom...

742
00:48:39,477 --> 00:48:41,917
Grandma Ae Gyo...

743
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:45,947
grabbed me by my hair in front of my friends.

744
00:48:45,947 --> 00:48:48,577
- What? 
 - I lost a clump of hair.

745
00:48:48,577 --> 00:48:52,357
She pinched and hit me, too.

746
00:48:54,677 --> 00:48:56,627
Is that true?

747
00:48:56,627 --> 00:49:00,107
Did you really grab her by the hair, pinch, and hit her?

748
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:02,997
Yes, I did that.

749
00:49:02,997 --> 00:49:09,487
She told elementary schoolers that I was her grandpa's mistress and concubine. That's why I did that.

750
00:49:09,487 --> 00:49:12,187
Was I supposed to stand back when she said that?

751
00:49:12,187 --> 00:49:17,137
What? Ma Ri, did you really say that?

752
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:20,717
Yes. She was grandpa's mistress and concubine.

753
00:49:20,717 --> 00:49:23,317
That's the truth.

754
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:26,337
Listen to her.

755
00:49:26,337 --> 00:49:31,337
Because you two look down on me, even this girl, Ma Ri, is calling me that.

756
00:49:31,337 --> 00:49:34,167
- Hong Ae Gyo. 
 - What?

757
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:36,807
How dare you call my name right now?

758
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:41,867
Yes, I was your father's mistress and concubine. You should call me "Mother," then.

759
00:49:41,867 --> 00:49:45,707
How dare you call me by my name? You backward son of a bitch.

760
00:49:45,707 --> 00:49:50,087
Try treating me like this again. I swear I won't tolerate it.

761
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:16,187
Mom, what if I get kicked out?

762
00:50:16,187 --> 00:50:18,837
 Aigoo, you brat. 

763
00:50:18,837 --> 00:50:23,107
 That's why you shouldn't have blabbered your mouth like that. 

764
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:28,707
Ma Ri, that brat called me a mistress and a concubine in public.

765
00:50:28,707 --> 00:50:30,907
Was I supposed to do nothing?

766
00:50:30,907 --> 00:50:35,397
Everyone looks down on me for being a mistress and a concubine. Everyone.

767
00:50:35,397 --> 00:50:39,257
 Aigoo, you brat. Do you blame them for calling you a mistress? 

768
00:50:39,257 --> 00:50:41,397
 It's true, though. What will you do about it? 

769
00:50:41,397 --> 00:50:43,517
 That's how you've lived. 

770
00:50:43,517 --> 00:50:47,617
 Will that fact ever change? You stupid brat. 

771
00:50:47,617 --> 00:50:51,377
Must you say that to me even in death?

772
00:50:51,377 --> 00:50:55,327
Can't you be the only one on my side?

773
00:51:11,677 --> 00:51:15,717
Honey, what's wrong?

774
00:51:21,757 --> 00:51:23,627
What if...

775
00:51:25,427 --> 00:51:29,167
Ma Ri's like this her whole life? Her whole life...

776
00:51:29,167 --> 00:51:32,277
Look at her photos.

777
00:51:32,277 --> 00:51:34,567
She hangs out with elementary schoolers.

778
00:51:34,567 --> 00:51:37,507
She can't hang out with friends her age.

779
00:51:39,237 --> 00:51:42,007
It's not like we can stop her, either.

780
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,297
What do we do with Ma Ri, Honey?

781
00:51:47,987 --> 00:51:50,467
It's okay.

782
00:51:50,467 --> 00:51:53,067
What's wrong with hanging out with younger kids?

783
00:51:53,067 --> 00:51:56,607
People become friends regardless of age in other countries.

784
00:51:58,017 --> 00:52:05,267
Our Ma Ri is so pure-hearted that she's friends with little kids.

785
00:52:05,267 --> 00:52:07,717
There's nothing wrong with that.

786
00:52:08,487 --> 00:52:11,047
So don't worry, okay?

787
00:52:11,047 --> 00:52:13,337
How could I not worry?

788
00:52:13,337 --> 00:52:15,777
This isn't a foreign country.

789
00:52:17,177 --> 00:52:22,247
Honey, whether she befriends elementary schoolers or high schoolers,

790
00:52:22,247 --> 00:52:27,197
I'm happy as long as she has friends.

791
00:52:28,097 --> 00:52:30,867
She just needs to be healthy and happy.

792
00:52:30,867 --> 00:52:32,957
What more can we ask for?

793
00:52:34,247 --> 00:52:35,837
Honey...

794
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:44,357
I prayed in front of the OR that day.

795
00:52:44,357 --> 00:52:47,047
I asked God to just let her live.

796
00:52:47,047 --> 00:52:49,907
I said I wouldn't ask for anything else.

797
00:52:50,677 --> 00:52:52,230
Honey,

798
00:52:52,897 --> 00:52:55,997
I still feel the same way now.

799
00:52:56,587 --> 00:53:01,977
I'm so grateful she's alive and well in front of us.

800
00:53:02,777 --> 00:53:04,417
Let's...

801
00:53:05,417 --> 00:53:08,147
not ask for more.

802
00:53:21,847 --> 00:53:23,877
They look good.

803
00:53:25,257 --> 00:53:27,377
With her. Like this.

804
00:53:36,067 --> 00:53:38,697
Do Ra, my sweet daughter.

805
00:53:38,697 --> 00:53:40,977
I knew you'd do this. I knew it.

806
00:53:40,977 --> 00:53:42,977
Mom, this is the last time, okay?

807
00:53:42,977 --> 00:53:45,617
Don't sign contracts for me from now on, okay?

808
00:53:45,617 --> 00:53:48,837
Okay, okay.

809
00:53:48,837 --> 00:53:51,457
Gosh, have a seat. Have a seat, Do Ra.

810
00:53:51,457 --> 00:53:54,587
I'm tired. What are you trying to tell me now?

811
00:53:54,587 --> 00:53:59,357
Do Ra, the new investment company, is called Angel.

812
00:53:59,357 --> 00:54:01,467
Do you know the CEO there, by chance?

813
00:54:01,467 --> 00:54:04,397
No, I don't. Why?

814
00:54:04,397 --> 00:54:08,397
Angel Investment is investing in "Straightforward Romance."

815
00:54:08,397 --> 00:54:10,247
But they said it had to be you.

816
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,807
That they'd back out if you didn't do it.

817
00:54:11,807 --> 00:54:17,187
And they told the production company to pay you as much as you want.

818
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:19,097
Really? Is that true?

819
00:54:19,097 --> 00:54:22,167
Yes. My goodness.

820
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:25,677
They must be investing in you because they recognize your true value.

821
00:54:25,677 --> 00:54:30,497
I suppose no one's as pretty and good at acting as you.

822
00:54:30,497 --> 00:54:32,967
Not anyone can play the lead.

823
00:54:32,967 --> 00:54:36,667
Mom, once we pay off the loan for the Cheongdam-dong building with the pay,

824
00:54:36,667 --> 00:54:39,387
why don't we buy another building?

825
00:54:39,387 --> 00:54:41,447
Should we buy one near Hongdae this time?

826
00:54:41,447 --> 00:54:43,267
Huh?

827
00:54:43,267 --> 00:54:47,737
Yes, let's do that. I'll look into it.

828
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:54,770
   

829
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:59,017
   

830
00:54:59,017 --> 00:55:00,947
Go Pil Sung.

831
00:55:02,497 --> 00:55:04,007
You're the best, Go Pil Sung.

832
00:55:04,007 --> 00:55:07,637
Hey, I knew you'd bring Park Do Ra back.

833
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,707
Wow. You even went to the airport to stop her.

834
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:15,487
You're definitely the man of his word, Pil Sung.

835
00:55:15,487 --> 00:55:19,457
She changed her mind because the new investment company

836
00:55:19,457 --> 00:55:23,157
promised to raise her pay significantly, not because of me.

837
00:55:23,157 --> 00:55:27,347
But it happened because you went all the way there.

838
00:55:28,387 --> 00:55:30,957
Good job. Well done.

839
00:55:32,177 --> 00:55:33,627
- Station Director... 
 - Yes.

840
00:55:33,627 --> 00:55:35,597
Can I switch to a different team?

841
00:55:35,597 --> 00:55:38,867
Any team but "Straightforward Romance" team.

842
00:55:38,867 --> 00:55:40,357
Hey.

843
00:55:41,677 --> 00:55:45,287
Are you saying that because I yelled at you earlier?

844
00:55:45,287 --> 00:55:48,207
All sorts of things happen in a broadcasting station.

845
00:55:48,207 --> 00:55:54,787
Hey. What you're going through now isn't serious.

846
00:55:54,787 --> 00:55:56,507
Okay, I'm sorry.

847
00:55:56,507 --> 00:56:02,007
Let's have a drink, put it behind us, and work hard on "Straightforward Romance."

848
00:56:02,007 --> 00:56:04,667
I'll be keeping my eyes on you.

849
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:07,457
Two-part series, okay?

850
00:56:08,227 --> 00:56:09,667
Fighting.

851
00:56:13,247 --> 00:56:15,967
Seriously, this is nuts.

852
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:19,297
I'll be running into her the entire time we shoot.

853
00:56:19,297 --> 00:56:21,587
What do I do now?

854
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:24,817
No, no, no.

855
00:56:24,817 --> 00:56:27,287
She doesn't recognize me, anyway.

856
00:56:28,067 --> 00:56:30,367
I need to sit through it just once.

857
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:32,237
Just once.

858
00:56:34,177 --> 00:56:36,987
 Unni, the ends of your hair got so damaged. 

859
00:56:36,987 --> 00:56:40,107
- Really? 
 - I think we need to trim it a bit.

860
00:56:40,107 --> 00:56:42,547
But I'm starting a drama.

861
00:56:42,547 --> 00:56:46,187
I'll treat the hair and scalp, too, then.

862
00:56:46,187 --> 00:56:47,927
Sounds good.

863
00:57:12,217 --> 00:57:14,457
Hey, Jo Bi Bi.

864
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:18,447
What are you doing right now?

865
00:57:18,447 --> 00:57:20,127
You bitch.

866
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:23,067
You took the role because you knew I wanted to do "Straightforward Romance," right?

867
00:57:23,067 --> 00:57:27,287
You took "Passionate Girl" last time. You're taking my role again?

868
00:57:34,887 --> 00:57:37,027
I can't believe this.

869
00:57:38,837 --> 00:57:41,227
Hey, Jo Bi Bi.

870
00:57:41,227 --> 00:57:44,257
You think I'm desperate enough to steal your role?

871
00:57:44,257 --> 00:57:48,547
I kept saying no to "Straightforward Romance" because I wanted to rest a bit.

872
00:57:48,547 --> 00:57:52,197
But they kept insisting it had to be me.

873
00:57:52,197 --> 00:57:54,537
The production company, investment company, and broadcasting station begged me. So I had to say yes.

874
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:56,987
The production company, investment company, and broadcasting station begged me. So I had to say yes.

875
00:57:56,987 --> 00:57:59,497
Did you even know that?

876
00:57:59,497 --> 00:58:01,547
W-What did you say?

877
00:58:01,547 --> 00:58:05,417
Why did they suggest the role to me, then? I even had a meeting with the director!

878
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:08,237
How do I know why he had a meeting with you?

879
00:58:08,237 --> 00:58:12,237
He must've met you as a backup because I kept saying no.

880
00:58:12,237 --> 00:58:13,937
W-What did you say?

881
00:58:13,937 --> 00:58:16,077
And "Passionate Girl..."

882
00:58:17,477 --> 00:58:21,927
The writer wrote that role specifically for me, okay?

883
00:58:22,587 --> 00:58:24,547
You think everyone's like you.

884
00:58:24,547 --> 00:58:27,907
Do you think I'm like you because you steal your juniors' roles?

885
00:58:27,907 --> 00:58:29,587
"Straightforward Romance..."

886
00:58:29,587 --> 00:58:34,327
You stole my role by seducing the main investor. You think I didn't know?

887
00:58:34,327 --> 00:58:37,707
You must've learned from your mother, I suppose.

888
00:58:37,707 --> 00:58:41,427
She got you roles by pouring drinks for people here and there.

889
00:58:41,427 --> 00:58:43,787
Everyone in the industry knows!

890
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:45,597
What?

891
00:58:47,937 --> 00:58:50,417
- Hey, you! 
 - What?

892
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:51,997
Calm down.

893
00:58:51,997 --> 00:58:55,037
How dare you say that? She poured drinks?

894
00:58:55,037 --> 00:58:56,907
What? Was I wrong?

895
00:58:56,907 --> 00:58:58,707
Who doesn't know that in this industry?

896
00:58:58,707 --> 00:59:01,637
Everyone knows about it already!

897
00:59:01,637 --> 00:59:05,447
Are you out of your mind? Let go. Let go!

898
00:59:05,447 --> 00:59:09,777
- Let go, I said! 
 - You know how Bi Bi's obsessed with Cha Bong Soo.

899
00:59:09,777 --> 00:59:14,437
That's why she wanted to do "Straightforward Romance," but you took the role. That's why.

900
00:59:14,437 --> 00:59:16,597
She thinks you'll steal Bong Soo from her.

901
00:59:16,597 --> 00:59:18,447
What? Seriously...

902
00:59:19,247 --> 00:59:23,337
She's doing this because of that womanizer, Cha Bong Soo?

903
00:59:23,337 --> 00:59:27,367
Wow. I can't believe this.

904
00:59:28,317 --> 00:59:31,137
I won't forgive you for this.

905
00:59:31,137 --> 00:59:35,647
Mom, you swear you didn't meet people from Angel Investment?

906
00:59:35,647 --> 00:59:37,777
No, I didn't.

907
00:59:39,987 --> 00:59:43,867
I don't even know who they are.  Why do you ask?

908
00:59:43,867 --> 00:59:46,837
You're sure, right? Do you promise?

909
00:59:46,837 --> 00:59:49,087
 Of course, I'm sure. 

910
00:59:49,087 --> 00:59:54,627
I thought you knew them. That's why I asked you if you knew the CEO.

911
00:59:55,787 --> 00:59:57,357
Okay.

912
00:59:58,277 --> 01:00:00,737
Fine, then. Hang up.

913
01:00:03,877 --> 01:00:05,917
She poured drinks?

914
01:00:06,817 --> 01:00:11,477
Wow. What do I do with Jo Bi Bi?

915
01:00:11,477 --> 01:00:14,327
Gosh, how do I kill her?

916
01:00:18,477 --> 01:00:20,077
Hold on.

917
01:00:21,127 --> 01:00:24,537
Bi Bi is obsessed with Cha Bong Soo.

918
01:00:27,747 --> 01:00:29,357
Cheers.

919
01:00:33,977 --> 01:00:38,267
I can already imagine a story by seeing you two sitting together.

920
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:41,207
Don't you agree, Writer? I think our drama will be a huge hit.

921
01:00:41,207 --> 01:00:44,887
Yes, we won't have to worry. You two make a great couple.

922
01:00:44,887 --> 01:00:49,947
Okay, okay, okay. Let's make "Straightforward Romance" a huge hit.

923
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:51,227
Cheers to "Straightforward Romance"!

924
01:00:51,227 --> 01:00:53,737
 Cheers! 

925
01:00:55,797 --> 01:00:58,767
Oppa, I'm in your care.

926
01:00:59,477 --> 01:01:01,077
Sure.

927
01:01:10,037 --> 01:01:15,497
Director Hong, I heard Mr. Cha refused to do kiss scenes.

928
01:01:15,497 --> 01:01:17,347
Is that true?

929
01:01:17,347 --> 01:01:20,277
This is a romantic story. We can't remove kiss scenes.

930
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:25,097
Gosh, don't worry. I'll try persuading him.

931
01:01:26,237 --> 01:01:29,007
Did his girlfriend tell him not to?

932
01:01:29,007 --> 01:01:31,067
How does that make any sense?

933
01:01:31,067 --> 01:01:33,007
Cheers.

934
01:01:34,707 --> 01:01:37,967
 You know how Bi Bi's obsessed with Cha Bong Soo. 

935
01:01:37,967 --> 01:01:42,487
 That's why she wanted to do "Straightforward Romance,"  but you took the role. That's why. 

936
01:01:42,487 --> 01:01:44,527
 She thinks you'll steal Bong Soo from her. 

937
01:01:44,527 --> 01:01:49,257
I'll take care of it. Convincing people is my specialty.

938
01:01:51,357 --> 01:01:55,957
Ms. Park and Mr. Cha, we're in your care.

939
01:01:55,957 --> 01:01:59,557
The chemistry between the leads is important in romantic dramas.

940
01:01:59,557 --> 01:02:02,947
Get to know each other quickly. You know, right?

941
01:02:02,947 --> 01:02:04,867
Of course, Director Hong.

942
01:02:04,867 --> 01:02:08,947
I'll treat you to the second round for that reason.

943
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:14,097
- Second round? 
 - Park Do Ra!

944
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:17,357
 Park Do Ra! Park Do Ra! 

945
01:02:17,357 --> 01:02:19,017
 Park Do Ra! 

946
01:02:19,017 --> 01:02:22,497
 Park Do Ra! Park Do Ra! 

947
01:02:22,497 --> 01:02:25,237
Park Do Ra! Cheers!

948
01:02:25,237 --> 01:02:28,527
She worked very hard on this project.

949
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:30,537
Let's make this work.

950
01:02:30,537 --> 01:02:32,247
Yes, let's make this work.

951
01:02:32,247 --> 01:02:33,937
Take a glass.

952
01:02:36,037 --> 01:02:39,037
I'm in your care. I mean it.

953
01:02:46,957 --> 01:02:48,867
Why don't we sing a little?

954
01:02:48,867 --> 01:02:50,887
We came all the way here. Come on.

955
01:02:50,887 --> 01:02:52,147
- Oppa. 
 - Yes?

956
01:02:52,147 --> 01:02:54,657
Let's go. Let's sing a song.

957
01:02:54,657 --> 01:02:56,047
- Sing? 
 -Come on out.

958
01:02:56,047 --> 01:02:58,187
- So Ri, you, too. Get up. 
 - I can't sing.

959
01:02:58,187 --> 01:03:00,877
You, too, Sook Ja. Come out. Come out.

960
01:03:01,717 --> 01:03:04,497
I heard you're a good singer.

961
01:03:16,957 --> 01:03:21,417
 Park Do Ra. Seriously, what's wrong with her? 

962
01:03:23,147 --> 01:03:26,967
Wow, we won't have to worry about the drama.

963
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:28,937
They already have great chemistry.

964
01:03:28,937 --> 01:03:30,927
We should start warming up, too.

965
01:03:30,927 --> 01:03:32,837
Let's join them!

966
01:03:46,247 --> 01:03:47,787
 What? 

967
01:03:48,467 --> 01:03:51,417
 They just met today. What's she doing? How embarrassing. 

968
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:54,117
Go Pil Sung, come on. Come on out.

969
01:03:55,337 --> 01:03:58,457
Come out and dance, Pil Sung! Pil Sung!

970
01:04:03,227 --> 01:04:06,777
- ♫  Her face is beautiful  ♫ 
 - ♫  Beautiful!  ♫

971
01:04:06,777 --> 01:04:10,047
- ♫   Her body is beautiful  ♫ 
 - ♫   Beautiful!  ♫

972
01:04:10,047 --> 01:04:17,297
♫  Everything about her is beautiful  ♫

973
01:04:17,297 --> 01:04:20,707
♫  Her face is slender  ♫

974
01:04:20,707 --> 01:04:23,987
♫  Her body is voluptuous  ♫

975
01:04:23,987 --> 01:04:29,827
♫  She's a total catch  ♫

976
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,957
I want to go home.

977
01:04:43,027 --> 01:04:45,887
I want to go home so desperately.

978
01:04:47,197 --> 01:04:50,317
Why is everyone having so much fun?

979
01:04:50,317 --> 01:04:52,527
When will this end?

980
01:04:56,507 --> 01:04:59,027
Huh? Park Do Ra. You're Park Do Ra, right?

981
01:04:59,027 --> 01:05:00,417
Well, yes.

982
01:05:00,417 --> 01:05:02,967
Wow, you're way prettier in person.

983
01:05:02,967 --> 01:05:07,657
Wow, seriously. I'm your fan starting today.

984
01:05:07,657 --> 01:05:10,727
Why don't we dance together to celebrate it?

985
01:05:10,727 --> 01:05:13,477
Hey, let go of me.

986
01:05:13,477 --> 01:05:17,927
I'm not a bad person. I said I'll be your fan.

987
01:05:17,927 --> 01:05:21,597
I don't need a fan like you. Let go of me.

988
01:05:23,647 --> 01:05:25,577
You're playing hard to get.

989
01:05:26,447 --> 01:05:28,807
Do you even know what I do?

990
01:05:28,807 --> 01:05:32,867
- What? 
 - You make money with your face. Don't act superior.

991
01:05:34,237 --> 01:05:36,367
What did you say?

992
01:05:36,367 --> 01:05:38,067
What?

993
01:05:39,027 --> 01:05:40,277
Let go!

994
01:05:40,277 --> 01:05:42,697
Apologize to Ms. Park.

995
01:05:42,697 --> 01:05:49,787
Grabbing her arm forcefully and... being rude counts as assault. You know, right?

996
01:05:49,787 --> 01:05:52,547
All of that was captured on CCTV just now.

997
01:05:52,547 --> 01:05:56,727
If you don't apologize now, we'll go to the police station.

998
01:05:57,687 --> 01:06:01,237
Yes, I'm sorry, Ms. Park.

999
01:06:01,237 --> 01:06:04,697
I apologize. Happy now?

1000
01:06:06,697 --> 01:06:10,477
Actors don't make money using their faces.

1001
01:06:10,477 --> 01:06:13,717
They share their beautiful souls with the world.

1002
01:06:15,647 --> 01:06:17,847
What are you saying?

1003
01:06:23,717 --> 01:06:25,547
Are you okay?

1004
01:06:26,467 --> 01:06:30,547
Well, yes. I'm okay.

1005
01:06:32,307 --> 01:06:35,467
Thank you for helping me.

1006
01:06:36,657 --> 01:06:39,717
Don't mention it. It's nothing.

1007
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:43,547
Wait...

1008
01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:49,637
Where did you hear that cool line from just now?

1009
01:06:49,637 --> 01:06:53,757
"Actors share their beautiful souls with the world."

1010
01:06:55,647 --> 01:07:01,047
Well, I wasn't quoting it. I just came up with it.

1011
01:07:08,687 --> 01:07:15,147
I forgive you for talking behind my back since you just helped me.

1012
01:07:15,147 --> 01:07:18,697
And we have to work on the same set from now on.

1013
01:07:22,047 --> 01:07:24,297
I hope we get along going forward.

1014
01:07:26,427 --> 01:07:30,797
Yes, I can't apologize enough for that. I'm so sorry.

1015
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:34,447
I hope we get along from now on. Thank you.

1016
01:07:34,447 --> 01:07:36,437
Let's work well together, okay?

1017
01:07:44,117 --> 01:07:46,397
Curly-haired assistant director.

1018
01:07:46,397 --> 01:07:47,867
Yes.

1019
01:07:48,487 --> 01:07:54,037
By chance, have we met somewhere before?

1020
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:56,947
Pardon?

1021
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:06,330


1022
01:08:07,487 --> 01:08:08,947
   

1023
01:08:08,947 --> 01:08:17,527
♫  Make my heart flutter and get me excited over and over  ♫

1024
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:21,097
♫  You keep finding me without fail  ♫

1025
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:24,267
♫  So I can't think about anything else  ♫

1026
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:28,937
♫  I think this is what they call fate  ♫

1027
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:42,497
♫  The sky is clearer than usual, and my feet feel light  ♫

1028
01:08:42,497 --> 01:08:46,717
 Soo Yeon said he'll set you up with a woman from a prominent family. 

1029
01:08:46,717 --> 01:08:51,227
 I'll find my other half myself. Please don't worry about it. 

1030
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:54,837
 There's no going back once you choose the wrong woman. 

1031
01:08:54,837 --> 01:08:58,947
 Just wait, Jo Bi Bi. You hurt my feelings. I'll hurt yours now. 

1032
01:08:58,947 --> 01:09:01,307
 She's crazy. She's totally out of her mind. 

1033
01:09:01,307 --> 01:09:03,187
 She's not the Park Do Ra I knew as a kid. 

1034
01:09:03,187 --> 01:09:04,827
 I need to tell you something. 

1035
01:09:04,827 --> 01:09:07,617
 We need time to start getting to know each other. 

1036
01:09:07,617 --> 01:09:09,647
 Park Do Ra! Cha Bong Soo! 

1037
01:09:09,647 --> 01:09:12,047
 What are you two doing right now? 

1038
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:15,247
 Don't do this on our set. Just talk it out.
