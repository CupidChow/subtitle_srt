Captain Cheng, what is it with you?

You didn't answer my calls

Didn't Bureau Chief Zhang refuse to accept

14
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,050
our inference about the male corpse in the travel bag case?

15
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,570
I just

tried it myself.

17
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,980
If the victim is about the same height

18
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,010
and weight as me,

19
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,850
it's possible that he

20
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,530
forces himself into the bag

21
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,640
and zip it up.

22

Jacques-Louis David,

called The Death of Marat

37
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,740
in 1793.

38
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,450
The victim was

39
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,090
a representative of the Jacobins

40
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,020

is his autopsy report.

44
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,650
Before cameras were invented,

45
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,040
the painter's brush

46
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,290
was the only tool

47
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,620

Ten minutes?

57
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,520

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,450
We couldn't recover

62
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,690

63

or property loss.

65

00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,410
[squatting in the elevator]

178
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,710
[and organizing my things.]

179
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,530
[I looked up,]

180
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,780
[and he was standing there.]

181
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,040
[That's how I saw him.]

182
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:25,930
Captain.

183
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,360
I told you so.

184
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,680
It's tricky to investigate here.

185
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:31,820
Why don't we

186
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,500
wait for the portrait...

187
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,580
Ask the property owner

188
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,860
to disable all the elevators.

189
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,860
Split into groups

190
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,600
and investigate every floor.

191
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,160
Is this him?

192
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,610
[Yes.]

193
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,750
All right, then.

194
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,820
When you're looking back in a squatting position,

195
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,180
you must have been looking up at him.

196
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,820
Also, he was wearing a hoodie.

197
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,880
So his face was mostly in the shadows.

198
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:02,820
That's why

199
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,370
you thought he had a fat face

200
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,520
with small eyes.

201
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,140
It's called cognitive bias.

202
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,900
If you were looking straight at him,

203
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,900
you would've seen

204
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,200
this face.

205
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,900
What kind of broken elevator is this?

206
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,500
Hello, auntie.

207
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,400
Have you seen

208
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,500
a thin, tall man

209
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,570
in his 20s

210
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,180
anywhere

211
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,440
around this building?

212
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,560
Who are you guys?

213
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,490
Auntie,

214
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,770
we are the police.

215
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:40,880
[Fire Passage]

216
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,690
Many

217
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,210
college students are staying here.

218
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:43,970
They all

219
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,300
look thin and tall to me.

220
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,820
Officer,

221
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,360
come and see this.

222
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,160
No, auntie. We...

223
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,980
Look at what

224
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,570
the property owner has done.

225
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,090
-What kind of management is this?
-Hi, Mom. I'm doing fine.

226
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,580
The elevators aren't working.

227
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,180
They keep

228
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,580
-I'll be back for the holidays.
-breaking down.

229
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,090
I'm fine.

230
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,770
I'm old now.

231
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,530
I still have to head out for groceries.

232
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,610
How is Dad doing?

233
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,700
I have to climb the stairs.

234
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,500
My legs hurt.

235
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,250
Which floor do you live on?

236
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,090
It's very inconvenient.

237
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:02,890
Eighth floor.

238
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,620
-Okay.
-Those youngsters are really...

239
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,020
Got it.

240
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,730
After they finished eating,

241
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,690
they'd throw food waste out of the window.

242
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,860
Chicken bones, duck bones, and all.

243
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,920
I got the portrait.

244
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,790
Sir, are you all right?

245
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,760
What's wrong with you?

246
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,780
Keep running.

247
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,490
Go on.

248
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,280
The wall is low.

249
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,880
Climb over it.

250
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,280
Captain Cheng.

251
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,600
Are you okay?

252
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,280
Of course not.

253
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,520
You guys are always late.

254
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,780
The culprit is caught.

255
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,660
Forget it.

256
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,660
Let's get to work.

257
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,410
Captain Cheng, I got the portrait.

258
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,620
Look, it looks pretty alike.

259
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,620
Take him away.

260
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:08,850
Wait.

261
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,890
You haven't seen the portrait yet.

262
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,350
How did you know it was him?

263
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,490
Would you react immediately

264
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,060
if someone

265
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,700
talks to you

266
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,940
while you are on the phone?

267
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,400
Which floor do you live on?

268
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,340
Eighth floor.

269
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,730
Qing gave you this watch, right?

270
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,210
It was costly.

271
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,760
What a huge loss.

272
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,970
You talk too much.

273
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,950
Don't tell her about it.

274
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,730
All right.

275
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,870
The third fabrication.

276
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,100
Has anyone of you figured it out?

277
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,080
No.

278
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,440
Fine.

279
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,770
Save it

280
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,120
for our next class.

281
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
Class dismissed.

282
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,790
Bureau Chief Zhang.

283

[We have caught the suspect.]

284
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,340
I have another

285
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,250
good news.

286
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,430
The police academy committee

287
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,970

288
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,260
your transfer request.

289

[I hope you can]

290
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,060
[report to us as soon as possible.]

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,300
Beijiang Sub-Bureau

292

293
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,380
Understood.

294
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,910
Thank you, Bureau Chief Zhang.

295
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:17,690
This morning,

296
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,890
Captain Cheng went after

297
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,330
-the suspect
-Enough.

298
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,440
like The Flash.

299

Eat your drumstick.

300
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,490
You guys are kind enough

301
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,020
to start eating without me.

302
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,700
We can't skip meals

303
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,850
just because the case is being investigated.

304
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,480
What's the matter?

305
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,290
How's the investigation?

306
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,350
Do you need my help?

307
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,640
No need.

308
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,160
It's solved.

309
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,410
He said

310
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,250
someone paid him RMB200,000

311
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,450
to kill that woman

312
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,610
with the knife you took from him.

313
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,050
All the data on her mobile

What is this?

318
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,040
Good job, Yan.

319
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,820
You've set a new record for the fastest interrogation yet.

320

That's what I do.

321
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,250
Enough.

322
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,320
Arrest him.

323
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,240

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,440
me so late at night?

331
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,250
I'm telling you,

332
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,240
I seldom have a chance

333
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,370
to visit my old lady.

334
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,560
I didn't even join Bureau Chief Zhang's

335
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,490
dinner banquet.

336
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:27,680
How amazing.

Are you better than your master now?

don't be arrogant.

Who is he?

341
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,360
An old friend of mine.

Yes.

525
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:51,730
Right this way.

526
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,130
She made the police report.

527
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,660
The deceased's secretary.

528
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,220
Where is the crime scene?

529
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:07,950
Fifth floor.

530
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,160
This way to the elevator.

531
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,650
Come.

532
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:12,650
Come.

533
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,600
Captain Cheng.

534
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,780
How are things going up there?

535
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,160
The flooring is done.

536
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,240
Wait.

537
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:34,940
The deceased is Liang Yi,

538
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,810
42 years old.

539
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,770
He's the owner of this plastic surgery hospital.

540
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,540
He's also one of the top

541
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,970
plastic surgeons in the city.

542
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:40,540
He bought

543
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,730
this building three years ago.

544
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,600
The hospital covers the first to the fourth floor.

545
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,420
The fifth floor is his residence.

546
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,740
No security cameras in the elevator?

547
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,180
There's none in this building.

548
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,050
We've asked about it before

549
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,020
during our routine

550
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
security checks.

551
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,500
They said

552
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,660
it's to protect their customer's privacy.

553
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,490
All their customers

554
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,840
refused to be recorded.

555
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,140
This is the primary crime scene.

556
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,660
The technicians are collecting fingerprints

557
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,610
and DNA samples.

558
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,780
[This must have been a mirror.]

559
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:36,540
There are

560
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,800
no signs of struggling

561
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,180
or obvious wounds

562
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,410
on the victim's body.

563
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,440
So it's unlikely to be a sharp weapon.

564
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,820
There's only one elevator in the building

565
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,420
that serves as the entrance.

566
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,700
Find out

567
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,370
who would usually

568
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,700
come to the fifth floor.

569
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,070
Don't simply touch!

570
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,550
Get him a pair of gloves.

571
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,050
Come.

572
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,670
Let's interrogate the secretary.

573
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,480
I was here at 8:30 a.m. this morning.

574
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,480
We had two surgeries in the morning.

575
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,850
They both involved

576
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,450
complicated preparations.

577
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,480
In such cases,

578
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,820
Dr Liang would usually

579
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,490
arrive an hour earlier.

580
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,110
But today,

581
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,490
the first patient had waited

582
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,010
for about half an hour.

583
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,130
But he hadn't come.

584
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,290
So the customer made a scene.

585
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:49,970
So I

586
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,800
went up to look for him.

587
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,930
But I didn't expect

588
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,510
he's already...

589
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,650
When did you

590
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,600
last see him?

591
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,440
It was

592
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,760
last Friday.

593
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,800
Before I got off work,

594
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,090
I told him

595
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,620
about Monday's surgeries.

596
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,540
He led a disciplined lifestyle.

597
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:14,730
We're not allowed

598
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,730
to disturb him during the weekends.

599
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,670
Did many have access to the fifth floor?

600
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,880
No.

601
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,730
Our elevator

602
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,410
can only reach the fourth floor.

603
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,510
You need an access card to reach the fifth floor.

604
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,700
My card gives me access to the fifth floor

605
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,490
because I need to

606
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,090
clean his room regularly.

607
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,030
Dr Liang

608
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,420
didn't like strangers

609
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,480
to enter his house.

[Crime Scene Investigation]

611
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:06,280
[Crime Scene Investigation]

612
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,370
So?

613
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,790
Found anything new?

614
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,040
Anything unusual?

615
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,080
Yes.

616
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,010
Someone touched this cup.

617
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,030
Amazing.

618
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,830
If you

619
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,250
do that again,

620
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,220
I'll let Bureau Chief Zhang

621
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,230
deal with you.

622
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,620
I didn't touch it.

623
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,150
The deceased has cyanosis.

624
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,020
It could be

625
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,480
due to cyanide poisoning.

626
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,790
Poisoning?

627
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,100
Was the wine spiked?

628
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,280
We need to analyze it

629
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,040
to find out.

630
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,680
Based on the corpse's livor mortis,

631
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,730
he died about

632
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,250
32 to 35 hours ago.

633
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,930
So that's

634
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,860
Saturday night,

635
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,540
9 p.m. to 12 p.m., right?

636
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,140
Yes, it's within that range.

637
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,590
What is this?

638
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,940
The unit's structural drawing.

639
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,320
That new guy drew it.

640
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,740
The structure is quite odd.

641
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,570
Compared to

642
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,500
the floor below,

643
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,420
this floor has been remodelled.

644
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:02,130
There

645
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,480
should be a hidden room

646
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,100
within this visible space.

647
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,410
And that hidden room

648
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,010
is right behind this wall.

649
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,960
The hidden room's temperature difference

650
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,600
will result in an uneven pressure,

651
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,200
causing air to flow through.

652
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,830
What a genius idea.

653
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,150
Wait.

654
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,050
So how do we get in?

655
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,140
What are you looking for?

656
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,510
Flaws.

657
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,710
"Girl with a Pearl Earring."

658
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:47,930
The whole world

659
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,930
thought those were pearl earrings.

660
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:50,660
But they were just

661
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,120
two smears of white paint.

662
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,510
Take a close look.

663
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:54,650
The girl's earlobes

664
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,120
and this so-called pearl

665
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,520
aren't connected at all.

666
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,060
It's an illusion by Vermeer

667
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,720
to trick our occipital lobes.

668
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,139
So?

669
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,690
What is your verdict?

670
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,179
The white smears

671
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:15,960
show signs of wear and tear.

672
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,190
It should be the mechanism.

There are no security cameras in the hospital.

I can't see anything.

700
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,120
I'll try to draw her face.

701
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,850
How?

702
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,280
With this alone?

703
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,370
Yes.

704
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,700
It's reasonable to say that

705
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,420
the surroundings are heavily monitored.

706
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,280
It's impossible to miss her face.

707
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,620
But after she left,

708
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,420
she did disappear into thin air.

709
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,070
That's so strange.

710
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:46,840
We must have

711
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,270
left out something.

712
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,140
Captain Cheng.

713
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,470
Do you think Shen Yi can draw

714
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,400
her face despite being covered up?

715
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,910
What do you think?

716
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,270
I don't think so.

717
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:02,680
Hello?

718
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:03,810
[Captain Cheng.]

719
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:04,990
[Did you know]

720
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:08,390
[what's inside those discs found in Liang Yi's hidden room?]

721
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,440
Captain Cheng.

722
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,280
Please take over.

723
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,540
I'm getting nauseous.

724
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,550
I went through them just now.

725
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,980
They're all the same.

726
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,950
Each disc features

727
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,010
a different woman.

728
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,130
Most of them

729
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,890
have clearly gone under the knife.

730
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,780
They all look similar.

731
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,970
They were all drugged.

732
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,520
Not all.

733
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,710
Some were still pretty awake.

734
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,050
They were willing to

735
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,350
do a peace sign.

736
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:37,700
Also,

737
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,590
after matching the disc numbers,

738
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,190
I noticed Discs 32 to 36

739
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,160
are missing.

740
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,880
I've also examined

741
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,100
all their medical records.

742
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,400
There are 87 in total.

743
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,040
Apparently, the discs are

744
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,300
numbered the same way.

745
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,850
Have you eaten, Mr Shen?

746
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,780
Not yet.

747
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,370
That won't do.

748
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,800
Our profession requires us

749
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,980
to be fit and healthy.

750
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,730
What would you like to have?

751
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,740
I'll buy it for you.

752
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,250
It's okay.

753
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,180
No need, thanks.

754
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,800
Did you draw all these?

755
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,910
How amazing.

756
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,470
Your

757
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,820
height is 163 cm, right?

758
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,510
And you weigh 44 kgs?

759
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,440
Quite accurate.

760
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,010
Well,

761
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,310
can you do me a favour?

762
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,230
Her face was all covered up.

763
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,880
Is it possible to draw it?

764
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,630
A silhouette is

765
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,480
all I need to guess her face shape.

766
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,570
Then, based on the Three Forehead

767
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,710
and Five Eyes theory,

768
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,920
I can reverse the five sense organs' position

769
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,930
and their base size.

770
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,660
But I need way more information

771
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,330
to draw an accurate face.

772
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,430
What are these?

773
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:55,500
These are the 36 vital

774
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,830
bone points on our face.

775
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,390
[Each bone point is linked together,]

776
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,190
[just like a constellation.]

777
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,810
[These 36 bone points]

778
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,070
[are just like stars.]

779
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:06,000
[Once they're linked together,]

780
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,760
[I can estimate]

781
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,230
[a person's facial structure.]

782
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:08,690
[But because]

783
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,330
[her face was covered up too much,]

784
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,420
[I need your help]

785
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,010
[to eliminate]

786
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,670
[the other uncertain links.]

787
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:21,750
This

788
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,150
should be her face shape.

789
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,170
But it looks odd.

790
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,280
Perhaps she's disfigured?

791
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,310
Should we continue?

792
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,410
We have to.

793
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,550
It's my first time

794
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,140
seeing so many videos of women.

795
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,340
I feel like vomiting.

796
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,250
Actually, Liang Yi

797
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,510
had a fixed aesthetic.

798
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,980
All these women

799
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,950
look the same.

800
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,750
Of course, they're constructed by

801
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,210
the same mould and person.

802
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,360
These are

803
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,880
post-surgery videos.

804
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,510
And these

805
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,020
are pre-surgery medical records.

806
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,280
How do we match them up?

807
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,090
Take a screenshot.

808
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,690
We'll ask the hospital staff to identify them tomorrow.

809
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:07,230
Okay.

810
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,330
I'll leave this to you.

811
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,810
Where are you going?

812
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,390
What are you doing?

813
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,820
She's helping me

814
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,740
to finish that woman's portrait.

815
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,670
I didn't ask you.

816
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,940
Mr Shen said

817
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,490
it's tricky to draw her face

818
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,200
because it's disfigured.

819
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,670
So I became his model.

820
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,670
You enjoy working overtime, do you?

821
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,200
Have you finished

822
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,710
organizing the medical records?

823
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,470
Yes.

824
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,060
Check again.

825
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,150
Don't blame her.

826
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,810
I asked her to help me.

827
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,440
Can you finish it?

828
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,590
If not, just say it.

829
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:03,930
Don't try to save face

830
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:04,730
like before.

831
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,350
I can finish it.

832
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,330
When?

833
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,720
Tomorrow morning.

834
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,380
If you can't finish it by then,

835
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,960
pack your stuff

836
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,130
and leave immediately.

837
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,700
If I manage to finish it,

838
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,180
this

839
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,180
will be my studio.

840
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,220
Let's wait and see.
