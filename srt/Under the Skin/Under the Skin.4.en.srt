When we first met

56

in the art classroom,

57
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,630
a painting was hanging on the wall.

58
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,820
It was a painting of this street.

59
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,510
The most striking is

60
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,100

You painted it, right?

63
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,440
How did you know?

64

You have a callus on your left pinky.

65
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,970
There's only one type of brush stroke

66
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,600
in that painting,

67
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,620
which is from the top left down to the right.

68
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,400
Only a lefty paints like that.

69

You're very observant.

70

Well,

92
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,140
I was wondering

93
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,670
if your school's art group students did

94
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,500
still-life drawing

95
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,760

96
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,610
Yes,

97
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,780
but

98
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,250
we had no idea

99
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,450
it was her skull that we were sketching.

100
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,620
Then are the paintings of the skull you all painted

101
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,420
still around?

102
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,409
They should still be at the school.

103
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,970
Is it convenient for you

104
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,500
to take me to the school now?

105
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,710
Sure, let's go.

106
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,440
The art students in our school

107
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,530
have good grades.

108
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,380
More than 200 of them have enrolled

109
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,240
in the top eight art schools.

110
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,810
Are you trying to use sketches

111
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,610
to determine the time when the skull was replaced?

112
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,560
Students who could admit

113
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,120
to the top eight art schools must have accurately drawn

114
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,420
the skull's details.

115
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,520
My only concern is

116
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,070
whether these paintings are still here.

117
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,060
The art room has the habit

118
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,940
of keeping some students' copy assignments

119
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,490
as mementos.

124
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,150
Judging from the brushstroke,

125
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,750
this should be yours, right?

126
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,860
I had the urge to paint during class.

127
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,100
So while the students were busy sketching,

128
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,159
I sketched one too.

129

when

131
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,260

the person who could replace

179
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,940

180
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,620

181

186
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,990
This diary has

187
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,210
a total of 224 entries.

188
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,010
After high school, there were 89 entries

189
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,360
with about 60,000 words.

190
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,950
This diary is

191
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,990
a breakthrough.

192
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,250
It contains lots of important details

193
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,980
about the person connected and key information.

194
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:55,780
For instance,

195
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,090
she was subjected to long-term bullying.

196
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,390
This paragraph shows

197
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,200
that she seemed to be molested before.

198
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,130
Don't you agree?

199
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,100
If this is so,

200
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,300
Ren Xiaoxuan's death

201
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,490
may be related to the person

202
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,050
who bullied and molested her.

203
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:08,680
This is an important direction

204
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,010
for the investigation.

205
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,650
Also,

206
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,530

207
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,410
a guy she liked

208
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,460
in the diary,

209
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,260
which is also an important clue.

210
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,150
Listen to this.

211
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,710
"If I can be part of his eyebrows,

212
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,930
that wouldn't be so bad."

213
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,990
What she wrote isn't cohesive at all.

214
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,910
Her mind seemed

215
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,910
to be too twisted.

216
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:24,970
Yan,

217
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,740
even youngsters like us

218
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,790
can never understand

219
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,990
a young girl's heart.

220
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,430

222
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,330
Fine. I know I'm old.

223
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:33,790
Go

224
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,800
and get female officers on duty

225
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,130
to help us out with this.

226
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,780
When I read through

227
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,840
the diary just now,

228
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,440
I noticed several keywords.

229
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,400
Where's He Rongyue?

230
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:08,900
I have also found

231
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,160
an important finding.

232
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,510
-She said she doesn't write diaries.
-She stopped

233

updating her diary

235
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,370
on June 23rd, 2011.

236
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,500
This means

237
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,760
Ren Xiaoxuan was likely

238
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,940
to have been killed

239
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,340
after this point in time.

240
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,630
We know all this.

241
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,800
Say something we don't know.

242
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,350
Tell us

243
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,480
about the keywords you found.

244
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,810
"How I wish I could take the place of the sunlight and the rain

245
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,460
to kiss your handsome nose tip."

246
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,060
The keyword is "handsome."

247
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,370
Turn to date April 21st.

248

May 22nd,

251
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,630
"a tall bridge nose."

252
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,210
Two days later, she wrote,

253
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,550
"How I wish I could be

254

the brush in his hand."

255
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,780
It can be seen from these descriptions

256
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,680
that Ren Xiaoxuan was

257
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,900
extremely insecure

258
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,370
because she had been bullied and molested.

259
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,760
So she had a special feeling

260
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,970
for this guy.

261
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,330
I feel what she wrote

262
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,010
about this guy doesn't seem real.

263
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,770
These descriptions are too hypothetical.

264
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,160
It's hard to find this guy based on this alone.

265
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,540
If we put all

266
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,420
the facial information together,

267
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,150
we can draw a composite drawing with them, right?

268
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,010
What are you doing here?

269
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,620
Now, we're basically certain

270
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,510
that the teenager sketched

271
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,720
on Ren Xiaoxuan's desk should be

272
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,770
the one she often mentioned

273
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,080

278
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,570
I've circled out the keywords.

279
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,260
You can start with the composite drawing now.

280
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,350

281

"The breeze messed up his hair."

283
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,030
"He would fix it with his slender fingers."

284
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,420

285
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,340

00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,370
like crazy?

519
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,580
Relax.

520
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,380
That's it.

521
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,910
That's not what happened, Officers.

522
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,170
It's all a misunderstanding.

523
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:49,630
That...

524
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,350
That didn't count as molestation.

525
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,940
Besides,

526
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,930
I didn't succeed either.

527
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,470
What does the student who came look like?

528
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,530
I... I don't remember his face clearly.

529
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,460
Think harder.

530
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,990
I... I really...

531
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,410
I really don't remember,

532
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,090
Officers.

533
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,390
I had a drink at the time.

534
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,850
I just took a glance at him.

535
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,660
Besides, I didn't dare

536
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,620
see him in the eyes.

537
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,810
I was scared he'd catch a glimpse of me instead.

538
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,940
Wait, Officers.

539
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,200
You must believe me.

540
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,040
I'm also hoping

541
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,220
you'll find him as soon as possible.

542
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,060
He can prove

543
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,990
that I didn't do anything that day.

544
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,330
Does he look something like this?

545
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,270
I really don't remember it clearly.

546
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,110
I only remember

547
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:33,900
that he's

548
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,070
skinny.

549
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,420
He's not very tall.

550
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,860
Most teenagers of that age are

551
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,120
about the same height.

552
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,380
I must be right.

553
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,680
He must be one

554
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,440
of the naughty kids

555
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,170
from the art group of that year.

[Ren Xiaoxuan's Diary]

557
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,940
The boyfriend Xiaoxuan mentioned

558
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,080
in her diary,

559
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,240
do you remember anything about that?

560
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,000
No.

561
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,800
Perhaps painters don't remember

562
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,900
with their brains.

563
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,020
After all,

564
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,260
we use hands

565
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,390
to remember people.

566
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,600
"The sunlight in the art classroom happened

567
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,860
to hit on his distinct eyebrows

568
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,090
and dense eyelashes.

569
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,870
It looked like the mottled grass under the tree shade

570
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,890
in the secret land of fairy tales."

571
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,930
"As he painted,

572
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,150
he flashed

573
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,710
a sunshine smile."

[April 21st. Sunny]

575
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,680
"He must be passionate about painting."

576
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,540
"How I wish I could take the place of the sunlight and the rain

577
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,930
to kiss your nose tip."

578
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,650
"After your ball game,

579
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,130
you ran to the faucet

580
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,940
without a care to wash your face

581
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,540
and wet your hair."

582
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,120
"We seem to be separated forever."

583
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,370
"Yet, we rely on each other."

584
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,310
At the time,

585
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,950
the art class was not divided into grades.

586
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,590
Everyone would paint together.

587
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,120
But I really don't remember

588
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,280
about that guy.

589
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,000
What about these names?

590
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,350
They're the art group members.

591
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,980
Some were in Grade 10, like Xiaoxuan.

592
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,620
Some were Grade 12 like me.

593
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,050
We often do

594
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,230
a get-together.

00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,740
I want to know the truth too.

602
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,920
I'm curious

603
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,640

your talent.

Why did you become a policeman?

I've seen your sketches.

610
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,660
Your level is far higher than

00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,090
an ordinary portraitist.

612
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:23,760
A painter

613
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,860
may not necessarily sell a painting for half a year.

A forensic artist

Art...

627

Pure art is too hard to realize.

628

people astray easily.

you said there's an event.

What's the event?

669
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,330
It's a game

to test the strength of your memory drawing.

Go now.

We were so close back then,

and now we feel so distant.

678
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,650

how much do you still remember

Not bad, Senior.

00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,860
you'll draw it on the blackboard.

692
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,700
Then, the rest will try

693
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,580
and guess who that is.

694
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,540
What do you think?

695
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,510
Sure!

696
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,350
-Let's start.
-Quickly.

697
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,570
I'll go first, then.

698
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,770
-Okay.
-You go first.

699
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:58,940
"His face is

700
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,000
always oily."

701
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,190
"His eyes look like

702
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,660
two black beans floating in the oil."

703
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,320
Who's this?

704
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,790
Only after she draws more can we find out.

705
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,920
What a smart move.

706
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,550
If Ms. Qu goes first,

707
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,140
the others won't feel

708
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,320
suspicious.

709
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,000
The rest of the lots are

710
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,100
descriptions of the physical traits

711
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,230
found in the diary

712
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,690
of the guy Xiaoxuan liked.

713
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,630
If

714
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,310
the guy she liked

715
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,770
or someone who knows him is

716
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,800
among these people,

717
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,570
they'll definitely have a certain reaction

718
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,080
to these descriptions.

719
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,710
Who's that?

720
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,020
Hey, isn't that Zhao Zipeng?

721
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,150
You're right!

722
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,740
It'll be perfect if I add one more thing.

723
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,400
Here you go.

724
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,380
Let me have it.

725
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,350
The center

726
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,950
of his look is here.

727
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,720
Wow, that's similar.

728
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Come on. Go for it.

729
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,110
Am I right?

730
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:12,860
You're right!

731
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,660
That's his look.

732
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,330
That's all.

733
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,800
That looks similar.

734
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,230
Why do I feel

735
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,320
this game seems

736
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,580
to be easy for you guys?

737
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,670
Come on.

738
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,890
We're still good.

739
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:22,610
How about this?

740
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,830
Let's change the rule.

741
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,360
Okay.

742
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:24,830
-Deal.
-What's the rule?

743
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,170
The same note

744
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:26,970
and the same person.

745
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:27,900
We'll draw it.

746
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,830
Let's see who's faster and more accurate.

747
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,420
What do you think?

748
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,210
-No problem.
-Why not?

749
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,050
No problem.

750
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,100
I can't wait to start drawing.

751
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,650
No problem.

752
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,200
Okay.

753
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,800
Then

754
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,140
let's begin.

755
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,690
Let's go!

756
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,700
Listen.

757
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,580
I'm going to win again.

758
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,050
[Dust Free White Chalk]

759
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,550
You?

760
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,250
Your grades were lower than mine.

761
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,280
Come on.

762
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,920
It's been ten years since I drew.

763
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,270
"The breeze blew across his face

764
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,790
and blew his hair

765
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,860
to reveal his tall nose bridge,

766
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,390
dense and long eyelashes,

767
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,770
and sunshine smile."

768
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,880
"Beautiful, distinct eyebrows

769
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,770
that look thick and dashing."

770
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,080
"All these traits set off

771
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,340
his gentle look."

772
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,100
Hush.

773
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,880
I'd bring some food

774
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,480
if I knew it'd take this long.

775
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,460
Here.

776
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,520
Hush.

777
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,530
Why do I feel

778
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,790
he looks like Xu Chen?

779
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,750
No way.

780
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:06,930
Xu Chen didn't have

781
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,400
such a stylish hairstyle.

782
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,600
I'm sure it's not him.

783
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,639
Then who's that?

784
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,570
I think he looks like Wang Yiqi.

785
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,120
You're going to lose

786
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,870
if you don't start drawing.

787
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,710
The rest added a stroke

788
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,929
every time they heard

789
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:39,020
a description.

790
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,080
During the process,

791
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,690
they hesitated and made changes.

792
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,699
It means the rest didn't know

793
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:47,230
who they were going to draw,

794
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,429
or it was their first time to hear

795
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:49,560
such descriptions.

796
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,960
He was the only one who started drawing

797
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,540
after hesitating for a long time.

798
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,830
Every stroke is decisive,

799
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,440
done in one strike

800
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,130
without any hesitation.

801
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,920
It's likely

802
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,970
that he already knew

803
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,170
who he's going to draw

804
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:07,320
when he heard

805
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,880
the descriptions.

806
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,860
It's been so long.

807
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,160
Yes, it's been so long.

808
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,780
Your painting skills are the best

809
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,490
among the same batch of art students.

810
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,420
Why were you the slowest this time?

811
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,750
Because I wasn't sure who that was.

812
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,610
It's drawn with force.

813
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,000
Filled with emotion.

814
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,440
I can feel

815
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,040
he's suppressing

816
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,920
his emotion

817
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,120
from being released.

818
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,740
It must be him.

819
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,150
He either knows her

820
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,370
or has read the diary.

821
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,060
Lanxin,

822
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,000
you didn't just call

823
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:06,880
everyone

824
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,220
for a gathering, right?

825
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,120
She wasn't the one.

826
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,710
We wanted to find you.

827
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,340
You read her diary, didn't you?

828
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,250
In her diary,

829
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,550
she wrote about a guy she liked.

830
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,550
It was you, right?

831
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,340
At first,

832
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,280
I thought

833
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,700
I was the one she liked.

834
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,850
When I first noticed her,

835
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,580
it was at the basketball court.

836
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,280
It was April Fool's Day.

837
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,530
It was raining.

838
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,360
I remember it vividly.

839
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,810
[She'd watch me play basketball.]

840
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,350
[She'd also cheer for me silently]

841
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,610
[outside of the basketball until dark.]

842
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,210
[She'd always peek at me]

843
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,180
[during art class.]

844
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,560
[During mealtime,]

845
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,820
[she'd sit near to me.]

846
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,370
But in other aspects...

847
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,690
She had never said

848
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,780
a word to me

849
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,440
or even looked at me directly.

850
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,170
At first, I thought

851
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,680
she was shy.

852
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,950
After I read her diary,

853
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,470
I found out

854
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,480
the back of the figure drawn

855
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,080
on her table wasn't me.

856
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,560
So you started bullying her.

857
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,940
"May 3rd. Rainy."

858
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,620
"I don't know why

859
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,170
he has been targeting me."

860
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,520
"He found my diary,

861
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,690
and he read it

862
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,110
in front of everyone."

863
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,610
[He was laughing so loudly]

864

in her diary.

00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,510
I only want to know

889
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,240
who she mentioned in the diary.

00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,160
Who's that?

891

I don't know.

to all the guys of the same term.

894
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,050
I didn't find anyone like that.

895
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,220
According to the current investigation,

896
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,320
we can be certain

897
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,090
that Zhao Zipeng and Tian Lin

898
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,910
have no direct connection

899
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,310
to Ren Xiaoxuan's death.

Then the only lead

we have is the guy

902
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,820
she wrote in the diary.

907
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:03,960
they didn't know

908

who this guy was.

Don't you find that strange?

So this is where you live?

913

It's dark here.

The streetlights have been broken for a long time.
