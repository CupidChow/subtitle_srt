the weather will affect the lighting.

28

that the tone of this sketch

45
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:55,960

from the construction site.

81

that it's a Chinese banyan flower.

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,810

They yielded different results.

The plant residue

176
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,490
You were in a basketball match

177
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,340
and she was cheering for you.

178
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,640
I still think something

179
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,730
is lacking.

180
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,850
Can you help me complete the drawing?

181
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,660
You did a splendid job.

182
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,530
This is not what Xiaoxuan wanted.

183
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,340
What she wanted

184
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,230
was a portrait of her drawn by you.

185
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,340
No one ever saw

186
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,060
her true smile.

187
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,380
Except you.

188
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,380
I want to speak with you in private.

189
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,590
Check

190
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,440
where the rescue team is now.

191
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,920
Nice haircut.

192
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,860
What do you want to talk to me about?

193
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,290
Come to me.

194
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,760
Let's have a chat.

195
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:20,910
Okay.

196
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,540
I'll come to you, then.

197
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,180
I...

198
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,940
I'm a bit acrophobic.

199
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,330
Can we

200
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,590
sit down and talk?

201
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,420
[Shen Yi]

202
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,360
[Did you know?]

203
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,040
[Du Cheng]

204
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,790
[She and I first met]

205
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,980
in this building.

206
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,120
The shading here

207
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,800
is too flat.

208
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,260
You need to draw

209
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,780
with the force I show you here.

210
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,140
[Perhaps from that day onwards,]

211
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,960
[I became the one]

212
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,260
[in her imagination.]

213
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,070
[Unfortunately,]

214
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,220
[I let her down.]

215
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,750
Are you crazy?

216
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,460
[Since young,]

217
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,570
[I know that I'm different.]

218
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,890
[The classmates always ostracized me.]

219
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,700
[But I didn't care.]

220
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,690
[However,]

221
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,830
[not every]

222
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,010
[outcast]

223
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,320
[could do the same.]

224
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,440
Look at this princess.

225
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,250
She looks just like Ren Xiaoxuan.

226
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,630
Perhaps she

227
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,140
thinks that she's a princess.

228
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,290
Stop fantasizing.

229
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,340
Give it back.

230
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,470
Are you mad now?

231
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,750
[Officer Shen.]

232
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,820
You know what it feels like

233
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,180
to be misunderstood, don't you?

234
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,490
Being different

235
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,750
might be incomprehensible to some,

236
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,730
but it should be respected.

237
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,720
Unfortunately, back then,

238
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,710
people didn't think that way.

239
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,720
[I couldn't get along with anyone.]

240
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,870
[So I could only practice basketball alone]

241
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,340
[when they were gone.]

242
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,990
[Xiaoxuan]

243
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,510
[would be my spectator by the sidelines.]

244
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,560
[I just wanted to console her.]

245
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,840
[Yet, unexpectedly,]

246
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,860
[from that day onwards,]

247
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,830
[I had a companion too.]

248
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,360
[And then,]

249
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,930
[I started to find opportunities]

250
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,860
[to hang out with her.]

251
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,070
[In those few months,]

252
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,850
[I was the closest to her]

253
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,200
[on that rainy day.]

254
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,850
[I walked behind her in silence]

255
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,690
[for a long time.]

256
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,580
[I hoped my companionship]

257
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,930
[would make her feel less lonely.]

258
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,510
[And then, Xiaoxuan transferred to another school.]

259
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,110
[But occasionally,]

260
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,210
[we would still meet]

261
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,470
[each other under that Chinese banyan tree]

262
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,350
[across the vast distance.]

263
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,760
[In the deluge of humans, the ordinary us shine ever so brightly in each other's eyes.]

264
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,730
"In the deluge of humans,

265
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,000
the ordinary us

266
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,310
shine ever so brightly

267
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,530
in each other's eyes."

268
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,430
We found a total of 21 cloth scraps

269
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,440
under

270
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,330
the Chinese banyan tree.

271
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,390
They're tainted with blood spills.

272
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,660
Also,

273
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,680
that long scar on your

274
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,900
left middle finger.

275
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,080
It must be left

276
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,260
by the utility knife.

277
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,740
Since you were

278
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,500
cut back then,

279
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,010
the current technology

280
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,360
allows us to run

281
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,150
a DNA test

282
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,200
on Xiaoxuan's clothes

283
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,760
with your blood.

284
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,900
That wouldn't be an issue.

285
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,410
So...

286
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,980
Why?

287
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,730
[I was just a girl]

288
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,950
[who didn't like to wear skirts,]

289
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,090
[who liked to play basketball,]

290
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,150
[and who liked a short haircut.]

291
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,090
[For many years,]

292
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,480
[everyone around me]

293
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,490
[misunderstood and avoided me]

294
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,330
[because of]

295
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,300
[my appearance.]

296
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,110
[I thought]

297
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,590
[Xiaoxuan truly understood]

298
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,600
[and accepted me.]

299
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,120
[But]

300
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,980
[she was just like them.]

301
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,020
[That day,]

302
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,260
[we agreed to meet under the Chinese banyan tree.]

303
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,590
[I wanted her to see]

304
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,580
[the real me.]

305
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,400
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

306
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,990
Xiaoxuan.

307
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,830
What's the matter?

308
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,580
It's me.

309
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,230
Qu Lanxin.

310
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,490
You're not him.

311
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,050
It's me.

312
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,860
You're not him.

313
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,490
I gave you sweets

314
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,000
under this Chinese banyan tree.

315
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,650
I ran with you on the track.

316
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,220
I sent you back home on that rainy day.

317
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,010
You're not him.

318
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,400
You're not him!

319
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,450
It's me!

320
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,540
Stop talking!

321
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,980
I don't want to hear!

322
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,740
Why did you come here

323
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,830
and tell me all that?

324
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,180
You have no idea how important

325
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,030
he was to me.

326
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,920
Why did you have to ruin the one

327
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,390
in my heart?

328
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,070
He's the only good thing

329
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,210
that ever happened to me.

330
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,360
None of you wants me to be happy!

331
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,910
Why?

332
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,820
Why do all of you want to hurt me?

333
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,940
I'm sorry.

334
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,770
I thought

335
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,570
you could accept the real me.

336
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,070
I don't want to see you

337
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,210
delude yourself anymore.

338
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,970
I thought

339
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,500
I found the light.

340
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,320
And you killed it.

341
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,860
More often than not,

342
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,210
the truth

343
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,600
hurts more than lies.

344
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,570
Xiaoxuan. What are you doing?

345
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,310
Xiaoxuan!

346
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,490
Xiaoxuan!

347
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,810

It's my fault, Xiaoxuan.

365

I shouldn't have forced you.

366

372

That day,

373
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,840
both of us died.

374
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,580
Ren Xiaoxuan killed herself?

375
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,780
Yes

376
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,880
and no.

377
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,490
Because I

378
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,380
caused everything.

379
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,610
Xiaoxuan needed the me

380
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,420
in her imagination.

381
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,820
I shouldn't have destroyed him.

382
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:18,970
So

383
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,820
you buried her

384
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,200
under the Chinese banyan tree.

385
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,530
I thought about calling the police

386
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,340
but I lacked the courage

387
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,610
to face the consequences.

388
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,150
Why is Ren Xiaoxuan's skull

389
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,070
in

390
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,500
the art room then?

391
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,710
When I entered university, I would accompany her

392
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,820
under the Chinese banyan tree every holiday break,

393
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,590
until I heard

394
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,230
that the city council

395
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,660
wanted to build a road there.

396
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,850
I then relocated Xiaoxuan

397
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,610
to somewhere

398
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,130
closer to me.

399
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,350
I don't trust

400
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,110
Qu Lanxin.

401
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,290
I don't believe

402
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,340
that Ren Xiaoxuan killed herself

403
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,140
and she merely buried her body.

404
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,430
Based on what we have so far,

405
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,480
we can now be sure

406
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,730
that the lethal weapon to kill Ren Xiaoxuan

407
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,620
was a utility knife.

408
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,550
Using its size

409
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,230
and the height of both

410
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,240
individuals,

411
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,080
He Rongyue

412
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,840
can then deduce how

413
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,470
the fatal wound

414
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,350
was inflicted.

415
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,680
It's been a decade.

416
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,450
No one has ever heard

417
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,460

419

Perhaps I looked like that

420
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,070
in Xiaoxuan's eyes.

421
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,300
