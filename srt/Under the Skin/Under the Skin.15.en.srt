00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,020
I've decided to introduce her

178
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,420
to the finest male police officer

179
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,480
in our sub-bureau.

180
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,210
I think you are the right man.

181
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,800
Thank you, Fei.

182
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,780
I don't think I'm the finest.

183
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,040
You must be the finest.

184
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,760
You look debonair and handsome.

185
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,660
You are the visual

186
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,010
of our sub-bureau.

187
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,490
That's settled then.

Tomorrow morning, ten o'clock.

189
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,010
Fei.

190
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:03,890
Well...

191
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,160
Unfortunately, I

192
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,350
have a class tomorrow morning.

193
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,640
What about the afternoon?

194
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,750
Don't turn down Fei's offer,

195
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,410
the visual of the sub-bureau.

Captain Cheng is off tomorrow.

198
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,320
So...

199
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,200
Du!

200
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,770
Fei.

201
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,650
I am miles and miles from being the finest.

202
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,810
Look, I'm not fine.

203
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,320
You must be the finest.

204
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,640
Look at you.

205
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,850
You look debonair and handsome.

206
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:33,850
You are

207
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,510
the visual of our sub-bureau.

Fei, no.

209
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,530
Don't turn down Fei's offer.

210
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,980
That's settled then.

211
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,300

are written clearly.

For the glory of our sub-bureau.

214
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,940
For the glory.

Good luck.

Where is Zhao Xiaoxu?

225
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,160
Please come up with your painting tools.

226
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,460
I'd like to ask you

227
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,590
to wear headphones.

228
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,420
While listening to the melody in the headphones,

229
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,550
you begin to imagine

230
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,920
and paint a landscape.

231
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,250
This is Zhao Xiaoxu's

Next,

240
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,100
I would like to read

241
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,720
some noteworthy comments.

242
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,000
"This painting

243
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,730
makes me

244
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,000
uneasy."

245
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,320
"It is too invasive."

246
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,890
"Paintings live."

247
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,080
"I think

248
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,630
someone capable of drawing up this

249
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,850
must be mad."

250
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,100
This is William Hogarth's notable work,

251
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,850
"A Rake's Progress In The Madhouse."

252
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,040
Can anybody tell me

253
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,270
who is the madman

254
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,360
among them?

255
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,330
Who is the painter?

256
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,520
I think all of them.

257
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:38,980
I think the two women

258
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,810
in the back of the painting

259
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,040
are not mad.

260
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,250
Why?

261
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,780
They dress in theatrical clothes and look respectable.

262
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,200
And they hold a hand fan.

263
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,880
They look at the others

264
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,120
with curiosity and disapproval.

265
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,930
They are more like outsiders.

266
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,120
Correct.

267
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,570
These two noble ladies

268
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,380
were visiting the madhouse.

269
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,490
At that time,

270
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,240
madhouses charged their visitors

271
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,980
to sustain

272
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,040
their operations.

273
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,020
Were they mad? Who would visit a madhouse?

274
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,960
Mr Shen.

275
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,620
Who is she? I haven't seen her before.

276
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,250
Me too.

277
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,560
Please.

278
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,690
I'm sure

279
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,820
the man without clothes

280
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,420
in the middle of the painting

281
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,850
is not mad.

282
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,720
Why?

283
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,200
You said this painting is called

284
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,260
"A Rake's Progress In The Madhouse."

285
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,450
This man

286
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,090
is in the middle of the painting.

287
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,650
I think he is the rake,

288
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,960
not a madman.

289
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,040
You are right.

290
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,490
He is

291
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,300
the central figure of the painting.

292
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,360
"A Rake's Progress In The Madhouse."

293
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,450
During college,

294
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,420
he unexpectedly inherited a legacy.

295
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,080
But he blew it all on gambling.

296
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,170
On the day he went bankrupt,

297
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,500
he had a mental breakdown and attempted suicide.

298
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,300
Then he was sent to the madhouse.

299
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,680
It's inhumane.

300
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,860
He was locked up just because he attempted suicide.

301
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,420
Well said. I would like to ask.

302
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,840
Is everyone in a madhouse

303
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,290
mad?

304
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,500
Hogarth wanted

305
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,800
to tell future people

306
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,280
that sanity and insanity

307
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,370
are defined by society.

308
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,960
A conservative and domineering society

309
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,020
will portray a sane person as a madman.

310
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,210
Who is the madman?

311
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,500
The jurisdiction

312
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,920
is in the hands of us.

313
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,210
And each of us

314
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,530
is also judged

315
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,240
by our own kind at all times.

316
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,010
Tell me.

317
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,330
What did you see?

318
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,330
What did you hear?

319
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,650
It's the serenade by Schubert.

320
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,570
I saw someone punting.

321
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,680
The oar pushed the water lilies away.

322
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,800
Now,

323
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,520
does anybody define him that way?

324
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,200
Sorry.

325
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,500
I'm a police officer.

326
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,380
Because of

327
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,610
my work,

328
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,730
there are times where I can't go home

329
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,730
for weeks.

330
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,160
I don't think we are suitable for each other.

331
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,970
Du Cheng, right?

332
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,020
I'm Xiao Shan.

333
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,770
Sorry for being late.

334
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,050
You must've been waiting for long.

335
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,120
It's okay, I

336
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,760
just arrived.

337
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,050
There was a sprinkler truck on the road.

338
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,780
And I didn't manage to avoid it.

339
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,840
Waiter.

340
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,820
Please get me a dry towel.

341
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,560
Thank you.

342
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,160
Mr Shen, see you.

343
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,690
See you.

344
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,870
Mr Shen, see you.

345
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:57,850
See you.

346
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,840
You look alike.

347
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,490
Who?

348
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,280
Du Cheng.

349
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,490
He has your eyes

350
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,880
and your temper.

351
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,490
You must be Du Qing.

352
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,330
Brilliant!

353
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,730
I read the news about you.

354
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,900
The Crime-hunting Detective of Beijiang Sub-Bureau.

355
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,700
But when you stood with the police

356
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,360
in the news,

357
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,170
you looked like

358
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,360
a cat among the wolves.

359
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,810
On the podium today,

360
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,250
you looked like

361
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,440
a fighter among the painters.

362
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,360
How is it?

363
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,840
Am I right?

364
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,010
What color is it?

365
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:48,890
Royal blue.

366
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,280
What about now?

367
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,820
It seems to be darker.

368
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:55,890
The same pen

369
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,930
will show different colors

370
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,530
in different environments.

371
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,350
But the pen has not changed.

372
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,280
Same goes to me.

373
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,050
I am a portraitist.

374
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,670
Whatever environment I'm in,

375
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,220
I remain a portraitist.

376
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,400
Now I see

377
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,780
why my brother appreciates you

378
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,579
and insists on working with you.

379
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,480
Is this your first blind date?

380
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,170
I'm a police officer.

381
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,080
I know.

382
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,910
The police are cool.

383
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,080
Cool?

384
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,440
No way.

385
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,970
It's all go.

386
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,180
We have to work overtime

387
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,240
and travel all day.

388
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,900
Being a model is the same.

389
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,200
We fly everywhere.

390
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,070
We are similar in some ways.

391
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,570
Did you drive?

392
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,690
Well...

393
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,290
Run me up to my company later.

394
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,770
My clothes are soaked.

395
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,370
This is inconvenient. I've got to get changed.

396
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,200
It's inconvenient for you, isn't it?

397
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,990
Then I'll sit here and wait.

398
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,460
I'll stay until the clothes are dry.

399
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,640
It's pretty cold.

400
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,440
Where is your company?

401
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,800
It's pretty close.

402
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,800
Cheng was like them when he was young.

403
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,590
He colored his hair.

404
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,120
He fought.

405
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,380
He did everything

406
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,510
a teenage rebel did.

407
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,440
Back then,

408
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,570
my parents were busy

409
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,770
and had no time for us.

410
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,180
They thought Cheng was a lost cause.

411
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,570
He once

412
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,160
smashed the headmaster's car at school.

413
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:49,840
The headmaster

414
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,640
wanted to talk to my parents.

415
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,190
Did you know what he told me?

416
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,170
He said,

417
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,320
"That's great.

418
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,940
I can finally

419
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,080
talk to Dad alone."

420
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,290
Only then did I realize that

421
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,480
he did these things

422
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,380
to talk a bit more

423
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,440
to our father.

424
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,600
Did he get his way?

425
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,050
My father

426
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,730
still sent his assistant.

427
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,430
Why are you telling me this?

428
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,490
Can you tell Cheng

429
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,230
not to be a police officer anymore?

430
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,330
Why?

431
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,900
He wanted to enter the police academy since childhood.

432
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,300
My parents disapproved.

433
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,400
He was rebellious.

434
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,060
My parents' disapproval

435
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,540
only gave further sustenance to him.

436
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,340
He doesn't really want

437
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,600
to be a police officer.

438
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,700
He just wants

439
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,680
our attention.

440
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,270
I think Du Cheng chooses to be a police officer

441
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,930
just for himself

442
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,680
and nobody else.

443
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:00,900
Du Cheng

444
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,610
is a man of great faith.

445
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,260
He believes

446
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,990
in his intuition and judgment.

447
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,260
He is uncompromising once he sets his mind.

448
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:10,700
No one

449
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,230
can manipulate his choice.

450
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,000
It's his nature

451
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,960
that made him a policeman.

452
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,180
I've lived with him

453
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,450
for thirty years,

454
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,110
but I don't know him any better.

455
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,280
Perhaps

456
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,190
the depth of understanding

457
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,170
is not determined

458
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,410
by the length of time.

459
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,300
Do you want to drop in?

460
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,890
If you have anything to say,

461
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,880
say it.

462
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,260
The temperature of the coffee shop

463
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,970
was 25 degrees Celsius.

464
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,100
It was not that cold.

465
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,220
You brought me here on purpose.

466
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,240
I guess you're not directing at me

467
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:01,900
but

468
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,830
at my position as a police officer.

469
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,610
I hate to trouble you.

470
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,200
However, no one

471
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,540
but you

472
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,400
can help me now.

473
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,530
What is this?

474
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,340
There is a Xinshan Art Garden that just opened.

475
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
Did you know that?

476
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,170
An exhibition

477
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,570
was held there recently.

478
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,890
It was an exhibition of art

479
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,690
by the top photographer, Mandy.

480
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,330
I fought for the opportunity

481
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,810
of a photoshoot with him.

482
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,040
And it came to this?

483
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,640
On the day of the exhibition opening,

484
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,190
we walked into the pavilion

485
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,400
just to find that my head

486
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,200
was cut off in all the photos.

487
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,480
When did it happen?

488
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,490
Evening three days ago.

489
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,140
The exhibition has been called off now.

490
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,660
Did you call the police?

491
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,320
I did.

492
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,930
I did so that evening.

493
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,840
But Xinshan is a new region.

494
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,650
There is no security camera inside.

495
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,160
We can't find this person.

496
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,180
This pavilion

497
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,290
is locked at night.

498
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,280
So the person

499
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,060
should have entered

500
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,060
before midnight.

501
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,510
Cutting off your head in the photos

502
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,680
means beheading.

503
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,370
This person has a spite

504
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,330
at you.

505
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,920
No real damage

506
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,120
is caused yet.

507
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,660
But if you can't find the person,

508
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,610
it is likely to turn into

509
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,250
actual bodily harm.

510
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,660
Do you have a feud with anyone recently?

511
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,440
Shu Qianqian.

512
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,560
Ever since she found out

513
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,770
about me working with Mandy,

514
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,700
she has been targeting me for everything.

515
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,760
I don't know why.

516
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,890
Xiao Shan.

517
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,870
We're going to work.

518
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,400
Why are you here?

519
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,490
I've heard about

520
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,220
the photographic exhibition.

521
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,350
Don't worry so much.

522
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,250
Two of us are the only models

523
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,380
in Mandy's photographic exhibition.

524
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,010
My photos have been removed now.

525
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,760

00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,060
Let's go.

703
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,720
I...

704
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,690
Let's go.

705
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,430
Let's go.

706
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,040
Officer Du.

707
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,420
What do you think about this matter?

708
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,820
Are there

709
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,950
artists around you?

710
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,920
Take it easy. Don't worry.

711
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,330
Many of them are my friends.

712
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:07,880
Come.

713
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,220
Mr Chen and Mr Wang!

714
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:11,770
Hi.

715
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,610
Long time no see.

716
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,160
Yeah.

717
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,210
I hope your business is going well.

718
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,300
You are getting more and more beautiful.

719
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,440
You are so sweet.

720
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,210
Lady, would you like a drink?

721
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,250
Okay, thanks.

722
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,880
Thank you.

723
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,080
Take it easy.

724
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,320
Didn't you say

725
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,860
you're a portraitist anywhere you are?

726
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,970
Just be yourself.

727
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,630
I'll socialize with them.

728
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,660
You get familiar with the environment.

729
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,360
I'll be right back.

730
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,090
All right, I'll leave you to it.

731
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,330
Miss Du.

732
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:36,970
Mr Wang.

733
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,370
Hi.

734
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,290
Come.

735
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,360
Long time no see.

736
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,620
-How's business?
-Hi.

737
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,280
Not bad.

738
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,000
-It's been a while since you came to my company.
-Long time no see.

739
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,740
Do pay me a visit next time.

740
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,000
All right, sure.

741
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,470
[Actually, those photos...]

742
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,680
It's not good

743
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,530
for such a handsome guy

744
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,190
to be on the phone by yourself.

745
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,380
Let me

746
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,640
introduce my friends.

747
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,390
See, the man

748
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,780
in a black suit over there.

749
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,290
He is the water industry chief

750
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,560
of Xincheng.

751
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,390
Look at that one.

752
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,760
The one in a plaid suit.

753
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,280
He is the boss of a biotechnology company.

754
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,580
Recently he is having a deal

755
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,770
with the government about health databases.

756
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,960
These are the people

757
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,500
who control the entire

758
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,960
urban system of Beijiang.

759
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,370
Together with him.

760
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:20,600
The future

761
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:21,850
of the Internet in Beijiang

762
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,280
is in their hands.

763
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,130
Mr Chen.

764
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,100
Sorry.

765
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,760
All right.

766
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,630
Thank you.

767
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,630
Talk to you later.

768
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,560
Long time no see, Miss Du.

769
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,490
Long time no see.

770
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,900
Let me introduce you.

771
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,340
This is my handsome brother.

772
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,960
Shen Yi of Beijiang Sub-Bureau.

773
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,490
He is a genius portraitist.

774
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:40,480
Hi.

775
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,450
This is

776
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,010
the boss who has the power

777
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,760
over the future of the Internet

778
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,600
in Beijiang.

779
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,560
Mr Chen Zhou.

780
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,180
I'm not that good, Miss Du.

781
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:48,970
-Hi, Mr Chen.
-Nice to meet you.

782
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:49,720
Hi, Mr Chen.

783
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,860
I will leave you two to it.

784
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,920
I'm going to talk to some old friends.

785
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,570
Shen Yi.

786
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,650
Officer Shen.

787
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,570
I've heard of you.

788
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,900
But when I see you today,

789
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,630
you're younger than I thought.

790
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,640
You flatter me.

791
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,460
By the way,

792
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,920
there was a case,

793
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,100
and your company

794
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,230
helped a great deal.

795
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,560
It's no bother.

796
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,810
Recently, Cyber City

797
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:11,810
is developing

798
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,070
a new security system.

799
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,360
I hope that

800
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,210
we can help with

801
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,800
your composite drawing

802
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,050
in the future.

803
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,360
Thank you.

804
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,860
I think it's a good thing.

805
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,050
Who is it?

806
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,650
Mr Lei.

807
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,120
What's the matter?

808
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,630
I'd like to ask you some questions.

809
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,700
Have you been to

810
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,100
the Xinshan Exhibition Hall four days ago?

811
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,199
Lei Hao, speak up!

812
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,610
Yes.

813
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,239
Why did you do that?

814
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,510
Because he admires you.

815
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,920
Admires me?

816
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,370
What would you have done

817
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,570
when you see your page

818
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:26,730
in a magazine?

819
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,000
I'll tear it out

820
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,130
and keep it.

821
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:35,620
You must be careful when you do that, right?

822
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,090
I'll lay a pad

823
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,520
and cut it down

824
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,250
inch by inch with a paper knife.

825
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:45,900
The same goes for

826
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,960
the photo cutouts.

827
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,100
The person who damaged the photos

828
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,170
didn't mean any harm.

829
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,770
He really liked them,

830
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,740
so he wanted to keep them.

831
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,440
He cut the photos

832
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,440
and pieced them together.

833
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,770
He made it into

834
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,450
what he really wanted.

835
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,880
Mr Lei.

836
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,760
If you admire me,

837
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,420
why did you cancel the contract with me?

838
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,240
When I first saw you,

839
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:04,850
you had me

840
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,890
riveted

841
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,210
with your cynicism.

842
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,580
You have been my source of inspiration.

843
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,210
But I didn't expect you

844
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,630
to enter into the showbiz industry

845
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,140
to gain more popularity.

846
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,680
You began to please

847
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,510
and entertain the public.

848
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,360
You no longer

849
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:32,980
dress up and make-up

850
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,320
in your old ways.

851
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,410
Your beauty

852
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,570
died away.

853
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:50,980
I brought

854
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,040
these photos back

855
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,850
because I want to tell you

856
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,550
that there's one man

857
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,170
who devoutly likes

858
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,360
the old you.

859
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,880
I will treasure

860
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,290
my muse forever.

861
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,130
Hello?

862
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,440
How are things at your end?

863
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,440
Is it not over yet?

864
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,560
[Almost.]

865
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,880
The photos were not cut out

866
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,600
for venting or threatening.

867
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,200
It's an appreciation.

868
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,250
[And...]

869
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,200
[Cheng!]

870
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,520
[You are drunk.]

871
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,720
Come over here!

872
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,280
Hurry.

873
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,730
Stop talking to him.

874
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,890
Let's have a drink.

875
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,440
Officer Du.

876
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,310
Thanks for your help today.

877
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,920
Let me treat you to dinner.

878
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,480
No need.

879
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,810
I'm glad it's resolved.

880
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,180
I've got things to do.

881
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,280
Goodbye.

882
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,920
Hi.

883
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:14,890
Come.

884
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:15,260
Thanks.

885
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,700
Would you two raise a toast?

886
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,660
Don't just look after your own interests.

887
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,170
Please look after my company.

888
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:20,610
All right?

889
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:21,280
All right.

890
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,300
Are you drunk?

891
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,660
Don't drink if it isn't for you.

892
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,090
You took longer than I thought.

893
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,240
You had noticed it, right?

894
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,370
He didn't cut out the photos

895
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,520
because of hatred.

896
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,540
You always

897
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,850
believe the worst.

898
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,070
That's why it took you so long.

899
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,760
I can't help it.

900
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,640
I'm used to being a policeman.

901
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,020
It is an old bad habit,

902
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,040
isn't it?

903
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,470
What do you mean?

904
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,210
I mean,

905
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,560
you did everything to gain attention

906
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,360
in the worst way.

907
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,520
For example...

908
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:31,680
For...

909
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,000
For example,

910
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,350
you smashed the headmaster's car.

911
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:36,900
How did you...

912
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,000
Cheers!

913
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,540
I wish you a prosperous business.

914
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,120
Come.

915
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,870
My sister told you that?

916
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,300
Don't believe her cock-and-bull story.

917
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,370
Don't believe her

918
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:48,780
just because

919
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,290
she treats you well.

920
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,560
She wants to know

921
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,880
everything about me.

922
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,880
So she tries hard

923
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,340
to sweet-talk my friends.

924
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,420
Jiang Feng and others fall for this.

925
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,370
Are we friends?

926
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,900
Your sister is tough.

927
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,710
She deals with every situation

928
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,400
as if she's at home.

929
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,920
She is good at everything,

930
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,920
except that she is too caring to me.

931
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,890
As a child, I was fearless.

932
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,570
I feared no one but her.

933
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,080
Not just me.

934
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,850
I remember there was a time

935
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,060
we children threw down the gauntlet.

936
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,320
Many people came.

937
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,950
When they heard that my sister was Du Qing,

938
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,200
they cursed and pulled back.

939
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,010
They said I was lucky.

940
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,690
Isn't it exasperating?

941
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,280
You are showing off.

942
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,760
But you are really fortunate.

943
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,050
Not everyone

944
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,610
has someone

945
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,120
he is committed to.

946
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:04,650
Indeed.

947
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:06,570
Besides my sister,

948
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,980
I still have Jiang Feng, Li Han,

949
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,420
He Rongyue, Yan,

950
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,680
Bureau Chief Zhang...

951
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:19,330
And you.

952
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,770
We are all friends

953
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,040
and mates.
