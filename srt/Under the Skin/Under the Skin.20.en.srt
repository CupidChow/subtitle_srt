Who is it?

13
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:55,570
It's me.

14
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,440
Why are you here again?

15
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,490
Congratulations, Captain Du.

Further examination by

18

the tech and

19
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,140
investigation department

20
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,780
has confirmed that the hotel surveillance video and

21
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,180
the anonymously reported audio clip

22
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,130
were all fakes.

23
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,050
Besides the Huige Hotel

24
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:19,840
video,

25
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,420
Zhou Jun's library video

26
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,600
is also a fake.

27
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,660
And they both

28
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,410
use

29
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,410
Cyber City's security systems.

30
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,100
They have all the raw data

31
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,760
from these security systems.

32
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,690
So they are more likely to

33
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,240
tamper with it.

34
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,610
Also,

35
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,560
the Cyber City confirmed that

36
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,829
the fake video evidence against you was genuine.

37
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,740
They clearly wanted to hide the fact

38
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,940
that they had tampered with the system.

39
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,510
What else did you find?

40
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,220
We also found out that

41
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,610
the big boss's voice

42
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,579
that M heard

43
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:54,370
on the phone

44
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,760
was in fact the audio

45
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,540
from Chen Zhou's presentation video in Cyber City.

46
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,650
So we suspect that

47
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,800
the question mark in M's notebook

48
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,230
refers to Chen Zhou.

49
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,360
Captain Cheng,

50
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,010
I have good news.

51
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:08,890
Captain Cheng.

52
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,600
Welcome back.

53
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,900
Chen Zhou will have a launching event

54
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,210
at 8 p.m. tomorrow

55
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,130
for the official release

56
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,930
of Silver Hawk Security System.

57
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,290
We have learned that

58
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,960
several big mobile phone manufacturers

59
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,050
were also invited.

60
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,130
During the event,

61
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,970
they will officially

62
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,570
sign the framework agreement

63
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,100
for future collaborations.

64
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,100
Once it's signed,

65
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,360
over 80 per cent of mobile phones in Beijiang

66
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,200
will have their

67
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,860
security systems installed.

68
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,650
That means

69
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,079
most people in Beijiang

70
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,060
will have zero privacy

71
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,120
against Chen Zhou.

72
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,160
That's his hidden trump card.

73
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,500
So we must

74
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,730
identify his flaws

75
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:54,860
before he succeeds.

76
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:56,420
I've collected some

77
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,750
information about him.

78
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,010
He often said

79
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,270
in the past interviews

80
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,530
that he once created

81
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,840
a forum in high school.

82
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,410
It was

83
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,740
very popular back then.

84
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,290
For once, he was even

85
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:07,930
called

86
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,410
a legend because of it.

87
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,530
But soon after,

88
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,720
the school had to shut it down

89
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,580
because students were making extreme remarks.

90
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,490
But we still can

91
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,490
find traces of it.

92
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,370
The forum

93
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,280
["Mr Chen Zhou" This is the place to speak your heart out.]

94
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,460
was the predecessor of Zero Contact

95
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,260
and the beginning of his crimes.

96
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:26,860
The cyber police

97
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,190
are probing Chen Zhou's

98
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,140
equipment

99
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,740
which holds all the secrets.

100
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,740
Once the result is out,

101
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,540
we'll take action.

102
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,170
Yes, sir.

103
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,490
This is confirmed to be the main host.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,050
[Failed to access host, close window and try again.]

105
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,050
Its parameters are

106
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:55,780
very different

107
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,840
from other hosts.

108
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,140
[Failed to access host, close window and try again.]

109
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,610
It also has

110
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,570
a stronger defence against cyberattacks.

111
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,640
I've been trying to access it.

112
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,360
But if I fail more than three times,

113
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,150
[Failed to access host, close window and try again.]

114
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,650
its data will self-destruct and

115
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,110
be impossible to recover.

116
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,930
Is there

117
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,330
another way to decrypt it?

118
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,100
I've analysed

119
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,240
the data stream.

120
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,860
There should be a remote console

121
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,390
[Failed to access host, close window and try again.]

122
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,970
that can control and access

123
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:12,760
this host.

124
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,750
If we find the remote console,

125
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,400
can we access the data?

126
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,880
Chen Zhou probably

127
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,820
carries it with him at all times.

128
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,360
I guess it must be his phone.

129
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,290
Yet, without the passcode,

130
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,350
we can't access it.

[Beijiang Sub-Bureau]

132
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,370
By forcing our way in,

133
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,980
all the data will be destroyed.

134
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,900
Yes. We need to know the passcode

135
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,500
in order to access it safely.

136
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,580
Can we get confirmation of

137
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,260
the event's

138
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,540
itinerary and media presence?

139
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,130
Yes.

140
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,360
Fine.

141
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,400
I'll find a way

142
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,950
to figure out the passcode.

143
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,800
Is it possible the target host

144
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,260
is

145
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,080
just a laptop?

146
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,650
No.

147
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,300
Because multiple hosts are sharing

148
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,730
the same local area network

149
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,790
as the target host.

150
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,409
Chen Zhou's notebook

151
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,610
is one of them,

152
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,860
and it will be the first

153
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,720
to be ruled out.

154
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:00,880
Multiple?

155
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,300
I may have guessed it right.

156
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,650
The equipment

157
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,100
which holds all the secrets

158
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,730
must be

159
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,440
hidden away

160
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,700
in Chen Zhou's office.

161
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,170
We can't search the place

162
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,170
if we don't have evidence.

163
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,020
So how do we legally

164
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,620
enter Cyber City and find it?

165
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,460
Du Cheng.

166
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,130
How many times must I tell you?

167
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,480
It's just speculation.

168
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,410
There's no evidence.

169
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,290
We will have evidence

170
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,690
once we locate that host.

171
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,370
What if

172
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,750
you can't find any evidence?

173
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,360
Don't you trust

174
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,659
me and Shen Yi's judgement?

175
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,730
Of course I believe in you.

176
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,810
But I don't have

177
