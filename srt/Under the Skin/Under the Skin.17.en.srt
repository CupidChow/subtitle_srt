from the crime scene.

This is one of them.

352

These glass pieces are very thin.

353
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:25,900
And every piece

354
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,290
has a curve to it.

355
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,670
For its thickness,

356
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,570
it gets thicker in the middle.

357
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,330

358
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,429
it's something similar

00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:35,850
