[Du Cheng fought Zhou Jun back.]

182

183

[At this time,]

184
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,040
[Zhou Jun stood facing Du Cheng.]

185
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,930
[The glass partition on his right happened]

186
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,590
[to reflect his silhouette.]

187
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,950
[The silhouette was captured]

188
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,020
[by a surveillance camera located diagonally opposite]

189
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,330
[above the glass.]

190
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,610
So

191
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,020
the surveillance camera

192
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,460
couldn't have caught Du Cheng.

193
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,220
This is unbelievable.

194
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,420
Shen Yi, well done.

195
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,460
I knew the video

196
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,450
had been tampered with.

197
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,330
What did I tell you?

198
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,140
Captain Cheng is not the murderer.

199
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,940
That's right.

200
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,050
Zhou Jun is

201
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,130
M's true murderer.

202
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,000
Your reasoning is brilliant.

203
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,940
But this is only based on

204
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,380
the descriptions from Du Cheng's perspective

205
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,510
and your deduction.

206
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,370
It can't be used to prove a statement.

207
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,420
But I think this reasoning

208
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,240
stands.

209
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,410
Of course,

210
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:13,970
all this is based on

00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:14,970

212
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,320
I trust Captain Cheng for sure.

What do you think?

You killed M

233

to avenge Lei Yifei.

234
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,680
After that, you took her diary

235
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,020
and destroyed the evidence,

236
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,700
intending to cover up the truth.

237
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,810
Let's say

238
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,420
you were the person behind

239
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,080
the international trafficking organization.

240
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,410
You were clever,

00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,600
and business was going smoothly.

242
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,370
But you were found out

243
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,660
by the police seven years ago.

244
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,300
You had no choice but to kill the police officer.

245
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,090
While

246
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,860
the authorities were after you,

247
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,330
a core member of your organization

248
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,210
disappeared

249
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,940
with a confidential document.

250
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,850
That document could bring you

251
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,050
to your fall.

252
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,980
So you had to dissolve the organization.

253
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,740
But this matter was

254
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,440
constantly bothering you.

257
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,770
You also noticed

258
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,730
that she's trying

259
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,500
to get close to a police officer.

260
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,900
How would you feel, then?

00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,170
Extremely anxious.

262
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:10,810
Exactly.

"Why is she approaching that police?"

264
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,330
"Will she give

265
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,930
that vital document to him?"

266
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,370

267
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,520
that document,

268

I can understand if he wants to kill the traitor.

273
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,960
But why does he want to get rid of the police?

274

275

Why?

276

Killing a police officer

277

the girls abducted and trafficked

We figured out the cause of death.

He died from photosensitive epileptic seizures.

361

Photosensitive epilepsy?

362
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,890
Photosensitive epilepsy is triggered

363
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,890
by a light source,

364
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:45,610

a cerebral spasm response.

368

He died

No wonder there weren't any injuries.

He died rather oddly.

Epileptic response induced

377
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,290

the most common reflex epilepsy.

The most famous case is

380
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,770
the one happened at the end of 1997.

381

That's odd.

392
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,810

a code?

When I ran this code,

397
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,440
it became like this.

This is it.

This isn't an accident.

405
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,260
He was murdered.

It's also the tool that killed him.

409

411

any antivirus software on his computer?

413
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,010
He installed

414
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,590
Cyber City's latest security system software.

415
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,170
Logically speaking,

416
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,460
this virus wouldn't be able to penetrate the system.

417

his system log.

419

00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,790
the security system

421
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,840

tomorrow morning.

429
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,740

if there's a chance for us to work together.

692
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,690
Excuse me, Miss Du.

693
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,550
Let me take this call.

694
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,090
Sure.

695
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,320
Hello?

696
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,150
Yes, what's the matter?

697
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,760
I'll get back to you later.

698
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,560
Sorry about that, Miss Du.

699
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,620
We've been looking forward

700
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,810
to cooperating

701
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,850
with you.

702
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,500
That's wonderful.

703
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,250
Your secretary showed

704
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,450
us around.

705
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,650
I had no idea it was this advanced.

706
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,090
It was such an eye-opener.

707
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:21,810
How about this?

708
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:22,360
I'll get my subordinate

709
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,170
to follow up

710
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,230
with your co-workers when I get back.

711
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:25,900
At the same time,

712
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,220
we'll help you expand the market

713
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,840
through our channels.

714
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,340
That'd be a great honor.

715
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:30,930
If you have the time,

716
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,860
I'll treat you to a meal

717
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,200
to express my thanks.

718
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,350
You're too kind.

719
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,180
Officer Shen,

720
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,990
join us if you have the time.

721
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,040
Sure.

722
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:39,980
By the way,

723
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,100
do you like

724
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,640
to play chess?

725
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,650
I do.

726
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,760
Chess is a war between two sides.

727
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,510
It's pretty interesting.

728
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,170
Are you interested

729
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,250
in chess too?

730
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,220
I play occasionally.

731
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,100
Are you interested in playing one round with me?

732
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,640
Sure.

733
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,380
We can play as we chat.

734
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:03,850
Sure.

735
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,890
I'm not good

736
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,780
at playing chess.

737
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,820
So I won't be joining.

738
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,690
You guys can go ahead.

739
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,640
I have another appointment later.

740
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,580
I'll get going first.

741
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,180
All right.

742
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,720
We'll talk about the details after this.

743
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,100
Sure, Miss Du.

744
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,160
All right, see you.

745
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,050
Shall we, Officer Shen?

746
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:18,600
Sure.

747
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,690
"King's Gambit."

748
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,450
Attack the center soldiers at the beginning

749
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,380
to seize the main control of the center.

750
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,090
Abandoning the pawn may increase

751
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,810
the speed of spreading out.

752
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,540
But the King's defense will become

753
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,400
weak.

754
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,410
Mr Chen,

755
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,220
you're using a gambler's style.

756
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,000
Aren't pawns meant to be sacrificed?

757
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:52,170
Looks like not only do you know how to play chess,

758
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,720
but you're also good at it.

759
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,010
How about a rapid game?

760
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,660
Since we're playing,

761
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,380
let's play something more interesting.

762
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,180
How about Fischer random chess?

763
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,200
Sure.

764
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,080
Shall we?

765
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,520
Officer Shen,

766
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:38,100
the braver one wins when meeting on a narrow road.

767
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,090
If you continue

768
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,610
to play conservatively,

769
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,540
you'll only lose

770
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,280
at every move.

771
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,670
I've taken down your queen,

772
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,360
how many pawns do you have left to sacrifice?

773
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,010
Any of the pawns

774
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,460
that manages to test your bottom line will be promoted

775
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,530
as the queen.

776
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,270
Now, I'm using a queen

777
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,460
to change the offense of the whole game.

778
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,260
It's worth it.

779
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,840
What an excellent move.

780
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,600
Officer Shen,

781
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,409
you're a professional.

782
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,800
I have a good mentor,

783
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:19,980
Du Shang.

784
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,330
He said this once,

785
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,260
"chess is

786
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,570
a silent knowledge."

787
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,550
Didn't you stay back to play chess with me

788
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,960
because you have something to ask me?

789
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,100
I wanted to.

790
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,659
But your chess move

791
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,469
has already given me the answer.

792
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,380
From Lei Yifei's death,

793
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,510
M's death,

794
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:51,980
Du Cheng being falsely accused,

795
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,949
and Zhou Jun's death.

796
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:54,080
When every case was

797
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,630
about to come to light,

798
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,410
there would always be

799
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,180
an invisible hand

800
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,040
that suddenly erased all traces.

801
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,890
That's because the opponent had predicted

802
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:12,770
your move.

803
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,810
It's just like playing chess.

804
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,680
Before making any move,

805
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,540
the chess player must predict

806
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,390
at least 50 moves in advance.

807
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,780
You've met

808
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,010
an expert in calculations.

809
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,210
Have you ever calculated

810
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,360
how many pawns you will lose

811
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,090
in the next game?

812
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,170
Some pawns are meant

813
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,860
to exist

814
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,860
to be sacrificed.

815
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,360
Was Zhou Jun one of your pawns?

816
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,390
I said

817
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,410
"King's Gambit" is

818
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,140
the beginning of a gambler.

819
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,260
So

820
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,040
if you keep sacrificing your pawns,

821
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,090
Mr Chen,

822
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,510
you won't be able to win.

823
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,520
Your chess style is very fierce.

824
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,720
I've studied your biographical data.

825
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:27,900
Early this year,

826
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,300
you developed an application called

827
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,890
"Zero Contact."

828
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,670
I didn't get it wrong, right?

829
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,110
Users can use it for free

830
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:38,950
by sharing the address,

831
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,760
information,

832
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,960
and emotional status

833
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,100
of all single women nearby.

834
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,430
But these women know

835
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,580
nothing about this at all.

836
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,050
Preferential information

837
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,590
and knowledge resources can be shared.

838
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,250
Why not

839
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,450
a person's information?

840
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,340
I only provide

841
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,690
some conveniences through technology.

842
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,650
But this technology has become

843
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,380
a tool for human trafficking.

844
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,190
All these years,

845
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,210
your skills have been improving.

846
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,430
You now have almost total control

847
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,830
of Beijiang's surveillance in your hands.

848
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,250
With the convenience of your technology,

849
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,660
it should be a piece of cake

850
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:25,230
to tamper with one or two surveillance cameras, right?

851
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,630
If you're planning to continue with these questions,

852
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,680
I'll have to call

853
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,560
my lawyer

854
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,020
to answer your questions.

855
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,040
Mr Chen,

856
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,870
it's your turn to make a move.

857
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,420
You killed

858
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,350
those who may have leaked your information.

859
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,400
You framed

860
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,870
the one who suspected you.

861
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,160
Have you ever thought

862
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,910
how dangerous it is

863
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,140
when the king is left

864
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,400
all alone

865
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,300
on the chessboard?

866
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,770
If you dare to be a lonely king,

867
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,820
of course, you'll leave yourself a way out.

868
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,120
Silver Hawk System

869
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,170
will be officially signed and released

870
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,940
in a few more days.

871
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,870
Most of the citizens of Beijiang will use

872
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,260
my security system.

873
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,230
This is a great trust.

874
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:19,960
Cyber City

875
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,890
will do its best

876
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:23,990
to protect the privacy and safety

877
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,250
of every citizen.

878
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,730
If you're interested,

879
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:28,860
you're welcome

880
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,660
to attend our press conference.

881
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,100
You will have a new understanding

882
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,680
of the power of science and technology.

883
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:39,820
I'll be there.

884
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,100
I must witness

885
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,160
how you will clean up

886
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,540
this mess.

887
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,730
If we continue with this game,

888
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,130
it's likely

889
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,980
to be a draw.

890
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:56,580
But I never seek

891
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,920
for a draw.

892
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:58,850
Likewise.

893
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,210
I prefer winning too.

894
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,740
Seems like we can't continue with this game anymore.

895
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,850
I still need to prepare for my press conference.

896
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,250
Let's meet another time.

897
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,470
Qing.

898
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,070
How did it go?

899
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,300
I found out about his trump card.

900
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,140
What is it?

901
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:29,170
After Silver Hawk System is released in the market,

902
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,010
he'll have control

903
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:33,070
over the private information of Beijiang's citizens.

904
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,010
Eight million people's privacy

905
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,140
for another person.

906
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,200
This card is extreme.

907
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,550
Judging from the security level here,

908
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,320
the place where he hides the secret should be

909
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,790
his office.

910
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,980
But we didn't see

911
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,070
anything out of the ordinary

912
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,250
in his office.

913
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,730
I still have some guesses

914
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,130
that need to be verified.

915
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,070
Since we've already made a move,

916
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,460
we'll just see what happens

917
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,120
during the press conference.

918
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:02,980
Shen Yi,

919
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,240
thank you

920
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,630
for trusting him.

921
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,920
Tell me if you're in trouble.

922
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,490
I'm not going to let him off easy

923
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,670
for setting up my little brother.

924
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,360
Don't worry.

925
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,530
He can't escape.

926
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:26,920
Since he's sure

927
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,250
that technology can control everything,

928
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,830
I'll beat him with the weapon

929
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,600
I'm good at.
