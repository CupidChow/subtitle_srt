the attention people give to him.

has one victim

146
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,380
and the second one in the plant

147
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,640
has one victim as well.

148
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,820
He did not try

149
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,860
to expand his influence

150
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,900

Therefore, I think

154
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,220

159
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,060
But this is all

Our bomber

716
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,300
Liu Xiaochen and Wang Xingjun

717
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,160
have similar facial structures.

718
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,080
So he mistook Wang Xingjun

719
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,770
for Liu Xiaochen.

720

00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,120
his targets?

724
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:14,780
Face blindness,

725
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,810
also known as prosopagnosia,

726
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,300
refers to the inability to recognize human faces.

727
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,370
He has it.

728
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,880
So he drew these

729
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,860
to distinguish different targets.

730
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,800
But his drawings are so abstract.

731
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,620
Those who have face blindness

732
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,980
can only recognize someone

733
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,110
by identifying a certain facial part.

734
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,490
After Li Junwei takes this drug,

735
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,010
he can identify

736
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,410
the most unique feature of someone's face.

737
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,680
He'll draw it

738
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,440
and this is the result.

739
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,280
These drawings

740
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,730
hide the markings

741
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,730
Li Junwei use to recognize someone.

742
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,140
Even though

743
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,000
he can recognize people this way,

744
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,970
it's prone to error too.

745
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,900
He killed him by accident

746
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,470
because of his face blindness.

747
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,320
Therefore, Liu Xiaochen is still alive.

he inherited the toy shop from his father.

Impossible.

but in his mind,

784
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:04,610
he has a rough idea

785

of what these few people look like.

786
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,520
I used Zhao Jianyu and Zhang Weifeng

787

the markings he used to identify people.

I will never be mistaken.

790
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,930
Since Li Junwei's targets

791
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,980
are associated with the summer camp,

792

should be Liu Xiaochen.

what we should do now
