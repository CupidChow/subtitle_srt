someone's here to see you.

Follow me to the visiting room.

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,150
Why?

182
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,490
Is it a man or a woman?

183
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,180
A man.

Chu Yingzi.

You're good-looking.

Today's worth it.

Thank you.

190

You look good too.

191
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,540
Strictly speaking, you're beautiful.

192
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,740
Your face is completely symmetrical.

193

The proportion ratios of your face are

194
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,440
also balanced.

195

Your face can be

196

I believe that.

202
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,330
But none of what they said were

203

This must be

what you looked like when you were around 12 to 13, right?

210

Have you seen

the pictures of me when I was younger?

212
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,560
No.

213
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,170
I just drew

214
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,260
a younger you

You're here to do a composite drawing.

All right. I'll tell you.

What about these?

230

But every composite drawing is different.

After that,

282
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,350
I saw his eyes.

283
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,880
You're lying.

284
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,970
Let me finish.

285
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,420
The last one,

286
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,000
I wanted to see his lips clearly.

287
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,800
You started lying from the eyes.

288
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:12,730
When the light of the lighter is close

290
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,339

involuntarily

292
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,270
due to the light.

293
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,349
It'll never be like what you said.

294
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,849
Your lips are dull.

295
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,560
It's pointless.

296
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,620
Your beauty was once

297
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,640
your proudest weapon.

298

But

299

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,880
You can no longer impress anyone.

301
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,080
A person's look is influenced by the heart.

302

Most murderers' faces become

303

gloomy and horrible.

304
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:57,920
That's

305
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,050
because they have lost their humanity

306
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,590
from the moment they murder another human being.

307
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,440
Only the look

308
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,040
of a hideous wild beast remains on their faces.

309
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,150
For you.

But you chose

to commit crimes with him.

316

I'll kill you if you run!

go first.

Hands over your head and get on the ground!

Where is he?

Where is he?

Why are you here?

It's been seven years.

You disappeared completely.

00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:55,770
I thought

547
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,370
you vanished out of thin air.

00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,070

many people want your paintings?

what you're doing now as art?
