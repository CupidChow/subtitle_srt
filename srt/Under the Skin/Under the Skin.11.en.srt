But all of his stab wounds

695
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,010
were created

696
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,410
from a horizontal angle.

697
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,580
[Police]

698
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,080
Captain Cheng,

699
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:24,940
we revisited

700
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,140
the crime scene at Chen Qiuwen's place.

701
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,320
This stun gun was found in the green zone

702
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,450
down the apartment.

703
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,310
Her fingerprints are on it.

704
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,640
Time for her to tell us the truth.
