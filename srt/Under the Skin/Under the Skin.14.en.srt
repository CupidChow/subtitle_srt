00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,620
Why are you here?

10
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,660
When a stone falls into the river,

11
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,460
it echoes.

12
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,450
But when a human falls into the river,

13
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,720
it's total silence.

14
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,579
All my teacher's

15
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:36,110
paintings are here, right?

16
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,170
I'd like to sort them out and

17
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,000
organise an exhibition for him.

18
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,400
What for?

19
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,380
Is it

20
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,680
to commemorate him?

21
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,010
He's no longer with us.

22
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,940
So what's the point?

23
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,740
Although he's gone,

24
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,160
his paintings are still here.

25
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,530
During his lifetime,

26
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,760
no one has ever seen his paintings.

27
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,100
And those paintings

28
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,740
are just art materials that

29
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,800
will soon become worthless.

30
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,840
All right.

31
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,010
I won't stop you from

32
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,520
doing so.

33
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,910
But I have one condition.

34
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,079
It has to be a joint exhibition

35
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,130
with you.

36
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,900
I'm not interested.

37
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,860
If you do not wish to be exposed,

38
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,630
come back and paint a real one.

39
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,570
After all, he's your teacher.

40
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,060
He's also your teacher.

41

I have a few questions.

49
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,810
Have you seen him before?

50
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,960
Yes, I have.

51
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,060
He sold a few paintings to me before.

52
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,130
In fact, he should be here later.

53
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,770
No, he won't.

54
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,420
This is the last one.

55
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,410
Shen Yi painted this?

56
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,240
You're quite an expert.

57
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,560
This is

58
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,200
one of Shen Yi's final works

59
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,540
from seven years ago.

60
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,590
Look at the colour.

61
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,520
He's such

62
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,610
a talent.

63
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,310
Did the seller

64
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,950
say where this painting came from?

65
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,010
He said it was part of his collection.

66
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,140
Back then,

67
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,800
he brought me a few paintings.

68
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,950
But they

69
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,380
were from an unknown artist,

70
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,510
so I didn't buy them.

71
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,690
After that,

72
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,530
he brought me

73
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,130
a few of Shen Yi's paintings.

74
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,390
I had to give that a good thought.

75
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,830
He must have been short of money.

76
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,490
Otherwise,

77
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,780
he wouldn't have given up his precious collection.

78
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,670
This is Shen Yi's work from seven years ago.

79
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,240
What's so strange about it?

80
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,740
His senior told me that

81
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,670
Shen Yi burnt all his paintings

82
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,600

83
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,580
So this is the last remaining one?

84
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,160
Not really.

There are only two possibilities.

88
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,210
Either his senior lied to me,

89
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,630
or

90
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,270
these signed paintings

91

112
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,320
Perhaps, I left out

113
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,030
a few.

114
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,580

115

raise that much money on his own,

135
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,860

or keep to yourself.

155

Also,

353
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,400
based on the reflection of his pupils,

354
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,000
there must be another light source

But judging by the shadows,

358
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,060
the light source seems

that's why Zhang Xiaoxue

the larger the quantity of photos is,

00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,350
the more natural the face-swapping effect is.

00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,460
What does he do?

873
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,850
He's a salesman at an IT store,

874
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,970
and he was doing quite well.

875
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,050
He

876
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,450
helped me rent the place.

877
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,520
Not long ago,

878
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,040
he told me he quit.

879
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,140
But he never looked for a new job.

880
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,840
When did you break up?

881
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,130
Last week.

882
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,840
Why did you break up?

883
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,570
He's always on a business trip.

884
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,970
And he's usually gone for at least ten days.

885
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,180
Although we've been

886
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,650
together for so many years,

887
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,740
I have no idea

888
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,260
why he's always busy.

889
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,740
Has he committed a crime?

890
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,080
How long

891
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,550
is the sentence for fraud?

892
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,410
Around three to ten years.

893
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,370
Hu Zhifeng's location is identified.

894
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,800
The budget hotel along Beixin Street,

895
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,310
[Result: Budget Hotel, Room 318]

896
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:05,980
room 318.

897
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,010
Jiang Feng,

898
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,190
call for a meeting

899
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,900
to formulate our arrest plan.

900
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:10,680
Okay.

901
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,540
Shen Yi, you...

902
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,980
Where did he go?

903
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,090
No idea.
