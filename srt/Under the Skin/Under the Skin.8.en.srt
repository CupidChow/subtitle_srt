I know how it's done now.

20
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,329
From the intersection where

21
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:27,290
Wen Jing and Hua Muyao met,

22
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,010
to the small house by the outskirt,

23
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,100
and then to the place where the ransom was paid.

24
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,530
I've run through them once.

25
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,490
I could do all of those things

26
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,880
alone.

27
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,480
Is my sketch a mistake then?

28
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,820
It's unlike of you.

29
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,110
The hunter of all things elusive

30
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,710
can have a crisis of faith too.

31
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,550
After all,

32
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,970
you're someone who can

33
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,030
reconstruct someone's face from a skull.

34
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,040
But it's fine.

35
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,140
Personality is harder to draw.

36
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,870
It's normal if you're stumped.

37
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,400
Skull...

38
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,020
Duan's and Wen Jing's skull

39
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,070
are the same.

40
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,960
So that means

41
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,909
they are the same person?

42
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,650
Perhaps it's not just them.

43
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,260
Sir,

44
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,110
when can I leave?

45
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,540
Soon.

46
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,920
We're almost there.

47
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,400
We have identified them.

48
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,700
You need to tell us if you know them.

49
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,450
This is

50
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,180
Wen Jing, identified by Hua Muyao.

51
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,500
This is

52
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,610
Duan, identified by you.

53
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,060
And this person here.

54
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,680
Do you know him?

55
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,280
It's...

56
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,210
It's me.

57
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,090
Exactly.

58
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,520
The skull outline of these three faces

59
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,650
overlap perfectly.

60
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,690
What does this mean?

61
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,120
I don't get it.

62
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,909
It might not be obvious

63
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,090
with 2D paintings.

64
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,470
Let's try 3D.

65
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,680
This is a sculpture of Duan's face.

66
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,040
This is yours.

67
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,390
Wen Jing.

68
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,570
Duan.

69
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,090
You disguised as them.

70
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,030
Impossible.

71
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,200
No one can transform

72
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,460
into two completely different individuals

73
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,890
without slipping up.

74
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,040
We searched your home

75
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,930
and found konjacs and pig's trotters

76
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,810
in your fridge.

77
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,800
Konjac contains a lot of hydrocolloids.

78
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,770
When you mix it with alkali,

79
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,430
you can obtain an elastic gel.

80
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,010
Coupled with the gelatine you get from cooking the pig's trotter,

81
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,060
you can produce artificial skin

82
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,159
with lifelike color and texture.

83
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,390
If its concentration is high enough,

84
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,650
you can even keep its original

85
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,610
skin color.

86
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,200
This is merely your supposition.

87
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,500
You don't have the right to say

88
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,680
who this sculpture represents.

89
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,810
Also, how sure are you of your drawing?

90
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,750
I drew this Duan according

91
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,220
to your description.

92
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,409
What does this have anything to do with me?

93
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,409
Of course it does.

94
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,070
Your signature is on it.

95
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,670
[I testify this is Duan. Chen Mingfeng]

96
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,470
This is not evidence.

97
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,200
Wrong.

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,470
This is key evidence.

99
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,890
[I testify this is Duan. Chen Mingfeng]

100
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,200
[We realized that the handwriting of]

101
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,800
["Chen" in Wen Jing's love letter to Hua Muyao]

102
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,390
[is very similar to the "Chen"]

103
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,490
[in Chen Tingfei's signature.]

104
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,220
[And so we looked into]

105
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,550
[Chen Tingfei's info.]

106
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,720
Chen Tingfei changed

107
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,940
his name once.

108
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,610
[Chen Tingfei]

109
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,500
Before the National College Entrance Examination,

110
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,120
he changed his name to Chen Mingfeng.

111
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,780
Four years later, he reverted to his birth name.

112
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,130
Chen Tingfei took your identity

113
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,310
and went to the university.

114
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,970
But your handwriting is good.

115
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,080
To make sure no one found out,

116
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,380
he spent a long time imitating

117
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,640
your handwriting.

118
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,450
Thus, his handwriting

119
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,890
and Wen Jing's are almost identical.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,670
This is your signature

121
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,350
from when you were interrogated.

122
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,010
Everything is premeditated.

123
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,050
You faked your handwriting first

124
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,780
and intentionally botched it.

125
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,570
That's how you convey

126
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,050
the difference between Wen Jing and Chen Mingfeng.

127
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,020
There are several pivotal elements to handwriting.

128
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,620
The stroke order, the strength used,

129
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,670
and the point of pressure.

130
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,420
Everyone writes

131
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,260
differently.

132
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,650
Let's have a look here.

133
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,830
At first glance, Wen Jing's and Chen Tingfei's

134
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,500
handwriting

135
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,760
are almost identical.

136
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,150
But their stroke order

137
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,670
and their point of pressure cannot be more different.

138
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,180
Wen Jing is used to starting from the side

139
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,440
[Summit]

140
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,440
before moving to the inside

141
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,370
while Chen Tingfei is the exact opposite.

142
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,580
[Chen Tingfei]

143
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,130
What about Chen Mingfeng?

144
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,330
[I testify this is Duan. Chen Mingfeng]

145
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,409
In terms of Chen Mingfeng's and Wen Jing's handwriting,

146
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:33,840
they share the same stroke order

147
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,919
[Summit]

148
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,740
and the same point of pressure.

149
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:36,610
In other words,

150
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,080
based on the handwriting,

151
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,750
Chen Mingfeng and Wen Jing

152
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,220
might be the same person

153
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,080
but Wen Jing and Chen Tingfei

154
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,290
are not the same person.

155
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,980
Not only did you impersonate

156
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,360
the dashing Wen Jing,

157
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,630
you also impersonated Duan.

158
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,690
You then used Duan's name

159
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,660
to contact people with your phone

160
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,850
and misled everyone into thinking

161
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,070
that Wen Jing and Duan are two different persons.

162
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,080
Duan

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,930
is just another disguise of yours.

164
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,830
You were the only player

165
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,090
from the get-go.

166
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,780
But you used

167
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,040
your good handwriting

168
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,610
in your love letter to Hua Muyao.

169
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,480
It's because in your heart,

170
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,510
Wen Jing,

171
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,360
a handsome gentleman

172
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,380

00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:55,800
it seems like he forgot

347
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,810
someone.

348
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,300
A woman.

349
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,410
Patients can put their emotions

350
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,220
or moods into a drawing.

351
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,070
I can feel

352
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,750
what he's feeling inside

353
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,150
through these drawings.

354
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,060
I'm sure you can tell

355
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,540
that he's trying real hard

356
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,270
to find the woman in his memory.

357
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,700
He came to me thrice.

358
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,350
After several attempts,

359
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,990
he still can't get through the shadow of water.

360
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,980
Perhaps it's because he was nearly

361
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,820
drowned

362
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,080
so he was

363
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,640
traumatized by it?

364
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,050
It's the opposite, actually.

365
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,870
It's thanks to the

366
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,130
stimulation from the

367
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,790
drowning experience

368
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,790
that he started to recall that face.

369
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,810
But there's no progress, is there?

370
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,700
Just like this drawing,

371
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,500
the memory is veiled.

372
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,270
What's inside the water?

373
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,240
Nothing.

374
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,920
What's the matter?

375
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,510
You've looked under the weather lately.

376
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,770
Too much work?

377
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,450
Do you need a break?

378
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,180
I'm fine.

379
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,610
Perhaps I didn't

380
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,030
sleep well yesterday.

381
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,140
Bureau Chief Zhang.

382
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,320
When will you ever knock before

383
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,710
entering my office?

384
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,930
Next time.

385
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,470
The thing you asked for.

386
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,070
Thanks, Bureau Chief Zhang.

387
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,920
Why were you looking for me?

388
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:48,820
I...

389
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,610
I need Shen Yi to sketch something.

390
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,360
Are you just going to stare at me like that?

391
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,180
No.

392
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,990
I was just relaxing my mind

393
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,920
and spacing out.

394
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,390
Have you been

395
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,870
feeling a bit...

396
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,220
Yes?

397
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,140
Nothing.

398
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,590
[2nd Floor. Passage 1]

399
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,970
[Did you draw those murals]

400
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,590
[on the Beijiang Port?]

401
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,680
[Why did you go all the way there?]

402
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,980
[It's so remote.]

403
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,050
That place is quiet and less crowded.

404
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,990
There are many walls too.

405
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,610
I can draw whatever I want.

406
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,180
Your murals are good.

407
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,830
They are quite artistic.

408
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,350
You flatter me.

409
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,980
[Do you hand out free lunch here?]

410
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,220
[Yes.]

411
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,420
[Just a bento.]

412
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,300
Oh, well.

413
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,810
Guess this will take

414
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:33,990
a long while.

415
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,340
Is there someone looking at us

416
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,600
[from the other side?]

417
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,300
[Interesting.]

418
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,910
If I could draw the people inside here

419
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,040
from the other side,

420
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,960
it'd be very interesting.

421
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,500
[So,]

422
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,090
[when can I leave?]

423
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,530
Du Cheng.

424
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,930
My experience tells me

425
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,770
that this kid

426
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,570
has nothing to do with the case.

427
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,830
Someone must have tricked him

428
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,230
into drawing that mural.

429
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,380
[When can I leave?]

430
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:32,450
[Discipline Yourself]

431
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,680
Sit.

432
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,730
When can I leave?

433
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,530
Who drew this?

434
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,790
I did.

435
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,090
Who asked you to draw it?

436
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,070
I already answered that.

437
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,200
Answer it again.

438
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,490
A woman asked me to.

439
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,380
Do you recognize the person in the photo?

440
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,100
No.

441
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,760
Then how did you draw him then?

442
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,290
That woman

443
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,550
showed me a picture of him when he was young.

444
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,010
She then

445
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:56,920
asked me to draw what he'd look like as an adult.

446
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,790
And I did.

447
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,270
Are you messing with me?

448
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,890
Why would I?

449
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:02,900
Here.

450
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,560
Have you heard of age progression drawing?

451
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,180
It's not too hard for me.

452
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,560
I did it in a hurry

453
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,130
so it looks kind of rough.

454
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,760
This was you when you were eight.

455
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,790
[Can I go now?]

456
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,520
You met the woman,

457
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,030
is that right?

458
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,830
The woman who asked you

459
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,760
to draw.

460
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,840
What does she look like?

461
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,540
Since you're this good at drawing,

462
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,840
draw her then.

463
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,540
Can I leave

464
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,340
after I finish the drawing then?

465
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,240
I'll take your word.

466
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,490
I can't draw her.

467
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,480
What do you mean?

468
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,790
I can't remember what she looks like.

469
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,760
Stop horsing around.

470
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,440
You took a glance at me

471
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,580
and you drew the eight-year-old me.

472
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,290
You met that woman

473
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,750
and now you can't draw her?

474
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,160
I don't care.

475
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,830
You have to draw her today.

476
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,460
Draw her!

477
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,679
Draw.

478
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,480
Draw.

479
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,699
Draw!

480
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,790
I can't draw her!

481
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,260
Why am I supposed to remember her?

482
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,480
[I'm an artist,]

483
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,699
not a police officer!

484
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,409
You can't locate the suspect

485
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:28,590
so why pin it on me?

486
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,790
Your drawing killed a policeman!

487
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,760
Because of your drawing,

488
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,429
a policeman is dead.

489
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,110
He was the most important

490
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,110
person in my life.

491
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,000
Du Cheng.

492
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,600
He was a good cop.

493
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,100
Du Cheng.

494
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,409
He saved many lives.

495
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:48,409
If it weren't for your painting,

496
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:49,810
he could have saved more!

497
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:50,980
He's dead now!

498
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,190
You killed him!

499
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:54,090
Du Cheng, we have rules here.

500
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,940
I beg of you.

501
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,910
Draw her, please.

502
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,170
Just something.

503
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,180
An eyebrow.

504
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,480
Eyes. Nose. Mouth.

505
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:07,780
Just

506
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,200
draw whatever you can.

507
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,630
We'll take whatever.

508
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,430
You're the only person

509
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,140
who has met her.

510
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:12,900
If you can't draw her,

511
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,760
we will have nothing to work with.

512
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,320
I can't draw her!

513
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,800
I really can't.

514
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,330
I can't draw her.

515
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,790
Throw your pencil away.

516
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,130
Don't ever draw again.

517
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,050
Your painting kills.

518
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,600
You don't deserve to be a painter.

519
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,170
You're done?

520
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,410
Where are you going?

521
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,400
Mr. Shen.

522
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,390
Why does he look so distraught?

523
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,610
No idea.

524
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:11,920
The sketch is out.

525
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,050
Find the person now.

526
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,610
Good spot you picked here.

527
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,240
Perfect for jumping into the sea.

528
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,050
Go ahead and jump.

529
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,080
I won't stop you.

530
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,330
You've been following me?

531
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
What do you think?

532
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,080
I'm not coming all the way here

533
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,830
just for sightseeing.

534
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,760
For someone who thinks highly of himself,

535
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,190
what is troubling you?

536
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,720
I thought

537
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,920
anyone

538
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,140
I come into contact with

539
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:33,860
will never

540
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,330
disappear from my memory.

541
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,390
But that woman

542
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,460
is like an illusion.

543
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,740
I can never catch her face.

544
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,780
It's ancient history now.

545
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,300
It's normal if you can't recall her.

546
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,040
I know you care a lot

547
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,260
about that case.

548
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,710
Seven years ago,

549
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,140
after I finished drawing Captain Lei,

550
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,510
someone shoved me into this sea.

551
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,410
Thank you.

552
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,970
It's going to rain soon.

553
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,480
Be careful on your way home.

554
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,790
Follow me.

555
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,980
