Why did you kill him?

35
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,690
Because when a person

37
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,070

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,260
How did you figure out

71

The colour of her left little fingernail

75
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,810
is one shade brighter

76
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,890
than the rest.

77
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,220
What's the difference?

78
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,330
As an artist,

79
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,409
identifying colours

80
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:37,610
is just a basic skill.

81
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,409
Freshly painted nails

82
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,890

84
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,690
other nails.

85
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,450
Besides, painted nails will have

86
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,890
a tiny slit of clean nail.

87
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,040
It's a sign of nail growth.

88
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,500
But there's none on

89

freshly painted.

92
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,620

It's unexpected, isn't it?

135
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,880

147
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,580
Before Marat was killed,

148

his last words to the world

149

The names in the list

153
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,980
were dissidents whom

154

Marat wanted to execute.

155
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,960

meet Marat alone

157
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,520

into a philanthropist,

171
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,840

173

The history and scenes of paintings

174

There's no wisdom tooth.

527
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,500
It's probably a teenage girl.

528
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,420
Based on the length and

529
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,340
circumference of the skull,

530
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,520
she's probably 1.69

The skull's surface is smoother.

She's probably thin.

I'll be assisting you with your investigation.

00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,020
Are you aware of

557
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,420
this skull's condition?

558
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,710
This skull was

559
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,430
donated to us by a medical school.

560
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,570
For the past ten years, students have used it

561
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,660
to practice sketching

562
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,920
and prepare for exams.

00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,230
there's

565
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,790
no serial number on the skull?

566
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,300
I got transferred here four years ago.

567
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,940
I have no idea what had happened.

568
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,500
I did see a serial number on the skeleton.

569
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,250
I thought

570
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,470
this skull was part of it.

571
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:02,890
We

572
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:03,980
have to take it back

575
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,620
how the deceased looked like

576
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,020
by using his or her skull?

577
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,230
Portraits

578
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,830
were known as sketches in ancient times.

580
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,980
help her

581

tell the world who she was

582
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,760
one last time.

583
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,920
I would like to see

584
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,630
what she looked like.

585

586
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,070
the skull and skeleton

587
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,670
belonged to the same person.

588
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,210
Next,

589
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,600
we need to scan the skull

590
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,610
and key its overall length, width,

591
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,620
and height,

592
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,680
into the computer.

593
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,100
The AI will generate

594
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,360
a life-like portrait.

595
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,840

597

Captain Cheng, it's done.

598

599
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:41,710
What is this?

600
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,390
A portrait generated by artificial intelligence.

601
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,860
It's as accurate as it can get.

602

Shut it down.

603
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,740

who're 25 years old and below.

609

I don't think Shen Yi

610
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,980
is able to draw it.

611
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,370
Instead of relying on the skull,

612
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:20,310
we should just wait for the suspect to turn himself in.

613
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,700
Not necessary.

614
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,230
Memorize all these people's

615
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,070
faces,

616
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,920
as well as their personal information.

617

We

618

Oh, right.

621
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,510
Give a copy to Shen Yi.

622
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,770
Why?

623
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,070
For fairness' sake.

624
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:37,780
Otherwise,

625
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,310
he'd accuse me of bullying.

626
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,680
Got it, Captain Cheng.

627
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,250
She's clearly not on our side.

How is it, Mr Shen?

630
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,090
I'm marking the bone points.

631
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,500
Captain Cheng's team has

632
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,430
compiled these photos of

Why?

639
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,170
Wouldn't it be easier

640
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,030
to just look at real-life photos?

641
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,530
Without this skull,

But since I have it with me,

measure the soft tissue's thickness

647

to determine the muscle's shape

648

and thickness.

649
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,860
I don't want to be disrupted

Forensics concluded that

675

So,

679
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:46,540

681
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:49,770
Yes.

Furthermore,

683
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,880

her parents divorced when she was six.

685
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,000
She had lived with her mother ever since.

686
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,680
She had very few friends because

687
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,810
she was unsociable.

688
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,860
Her classmates and teachers

689
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,250
thought she was too sensitive

690
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,710
and hard to get along with.

691
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,590
This is a complicated case.

692

known to be sensitive,

694

let alone coming from a single-parent family.

695
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,380
They are more likely to have lonely personalities.

696

Without a social circle,

697
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,560

00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,090
to gather any useful leads.

699
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,050
Besides, it's been so many years.

700
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,010
Some of them might not

701
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,940
stay here anymore,

702
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,410
or they might be abroad.

703
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,360
The scope of this investigation is too broad.

704
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,450
Where are you going?

705
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,340
I'll find someone to inquire about it.

706
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,480
Unorganized and ill-disciplined.

707
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,210
Hush.

708
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,520
Shen

709
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,030
came from a background of an artist.

710
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,960
It's normal to have

711
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,510
a bit of personality for an expert like him.

712
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,440
Personality doesn't solve cases.

713
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,210
He should provide us with

714
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,940
useful leads if he's an expert.

715
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:57,770
I didn't expect

716
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,160
you to finish it so soon.

717
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,160
Ren Xiaoxuan?

718
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,390
You know her?

719
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,330
I do.

720
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,350
You said you got

721
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,240
transferred here not long ago, right?

722
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,220
I also graduated from Qizhong High School.

723
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,600
Back then, both of us

724
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,200
were in the same art class.

725
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,210
I was in my third year

726
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,410
when she got transferred to the school.

727
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,930
I saw these wooden boards

728
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,480
the last time I came here.

729
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,020
It's so interesting.

730
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,700
These

731
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,550
are abandoned wooden desks.

732
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,640
Art class students

733
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,280
love to write on it.

734
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,170
It's been many years.

735
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:48,720
[Sleep and rise early, study hard]

736
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,590
After I started working here,

737
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,450
these words and drawings looked

738
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,600
interesting to me.

739
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,560
It's a pity to throw them away,

740
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,950
so I collected them all

741
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,550
and made this cultural wall.

742
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,970
This corridor has

743
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,070
embodied our school's history

744
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,420
for the past ten years.

745
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,580
So which one was your desk?

746
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:05,930
Which one was it?

747
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,360
I

748
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,760
used to be a good student.

749
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,300
My table was spotless,

750
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,230
so it's not here.

751
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,540
Right.

752
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,930
What do you think of

753
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,530
Ren Xiaoxuan?

754
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,230
She's thin

755
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:23,620
and quiet.

756
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,690
Ren Xiaoxuan lived here.

757
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,980
Her mother remarried five years ago

758
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,780
and gave birth to another child.

759
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:51,970
Who is it?

760
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,610
You...

761
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,450
We're from the Beijiang

762
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,920
Sub-Bureau's Interpol Team.

763
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,430
Were you

764
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,760
Ren Xiaoxuan's mother?

765
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,400
Where

766
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,410
did you find her?

767
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,600
Beijiang Qizhong High School.

768
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,280
Under the field.

769
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,110
It's been ten years.

770
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,090
It turns out that it's so near to us.

771
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,250
Ren Xiaoxuan had been

772
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,850
transferring schools all the time.

773
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,110
Was there any problem?

774
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,890
She was a sensitive child.

775
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,670
It's hard to get along with her.

776
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,680
That's why she couldn't

777
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,820
stay for too long.

778
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,390
Did anything unusual

779
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,610
happen before she went missing?

780
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,660
I don't remember.

781
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,390
She was always on her own.

782
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,530
I didn't know

783
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,000
what was on her mind.

784
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,560
Ever since I divorced her father,

785
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,630
she seldom talked to me.

786
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,490
I know she hated me.

787
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,980
Did you keep her stuff

788
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,840
from when she was still in school?

789
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,370
Take them back to the bureau.

790
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,130
Okay.
