[Episode 10]

4
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,320
Why does every sketch look similar to him?

5
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,520
That's too strange.

6
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,720
-Not at all.
-Thanks.

7
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,320
If you always visit the crime scene,

8
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,080
you'll know

9
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,180
that many people thought

10
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,289
they saw the murderer

11
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,370
when they didn't.

12
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,500
Or they mistook them for someone else.

13
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,100
So

14
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,930
we have to believe the witness,

15
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,280
but not entirely.

16
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,610
Then it's not that reliable.

17
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,850
Eyes aren't cameras.

18
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:02,980
Besides, when cases happened,

19
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,620
they happened

20
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,520
in seconds.

21
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,970
It's hard for people

22
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,780
to remember consciously.

23
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,320
When they try to recall,

24
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,160
their imagination

25
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,380
will be embedded in their memories.

26
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,420
Their preference

27
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,340
and other people's hints will distort

28
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,520
their memories.

29
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,620
There are

30
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,880
too many missing clues

31
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,040
from the witness.

32
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,180
We still need to go back to the starting point

33
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,980
to find a breakthrough from Mu Wei

34
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,740
and continue to investigate our doubt on He Hong.

35
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,540
We need to find a way

36
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,740
to obtain Xiaoan's DNA

37
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,450
to determine

38
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,110
her relationship with Mu Wei.

39
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,200
So who's going to handle this kid?

40
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,920
Me?

41
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,280
Thanks.

42
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,320
We're here

43
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,820
to ask you more

44
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,930
about Mu Wei.

45
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,600
I've told you everything.

46
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,010
Why did you come at this time?

47
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,940
Xiaoan is getting off school soon.

48
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,440
Mom!

49
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,100
Xiaoan, you're home.

50
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,800
Mom,

51
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,040
why are they here again?

52
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,400
Why is Dad not home yet?

53
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,970
Your dad is working out of town.

54
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,220
He'll be back in a couple of days.

55
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:46,780
We have something

56
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,180
to discuss with your mum.

57
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,800
Xiaoan,

58
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,270
why don't I take you out for fun?

59
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,480
Go on.

60
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,130
Let's go.

61
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,080
Can we start now?

62
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,090
When did you and Mu Wei

63
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,090
move to Beijiang?

64
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,880
I think

65
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,360
it was in 2014.

66
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,080
We grew up together.

67
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,800
You've been seeing each other

68
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,820
and got married after that?

69
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,440
Yes.

70
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,180
Both of us are away from home,

71
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,060
so it's better to be together and take care of each other.

72
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,800
Have you seen any guns at home?

73
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,320
Gun?

74
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,660
I'm done. It's your turn now.

75
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,850
Okay.

76
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,720
Watch me.

77
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,520
You're so bad at it.

78
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,410
I did it poorly.

79
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,460
Why don't you play?

80
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,180
I want to stop now.

81
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,690
I want to go home to Mom.

82
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,260
Let's play for a little longer.

83
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,120
How about this?

84
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,409
You'll shoot,

85
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:36,500
and I'll draw something for you,

86
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,080
okay?

87
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,790
You know how to draw?

88
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,690
I've never seen any.

89
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,570
Really?

90
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,560
Yes.

91
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,950
It seems that

92
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,320
you don't know Mu Wei.

93
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,340
Did you hear

94
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,540
about the recent armed robbery at the jewellery shop?

95
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,560
I watched it on the news.

96
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,450
We have reasons to suspect

97
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,580
that the robber in the armed robbery is

98
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,480
Mu Wei.

99
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,050
You're a married couple.

100
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,130
Didn't you notice

101
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:10,620
anything unusual

102
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,800
in your daily life?

103
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,440
Married couples can be

104
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,100
the closest people and the most distant

105
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,530
in this world.

106
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,140
You scored a total of 158 points.

107
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,400
This bear is yours now.

108
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,510
Thank you, auntie!

109
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,300
You're welcome.

110
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,450
You were amazing.

111
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,810
Uncle,

112
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,970
are you done drawing?

113
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,200
Not yet.

114
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,610
Drawing takes

115
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,880
a lot of time.

116
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,800
It's so pretty.

117
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,090
Uncle,

118
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,240
can you draw this bear too?

119
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,290
Sure.

120
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,830
What else do you want me to draw?

121
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,570
What about Mom?

122
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,080
Sure.

123
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,340
What about your dad?

124
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,280
No.

125
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,080
I remember he was in a bad mood

126
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,640
the day he left.

127
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,520
He got under the bed

128
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,970
to take something out

129
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,860
and put it in his arms as he walked out.

130
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,360
I asked where he was going.

131
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,860
He didn't answer me.

132
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,659
How big was it?

133
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,360
It was

134
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,920
as big as a cookie box.

135
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,770
At that time, you already knew

136
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,500
he might not come back anymore.

137
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,440
Why do you say that?

138
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,740
Every time we were here,

139
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,890
you looked very calm

140
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,740
when you opened the door.

141
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,060
You don't look like a woman

142
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,520
who cares about her husband's whereabouts.

143
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,500
You're not waiting for someone.

144
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,990
You're waiting for an outcome.

145
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,560
Uncle Shen Yi,

146
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm hungry.

147
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,990
What do you want to eat?

148
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,170
I want to eat...

149
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,670
I want to eat some pizza!

150
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:32,840
Pizza?

151
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,049
Mu Wei has

152
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,480
bad habits.

153
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,620
He loves gambling

154
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:41,929
and drinking.

155
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,010
We quarrelled too.

156
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,370
If you ask

157
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,480
whether I anticipate his return,

158
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,440
I can tell you

159
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,960
that I don't.

160
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,160
But aren't you worried that

161
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,370
Xiaoan misses her dad

162
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,770
when she doesn't see him?

163
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,120
I'm enough for Xiaoan.

164
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,490
I know

165
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,230
I might sound selfish saying this.

166
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,740
But I'm being honest.

167
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,420
If Mu Wei is really

168
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,160
on the run,

169
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:12,970
I hope

170
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,500
he'll go as far as possible.

171
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,420
The little tadpole is searching for its mummy.

172
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,410
It keeps searching.

173
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,080
Little tadpole...

174
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,460
Your Hawaiian pizza and chicken nuggets are

175
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,330
here!

176
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,530
Thank you.

177
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,520

539

I've been searching for her for seven years.

When I finally found her,

544
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,620
she was already with someone else.

545
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,560

Let me see.

552
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,480
Did you hurt yourself?

553
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,650
Does it hurt?

554

I'm sorry.

556
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,340
She's young and not careful with her scooter.

557

I'm sorry about that.

[I'm sure she's He Hong.]

570
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:47,780
When did you find out

571

that Xiaoan is your daughter?

572
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,950
I knew from the moment I saw her.

573
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,320
Back then, when He Hong disappeared,

574
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,860
she was already pregnant with my child.

575
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,880
Xiaoan is my daughter.

576
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,570
He Hong doesn't dare to acknowledge me.

577
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,720
I think

578
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,770
she must have her reasons.

579
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,850
I was planning

580
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,660
to protect them silently.

581
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,260
It was already enough for me.

582
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,520
But Mu Wei dared

583
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,600
to abuse them!

584
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:17,900
I want

585

586
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,020
I want to take back

So

589
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,320
you killed Mu Wei?

590
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,880
[I knocked him out]

591
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,060
[and stuffed him into a piece of luggage.]

592
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,860
[After that,]

593
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,550
[I drove all the way to the outskirts.]

594

[I drove to a deserted place.]

595
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,520
Where did you kill him?

596
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,530
It was already dark that day.

597
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,420
I don't remember

598
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,690
where I did it.

599
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,770
I only remember it was a grove.

600
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,240
I dragged him to the middle of the forest.

601
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,810
I took out my gun.

602
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,040
I aimed for his head

603
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,560
and shot him.

604
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,240
I then dug out a hole

605
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,020
and buried him there.

606
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,040
It was dark.

607
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,250
How did you shoot

608
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,330
him in the head?

609
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,950
The headlights were on.

610
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,840
I pointed the gun at his forehead.

611
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,480
At his forehead?

612
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,060
What did the wound look like?

613
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,450
What else would it look like?

614
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,860
It looked like a bullet hole.

615
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,280
Bullet hole?

616
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,340
What's the shape?

617
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,160
It's a hole.

618
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,380
What other shape could it be

619
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,360
if it's not round?

620
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,320
You're lying.

621
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,620
If you fire at close range

622
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,650
with the gun you used for the robbery,

623
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,710
it'll cause radiating lacerations.

624
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,650
It can never cause

625
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,650
a bullet hole

626
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,330
like Zhu Zhengqian's mouth,

627
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,440
which you shot.

628
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,040
It was too dark.

629
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,160
I couldn't see it clearly.

630
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,290
Didn't you say the headlights were on?

631
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,860
How much does He Hong know

632
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,180
about you murdering Mu Wei?

633
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,040
Killing Mu Wei is my own business.

634
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,220
I have never met He Hong

635
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,480
the whole time.

636
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,820
She has no idea at all?

637
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,090
That's strange.

638
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,690
According to what you said,

639
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,250
you've killed Mu Wei.

640
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,810
But we found on his computer

641
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:08,940
that someone had bought

642
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,090
a train ticket for him

643
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,620
with someone else's ID card

644
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,060
to make us think

645
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,790
that he had fled from the crime.

646
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,290
Who's that person?

647
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,449

Is it He Hong?

650
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:29,050
She has nothing to do with it.

651
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:35,840

she left town to work

She has never contacted home since then.

at Xiangnan Hospital once.

735

that she was 20 years old.

From age 20 to 25,

the bone structure changes every year.

He Hong is 27 this year,

750
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,020
and the one on the medical record is 20 years old.

the current He Hong's

753
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,890
bone structure should have obvious changes compared

754
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,820
to the photo on the medical record.

755
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,070
Take her lower jawbone,

for instance.

or more prominent with age.

But according to my observation,

760
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,890
compared to her 20-year-old photo,

761
