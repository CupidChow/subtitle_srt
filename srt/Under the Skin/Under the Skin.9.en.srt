This shows

What does that mean?

533

It's more convenient for him

if the robber is colour-blind,

555
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,330

for a while before crossing the road

because he couldn't tell the colors on the traffic light.

That's why

the robber was using Mu Wei's gun

their neighbours?

697
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,820
Not bad.

698
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,620
Mu Wei

699
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,880
loves to play mahjong.

700
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,730
He often plays mahjong with Wang

701
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,120
from the third floor and Zhou

702
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,320
from the sixth floor.

703
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,470
But he's always

704
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,130
out of luck.

705
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,570
He often loses almost a thousand yuan

706
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,700
within a night.

707
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,180
What about his relationship with his wife?

708
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,310
Every time I pick up my granddaughter,

709
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,620
I see He Hong

710
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,350
picking up her daughter alone.

711
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,650
Mu Wei

712
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,310
doesn't care about his daughter at all.

713
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,130
Right.

714
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,900
One day, he got drunk

715
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,030
and said

716
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,540
Xiaoan wasn't his child.

717
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,100
Just conduct a paternity test to

718
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,500
verify their blood ties.

719
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,200
We have

720
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,160
Mu Wei's DNA.

721
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,400
We need someone

722
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,040
to collect Xiaoan's.

723
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,530
What if

724
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:04,960
they don't have blood ties?

725
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,630
Then

726
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,340
He Hong

727
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,800
might be involved as well.

728
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,860
We need to figure out

729
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,660
He Hong's relationship as well.

730
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,190
This robbery case

731
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,920
is becoming more complicated.

732
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,060
Du Cheng.

733
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,240
I found someone for you.

734
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,510
Yan,

735
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,580
an eyewitness?

736
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,450
He

737
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,550
got shot before,

738
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,390
so he's still quite traumatized.

739
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,860
He moved away after he was healed.

740
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,750
So it took me some time to locate him.

741
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,760
But he told me

742
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,650
that he did see

743
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,780
the suspect before.

744
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,410
Where is he?

745
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,440
In the waiting room.

746
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,290
Hello.

747
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,010
Hello.

748
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,520
Hello.

749
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,890
That bullet

750
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,080
went through my cheeks.

751
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,550
Luckily, it didn't hit any vital parts.

752
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,080
And I managed to survive it.

753
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,960
But my teeth aren't

754
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,090
as strong as before.

755
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,100
Back then,

756
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,070
I could use them to open bottle caps.

757
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,790
But now,

758
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,840
I couldn't even chew a sachima.

759
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,150
If you meet that person again,

760
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,410
can you recognize him?

761
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,180
Yes, of course.

762
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,740
I will never forget his eyes.

763
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,750
Is this him?

764
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,230
Yes.

765
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:15,910
It's him.

766
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:19,900
Wait.

767
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,320
What about him?

768
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,280
He also looks similar.

769
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,850
What about him?

770
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,110
And him?

771
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,620
They all look pretty similar.

772
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,070
Who do you think looks more like him?

773
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,300
Well, I'd say

774
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,070
none of them.
