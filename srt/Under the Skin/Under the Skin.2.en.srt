It's fine.

183

Her disfigured face

184
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,360
made it hard to sketch.

185
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,360
We don't even know if it's accurate.

186

Bureau Chief Zhang, I'll keep going.

187

188
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,530

190
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,169
The women in the videos

191
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:43,730

192
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,000
a complete surgery.

193
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,480
So it's hard

194
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,740
to confirm their identity.

195
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,220

196
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,130
Liu Yun from the plastic surgery clinic

197
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,210
to identify over 30 of them.

198
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,010
We'll have to go through

199
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,130
the rest of the patients ourselves.

200
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,790
There's a more efficient way.

201
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,170
I'm all ears.

202
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,930
If we can recover their faces in the videos

203
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,250
back before their surgeries,

204
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,110
we will be able to do a comparison.

205
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,230
Will you be able to recover all of them?

206
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,740
If I go through

207
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,220
all of the videos carefully,

208
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:09,940

209

The size of the sclera

[for an opportunity.]

697
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,740
[If I wasn't seen]

698
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,260
[by the first impression,]

699
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,190
[the opportunity would be taken.]

700
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:26,830
[Beauty changes lives]

701
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:21,910
[That's why]

702
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,410
[I swore]

703
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,280
[to be the most outstanding.]

704
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,100
[If gender can't break]

705
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,000
[the ceiling,]

706
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,130
[I will break it with my beauty.]

707
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,760
It won't be a problem.

708
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,680
Trust me.

709
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,890
All you have to do

710
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,700
is close your eyes and go to sleep.

711
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,630
When you wake up,

712
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,360
you will be pretty just like them.

713
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,530
Then, just like what he did

714
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,400
to the other women,

715
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,080
Liang Yi drugged you.

716
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,490
I was the first victim.

717
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,440
That dreadful secret room

718
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,760
was designed by me.

719
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,920
It's perfect.

720
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,220
It's definitely

721
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,280
a flawless design.

722
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,320
Miss Jiang.

723
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,730
It looks like

724
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,690
I owe you a huge amount of design fee.

725
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,700
And you wouldn't take my money

726
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,050
for the surgery.

727
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,680
Dr Liang.

728
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,560
Why did you want

729
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,160
a secret room

730
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,170
in this luxurious apartment?

731
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,560
When I was little,

732
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,730
I had some far-fetched dreams.

733
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,850
Now that I grew up,

734
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,690
I need a place

735
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,370
where I can daydream

736
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,380
without being interrupted.

737
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,550
Why didn't you seek help from the police?

738
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,050
If I did that,

739
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,730
he would leak

740
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:43,850
all my videos.

741
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,240
My career would be ruined.

742
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,960
I have my future.

743
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,300
I'd rather walk with my body riddled with holes

744
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,240
than stop here.

745
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,250
So, you just stood by and watched

746
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,730
while other women suffer the same fate,

747
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,610
and you did nothing.

748
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,840
I admit that

749
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,930
I was his accomplice

750
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,490
in some sense.

751
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,830
[He humiliated me.]

752
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,490
[He toyed with me.]

753
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,650
He wanted me

754
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,510
to introduce him to more clients.

755
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,900
Sometimes, I was even grateful

756
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,320
to him

757
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:29,770
[for giving me]

758
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,000
[such a face.]

759
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,350
[Because of this face,]

760
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:35,270
[I made a name for myself.]

761
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,020
[I gained fame and wealth.]

762
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,330
But the more I gained,

763
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,210
the least I tried

764
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,560
to resist him.

765
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:46,940
Then, why did you

766
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,800
decide to kill him in the end?
