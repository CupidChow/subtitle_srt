[Under The Skin]

3
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,030
[Episode 13]

4
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,590
What are you looking at?

5
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,729
The snail.

6
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,240
Snails are rare in a hospital.

7
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,170
I wonder

8
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,370
where it came from.

9
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,520
Calm down.

10
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,960
I'm here to check

11
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,550
how you're recovering.

12
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,240
Do I need another checkup?

13
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:29,920
No.

14
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,530
I'm here to see

15
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,220
how you're feeling

16
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:34,890
right now.

17
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,800
So...

18
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,460
What should I do?

19
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,530
Nothing.

20
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,110
I came for a chat.

21
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,600
Can I sit here?

22
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,280
Thanks.

23
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,000
You can pet it.

24
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,040
How did it feel?

25
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,560
Wet

26
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,290
and cool.

27
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,510
What else did you feel?

28
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,480
It seemed nervous.

29
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,130
It's very timid.

30
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,420
Its antenna was stretching out,

31
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,120
but it retracted them

32
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,560
as soon as I touched it.

33
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,840
I saw it yesterday.

34
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,040
It was

35
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,400
under the flower pot.

36
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,000
It wasn't moving.

37
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,120
It's tiny,

38
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,430
and the leaf is so far away.

39
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,270
It must have used up a lot of strength to get there.

40
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,840
Where do you think

41
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,320
the snail is going?

42
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,840
I don't know.

43
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,850
Maybe it's hungry

44
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,730
and wants some food.

45
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,800
Or perhaps

46
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,610
it wants some water.

47
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:19,890
Anyway,

48
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,060
it must be

49
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,860
something very important to it.

50
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,520
Otherwise,

51
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,040
the leaf is too far

52
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,700
and too dangerous for it,

53
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,790
it shouldn't have come out.

54
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,080
Did I say something wrong?

55
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,140
There is no right and wrong in feelings.

56
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,890
It's just a way

57
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,170
you view this world.

58
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,880
Alright.

59
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,900
You're making a good recovery.

60
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,560
Rest well.

61
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,760
[Ward]

62
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,400
Xiaoye,

63
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,110
things will get better.

64
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,860
It will all be better.

65
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,160
Mr Shen, how's it?

66
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,300
I can now do a composite drawing.

67
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,130
"He was tall

68
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,280
and strong.

69
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,250
His face looked sinister.

70
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,640
There were spots

71
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,000
on his cheeks.

72
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,850
He had a large mouth.

73
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,330
It was wide open.

74
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,659
The corner of his mouth pointed downward.

75
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,650
Every time I opened my eyes,

76
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,480
I could see his three eyes

77
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,360
staring at me.

78
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,380
His eyes were triangular.

79
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,640
One corner of the eyes pointed upward.

80
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,090
The eye in the middle

81
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,330
had a scar under it.

82
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,790
It looked like a tear drop.

83
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,410
He had a narrow nose.

84
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,280
It was rounded.

85
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,810
The ridge was long.

86
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,450
His face

87
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,570
was ever-changing."

88
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,580
I'll recite it one more time.

89
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,640
That's all?

90
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,080
That's all.

91
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,540
We'll use the surveillance cameras

92
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,760
and close inspection

93
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,020
to check the jewelry shop,

94
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,280
downtown,

95
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,100
and so on.

96
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,090
Everyone, check everything

97
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:02,950
and ask around.

98
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,960
Find out what actually happened.

99
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,480
Are you Shen Yi's superior?

100
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:09,920
Yes.

101
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,440
Yes, I am Captain Du Cheng.

102
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,490
I am Mr Xu.

103
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,040
I was Shen Yi's teacher.

104
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,540
Are you here for Shen Yi?

105
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,440
He's away and

106
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,370
won't be back soon.

107
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,300
You could wait in the waiting room.

108
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,560
May I see his drawings?

109
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,490
Sure.

110
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,160
What a shame.

111
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,440
He was my most brilliant student,

112
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,450
and also my greatest regret.

113
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,200
Since Shen Yi is not here,

114
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,320
I should leave.

115
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,980
You may wait

116
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,559
in this room.

117
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,020
He might be back in a while.

118
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,360
Never mind.

119
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,050
I should go.

120
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,370
Mr Shen.

121
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,300
Thank you for the work.

122
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,160
Grab some food.

123
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,830
I'm not hungry, thanks.

124
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,280
Mr Shen.

125
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:18,810
Was my description

126
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,000
too confusing?

127
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,170
I could repeat the description to you.

128
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:22,830
Never mind.

129
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,760
This is the end result.

130
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,160
Every witness

131
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,210
has their own way of expression.

132
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,700
Some are more inclined to appearances,

133
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,980
some are more inclined to trust their senses.

134
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,380
Liu Xiaoye is the latter.

135
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,540
I could tell as much

136
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,670
when I talked to her.

137
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,350
She emphasized her senses.

138
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,740
She notices nuances and sizes more easily.

139
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,870
Under the effect of the hallucinogen,

140
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,160
her senses became extremely sensitive.

141
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,100
Her sensation became exaggerated.

142
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,090
Time and space

143
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,160
became blurred.

144
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,970
But this eye...

145
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,440
Liu Xiaoye mentioned

146
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,940
a triangular eye.

147
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,630
This doesn't fit her description.

148
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,640
Because of the rotating perspective,

149
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,340
the suspect's eye

150
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,220
appeared to be

151
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,170
a triangle.

152
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,220
She couldn't tell the change in space

153
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,780
of the left and right sides of the suspect's face.

154
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,690
The left cheek

155
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,520
is the rotating perspective.

156
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,720
The right cheek

157
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,400
is the front profile.

158
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,570
So this nose,

159
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,290
the ridge,

160
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,770
and the tip...

161
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,020
Why do you draw them separately?

162
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,020
Why not combine them into one image?

163
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,660
If we reconstruct the image

164
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,600
based on her description,

165
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,520
you'll notice

166
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,130
the facial features

167
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,970
are contradicting.

168
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,320
Imagine this.

169
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,760
A nose

170
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,050
cannot be crooked

171
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,820
while the nostrils are pointing upward

172
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,220
and have a long nasal ridge.

173
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,080
These features

174
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,410
are the result of the witness

175
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,200
losing time awareness.

176
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,580
She could only somewhat feel

177
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,300
that at different moments,

178
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,790
these facial features were changing.

179
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,090
In other words,

180
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,300
some of these contradicting facial features

181
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,890
are the results of her hallucination.

182
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,440
No,

183
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,170
I don't think she would make this up.

184
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,350
But these facial features

185
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,140
could not have been on the same face.

186
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,200
What if

187
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,480
this isn't just a face?

188
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,060
There was more than one culprit?

189
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,280
Go on.

190
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,610
Liu Xiaoye was drugged.

191
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,780
She fused

192
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,640
these different faces together.

193
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,650
So this is...

194
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,310
A multiple perpetrator rape.

195
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,120
Our next step

196
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,110
is to put these facial features

197
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,770
back on the right faces.

198
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,610
We need to separate

199
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,650
the blurred images

200
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,680
caused by the drug

201
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,960
and the elements from different faces.

202
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,570
Until

203
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,420
we can

204
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,350
confirm the structure of the face,

205
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,570
the only lead we have

206
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,140
are these facial features and

207
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,800
details.

208
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,520
Look at these.

209
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,780
From the anatomy perspective,

210
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,890
do you see any pattern

211
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,200
with the perspective angle

212
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,400
and the visual angle?

213
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,000
The eye with the teardrop

214
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,960
and this mouth.

215
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,530
The ear where the face looks to the right

216
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,730
and this eye on the left,

217
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,330
they seem to be

218
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,530
two different perspective spaces.

219
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,530
Good.

220
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,380
Let's

221
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,310
remove them now.

222
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,680
Let's put the pieces closer.

223
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,200
Okay.

224
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,120
We need more information.

225
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,000
There is more to what you see here.

226
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,340
Due to the hallucination,

227
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,140
there are many unknown elements

228
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,570
that might be hiding

229
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,320
other information.

230
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,590
Look at this nasolabial fold.

231
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,290
Doesn't it look odd?

232
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,860
Look at this side-profile eye.

233
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,050
Judging by the location of this eye,

234
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,120
that nasolabial fold seems like

235
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,600
a missing nose.

236
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,050
I can't spot

237
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,120
anything else.

238
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,480
Based on the anatomy,

239
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,880
draw the missing

240
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,140
facial features.

241
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,490
[I did as you said.]

242
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,170
[What is the next step?]

243
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,980
[Draw the lines.]

244
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,930
[Use your feelings]

245
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,520
[to draw the slope.]

246
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,360
[What's next?]

247
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,720
[Color it.]

248
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,330
[Use the color of life]

249
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,660
[in your imagination.]

250
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,080
[Red,]

251
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,400
[deep red, scarlet...]

252
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,650
Use your eyes

253
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,170
and feel the life force of the color.

254
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,690
Don't look at me.

255
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,160
[Follow your heart.]

256
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,400
No one would have such a long face.

257
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,300
This is

258
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,490
constructed based on warped

259
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,490
facial features.

260
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,390
Alright.

261
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,410
We'll continue to use

262
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,860
the normal ratio of Three Forehead and Five Eyes.

263
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,990
We'll draw up the structure once more.

264
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,280
[I can't bring out the life force]

265
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,680
[of the perspective.]

266
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,120
It's not that you can't.

267
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,790
To close the gap between you and the color,

268
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,880
don't make the color bow to you,

269
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,240
[let it play along with you.]

270
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,000
Mr Shen,

271
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,880
did I get it wrong?

272
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,680
Maybe you should do it.

273
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,900
Do not worry about getting it wrong.

274
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,170
You have doubts

275
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,530
because you fear

276
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,590
not being able to control the pencil.

277
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,450
Do not try to control it.

278
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,100
Close the gap between you and the pencil.

279
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,160
Play along with it.

280
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,790
Nicely done.

281
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,250
Officer Shen.

282
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,130
You really are

283
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,460
the hunter of all things elusive.

284
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,600
How brilliant.

285
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:11,880
Liu,

286
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,580
you should learn from Mr Shen.

287
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,710
I didn't draw these.

288
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,050
It was her.

289
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,640
I drew them under Mr Shen's guidance.

290
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,110
That's only because Mr Shen is a good teacher.

291
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:33,760
Alright.

292
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,100
We'll start investigating

293
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,260
all the men

294
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,450
from that party.

295
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,480
We'll search based on these three sketches.

296
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,250
Officer,

297
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,090
these are

298
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,520
all the men who attended

299
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,560
the gathering.

300
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,599
Raise your hair.

301
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,280
You, go to A1.

302
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,200
Don't touch me.

303
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,420
Take him away.

304
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,940
They all admitted it.

305
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,170
They planned it.

306
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,200
I checked their phones

307
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,819
and computers.

308
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,760
The folders contained

309
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,530
the photos

310
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,670
they took while stalking the girl.

311
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,080
As for the drug,

312
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,640
we found it at their place.

313
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,650
This time,

314
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,180
they wanted to do something big.

315
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,780
They stalked

316
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,340
Liu Xiaoye who was always alone.

317
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,780
They prepared the instruments

318
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,970
and cleaned all the traces at the scene.

319
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:39,610
That is why

320
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,260
it took us so long to track them down.

321
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,210
However...

322
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,780
Something still baffles me.

323
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,760
Look.

324
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,970
These three drawings

325
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,170
are basically the same as their photos.

326
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,600
But, they don't have

327
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,730
the scars and marks.

328
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,530
Anyway, they confessed

329
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,660
to committing the crime.

330
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,480
It's alright.

331
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,660
You're right.

332
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,180
Liu Xiaoye was agitated,

333
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,920
so hallucination was normal.

334
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,160
No.

335
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,260
It's the same

336
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,660
as taking an object apart

337
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,340
and finding

338
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,340
an extra piece after reassembling.

339
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,690
We either got it wrong

340
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,670
or the extra part

341
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,520
should have never been there.

342
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,000
There is more to this drawing.

343
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,220
There could be a fourth culprit.

344
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,770
A butterfly?

345
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:11,930
It looks like one.

346
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,000
It is a butterfly.

347
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,650
Hello, Mrs Liu.

348
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,900
This is Officer Shen

349
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,100
from our sub-bureau.

350
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,270
I want Xiaoye to take a look at this.

351
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,540
That won't be necessary.

352
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,240
It was when she was still little.

353
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,660
I was busy with work.

354
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,610

00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,100
a replacement.

530
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,910
But, to train

531
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,340
an artist like him

532
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,740
took tremendous effort!

533
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,460
You can do just fine with other portraitists.

534
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,620
Let Shen Yi return

535
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,980
to his art.

536
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,610
Sorry.

537
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,030
I can't do that.

538
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,200
I understand.

539
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:14,790
You admire

540
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,560
Shen Yi's gift for art,

541
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,900
but his talent is greater than that.

542
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,230
He can see through

543
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,030
the heart by looking at the face.

544
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,420
You probably didn't know that.

545
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,250
When he first came here,

546
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,690
I took him for

547
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,820
an ordinary artist.

548
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,510
Yet, he played

549
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,650
a pivotal role

550
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,330
in solving many cases.

551
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,410
I realized he had

552
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,210
the quality to become

553
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,010
an outstanding police officer.

554
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,200
And more importantly,

555
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,510
we all know

556
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,490
his passion for this job is genuine.

557
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,590
As his teacher,

558
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,140
you should

559
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,600
respect his decision, no?

560
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,960
Your teacher came here

561
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,900
to talk you into giving up on your job here

562
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,350
and being an artist instead.

Shen Yi.

565
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,240
You didn't just burn a few drawings,

566
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:55,990
what you burned

567
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,520
was my hard work of training you for ten years!

568
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,320
I'm so disappointed in you.

569
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,550
Go.

570
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,860
Go and be a police officer.

Come on.

578
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,240
I don't like it.

579
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,210
Just eat up.

is mistaking you for Siwen again.
