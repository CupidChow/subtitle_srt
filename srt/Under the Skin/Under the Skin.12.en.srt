you used the stun gun

00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,409

67

If you were that afraid,

78
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,580
why did you put the hat on him?

79
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,430

In some of the paintings,

119
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,530
the maid is just an onlooker

Holofernes tries to fight back

123

135
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,070
they delegated the maid as an onlooker

136
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,370
because their focus

137
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,610
was placed on the beautiful

Gentileschi was different.

141

In her painting, the women

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,680
I found this.

154
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,720
Gentileschi was raped

155
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,730
by her teacher

156
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,130
when she was young.

157
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,400
Gentileschi

158
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,120
was raped indeed.

159
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,420
To avoid the punishment, her aggressor

160
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,010
turned around

161
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,100
and said Gentileschi was a prostitute.

162
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,430
To prove her innocence,

163
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,320
Gentileschi

164
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,180
was forced to have a body check-up in public.

165
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,000
In the end,

166
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,320
the rapist

167
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,780
was only found guilty of larceny.

168
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,140
He was jailed for eight months only.

169
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,200
Only eight months?

170
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,340
So this painting isn't to depict

171
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,290
how Judith

172
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,560
killed Holofernes.

173
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,290
It's how Gentileschi

174
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,650
killed her own rapist.

175
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,490
Yes.

176
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,170

179

There's no hesitation

180
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,400
or fear.

181
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,120
She infused her painting

182
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,650
with her pain and sympathy.

183
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,170
She shared the same soul

184
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,280
with the depicted Judith.

185
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,200
Sorry.

186
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,290
[Two same souls.]

187
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,380
[Two women]

188
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,840
[who were also violated.]

189
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,580
That's all for today.

190
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,380
Discuss among yourself.

191
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,010
You think Chen Qiuwen lied?

192
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,130
If she lied once,

193
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,260
she could lie twice.

194
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,410
Usually,

195
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,490
female victims of long-term domestic abuse

196
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,130
would be seen

197
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,530
as vulnerable martyrs.

198
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,700
That's why we tend to overlook them.

199
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,270
Also, women have the power to fight back.

200
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,370
When they do,

201
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,620
they might be even stronger than the men.

202
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,530
Chen Qiuwen said

203
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,050
after she stunned Zhao Mingzhe,

204
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,530
she killed him in fear.

205
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,020
And now, I suspect

206
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:01,740
that she planned

207
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,160
this ending for him.

208
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,920
Or should I say,

209
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,760
the moment

210
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,360
Zhao Mingzhe saw that photo,

211
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,810
his fate was doomed.

212
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,610
Let's head back to the hotel

213
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,380
and follow

214
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,550
Zhao Mingzhe's footstep that night.

215
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,300
We might be able to find

216
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,160
something new.

217
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,120
This person

218
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,900
checked in three days ago.

219
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,100
I was on duty that day.

220
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,620
Was there anything

221
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,250
peculiar about him?

222
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,510
Or did he say anything?

223
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,280
Many people checked in here.

224
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,970
I can't recall clearly.

225
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,930
You can indeed see

226
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,930
Chen Qiuwen's apartment from here.

227
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,430
Oh, I got something.

228
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,610
When the man

229
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,840
was checking in,

230
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,520
he insisted on a room with no direct sunlight.

231
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,310
And he kept telling me that

232
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,050
the room with no direct sunlight

233
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,180
must lead to the view of Fengmao Tower.

234
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,970
I knew it.

235

[Fengmao Tower]

236
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,660
He had to rely on the Fengmao Tower

237
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,520
to identify Chen Qiuwen's place.

238
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,800
This indicates

239
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,500
Zhao Mingzhe was hunting

240
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,720
Chen Qiuwen.

241
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,520
Hello?

242
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:27,880
Are you sure?

243
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,910
Okay. Noted.

244
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,340
Li Han found

245
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,300
traces of photoshop

246
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,630
on Chen Qiuwen's photo.

[Fengmao Tower]

248

The word Fengmao couldn't possibly

249
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,050
appear in Chen Qiuwen's eyes.

250
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:46,980
This is where

251
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,150
Chen Qiuwen took the photo.

[Fengmao Tower]

253
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,780
I found the evidence.

254
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,240
What do you mean?

255
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,740
You said

256
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,270
you fled from Zhao Mingzhe.

257
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,280
[You dared not go out,]

258

[make friends,]

259
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,820
[or post on WeChat Moments.]

260
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,090
Yet you posted this high-definition

261
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,740
selfie

262
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,120
on your social media.

263
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,320
Isn't that quite contradictory?

264
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,910
I want to heal from my trauma

265
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,080
and start over.

266
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,000
Can I not?

267
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,320
Sure.

268
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,050
But this photo of yours

269
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,790
has been touched up.

270
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,250
You knew Zhao Mingzhe

271
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:08,970
would look for you

272
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,240
if he saw this photo.

273
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,770
So you intentionally left a crumb

274
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,720
in the photo

275
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,200
to lure him

276
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,320
into the lethal trap you set up.

277
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,240
Any proof?

278
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,850
Yes.

279
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,060
This is the evidence.

280
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,400
Judging from the angle you took this selfie,

281
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,090
the word Fengmao shouldn't appear

282
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,250
in your eyes.

283
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,420
Just like the one I took here.

284
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,730
Your photo

285

has been edited.

286
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,680
And your aim

287
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,790
was to expose your location

288
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,960
to Zhao Mingzhe.

289
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,450
Even if my photo

290
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,570
was edited,

291
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,340
there are many pictures on the Internet.

292
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,470
How could I make sure

293
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,030
that Zhao Mingzhe saw this?

294
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,690
Someone could.

295
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,690
Lu Ting.

296
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,330
Who is she?

297
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,940
She's Zhao Mingzhe's

298
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,120
current lover.

299
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,640
Both of you met two days ago.

300
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,220
It doesn't ring a bell.

301
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,150
I don't know her.

302
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,410
If

303
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:28,860
a stranger

304
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,720
apologizes to you out of a sudden,

305
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,510
the normal reaction

306
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,970
should be surprised

307
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,450
or intrigued,

308
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,840
but you were neither.

309
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,010
You walked past her

310
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,340
without looking at her.

311
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,210
You pretended not to know her.

312
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,070
I didn't hear what she said.

313
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,630
When Lu Ting heard that ruckus,

314
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,630
she had the same reaction as yours.

315
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,180
She wasn't afraid of the noise,

316
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,730
but the violence

317
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,840
that came after.

318
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,240
The source of violence

319
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,120
was also Zhao Mingzhe.

320
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,290
Like I said,

321
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,610
I don't know Lu Ting.

322
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,170
I have no idea how

323
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,060
Zhao Mingzhe

324
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,730
got this photo.

325
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,980
If he didn't want to kill me,

326
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,240
he wouldn't have died.

327
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,200
I didn't kill him.

328
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,520
He himself did.

329
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,440
Zhou Yunyi.

330
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,240
The police always know

331
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,480
more

332
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,030
than you give them credits for.

333
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,600
Lu Ting is right next door.

334
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,170
[Lu Ting.]

335
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,800
[We do not summon you here]

[for nothing.]

00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,880
[Confessing now]

338
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,990
[will only do you good.]

339
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,020
The day before yesterday,

340
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,750
Zhao Mingzhe came to Beijiang.

341
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,490
We found that you took

342
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,240
the high-speed rail after his

343
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,690
and arrived at Beijiang too.

344
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,079
According to

345
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,619
Zhao Mingzhe's forensics report,

346
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,329
he lost

347
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,619
consciousness after getting attacked by the stun gun.

348
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,750
The stab wounds

349
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,980
on his body do not match Chen Qiuwen's

350
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,690
testimony.

351
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,290
So this is not self-defense.

352
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,830
It's voluntary manslaughter.

353
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,400
We now suspect that there was a third person

354

Hurry.

00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,080
What's with this drawing?

541
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,020
Liu drew this.

542
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,580
She used to learn to draw

543
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,240
but this is the best she can do.

544
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,360
I'm just curious

545
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,699
as to how

546
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,760
you drew this face.

547
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:11,679

548
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:13,150
drew according to the victim,

Liu Xiaoye's description.

550
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,300
I just drew what she described.

551
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,699
And it turned out this way.

552
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:21,290
If the lieu is fixed,

553
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,230
it shouldn't be hard to locate the suspects.

554
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,510
You just need some time.

555
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,790
That's the problem,

Liu Xiaoye wasn't

558
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,440
raped during the student association party.

559
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,739
She was made drunk

560
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,760
before being raped in the mountain next to it.

561
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,639
And now,

562
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,440
there are more

563
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,070
possible suspects.

564
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,949
It could be a student

565
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,409
or someone who is working.

566

we have now

571
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,389
is this

572
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:44,600
weird drawing.

573

their first reaction

587
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,130
is to think that they are dirty

588
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,430
and wash their body.

589
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,350
They then remain quiet.

00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,390
If you're worried,

705
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,570
come with me then.

706
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:25,950
I...

707
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,380
I have a mountain

708
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,260
of cases already.

709
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,520
I don't have time for him.

710
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,620
-Hi, Shen Yi.
-I...

711
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,300
The report is out.

712
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,980
It looks grim.

713
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,150
I can't find

714
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,500
useable fingerprint or DNA

715
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,830
from the victim's body.

716
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,180
The rapist must have erased

717
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,380
all criminal traces.

718
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,410
Also,

719
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,340
we found γ-hydroxybutyric acid

720
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,770
in her body.

721
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,910
γ-hydroxybutyric acid?

722
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:47,650
[Yes,]

723
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,430
[it's a kind of hallucinogen.]

724
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,730
[When ingested, you'll be left]

725
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,130
[defenseless shortly.]

726
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,160
Okay. Noted.

727
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,510
Oh, the Obedient Syrup.

728
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,400
You know it?

729
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,380
γ-hydroxybutyric acid.

730
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,110
This kind of thing circulates

731
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,170
in the black market

732
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,540
once in a while.

733
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,680
If you want to confiscate it,

734
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,980
you have to track it for a long time

735
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,030
and target the right person.

736
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,080
But it won't be

737
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,630
until the cycle begins again.

738
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,390
It's tricky.

739
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,790
Officer Shen.

740
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,260
The three-eyed monster

741
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,940
that Liu Xiaoye saw

742
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,700
might be

743
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,500
the effect of the hallucinogen.

744
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,300
Chief Hu.

745
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:31,640
I have already

746
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,110
obtained the basic info of this case.

747
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,570
I can start sketching now.

748
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,130
I want to see Liu Xiaoye.

749
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:36,850
Don't.

750
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,960
Don't trigger her for the second time.

751
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,420
Liu.

752
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,440
Describe it.

753
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,370
Liu Xiaoye is unstable

754
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,540
as if she has suffered a huge trauma.

755
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,280
She says she doesn't know or remember

756
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,950
anything.

757
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,460
The rapist in her description

758
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,120
is just a three-eyed monster.

759
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,990
It'll be hard to get something

760
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:55,960
out of her again.

761
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,340
I'm not there to make her rejog

762
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,860
the memory of her awful experience

763
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,990
or that person's appearance.

764
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,380
Why are you going to her then?

765
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,640
I'm there to determine

766
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,380
if her jumbled description

767
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,200
is the result of a drug

768
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,190
or the result of a memory error.

769
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,410
By talking to her,

770
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,090
I'll get to know her memory habit

771
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,140
and mental state.

772
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:14,650
I want to know

773
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,950
if that weird picture

774
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,670
is what she saw

775
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,150
or what she imagined.
