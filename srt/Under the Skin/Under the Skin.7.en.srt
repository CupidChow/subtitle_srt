I've never been the one you cared about the most.

It was yourself.

finding a son-in-law

220
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,910

give you recognition and stroke your ego.

and live somewhere else.

689
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,310
Where?

690
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,400
I don't know.

691
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,740
You can call anywhere you go anyway.

692
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,360
I'm envious.

693
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,230
He can leave just like that.

694
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,560
Are you sure you've never met this guy?

695
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,090
Who is this?

696
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,830
The man you were talking to.

697
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,030
Oh, my.

698
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,770
I'm certain I've never met him.

699
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,720
If I had known

700
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,730
he looked so ugly,

701
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,760
I would've stopped talking to him a long time ago.

702
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,950
Duan first appeared

703
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,510
[Duan, data unavailable]

704
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,120
six months ago.

705
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,010
He visited the nightclub in high profile.

706
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,400
Every time he gets drunk,

707
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,450
he breaks things.

708
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,840
Very eager to get people to remember him.

709
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,850
Wen Jing first showed up

710
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:10,000
[Wen Jing, data unavailable]

711
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,180
about three months ago.

712
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,040
He would always order the cheapest liquor

713
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,600
in the nightclub.

714
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:12,940
We examined the letters

715
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,500
Wen Jing gave Hua Muyao as well.

716
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,840
No fingerprints were left behind.

717
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:21,050
[Duan, data unavailable]

718
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,640
This is a premeditated

719
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,360
group crime.

720
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,040
They have a clear division of labor.

721
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,380
Wen Jing lures and kidnaps the girl,

722
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:24,990
[Duan, data unavailable]

723
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,980
and Duan guards the hostage.

724
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:23,860
The nightclub

725
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,320
is where they rendezvous.

726
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,010
But this is strange.

727
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,980
They've left so many traces and clues.

728
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,950
So why did we still walk into

729
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:30,830
dead ends?

730
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,200
There must be a problem

731
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,600
somewhere in the middle.

732
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,450
The two of them conspired for six months

733
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,210
and carried out the kidnapping.

734
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,940
They even left so many traces.

735
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,030
[Duan, data unavailable]

736
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,170
But they disappeared after executing their scheme.

737
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,320
That's impossible.

738
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,500
Unless they don't exist.
