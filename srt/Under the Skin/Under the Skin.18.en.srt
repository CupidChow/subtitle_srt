Salt.

It's normal for the human body to secrete salt,

190

00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,500
Usually,

00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,630
when people are asked this question,

354
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,830
they give a response.

355
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,100
Either affirmative

356
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,700
or negative.

357
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,350
Staying silent

358
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,140
means that you must be hiding something.

It matches perfectly with that man.

521
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,570
[But a long time ago,]

522
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,770
[when the killer was talking to them on the phone,]

523
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,190
[I heard their voice.]

524
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,460
[And recently,]

525
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,350
[I heard that voice again]

526
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,910
[when the killer called]

527
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,170
[to threaten me.]

528
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,770
What did they say?

529
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,920
[I couldn't hear very well.]

530
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,260
[I only heard]

531
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
[something to do with stronghold.]

532
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,560
[How about it, Officer Du?]

533
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,240
[If you're interested,]

534
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,450
[come and see me alone.]

535
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,690
Then, you went to see M

536
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,380
and got into a fight with her.

537
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,220
And your dial broke there.

538
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,100
You had Qing fix it

539
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,540
and cover up for you.

540
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,650
There was a fight.

541
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,700
But it wasn't with M.

542
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,920
It was with Zhou Jun.

543
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,480
Zhou Jun killed M?

544
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,160
I found M's diary

545
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,420
in her residence.

546
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,790
[The contents were ripped off.]

547
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,280
I got this frottage from the diary.

548
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,700
Their organization is like an assembly line

549
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,430
with a clear division of labor.

550
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,030
Zhou Jun is in charge of abducting and securing the women.

551
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:34,840
[Zhou Jun]

552
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:35,300
M is responsible for transportation and transaction.

553
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,310
But the most important link

554
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,740
has yet to emerge.

555
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,690
The one that links the buyers and sellers.

556
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,670
That question mark...

557
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,870
If you turn in this piece of paper...

558
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,480
You know why Lu Haizhou

559
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,780
came now, don't you?

560
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,920
To investigate you.

561
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,980
Since they want to frame me,

562
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,830
turning in that paper without a plan would only alarm them.

563
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,360
This was all your setup.

564
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,670
You kept silent

565
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,230
in order

566
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,570
to find the person behind all of this.

567
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,330
I want that person

568
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,970
to think their plan worked.

569
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,580
That's the only way to get their guard down.

570
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,700
You had it all planned, didn't you?

571
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:21,540
First,

572
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,350
[you found out you were set up]

573
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,730
[at the crime scene.]

574
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,340
[So you erased all traces]

575
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,730
[so that they had no way of leading it to you.]

576
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,450
[Next,]

577
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,670
you went to M's place and put up the photo.

578
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,360
Distracting us and getting us to focus on a different suspect

579
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,490
[and find Zhou Jun.]

580
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,330
[Then,]

581
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,430
[interrogate him.]

582
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,660
[Force him to give up the name of the person behind him.]

583
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,290
[But I didn't expect]

584
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:44,220
[Zhou Jun to keep his lips sealed shut.]

585
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,350
So you came up with the step after that.

586
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,500
Letting him go.

587
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:49,420
[When I saw]

588
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:50,810
[that the security footage]

589
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:51,820
[from Huige Hotel caught no signs or traces]

590
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,830
[of the culprit,]

591
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,520
[I realized they might have the ability]

592
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,320
[to tamper with surveillance.]

593
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,970
[That's why I deliberately had a chat with Zhou Jun]

594
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,630
[under the security camera.]

595
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:04,910
By doing so,

596
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,000
they'll make their move again.

597
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,520
You're using yourself as bait.

598
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,210
Countering their moves as you go.

599
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,850
Continuously plotting.

600
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,730
All to lure out that question mark.

601
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,260
It's like I'm sitting

602
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,570
at a giant poker table.

603
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,460
The moment M died,

604
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,250
I knew

605
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,980
I had little time left.

606
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,770
I want to find out as much as I can

607
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,370
about who that question mark is

608
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,630
before I exit the game.

609
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,000
Unfortunately, it's too late.

610
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,980
I've investigated all I could.

611
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,370
I'll leave the rest to you.

612
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,800
Why did you have to hide even from me?

613
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,230
Even if I escaped their trap,

614
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,240
they would have another move.

615
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,060
They'll investigate me eventually.

616
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,460
If I am suspected,

617
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,260
everyone around me

618
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,520
will be excluded.

619
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,760
Leaving you in the dark

620
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,940
is the only way for us to find the truth.

621
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,780
You are my hidden trump.

622
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,130
Find that question mark.

623
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,640
[Zhou Jun]

624
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:44,500
Officer Lu,

625
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,520
this is the person in the security footage.
