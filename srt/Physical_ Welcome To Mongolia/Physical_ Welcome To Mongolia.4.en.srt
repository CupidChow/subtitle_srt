00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,837
PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:09,509
BÖKH TRAINING CENTER

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,312
I don't like this at all.

4
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:14,247
It's too scary here.

5
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:15,315
Look at this place.

6
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,721
THE ATHLETES GREET THEM WITH APPLAUSE

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,358
ORKHON'S BÖKH TEAM

8
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:31,631
BÖKH: YOU LOSE IF ANY PART OF YOUR BODY
EXCEPT HANDS OR FEET TOUCH THE GROUND

9
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,141
Everyone looks really strong.

10
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,009
It's insane.

11
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,045
All athletes share the same expression.

12
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,280
It's like seeing
Korean judokas and wrestlers.

13
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,215
Their attire…

14
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,551
I think I feel intimidated
because of their attire.

15
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,220
It's their attire, shoes, and everything.

16
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:55,688
Wow.

17
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,059
Today is all about you two,

18
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,461
so pick the strongest opponents
and face them.

19
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,930
-Why?
-Choose the biggest person.

20
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,432
Go easy on us.

21
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:06,633
I thought today

22
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,169
we could just watch Orkhon train…

23
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,070
Amotti.

24
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,071
Amotti.

25
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,043
ORKHON'S TEAMMATE:
DARMAAJANTSAN

26
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,578
Who's stronger?

27
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,887
I'll show you later.

28
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,690
I don't think
I've ever seen him this excited.

29
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,358
Why are you so excited?

30
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,328
He's picking on us.

31
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,030
Don't pick on weak people like us.

32
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,873
-Amotti!
-Yes?

33
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,312
Hurry, let's toss him up together.

34
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,852
Please!

35
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:05,859
A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME

36
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,460
That's scary.

37
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,062
Wow.

38
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,000
We prepared traditional Bökh attire
for Amotti and Dong-hyun.

39
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,402
It's from everyone on our wrestling team.

40
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,638
But I really like what I have on.

41
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,073
I like what I'm wearing.

42
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,207
This is really nice.

43
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,609
It's warm.

44
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,477
I hope you'll be good students.

45
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,779
Okay.

46
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,817
I hope you become a good wrestler.

47
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,756
I'll soon be 50 years old.

48
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:38,992
I can't even untie this.

49
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,094
I'm so old that I can't even untie it.

50
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,129
Amotti.

51
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:44,931
Got it.

52
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,299
What a clever idea.

53
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,001
Great.

54
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,335
Okay.

55
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,336
Is this underwear?

56
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,971
-Undies?
-<i>Shuudag.</i>

57
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,240
This is pretty revealing.

58
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,011
Mongolian wrestlers
deeply value this attire,

59
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,446
so they never set it down below the hips.

60
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,382
So you hold it up like this?

61
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,254
When you take a break,
you put it around your neck like this.

62
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,456
-Like this?
-Yes.

63
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:15,195
Come on, let's go and change.

64
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,339
PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

A TRADITIONAL "EAGLE DANCE" RITUAL

67

CHAPTER 2: ABRUPT WARM-UP

73
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,775
Gosh, he's so quick.

REPEAT PERFORMANCE

75
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,751
That hurts!

76
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,119
It hurts here…

77
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,058
LEARNING BÖKH BY GETTING TOSSED

78
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,776
Lower your stance, then lift up.

79
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,045
-Drop down, then lift up.
-Okay.

80
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,964
He can find out later.

81
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,203
SECRET TRAINING CONTINUES
WITH THEIR TEACHERS

82
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,142
-Nice! This was great!
-Okay.

84
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:25,017

I'd like to choose…

86
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,489
You'll be my opponent.

87
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,993
LKHAGVA-OCHIR VS. KIM DONG-HYUN

88
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,095
This wrestler is 18 years old.

89
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:38,698
Are you serious?

90
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:39,832
USUKHBAYAR
18 YEARS OLD

91
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,801
Amotti can go against him.

92
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,038

ROUND 1:
ORKHONBAYAR VS. DARMAAJANTSAN

101
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,007
This is my stage.

102
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,009
This match is mine.

103
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,379
<i>I'm curious because they say</i>
<i>Orkhon is the best here.</i>

104
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,123
CALMLY FEEL EACH OTHER OUT

105
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,062
ORKHON MAKES THE FIRST MOVE

106
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,932
DARMAA SUCCESSFULLY BLOCKS IT

107
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,533
Come on, Darmaa!

108
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,412
They are neck and neck.

109
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,657
FLIPS HIM IN ONE MOTION

110
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,197
THE WINNER SPREADS HIS WINGS

111
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,499
Only the winner does that?

112
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,035
WINNER

113
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,872
TEAM ORKHONBAYAR
WINS ROUND 1

114
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,811
THE LOSER PASSES UNDER THE WINNER'S ARM
PER TRADITION

115
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:37,049
THE NEXT COMPETITORS WARM UP

116
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,952
ROUND 2:
AMOTTI VS. USUKHBAYAR (18 YEARS OLD)

117
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,622
The wrestler I feel most pressured by

118
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,090
is absolutely nobody.

119
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,093
<i>I'll make sure to win.</i>

120
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,606
What happened? It's over already?

121
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,679
A SINGLE PULL ENDS THE MATCH

122
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,081
What the heck?

123
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,288
He's too strong.

124
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:18,157
ROUND 2: REMATCH
(AT AMOTTI'S REQUEST)

125
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:20,393
Jeez.

126
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,661
GET IT TOGETHER!

127
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,832
EASILY DODGES

128
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,537
<i>I've never played</i>

129
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,005
<i>any kind of contact sport.</i>

130
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,208
<i>But I'll still try my best.</i>

131
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,717
THE MOMENT AMOTTI MAKES A MOVE

132
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,652
HE GETS PULLED AND TOSSED ASIDE

133
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,361
I think they picked
the wrong opponent for me.

134
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,930
They chose someone way too strong,

135
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,566
so I didn't stand a chance.

136
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,869
WINNER

137
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,038
TEAM DARMAAJANTSAN

138
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:16,282
HE UNTIES HIS CORD TO CONCEDE DEFEAT

139
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,317
Amotti, do this.

140
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,522
HE DOES AS HE'S TAUGHT

141
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,229
LAST MATCH

142
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,200
FINAL ROUND:
OCHIR VS. KIM DONG-HYUN

143
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,837
<i>The one I feel most pressured by</i>
<i>is Kim Dong-hyun.</i>

144
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,240
But I'm Mongolian,

145
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,311
so I know I can beat a Korean athlete.

146
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,681
<i>I held my ground for the most part</i>
<i>during UFC matches.</i>

147
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,349
I'll show you what I've got.

148
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,361
Ochir is aggressive.

149
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,438
DONG-HYUN GETS CAUGHT IN A REAR HOLD

150
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,021
OCHIR BRACES WITH HIS CORE STRENGTH

151
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,002
No, no!

152
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,110
THEY GO DOWN AT THE SAME TIME

153
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,516
Who won?

154
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,053
VAR REVIEW

155
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,090
Your elbow touched the floor.

156
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,160
DONG-HYUN'S ELBOW HIT THE FLOOR FIRST

157
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,001
I'll do it right this time.

158
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,572
FINAL ROUND: REMATCH
(AT EVERYONE'S REQUEST)

159
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,142
You got this!

160
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,377
ASSERTS HIS DOMINANCE

161
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,151
Who are you pulling for?

162
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:35,755
Ochir.

163
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:37,757
Ochir.

164
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,029
Because we're in Mongolia.

165
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,164
It's a Mongolian sport.

166
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,510
THE MATCH RESUMES

167
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,278
Show us what you've got!

168
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:09,088
HANDS CAN TOUCH THE GROUND

169
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,493
I can't get a grip on him.

170
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,728
Where can I grab him?

171
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,631
Wow, they're so competitive.

172
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:23,135
What was that for?

173
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,771
What was that for?

174
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,873
What is it?

175
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,441
Why did he hit me?

176
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,910
What for?

177
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,012
A GESTURE OF ENCOURAGEMENT

178
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,085
GRAPPLING HAND TO HAND

179
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,202
He engaged his back muscles
to stay balanced.

180
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,337
I've never seen
an athlete like him before.

181
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,407
How am I supposed to take him down?

182
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,046
You got this!

183
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,314
Come on, Dong-hyun!

184
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:14,854
What the heck?

185
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,056
What the heck?

186
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,658
THIS IS INSANE

187
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:20,726
IT'S LIKE A CIRCUS

188
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:21,994
He won't go down.

189
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,062
Jeez, come on.

190
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,365
He won't go down.

191
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,368
I can't flip him.

192
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,004
He won't go down. His balance is insane.

193
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,080
SOLID BACK MUSCLES

194
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,417
<i>I saw Ochir's grit and tenacity.</i>

195
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,019
He was really something.

196
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,289
With that skill,
I felt he should take first place.

197
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,962
Hey!

198
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:57,997
My undies.

199
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,033
OCHIR GRABS ONTO DONG-HYUN'S UNDIES

200
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,301
Hey.

201
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,602
Hey!

202
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,675
That's my behind!

203
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,977
Hey!

204
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:16,215
HELPLESS AGAINST THE UNDIES ATTACK

205
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:33,165
OCHIR ATTACKS WHILE DONG-HYUN IS OFF GUARD

206
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,205
Who won?

207
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,443
DONG-HYUN'S ELBOW HIT THE FLOOR FIRST

208
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,913
<i>Jeez, how humiliating.</i>

209
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,016
I didn't know you could grab
inside the undies too.

210
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,452
Ochir said it was his first time,
but clearly it wasn't.

211
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,688
USING YOUR OPPONENT'S ATTIRE
IS ALSO A SKILL

212
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,894
THE LOSER PASSES UNDER THE WINNER'S ARM

213
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,400
VICTORY RITUAL

214
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,535
So cool.

215
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,277
TEAM ORKHONBAYAR
WINS ROUND 3

216
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:21,113
WINNER:
ORKHONBAYAR, AMOTTI, LKHAGVA-OCHIR

217
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,454
It was a pleasure to have

218
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,124
such amazing people
join us for today's training.

219
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:42,001
Now let's raise our voices
and sing with confidence.

220
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,871
"MY BELOVED HOMELAND"
(MY BELOVED HOMELAND, FOREVER IN MY HEART)

221
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,374
REGARDED AS MONGOLIA'S "SECOND ANTHEM,"

222
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,677
THIS PATRIOTIC SONG IS OFTEN SUNG
AT NATIONAL CELEBRATIONS LIKE NAADAM

223
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,928
DOING AN INTERVIEW

224
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,931
What is it?

225
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,133
What are you doing?

226
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:21,073
DONG-HYUN & AMOTTI VS. ORKHON

227
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,076
They're like little kids.

228
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:28,914
TRIES THE UNDIES-GRABBING TECHNIQUE

229
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,950
PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

230
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,021
Wow, what's all this?

231
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,190
Holy cow.

232
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,291
This is amazing.

233
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,459
Look at the meat!

234
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,396
There's Japanese food, Korean food,

235
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,098
Mongolian food, and everything.

236
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,637
FAREWELL DINNER

237
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:56,241
Tonight's dinner has been prepared
by Team Mongolia.

238
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,510
-Gosh.
-Thank you.

239
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,778
Thank you.

240
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,649
It's like the meal we had
before the final match in<i> Physical: Asia</i>.

241
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:18,630
What do I dip this in?

242
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,998
This sauce?

243
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,541
This meat is delicious.

244
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,776
It's so good.

245
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,077
This looks really good.

246
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,324
ADIYASUREN
TEAM MONGOLIA

247
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:49,728
Good to see you.

248
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,365
-Wow.
-You really scared me.

249
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,733
Seriously.

250
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,168
You scared me more.

251
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:57,936
Gosh, my heart…

252
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,404
I flew up about 10 cm.

253
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,439
I jumped.

254
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,575
-I saw it coming and still got startled.
-You came running.

255
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,079
So that's why there are empty seats.

256
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,814
He jumped up like a grasshopper.

257
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,323
Then who is this seat for?

258
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,560
-Is someone else coming?
-Another surprise?

259
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,097
A REASONABLE ASSUMPTION

260
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,431
Yun Sung-bin?

261
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:27,900
Seriously, maybe it's him.

262
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,034
Sung-bin.

263
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,302
Hey!

264
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,236
Just kidding.

265
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,009
Acting isn't for you.

266
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:42,681
Actually, Dulguun and I
were going to surprise you together,

267
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:48,320
but he had a game today,
so he couldn't come.

268
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:49,922
I see.

269
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,123
He had a game?

270
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,391
DULGUUN'S SEAT

271
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:58,163
I think Team Korea members
meet up pretty often.

272
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,531
Maybe not altogether,

273
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,568
but we'll meet in small groups
and work out and such.

274
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,070
Do Team Mongolia members meet up often?

275
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,039
We haven't had the time.

276
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:11,643
Everyone has been very busy
with their own training and work.

277
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,252
All of you are still active athletes,

278
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,989
and Khandsuren plays
in the Japanese league.

279
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,123
But for us…

280
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,059
I…

281
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,126
I'm retired.

282
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:28,994
I'm an elder,

283
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,196
so I have a lot of time to hang out.

284
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,600
You won<i> Physical: Asia</i>,
so you're not an elder.

285
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,278
I'll help you make it to the UFC.

286
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,080
Yeah.

287
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,314
UFC and Bökh.

288
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,050
I want to go against you two in judo

289
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,619
and win.

290
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,054
Amotti!

291
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,089
Please don't.

292
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,999
I saw you use judo techniques
while doing Bökh today.

293
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,567
You used three judo moves on me.

294
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,235
You tried to take me down.

295
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,037
Right, I did.

296
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,972
You almost fell, then recovered.

297
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,941
Almost fall, then recover.

298
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,876
I didn't know how to defend against it.

299
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,412
He was this close to the floor.

300
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,381
Ochir doesn't have any bones,

301
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,715
so he just bends backward.

302
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,084
That's so true.

303
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,052
I thought I took him down,

304
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,453
but then…

305
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,321
Seriously.

306
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,057
You thought you won a few times, right?

307
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,293
You're really something.

308
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,260
That's me.

309
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,996
Amotti ended up cheering for Mongolia.

310
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,035
He was the underdog in terms of weight,

311
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,436
so that's why I cheered for him.

312
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,673
What makes Bökh distinctive
is that there are no weight classes.

313
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,009
By the way, Adiyasuren,

314
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,911
Korea is also good when it comes to judo.

315
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,247
Have you gone to Korea for training camp?

316
00:21:55,314 --> 00:22:00,319
I went there for training camp
a couple of times a while back.

317
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,421
I had a great time
with the Korean athletes,

318
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,456
and the food was really good.

319
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,091
I've really liked Korean food since then.

320
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:12,898
Kimchi<i> jjigae.</i>

321
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,599
-Kimchi<i> jjigae?</i>
-Wow.

322
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,568
There's a really good kimchi<i> jjigae </i>place.

323
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:17,803
They only sell kimchi<i> jjigae.</i>

324
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,071
-Kimchi?
-Seriously.

325
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,807
They put tons of meat
in their kimchi<i> jjigae.</i>

326
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,041
Just let us know,

327
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,109
and Amotti will handle it.

328
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,578
He'll take care of everything.

329
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,048
I'll show you the full experience.

330
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,050
Amotti will buy you everything
at Olive Young.

331
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,160
You might age suddenly.

332
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,000
I see.

333
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,819
I want to learn that phrase.

334
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,889
The subtitles said, "Warriors, mount up!"

335
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,091
<i>-Daichid,</i>
<i>-Daichid,</i>

336
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,559
<i>morindoo!</i>

337
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,929
<i>Daichid morindoo.</i>

338
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,699
If that's your memorable moment,

339
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,034
mine is when they counted,
"One, two, three."

340
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,838
The feeling that washed over me
during the wall pushing match…

341
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,040
<i>-Neg khoyor gurav.</i>
<i>-Neg khoyor gurav.</i>

342
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,842
<i>-Neg khoyor gurav.</i>
<i>-Neg khoyor gurav.</i>

343
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,045
Let's push.<i> Neg khoyor gurav</i>!

344
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:37,916
After the final match,

345
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,051
Ochir went to the Mongolian flag

346
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:43,488
and showed a gesture of respect like this.

347
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:44,990
He did something like that.

348
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,260
Is that a traditional Mongolian ritual?

349
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,731
It's hard to give a clear-cut answer.

350
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,199
Even though it was a small flag,

351
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,035
it embodied everything
our country stands for.

352
00:23:57,135 --> 00:24:01,072
That small flag felt bigger
than anything else in my heart.

353
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:08,380
So I think my body just reacted
to what I was feeling.

354
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,650
Before I knew it,
I was kneeling and paying my respects.

355
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,554
-It really resonated with me.
-That scene was touching.

356
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,522
In Korea,

357
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:20,258
people talk about how we won
and congratulate us,

358
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:21,393
but more than that,

359
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,094
they say how amazing Team Mongolia was.

360
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,764
Even though a winner was declared
in the final match,

361
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,300
it didn't feel like anyone lost.

362
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,734
It felt like both teams had won.

363
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,572
I think that was the result of the match.

364
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:38,176
Right. It's not every day
that you see competitions end like this.

365
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:41,046
This particular show was created

366
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,113
because Orkhon said

367
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,550
that Team Mongolia would win first place
and invite Team Korea.

368
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,552
That's how all of this started.

369
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,021
It's obvious how much you love Mongolia.

370
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,960
We really appreciate both of you

371
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,129
taking the time to come all the way here.

372
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,633
Even though the trip was short,

373
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,902
it was full of good, lasting memories.

374
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,604
We had a truly wonderful time,

375
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:10,041
and it was the most meaningful
and heartfelt experience of the year.

376
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,043
I never thought
this would actually happen.

377
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,479
But it did come true,

378
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,681
and I'm happy that I spent quality time

379
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:17,949
with good friends.

380
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,552
Every photo we took was a masterpiece,

381
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,354
like the plains of Mongolia.

382
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,092
<i>My friend said</i>
<i>his dream destination was Mongolia.</i>

383
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,493
<i>And now I know why.</i>

384
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,029
<i>We tried our best to share with you</i>

385
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,632
<i>Mongolia's most beautiful culture</i>
<i>and traditions</i>

386
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,233
<i>during your brief visit.</i>

387
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:40,205
<i>I hope our friendship lasts</i>
<i>for many years to come.</i>

388
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,742
And as always, we'll greet you with,
"Welcome to Mongolia."

389
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,011
We'll see you again.

390
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,412
Let's see each other in Korea.

391
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,014
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

392

and thank you for inviting us here.

403

We'll continue producing great content

00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,714
and show the power and beauty of Mongolia

405
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,849
to audiences around the globe.

406
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,018
We'll be grateful for your ongoing support

407
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,620
