1
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:08,274
PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,509
It's your last arrow.

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:10,777
Yeah, last arrow.

4
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:14,681
Don't pull back too hard.

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:15,682
Good aim.

6
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,426
No!

7
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,628
ORKHON: 0

8
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,530
Zero points.

9
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:31,998
Orkhonbayar is

10
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,334
definitely a city boy.

11
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:37,470
It was my first time shooting a bow, so…

12
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,572
I think the three of us…

13
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,010
Final match?

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,720
AMOTTI VS. EDDIE VS. ORKHON

15
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,221
-Amotti.
-Pull back hard.

16
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:56,322
I won't pull back hard.

17
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,524
I'm going with technique.

18
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:03,897
Hey…

19
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,733
INEFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,635
You really have to pull back hard.

21
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,236
Amotti will end up cleaning.

22
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:13,973
I can't do anything in this cold.

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,876
I'm definitely an apartment boy.

24
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,345
Yeah.

25
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,515
Show us what you got, Eddie.

26
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,257
EDDIE DODGES POOP PENALTY

27
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:32,826
Orkhon!

28
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,240
Good aim.

29
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,275
He's got this.

30
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,114
Where did it go?

31
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,882
AMOTTI: X, EDDIE: O, ORKHON: X

32
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,458
(FOR REAL)

33
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,127
We have to make Orkhon clean.

34
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:08,695
Please let me beat Orkhon.

35
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,763
I was laughing on the outside,

36
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,266
but inside I was serious.

37
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,068
In order to beat Orkhon,

38
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,603
I'm going to give it my all

39
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,440
like it's <i>Physical: Asia, Season 2.</i>

40
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,941
This is our last chance.

41
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,822
-What is it?
-The ground!

42
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,090
It touched the ground!

43
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,291
It touched the ground!

44
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,328
This is the loser's match.

45
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,471
This and this? It's okay.

46
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,706
All of this is okay.

47
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,009
I'LL SHOOT
IN FRONT OF THE TARGET

48
00:02:58,878 --> 00:02:59,712
THE ABSOLUTE FINAL ARROW

49
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:00,613
He looks good.

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,282
He has the best stance.

51
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,651
-You look like a veteran.
-He looks the coolest.

52
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,120
He really has the best stance.

53
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,556
FAILED

54
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:13,092
ORKHON GETS TO CLEAN THE POOP

55
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,937
Despite how cold it was today,

56
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,505
we had a fun time doing archery.

57
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,540
Now, we're going to see my show.

58
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,512
Wow!

59
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,015
Oh, okay then.

60
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,067
FINISHED CLEANING THE POOP

61
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,302
Wow, that's so cool!

62
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,271
That's amazing.

63
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,245
PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

64
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,515
OCHIR'S PERFORMANCE VENUE

65
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,720
Ochir said he was
going to perform with his family.

66
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,923
I'm really looking forward to it.

67
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,965
This looks like a <i>ger</i>.

68
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,934
It's designed like a <i>ger</i>.

69
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,169
Wow, this is amazing.

70
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,804
It's a real circus stage.

71
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,239
Seriously.

72
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,340
Come on, Ochir.

73
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:40,847
Why am I nervous?

74
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,784
1ST PERFORMANCE: OCHIR'S SOLO

75
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,481
I'm breaking out in a sweat.

76
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,558
He's balancing the whole time.

77
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,930
This is amazing.

78
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,603
He's incredible.

79
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,507
Hey, there's more.

80
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,311
What is it?

81
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,013
What's he doing?

82
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,835
He's incredible.

83
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,470
That was amazing.

84
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,473
He's so cool.

87
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:24,951
She's cute.

88
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,018
-She is.
-She is.

89
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,788
2ND PERFORMANCE:
OCHIR'S CHILDREN

90
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,590
She looks like a bird.

91
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,493
They're so pretty.

92
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,931
-What's this?
-Wow.

93
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,669
They're incredible!

94
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,741
How do they move like that?

95
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,643
Holy cow.

96
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:56,749
She put her feet on top.

97
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,219
How are they so flexible?

98
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,458
They're so amazing.

99
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,626
That's insane.

100
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,666
How did he have four daughters?

101
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,003
Imagine how happy he must be
to go home after work.

102
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:19,972
What?

103
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:22,742
Who's that?

104
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,178

00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,234
I just got chills.

108
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,175
Seriously, this is so incredible.

109
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,583
What a beautiful family.

110
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,489
How amazing.

111
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,421
Their strength is…

112
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,541
Wow, this is seriously…

113
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,013
This is insane.

114
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,199
-How are they doing that?
-Feet.

115
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,534
She's hanging from his feet.

116
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,861
I almost teared up
because it was so amazing.

117
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,430
OCHIR RETURNS AFTER PERFORMING

118
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,302
What's this long thing?

119
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:12,111
LAST PERFORMANCE:
OCHIR'S WIFE & HIS STUDENTS

120
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,300
I've never seen this before.

00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,016
Holy cow, that was amazing!

122
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,586
It was totally amazing.

123
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,654
Gosh, I'm hot.

124
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,290
I'm sweating.

125
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,327
What's going on?

126
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,395
OCHIR GOES ON STAGE

127
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,196
Let's see.

128
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,533
You want me to come up?

129
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,712
I'm not doing that.

130
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,147
I can't do this.

131
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,021
Hold on!

132
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,034
No, I can't do that. Absolutely not.

133
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,502
Oh, come on!

134
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,007
No messing around!

135
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,208
No messing around.

136
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,876
You have to stop up here.

137
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,892
I can't do stuff like this.

138
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,094
I just can't.

139
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,585
Why is it so hard to climb this?

140
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,791
ENDS UP LYING DOWN

141
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,126
SMILING

142
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,260
LOSES IT

143
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,367
Hey!

144
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,539
Hey, little brother.

145
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,008
He's adorable.

146
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,082
All right, everyone. Let's take a bow.

147
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,152
For everyone here today,

148
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:09,388
we put together
our special family circus performance.

149
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,058
This is my wife and my daughters.

150
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,727
We're a true circus family.

151
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:26,372
Tomorrow, we'll invite
all of you to our home.

152
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,108
We'll prepare
some delicious meals for you.

153
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,278
I hope you'll have a good time
with my family tomorrow.

154
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,781
Why is that so hard to climb?

155
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,689
Hold on. How do I get down?

156
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,558
How do I get down?

157
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:46,458
Wait a minute.

158
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,194
PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

159
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,730
OCHIR'S HOME

160
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,437
He has a really nice house.

161
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,645
IT'S STILL DARK IN THE MORNING

162
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,263
Jeez, that's so cold.

163
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,133
OCHIR'S FAMILY GETS READY
TO GREET GUESTS

164
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,034
KNOCK KNOCK

165
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,339
Come in.

166
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,150
Hello. You're the kids we saw yesterday.

167
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,219
Holy cow.

168
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,222
Your home is already giving off
New Year vibes.

169
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,931
I love how this house feels.

170
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,136
WELCOME TO OCHIR'S HOME

171
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,071
Hey, look at that.

172
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,173
That's an insane family photo.

173
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,113
It's probably the only one in the world.

174
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,255
Hey, younger guy.

175
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,525
Oh, that's right.

176
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,526
If the host sits there,

177
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,862
you have to sit here, Dong-hyun.

178
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,664
-Why?
-The older guy sits here.

179
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,565
-Right, the rules.
-Like yesterday.

180
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,401
Got it.

181
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,472
You're the elder.

182
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,308
Right, I'm the elder.

183
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:48,013
We came very early in the morning,

184
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,883
so we feel bad
for the trouble you went through

185
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,651
to get everything ready.

186
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,287
There's no need to worry at all.

187
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,856
It's Mongolian tradition to welcome guests

188
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,060
who have come a long way,
so please relax and enjoy yourselves.

189
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,027
No worries at all.

190
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,629
<i>-Bayarlalaa.</i>
<i>-Bayarlalaa.</i>

191
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,698
We're very thankful.

192
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,700
I hope we'll have the opportunity

193
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,134
to return the hospitality.

194
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:18,243
We prepared a traditional Mongolian meal
especially for you.

195
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,121
This is <i>airag</i>.

196
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,189
Fermented horse milk?

197
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,791
-I've never seen this before.
-It's like Korean <i>makgeolli</i>.

198
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,760
Mongolians enjoy this drink,

199
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,529
and they serve it to special guests.

200
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,031
I see.

201
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,535
But if you drink that much,

202
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,304
won't you get completely drunk?

203
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,144
You can hold your liquor.

204
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,713
Hey, it's cold. It's not warm.

205
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,682
Guests who come over

206
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,518
have to sing a song
to bring good luck to the home.

207
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,619
Really?

208
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,089
Yes, really.

209
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,126
What song do I sing?

210
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,230
There are lots of kids,
so I'll sing a kids' song.

211
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,613
<i>There are three bears in a house</i>

212
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,415
<i>Daddy bear, mommy bear</i>

213
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,616
Oh, she doesn't look happy.

214
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,084
<i>And baby bear</i>

215
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,788
<i>Daddy bear is fat</i>

216
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,391
-<i>Mommy bear is slim</i>
-<i>Mommy bear is slim</i>

217
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,995
-<i>Baby bear is really cute</i>
-<i>Baby bear is really cute</i>

218
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,165
-<i>Shrug, shrug! Good job!</i>
-<i>Shrug, shrug! Good job!</i>

219
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,402
BABY BEAR FEELS DAZED

220
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,504
How do you say, "I'm sorry" in Mongolian?

221
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,177
This smells strong, like <i>makgeolli</i>.

222
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,382
I'm sipping it to make it last.

223
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,184
Down it in three gulps.

224
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,518
Okay.

225
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:17,029
He takes tiny sips,
but his reactions are huge.

226
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,499
AMOTTI DRINKS TOO

227
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,568
AS WELL AS THE HOST

228
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,776
He looks a little out of it.

229
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,077
And he's more talkative.

230
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,928
PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

231
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,965
Here's the <i>khorkhog</i> Amotti ordered.

232
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,066
It's <i>khorkhog!</i>

233
00:18:56,568 --> 00:19:00,405
There's also fried dumplings and <i>buuz</i>,
so help yourselves.

234
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,308
I hope you enjoy the food.

235
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,179
This is so good!

236
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,749
-Wow.
-It's delicious.

237
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,056
This is amazing. It's the best.

238
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,227
It's so good.

239
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,695
And it's barely seasoned.

240
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,868
I'm curious about something.

241
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:33,005
Do the kids train with you regularly,

242
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,174
or did they practice
only for yesterday's show?

243
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,409
We train and practice together regularly,

244
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,379
but we specifically prepared
yesterday's performance for you.

245
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,817
Right now, I'm teaching my kids

246
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:49,154
to pass on my expertise and knowledge
of traditional Mongolian acrobatics,

247
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,456
but when they grow up,

248
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:57,796
they'll decide for themselves
and follow their own paths.

249
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,767
The children must be very proud

250
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,068
of their father.

251
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:08,574
I think your youngest is close in age
to my second child.

252
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,046
Really?

253
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:17,416
If we go to Korea,
I think our kids will hit it off quickly.

254
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,190
My kids can teach your kids acrobatics.

255
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,327
My kids are learning a bit of gymnastics.

256
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,297
When kids use the trampoline
at a kids' café,

257
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,233
they usually just jump and fall over.

258
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,268
But Ochir's kids will flip in the air.

259
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,937
It'll be really amazing to watch.

260
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,906
-Parenting for a day, done in a snap.
-In a snap.

261
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,943
What I found amazing yesterday

262
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,612
was the hanging performance.

263
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,547
I was so moved by it.

264
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:51,316
Your whole family is amazing.

265
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,287
My wife took up acrobatics later in life.

266
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,223
It was after we got married
when she was about 25.

267
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,560
That's when she decided
to become an acrobat.

268
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:04,997
Wow, that's amazing.

269
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,565
It's not easy once you're an adult.

270
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,701
What did you do
before becoming an acrobat?

271
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:15,207
I worked for Korea Visa Application Center
for about two years.

272
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,411
I also worked for Mongolian Airlines.

273
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,683
Those jobs had nothing to do
with circus performing.

274
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,954
I turned an office worker
into a circus acrobat.

275
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,657
How hard did she have to train
to catch up?

276
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,627
She became this good

277
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:39,598
because she trained harder
than anything on <i>Physical: Asia</i>.

278
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,867
That must've been so hard.

279
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,136
Was your training difficult?

280
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,404
Was he very hard on you?

281
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,472
Of course.

282
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,541
-Of course.
-Of course.

283
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:54,446
I think Ochir would've scolded her a lot.

284
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,783
If I'd tried to scold her,
I'd have only gotten into trouble.

285
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,692
OCHIR CALLS SOMEONE OVER

286
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,761
Come here.

287
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,168
I'm Narantsetseg.

288
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,236
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

289
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,572
You're a handsome man.

290
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,207
And your mother is very beautiful.

291
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,510
So I think you're handsome
because you take after her.

292
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,453
Last month was a difficult time
for our family

293
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,823
because my father passed away.

294
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,460
It's been exactly one month.

295
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,996
He passed away
the day before <i>Physical: Asia</i> aired.

296
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:48,166
So we were in the hospital
when the first episode aired.

297
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,503
It was a very difficult time.

298
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,807
I offer my deepest condolences
on your father's passing.

299
00:22:55,874 --> 00:23:00,212
But I'm sure your father
is watching you from above,

300
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:04,116
filled with pride and joy
at the life you're living.

301
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,217
Thank you.

302
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,854
I was happy that <i>Physical: Asia</i>

303
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,089
reached so many people,

304
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:14,025
and that people around the world
cheered for Mongolia.

305
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,763
But even though I felt joy and happiness,

306
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:24,236
my heart ached even more,
as if it were breaking.

307
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,773
Before my dad passed away,

308
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,608
I told him
I participated in <i>Physical: Asia</i>,

309
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:33,779
and that his name and mine
were becoming known worldwide.

310
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,681
He cried when he heard that.

311
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,952
Even more people in Mongolia now

312
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,456
see you as a hero and support you,

313
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,726
so if your father were still here,
he'd be even more pleased.

314
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:50,662
I imagine that part hurts you the most.

315
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,199
But as Orkhon said earlier,

316
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,036
I think he's always by your side,
watching over you

317
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,372
and supporting you in that way.

318
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:05,043
So I hope everything
continues to go well for you,

319
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,046
and I'll also always support you,
right by your side.

320
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,116
Thank you.

321
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,387
There are so many people in Korea

322
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,255
who love Ochir and Orkhon.

323
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,559
So I'd like to invite both of you
to Korea someday.

324
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,962
Some Korean fans have told me

325
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:27,732
that I look a lot like
the actor Kim Ji-hun.

326
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,502
If I go to Korea,
will it be possible to meet him?

327
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,871
I'll try my best to make that happen.

328
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,307
Because you resemble Kim Ji-hun,

329
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:36,942
you're known as "Mongolian Kim Ji-hun."

330
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:39,478
Your nickname is actually "Mong Ji-hun."

331
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,580
Mong Ji-hun.

332
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,448
You look the same.

333
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:44,983
Totally the same.

334
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:45,884
TRANSFORMS INTO MONG JI-HUN

335
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,185
You really resemble him.

336
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,720
-Seriously.
-So handsome.

337
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,789
Don't I look like Ma Dong-seok?

338
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,124
MONG DONG-SEOK

339
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,795
You're right.

340
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,364
You really look like him.

341
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,767
We prepared some gifts for you.

342
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,336
Thank you!

343
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:05,837
It's a puffer jacket.

344
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,439
Thank you.

345
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:11,109
We're so grateful you came
all the way from Korea,

346
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,578
shared such warm
and meaningful conversations,

347
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,181
and enjoyed the meal we prepared.

348
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,183
It truly meant a lot to us.

349
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,453
I hope the next time we meet,
we'll be just as healthy and happy.

350
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,888
Let's raise our glasses.

351
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,556
Cheers.

352
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:27,626
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

353
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,565
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

354
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:52,751
You're the best dad.

355
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,657
PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:28,887
