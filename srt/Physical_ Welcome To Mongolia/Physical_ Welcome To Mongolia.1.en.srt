00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:08,541
<i>This place is amazing.</i>

2
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:09,542
<i>I can't believe I'm here.</i>

3
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:14,948
<i>This is insane!</i>

4
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,220
<i>I want to live in Mongolia!</i>

5
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:22,455
PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,926
INCHEON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

7
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:28,328
We're going.

8
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,230
We're finally going.

9
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,132
How long are we staying?

10
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,500
It's a three-night, four-day trip.

11
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:34,401
What's with your bags?

12
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:35,668
You have so many.

13
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:38,371
I know I have a lot,
but you're even worse than I am.

14
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:39,706
Well, I…

15
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,107
- It's really cold.
- Right.

16
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:44,811
So I packed boots, a long puffer coat,
and bulky clothes.

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,745
Right.

18
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,481
- One day's worth takes up half a suitcase.
- I totally get it.

19
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,617
- Did you get any messages?
- What messages?

20
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:53,019
People in Mongolia are saying
not to come right now.

21
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,721
- Why?
- Because it's too cold.

22
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,756
They say now isn't the time
to visit Mongolia.

23
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,425
- Is it the coldest time of year there?
- Yes.

24
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,260
They say it's the coldest right now.

25
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:01,795
We have to wear five or six layers.

26
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,130
- I think this is it.
- Is it here?

27
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,299
- Mongolian Airlines.
- Wow, Mongolian Airlines.

28
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,935
- I'm curious when we get to Mongolia.
- About what?

29
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,171
Will anyone recognize us?

30
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:13,440
I'm curious about that too.

31
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,476
I hear you have a ton of followers, Motti.

32
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:17,911
Yes, I gained a bit more.

33
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,979
- Any Mongolian followers?
- A lot of them reach out…

34
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,448
- Wow, really?
- Yes.

35
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:25,919
- But--
- Hi. Oh my god, can I hug you?

36
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,654
- Oh my gosh.
- Thank you.

37
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,822
Do you know this lady?

38
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:36,129
- It's so famous.
- Oh, wow.

39
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,997
Are we… Mongolia…

40
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,500
- Are we like BTS in Mongolia?
- Yeah.

41
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,503
A QUICK SHOT WITH A MONGOLIAN FAN

42
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,139
Is <i>Physical: Asia</i>
really popular in Mongolia?

43
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,540
It's no joke.

44
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,243
- Do they get recognized on the street?
- Yes.

45
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,045
It's all over social media.

46
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,746
ANOTHER QUICK SHOT

47
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:54,781
Awesome.

48
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,050
Dong-hyun, I feel kind of relieved now.

49
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,186
Right, it's good to hear
that people liked the show.

50
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,322
I'm looking forward to this.

51
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:03,256
Thank you.

52
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,192
Wow, this is comfy.

53
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,761
- You look super comfortable.
- Yes.

54
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,296
I really like it.

55
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,634
Well…

56
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,038
You're having champagne?

57
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,807
I'm just taking it for now.

58
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,309
- It's for show.
- Oh, it's for show?

59
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,579
- Do you even drink?
- No, I don't drink.

60
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,416
And now we're off to Mongolia.

61
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,721
- Today's temperature is minus 21 degrees.
- Really?

ANOTHER PHOTO REQUEST
AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVE IN MONGOLIA

67
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,914
Wow, Mongolia is crazy!

68
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,416
- Seriously.
- They're usually very no-nonsense.

69
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,551
They never take photos.

70
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,886
- But they asked for a group photo.
- Gosh.

71
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,722
- The show must be really popular.
- When they called us over,

72
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,090
I thought we were in trouble.

73
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,227
Where are we right now?

74
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:18,598
- They're taking us through the VIP exit.
- I heard they'd do that.

75
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,666
USING THE VIP EXIT

76
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,034
This is something they do

77
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,169
for visiting dignitaries and such, right?

78
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,238
This is really out of the way.

79
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,173
Wow, this is just…

80
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,675
My friends.

81
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,577
Hey, my friends.

82
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,446
Hello.

83
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:35,848
Hey, what's this?

84
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,354
Holy cow, it's Orkhon!

Hello.

88
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,135
It's been so long.

89
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,806
This lounge?

90
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:03,676
The VIP lounge?

91
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,911
Wow, this is something else.

92
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:09,782
Hey, friend!

93
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,684
- Hey, friends.
- Yes, my friend.

94
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,785
Gosh, this is…

95
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,387
You got this?

96
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,166
Did you rent it?

97
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,238
It's starting to get warm in here.

98
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,379
Hey, since our English is kind of…

99
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,648
I practiced using this beforehand.

100
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,716
- AI assistant?
- Yeah.

101
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,717
Let's try this out.

102
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,621
Orkhon.

103
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,724
It's good to see you. I missed you.

104
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,393
Please say this in Mongolian.

105
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:57,196
<i>Hello, how are you? It's good to see you.</i>

106
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,097
Yes.

107
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,399
Hello.

108
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,769
Is <i>Physical: Asia</i> famous in Mongolia?

109
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,270
Yes, it's famous.

110
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,441
do people take pictures?

111
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,152
- I'm 28.
- He was born in 1998.

112
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,421
- Oh, he's 28?
- He's 6 years younger than me.

113
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,589
Right. Wow…

114
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,325
There's a huge gap between us.

115
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,095
- Big difference. I'm old.
- Dong-hyun is…

116
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,798
- I'm 44 years old.
- He's 44.

117
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,232
You're 44?

118
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,236
I'm old, okay?

119
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,438
<i>Eoreusi</i>?

120
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,673
- <i>Eoreusi</i>?
- Oh, <i>eoreusin</i>? Like, "elder"?

121
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,607
I'm an elder?

122
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,177
Hey, I'm not an elder!

123
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,878
No elder here!

124
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,089
- Any <i>danbaekjil</i>?
- Like, protein?

125
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,156
I'm curious.

126
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,603
Our friends.

127
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,706
PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

128
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,476
Gosh, it's cold!

129
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,643
It's freezing.

130
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,245
- Wow!
- What's that?

131
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,381
- Look at the car. It's insane!
- Holy cow!

132
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,217
It's a BMW.

133
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,486
ORKHON PREPARED A SURPRISE RIDE

134
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,788
Look at all the G-Wagons!

135
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,323
Is he rich?

136
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,491
ESCORT VEHICLES SURROUND THEIR CAR

137
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,596
Is this special treatment for us?

138
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,930
This is amazing.

139
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:39,399
What's this?

140
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,501
This is nice.

141
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,904
Orkhon is treating us too well.

142
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,673
He's giving us
the full Mongolian experience.

143
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,942
- It even has massage functions.
- Holy cow.

144
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,044
- This is amazing.
- It really is.

145
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,714
ORKHON USES A TRANSLATING APP

146
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,350
He says he prepared all this for us.

147
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,586
Thank you.

148
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,793
I hope your first trip to Mongolia
becomes a treasured memory.

149
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,463
It looks amazing outside.

150
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,911
What do you want to do in Mongolia?

151
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,513
I want to eat the same food
that Mongolian wrestlers eat

152
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,449
and become strong like them.

153
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,250
And I want to ride a horse.

154
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:35,922
We have prepared

155
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,457
an awesome two-day program

156
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,891
- for you.
- Amotti.

157
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,534
I don't think I'll get any sleep.

158
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,273
Is Orkhon married? He's single, right?

159
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,741
No, he's married.

160
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,483
How many kids do you have?

161
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,051
It's a secret?

162
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,488
But you know what?

163
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,022
This is on my YouTube channel,

164
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,759
but even Mongolians don't know that
he is already married and has a child.

165
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,928
- Really?
- Yes.

166
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,764
Eddie and Amotti talked too much
about that in the vlog.

167
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,872
Do Mongolians get married at an early age?

168
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:33,145
We tend to get married
at a relatively young age.

169
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,882
The age varies, but most get married
after they turn 18.

170
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,385
- At 18 years old?
- Wow, that's early.

171
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,288
Right, getting married
after 18 is really early.

172
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,456
That's around 20, then.

173
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,658
I got married

174
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,661
when I was 38 years old.

175
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,298
- I'm an elder.
- Right, an elder.

176
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,767
Why did you get married so late?

177
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,742
A FRIENDSHIP BOUND BY SECRETS

178
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,014
Wow, the moon is huge.

179
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,485
Hey, there's a CU!

180
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,953
It's a CU convenience store!

181
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,721
- Hey, it's CU!
- A Korean convenience store.

182
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:26,399
Do Mongolians
watch a lot of Korean TV shows?

183
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:33,706
Yes, that's right.

184
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:34,874
That's how it goes, right?

185
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,843
Yes, that's right.

186
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,580
"Let the games begin."

187
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,683
- You say, "<i>Naneun</i>…
- "<i>Naneun</i>…

188
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,717
<i>…haengbokhamnida</i>."

189
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:46,652
…<i>haengbokhamnida.</i>"

190
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,155
Yeah, that's good.
"<i>Naneun haengbokhamnida.</i>"

191
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,857
It means, "I'm so happy."

192
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,893
<i>Naneun haengbokhamnida.</i>

193
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,530
<i>Az jargaltai baina.</i>

194
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,065
Yes, that means, "I am happy."

195
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,433
Say it in Korean again.

196
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,601
- <i>Naneun…</i>
- <i>Haengbokhaeyo.</i>

197
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:02,802
<i>Haengbokhaeyo.</i>

198
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,503
<i>Naneun haengbokhaeyo.</i>

199
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,738
<i>Saranghaeyo.</i>

200
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:06,906
<i>Saranghaeyo.</i>

201
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,441
- It means, "I love you."
- "I love you."

202
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,609
In Mongolian,

203
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:10,910
it's "<i>Bi chamd khairtai."</i>

204
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,311
- <i>Bi chamd</i>
- <i>Bi chamd…</i>

205
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,546
- <i>khairtai.</i>
- <i>…khairtai.</i>

206
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,548
- <i>Bi chamd khairtai.</i>
- <i>Bi chamd khairtai.</i>

207
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,483
- <i>Daebak.</i>
- <i>Daebak.</i>

208
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,451
It means, "Wow."

209
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,452
<i>Daebak!</i>

210
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,095
ORKHON'S GO-TO RESTAURANT

211
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,564
- I'm so hungry.
- I'm starving.

212
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,434
What in the world?

213
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,216
In Mongolian, this is called <i>aaruul.</i>

214
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,417
MONGOLIAN CURD SNACK: AARUUL

215
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,255
- It's cheese.
- Hey, it's cheese.

216
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,261
I like milk tea.

217
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,331
- <i>Goy baina.</i>
- <i>Goy baina.</i>

218
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,666
- Cheers?
- Yes, cheers.

219
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,701
How do you say "cheers" in Mongolian?

220
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:09,769
<i>Toloo</i>.

221
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,139
- <i>Toloo.</i>
- <i>Toloo.</i>

222
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,841
Gosh, this smells rich.

223
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:16,742
It's the milk.

224
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,014
- It's a bit salty.
- It is.

225
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,150
It doesn't smell like tea.

226
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,152
It reminds me of

227
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:29,055
<i>seolleongtang</i> or beef bone soup.

228
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,089
How does it taste?

229
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,361
I think it'll even taste good
with rice in it.

230
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,031
We brought you some gifts.

231
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,533
- I'll get it.
- We got presents.

232
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,568
We have gifts.

233
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:43,636
We brought gifts.

234
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,246
EAGLE EDITION WHISKEY

235
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,414
Thank you.

236
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,084
TRADITIONAL MOTIF UTENSILS

237
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,719
TRADITIONAL MOTIF BLANKET

238
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,288
TRADITIONAL LANDSCAPE VASE

239
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,527
SPORTS DUFFEL BAG

240
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,596
SPORTS DUFFEL BAG
WITH MONGOLIAN FLAG EMBLEM

241
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,632
I sewed the flag on myself yesterday.

242
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:18,137
Thank you so much.
I can tell you really put a lot into this.

243
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,806
It's cold in Mongolia,
so I got you a puffer vest

244
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:21,941
and a headband.

245
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,776
I wear this headband every day.

246
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,177
It's Amotti's signature look.

247
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,713
- Thank you.
- This headband is always sold out.

248
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:32,718
You're Orkhon-tti.

249
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,019
Right, Orkhon-tti.

250
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:34,987
Mini-Amotti.

251
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,526
I think that's our food.

252
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:45,131
The food over there
is the same Mongolian food we had

253
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,968
before the final match in <i>Physical: Asia</i>.

254
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,238
Right, so we get it ourselves.

255
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,748
Wow, there's so much food.

256
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:03,816
It looks delicious.

257
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:04,917
This is amazing.

258
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,720
- This is <i>buuz</i>.
- <i>Buuz</i>?

259
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:09,488
It's the rump of a sheep.

260
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,691
This is leg of sheep.

261
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,059
It's the leg? I see.

262
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,230
What's this?

263
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,532
- Stones.
- Stones?

264
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,101
You grill the meat on this, right?

265
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:27,206
ORKHON SLICES THE MEAT HIMSELF

266
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,440
Have this.

267
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,910
Wait, is this meat?

268
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,245
It looks like whale meat.

269
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,313
Is this the flesh?

270
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,582
You eat it raw?

271
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,050
Is this cooked?

272
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,385
This is unusual.

273
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,021
It looks like a layer of fat.

274
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,857
It really is a layer of fat.

275
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,930
It doesn't look like fat.
It really is just fat.

276
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,802
It's the best kind of fat.

277
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,238
But it's really good and savory.

278
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,808
- Hey, this is it.
- This is what I mean.

279
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,510
This is it.

280
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,178
Just pure protein.

281
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,280
You have to grab and tear into this.

282
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,115
This is a must, right?

283
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,383
- Want to try it?
- Yes, I do.

284
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,285
This is going to be amazing.

285
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,089
Listen to that sizzle.

286
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,360
They're Korean,
so they're good at grilling.

287
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,004
You watch a lot of YouTube, don't you?

288
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,107
- You're Salt Khon.
- Sprinkle with vibe.

289
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,111
I'm going to try this.

290
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:44,617
Orkhon.

291
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,653
We need to move
this whole thing over there.

292
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,822
Seriously, try some right now.

293
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,923
Pop it in your mouth.

294
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,824
This is it!

295
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:53,792
- This is it.
- It's good.

296
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:54,860
This is really good.

297
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,196
- Let's eat!
- Let's eat!

298
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:58,898
<i>Saikhan khoollooroi</i>.

299
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,499
- <i>Saikhan khoollooroi</i>.
- <i>Saikhan khoollooroi</i>.

300
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,401
<i>Tsuivan.</i>

301
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,472
Wow, this is really good.

302
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,606
It's so good.

303
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,345
Hey, this is…

304
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,180
It looks like beef short rib soup.

305
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,149
They serve this at buffet restaurants.

306
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:21,520
It's a traditional Mongolian soup
that helps you recover from fatigue.

307
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,623
It's cooked so that
the heat doesn't escape.

308
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,227
This is so nourishing.

309
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,131
It's beef short rib soup.

310
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,433
That's <i>buuz</i>.

311
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:36,368
Is it good?

312
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,638
It's seasoned perfectly.

313
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,975
How do you like Mongolian meat?

314
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,677
- It's delicious.
- It's so delicious.

315
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,478
- You know what?
- It's so savory.

316
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:47,980
This is amazing for athletes.

317
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,015
- It's the best.
- It's all meat.

318
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,217
Mongolian wrestlers eat a ton of meat.

319
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,786
That's why Mongolians are so strong.

320
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:58,290
How many Mongolian wrestling titles
have you won?

321
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:03,495
I placed second at Naadam twice,

322
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,931
but I've won many times
in other competitions.

323
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,135
Naadam is the biggest festival
in Mongolia, right?

324
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:13,939
Yes, because ranks are awarded at Naadam.

325
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,375
Right, as your rank increases,
your head ribbon…

326
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,845
The head ribbon markings change
and become more distinctive.

327
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,214
What's the highest title?

328
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,248
<i>Avarga.</i>

329
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,017
I'm working toward becoming <i>avarga</i>.

330
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,519
That's how hard it is to earn a high rank.

331
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:28,988
What if your team

332
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,622
had entered the second-chance round

333
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,958
- where you had to steal the ball?
- Right, steal the ball.

334
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,893
What would you have done?

335
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,261
I would have thrown

336
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,564
the ball and the person together.

337
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,170
What really surprised me

338
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,972
- was how we kept pushing the cart.
- Right.

339
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,308
But your team pushed the wheels.

340
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,945
- I thought, "Orkhon is really smart."
- He really is.

341
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,281
Any other Mongolian
would've pushed the wheels too.

342
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,983
Why didn't I think of that?

343
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,918
And when we had to breach the gate,

344
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,154
your team focused on ramming one side.

345
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,490
- That thought never occurred to me.
- It was a smart move.

346
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,559
Maybe that's the Genghis Khan in us.

347
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,828
So it's hardwired in your DNA?

348
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,063
A lot of comments said that.

349
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,398
We were quick to close the gate.

350
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,833
It was so hard.

351
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,437
So I took turns
looking at the production crew,

352
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,373
and as I walked by, I thought to myself,

353
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,509
"Why are they making it so hard?"

354
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,085
Did you enjoy your meal? Are you full?

355
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:33,986
I'm stuffed.

356
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,021
All of this was for you two.

357
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,026
We prepared
another special surprise for you.

358
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:45,397
Traditional Mongolian performances.

359
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,400
Traditional Mongolian performances?

360
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:52,204
1ST WELCOME PERFORMANCE: KHOOMEI

361
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:53,739
I like the music.

362
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,507
It's lively.

363
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,594
You can hear two voices.

364
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,996
He's whistling while singing.

365
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,798
Is he hiding something?

366
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,101
Did he turn on a speaker?

367
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,607
Where is that sound coming from?

368
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,283
Was that a horse?

369
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,887
That sounded like a horse!

370
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,563
Hey!

371
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,701
2ND WELCOME PERFORMANCE: LIVE INK DRAWING

372
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,102
They're so good.

373
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,304
It's Amotti.

374
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:00,973
Amotti?

375
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,710
They're so good at drawing.

376
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,445
This is awesome.

377
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,446
It's a horse.

378
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,651
That horse drawing is amazing.

379
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:17,789
This is unbelievable.

380
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,931
This is so cool.

381
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,536
3RD WELCOME PERFORMANCE:
TRADITIONAL MONGOLIAN COSTUME SHOW

382
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,537
Orgil.

383
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,707
Are they supposed to be
descendants of Mongolian warriors?

384
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:51,190
It feels like we've gone back in time.

385
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,262
- That's so cool.
- It's amazing.

386
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,967
We prepared this for you

387
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,203
because you were coming to Mongolia.

388
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,137
Thank you so much.

389
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,238
It was so amazing.

390
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,707
The food was incredible,

391
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,543
and watching all of these performances

392
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,346
is something I'll never forget.

393
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:18,250
We will have
even better experiences tomorrow.

394
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:22,588
We're going to the countryside
to ride horses and do archery.

395
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:27,259
So you'll need to wear warmer clothes.

396
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,827
Only Amotti will ride a horse.

397
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,763
- I'm an elder, so…
- He'll ride a camel.

398
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,467
Tomorrow,

399
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,070
you can ride the scariest horse.

400
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,172
- That's for him.
- No, I can't.

401
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,406
You got this!

402
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,708
No, I can't!

403
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,014
We have a very busy schedule tomorrow,

404
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,718
so you should go and rest up now.

405
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,188
Gosh, I'm full.

406
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,590
Hey, it looks similar.

407
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,196
That's you, Orkhon.

408
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,164
You just turned a masterpiece

409
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,834
into an elementary school art project.

410
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:13,672
You're talented, Dong-hyun.

411
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:14,906
Really?

412
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,112
ORKHONBAYAR

413
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,518
- That's great.
- Not bad, right?

414
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,653
Not bad at all.

415
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,855
PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

416
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:30,922
NEXT DAY

417
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:34,426
STATE DEPARTMENT STORE

418
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,662
STATE DEPARTMENT STORE

419
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:37,929
I need a souvenir.

420
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,668
This is the first
and oldest department store

421
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,636
in Mongolia.

422
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:48,807
I'd like to see some Mongolian souvenirs.

423
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,709
What's Mongolia famous for?

424
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,210
- Cashmere!
- Cashmere?

425
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,680
I talked to my wife on the phone,

426
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,281
and she said to buy something cashmere

427
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,116
because Mongolian cashmere is famous.

428
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,987
Hey, Orkhon.

429
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,556
This will look good on you.

430
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,295
- It looks great on you.
- It really does.

431
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,597
Elder, try it on.

432
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,400
It's warm.

433
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,570
Wow.

434
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,373
- Hey, I like it.
- It looks good on you.

435
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,274
It's really warm.

436
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,109
I'll get this.

437
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,479
It's 20,000 won.

438
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,181
Let's get three matching ones.

439
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,482
And wear them?

440
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,522
It doesn't fit.

441
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:38,557
I think it's big enough.

442
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,025
But I'll only wear it once.

443
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:44,196
- Come on, we're in Mongolia.
- Why? It looks good.

444
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,731
He's a manly man and won't wear it.

445
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,232
He doesn't like stuff like this.

446
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,907
Let's tease the manly man.

447
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:02,681
Why take it off?

448
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,351
He's blushing.

449
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,453
TRIES IT ON AGAIN

450
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:10,889
- Okay, good.
- No, wait.

451
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,191
He's embarrassed and won't pull it down.

452
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,595
He cares a lot about his style.

453
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,030
- Just buy them for now.
- Get three.

454
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:27,406
Can you ask for a discount
the Mongolian way?

455
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,141
Manly men don't ask for discounts.

456
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:33,178
We're going to transform Orkhon
from a manly man to…

457
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,280
Let's turn him into a softy today.

458
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,783
- He has too much testosterone.
- Yes, he does.

459
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,084
We need to balance him out.

460
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,920
Let's go for a cute look for Orkhon.

461
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,056
THREE HATS PURCHASED

462
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,858
Hey, baby clothes!

463
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,126
They're so cute.

464
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,027
Baby clothes.

465
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:53,832
- It's so cute.
- It's adorable.

466
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,503
How cute. She said I have to buy gloves.

467
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,372
They're adorable.

468
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,807
- This is really cheap.
- It is.

469
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,608
It's not even 20,000 won.
I have to get it.

470
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,777
This hat is so adorable.

471
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,480
- We have to get this for our kids.
- This is too cute.

472
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,085
He's choosing this?

473
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,221
- This is for my son?
- Yes.

474
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,591
GOING WITH THE HAT ORKHON CHOSE

475
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:26,631
In Mongolia, we don't buy anything
before the baby is born.

476
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,002
Then I'm not getting anything.

477
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,737
I think these are good for your wife.

478
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,272
- Really?
- Yes.

479
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:40,846
There will be
Amotti, Orkhon, Elder, and Ochir.

480
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,984
Ochir, Enkh-Orgil, Adiya, and Handa

481
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,487
all became cashmere models.

482
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,554
Seriously?

483
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,556
- Why not you?
- What about you?

484
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,792
- I'm too busy.
- Did you want more money?

485
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,026
I don't get it.

486
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,094
Hurry up and do it.

487
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,629
You have to row when the tide comes in.

488
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,598
When the water comes in,

489
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,299
take advantage of it and row.

490
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:04,903
It's a Korean proverb.

491
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,906
I actually believe in the opposite.

492
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,008
Instead of doing too many ads,

493
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,577
I think my worth goes up
if I don't overdo it.

494
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,448
I see. You're being more careful instead.

495
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,849
You're going for a mysterious vibe.

496
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,885
There's a Korean proverb for that too.

497
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,354
"Hold back too much,
and it turns to crap."

498
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:28,393
Are you serious?

499
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,996
- But I got a lot of stuff.
- You shouldn't.

500
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,631
But I got three things.

501
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,999
Darn, I should've gotten two more.

502
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,470
How much was that coat? Bring it.

503
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,143
This is so cool.

504
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,945
I want to take this to Korea.

505
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,681
It won't break?

506
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,049
Wow!

507
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,885
I've got the hang of it now.

508
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,253
Hey, this is hard to pull.

509
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,155
Right, it's not easy to draw it.

510
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,089
Will you play?

511
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:00,892
Oh, from yesterday?

512
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,899
Is this real?

513
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:08,934
It looks real.

514
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,002
It looks good on you.

515
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,038
- Hey, it's warm.
- It's really warm.

516
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,876
- You look like a real Mongolian warrior.
- Let's go.

517
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:25,784
Come on, Whittaker.

518
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:30,789
A QUICK HAND WRESTLING MATCH

519
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:31,790
It'll be nuts if you win.

520
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:34,392
Hey, come on.

521
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,529
Good match.

522
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,199
Let's go eat.

523
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:49,674
Remember the group of people from earlier?

524
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,209
Everyone recognized us.

525
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,645
They said, "Welcome to Mongolia."

526
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,416
- <i>Physical: Asia</i>?
- <i>Physical: Asia.</i>

527
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:00,719
Do you know my name?

528
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,853
Dong-hyun.

529
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,388
- And his name?
- Amotti.

530
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,190
- His name?
- Orkhonbayar.

531
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,761
POPULAR AMONG THE LOCALS TOO

532
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:10,795
<i>Physical: Asia.</i>

533
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:18,803
We enjoyed watching
<i>Physical: Asia</i> together,

534
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,608
and we wanted to say
that we really supported it.

535
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:26,878
THEY EVEN RECEIVED A GIFT

536
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:29,914
PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

537
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,716
The Mongolian department store was fun.

538
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,485
- Seriously.
- I agree.

539
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,020
I thought I'd have to visit a market

540
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,454
for traditional Mongolian culture,

541
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,756
but it was more fun here.

542
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,791
Thank you, Orkhon.

543
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,027
When you come to Korea,
we'll go to a department store.

544
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,029
I'll buy you gifts. Promise to call me.

545
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,667
ORKHON USES THE TRANSLATING APP

546
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,301
"Let's go to the beautiful countryside."

547
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,737
- I'm down.
- Sounds good.

548
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:53,905
<i>Bayarlalaa.</i>

549
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,140
Thank you.

550
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,409
"Do you like the Mongolian language?"

551
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,315
A QUICK MONGOLIAN LESSON

552
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,583
<i>Yadarch baina.</i>

553
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,786
<i>Yadarch baina?</i> Okay.

554
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,755
- Tired. You're tired.
- Yes, I'm tired.

555
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,058
I practiced Mongolian before coming here.

556
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,926
I asked an AI assistant.

557
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:16,795
Let's see…

558
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,863
<i>Jorlon khaana baina?</i>

559
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,198
"Where is the restroom?"

560
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:23,968
<i>Tuslaach.</i>

561
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,271
- What does that mean?
- "Help."

562
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,940
- Help!
- Right. <i>Tuslaach.</i>

563
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,842
<i>Bi aij baina.</i>

564
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,546
<i>Bi aij baina</i> horse<i>.</i>

565
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,024
You have to help, okay?

566
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,226
<i>Rashaand oreuho…</i>

567
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:52,430
<i>natadeu mor' unakhaas ilüü durtai</i>
blah blah.

568
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,099
What did you say?

569
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,568
"I like hot springs
more than horseback riding."

570
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,872
Let's go to <i>rashaand</i>!

571
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:01,873
You're such an elder.

572
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:08,847
It's about that much.

573
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,981
It's a helicopter.

574
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,986
- Wait, are we taking a helicopter?
- We are?

575
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,700
HELIPAD

576
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,702
Holy cow. Is this for real?

577
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,505
We're getting on that thing?

578
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:35,974
I came fully prepared.

579
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,442
It's getting cold.

580
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:38,777
Gosh, it's cold.

581
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:41,012
We prepared this just for you two.

582
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,783
- Are we really getting on that thing?
- Seriously?

583
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,320
Countryside?
We're taking this to the countryside?

584
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,656
Geez, this is my first time.

585
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,191
Helicopters are fun, Dong-hyun.

586
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,161
How do they even get up in the air?

587
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,462
Holy cow.

588
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,696
You know…

589
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,232
Normally, there are staff
who open the door,

590
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,500
but Orkhon opened it himself.

591
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,935
Are you going to fly this?

592
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,136
Yes.

593
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,305
You? No, no.

594
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,343
This is my first time!

595
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,713
Geez, it's cold.

596
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,748
My very first time.

597
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,219
- We got this!
- We got this!

598
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,187
This is scary!

599
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,488
Testing.

600
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:27,058
The mic works. It sounds like a radio.

601
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,459
Alpha, Bravo.

602
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,395
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie. Let's go.

603
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,764
They're spinning!

604
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,699
They're really spinning.

605
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:35,934
It's my first time.

606
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,236
Welcome to Mongolia!

607
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:41,005
Thank you, Orkhon.

608
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,640
We're getting the full welcome treatment.

609
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,642
I'm so scared.

610
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,981
The control panel is moving.

611
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,149
Hey, we're taking off!

612
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,284
We're taking off.

613
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,485
Holy cow.

614
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:56,621
I need to record this.

615
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,959
- Wow!
- Wow!

616
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,134
This is insane.

617
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,303
I love Mongolia.

618
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:15,974
Hey, look!

619
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,442
I see yak!

620
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,910
I see yak below us!

621
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,547
Are they wild yak?

622
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,149
Wow, they're just living in nature.

623
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,320
I need to record this.

624
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,656
They're just running around.

625
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,694
Hey, stop playing around!

626
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,264
DONE SIGHTSEEING, CHANGING DIRECTION

627
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,932
Oh, geez…

628
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,241
Hey, there's the helipad.

629
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:54,279
Can we change seats?
I want to sit on the inside.

630
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,680
Dong-hyun is scared.

631
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,582
He's an elder.

632
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:58,683
An elder!

633
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:09,861
We're flying over mountains.

634
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,899
This looks amazing.

635
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,537
What do you think?

636
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,446
- Hey!
- What is it?

637
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,849
Hey, the horses don't have owners.

638
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,352
There are so many!

639
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,355
Are those really horses?

640
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,057
Seriously?

641
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:40,591
But they have no owners.

642
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:42,694
How do they survive?

643
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:44,729
Or do they have owners?

644
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,165
There's a house down there.

645
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,167
It's a <i>ger</i>.

646
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,002
A FEW GERS COME INTO VIEW

647
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,071
- They're <i>gers</i>.
- I think you're right.

648
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:56,774
Is this a town?

649
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,211
There are so many animals.

650
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,512
I see a camel!

651
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,016
They have sheep and camels and everything.

652
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,152
We're going down.

653
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:21,265
That's so cool.

654
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,233
It really is.

655
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,935
That's amazing.

656
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,574
Look, wild horses.

657
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,442
They're not very big.

658
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,610
That's why they're fast.

659
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,016
- This is so cool.
- Holy cow.

660
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:43,621
This is seriously cool.

661
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,286
We came back alive.

662
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:34,739
NOMADIC CAMP
