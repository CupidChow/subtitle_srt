00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 16

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,840
There's no such thing as fairness in this world.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Be happy, you brat.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Fatty!

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,760
Let go!

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,560
Help!

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,480
Help! Help!

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,560
Help!

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,160
Help!

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,480
The report of the painting house of Peng Wuji hasn't come out yet.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Who is so anxious to kill Ma Shanbao?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What? Isn't the one who was forced to travel called Xu Xiong?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But Ma Shanbao was right next to Xu Xiong.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Who dares to say that their real target is not Ma Shanbao?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Moreover, Ma Shanbao's identity has always been kept secret.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How would the informant know?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The person below.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's possible that the person above also knows.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Who said that no one knows about the secret?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Anyway, I think the whole thing is very strange.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't get involved in this.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Just do your job.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You have to protect yourself.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now Ma Shanbao is like a knife.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Everyone wants to use it to stab each other.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Not afraid to die.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The painting house of Peng Wuji

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The painting house of Peng Wuji

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The painting house of Peng Wuji

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Officer Tang, welcome.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't you have a lot of cases to deal with?

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Are you still Ma Shanbao's agent lawyer?

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If so, please answer my question.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If not, I won't waste your time.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You say it.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do you know that you are in the media interview?

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't know.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't know.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't know.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't know.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't know.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You say it.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Do you know that you are in the media interview?

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Will expose Ma Shanbao's identity.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I never mentioned the three words Ma Shanbao.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But you said he was from the old city district.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Did Ma Shanbao mention to you?

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He was involved in a traffic accident.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The case of Zhao Shi and Tao Yi.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't need to tell you.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The conversation between me and my client.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You can not say it.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But I can tell you.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That one was hit badly.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Still in the ICU.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The person who was hit was Han Gang.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He is Han Kuilong's eldest son.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Do you know that the police used all means to block the news?

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You exposed all the questions.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I am just stating the facts.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
His name is Xu Xiong.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He is from the old city district.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
When he was hit badly.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He was right next to Ma Shanbao.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The police do not rule out their real target.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It is Ma Shanbao.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Who did it?

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The police arrested Ma Shanbao.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They transferred him to the prison.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If you insist on protecting him.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No one can guarantee his safety.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Think about it.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Ma Shanbao.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why are you not eating?

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Who is the one who broke the hot oil?

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Ask.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Of course, the Han family.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They are always in disagreement with the old city gang.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Everyone knows.

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But this time, it was hit badly.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You are also from the old city district.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Be careful.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Has my lawyer been here?

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No.

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I have to call him.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Hello.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is Zhou Luo Wen's message box.

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hello.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is Zhou Luo Wen's message box.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I can't answer the phone right now.

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Please leave a message.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Protecting the city.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why don't you just call the lawyer to shut up?

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What is the difference between us and the Han Kui Long?

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Hu San.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We can't just stand by and watch like we are fighting.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Now Xu Xiu and Han Gang are in the same hospital.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If we don't think of a way.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The hospital will be on the battlefield at any time.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Come in.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Sir.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Madam.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You'd better come out and have a look.

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Sir. Madam.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What is this?

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Qi Chang Rong sent it.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't know what he means.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's obviously a way to pay respect to the emperor.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Xu Xiu is his man.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He is showing us his power.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The man he wants to pay respect to is Han Kui Long.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Please help me give it to Han Kui Long.

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Since he is fond of hot oil.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'll treat him to fried pork head with oil.

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Will Qi Chang Rong be too arrogant?

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is clearly a provocation.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why don't you throw it away?

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's too bad.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I can't throw it away.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How can I waste my family's good intentions?

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You are going to deliver the goods?

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Since it is a private dish made for Han Kui Long.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Of course I have to deliver it while it's hot.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll go.

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I knew you would come.

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But I didn't expect that you would come in person.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Eat it while it's hot.

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's a gift from my family.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If you want to trouble me.

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Deliver it to that crazy dog.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Aren't you afraid that others will say that we are working together?

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Just with a pig's head.

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No wonder you are going to throw it away

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
with a anonymous call.

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you can't hand it over.

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Next time, you might not only throw hot oil.

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Your eldest son didn't die.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He has regained his life.

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Sit down.

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What's the difference between him and death?

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I know you found the suspect.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I also know that you have a spray gun

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that you found at the scene.

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's not that I force you to say it.

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Even if you don't say it.

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I can still find it.

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Then I can just point out a person from the old city district.

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I can point out that he did it.

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Then I can see him die.

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If you are happy.

153
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I can also solve the case.

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We win.

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But you know I won't do that.

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I am not the black police that you bought with money.

157
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I know that you came here not just to deliver food.

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I will definitely investigate this case.

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But I need time.

160
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay.

161
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You can investigate it slowly.

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
As long as you can't find it.

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You have to clean up every day.

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
This is not right.

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hold on.

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hold on, son.

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I heard that your son Han Lie is back.

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What?

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Dad is in jail.

170
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I am in jail.

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I am in jail.

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I am in jail.

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Brother is in a coma.

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He is in jail.

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Brothers are deeply in love.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's normal.

177
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Father and son are deeply in love.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He is in jail with you.

179
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Do you have evidence?

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
According to your rules.

181
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What evidence do you want?

182
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I said I have.

183
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But I know.

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Han Gang is your successor.

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
In your mind.

186
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's the most important to keep your son.

187
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Come in.

188
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Take a break.

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We will definitely investigate this case.

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But during this period.

191
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,160
Don't play tricks.

192
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,000
Don't let your subordinates

193
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,720
come to you.

194
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,240
Especially your son, Han Lie.

195
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,280
I've applied for a paper from the superior.

196
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,360
You can go out and visit your eldest son.

197
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,880
Just once.

198
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,960
Qingcheng Pavilion

199
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,440
Twice.

200
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,160
Old Han,

201
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,560
is the pig's head tasty?

202
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,640
Qi Chang Ru.

203
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,920
The beef is not hot enough.

204
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,120
The skin is definitely not crispy enough.

205
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,400
Then I'll fry it more crispy next time.

206
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,640
Shut up!

207
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,880
You!

208
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,640
Stop!

209
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,440
Don't move!

210
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,240
Let's go!

211
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,760
The last tourist episode

212
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,000
is on Hot rises and sausages.

213
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,240
There will be more time for 앵 박이 and party.

214
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,080
We won't die.

215
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,080
Let's go.

216
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,760
It's so embarrassing.

217
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,280
Raise your hands.

218
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,160
Turn around.

219
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,560
Turn around!

220
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Don't kill me.

221
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,880
Don't kill me.

222
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,520
Tell me.

223
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,000
Does it have anything to do with you

224
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,240
that Da Xiong is in this state?

225
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,720
You asked me to persuade A'bao to confess.

226
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,360
You said that money

227
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,160
was used to buy him

228
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,560
a few years' prison time.

229
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,320
So, you bought

230
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,440
A'bao's life.

231
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,960
What money?

232
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
When Da Xiong was in trouble,

233
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,440
A'bao was also there.

234
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
I don't know who the next person

235
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,920
who was in trouble would be.

236
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
What's going on with the money

237
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,480
that Uncle Xue received?

238
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,560
I found the best doctor.

239
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,920
Da Xiong will be fine.

240
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,920
He doesn't know

241
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,760
who Da Xiong is in trouble.

242
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,440
Don't worry.

243
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,080
Da Xiong is my brother

244
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,200
and my family.

245
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,400
A'bao is also my brother.

246
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,200
You don't have to

247
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,040
tell me anything.

248
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,480
I'm here to avenge

249
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,200
the death of my wife and child.

250
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,120
Tell me what's going on with the money.

251
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,920
Why did you give it to Xue?

252
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,600
Where did you get the money?

253
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,120
How much did you give him?

254
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,760
Honey, I'm scared.

255
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,760
We're still young.

256
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,400
I'm scared of Xi Changrong.

257
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,520
I know

258
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,720
I won't let anything happen to you.

259
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,160
I'm more scared of you.

260
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,720
What happened that night?

261
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,880
Why was A'bao taken away by the police

262
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,080
and not bailed?

263
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,480
What did you and Officer Jin

264
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,320
hide from me?

265
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,280
Tell me.

266
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,560
Who is it?

267
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,160
Qin Fanghua.

268
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,960
Answer it.

269
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,280
Answer it.

270
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,520
Fine, I'll answer it for you.

271
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,400
I'll be the judge.

272
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,400
Everything can be reckoned with Yan X Beau.

273
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,320
I'll let Uncle Anping buy all the��

274
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,400
be the judge the judge asked.

275
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,840
That's all I'm asking.

276
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,260
I won't say anything.

277
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,500
We can't berandoan g parrry.

278
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,420
Both of us are going to live a life

279
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,540
as the wrong s miserable generations.

280
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,280
Usually

281
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,000
what you ended is what we should be doing

282
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,840
I'm sorry.

283
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,120
Is my brother feeling better?

284
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,240
He's not getting better.

285
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,040
But fortunately, he's not getting worse.

286
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,760
But he's been lying down for a long time.

287
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,880
His muscles are easy to shrink.

288
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,400
If you have time,

289
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,280
you can massage his hands and legs.

290
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,360
It will be better for blood circulation.

291
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,120
I'm not used to my brother being like this.

292
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,480
When he used to go out to fight,

293
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,600
he would be beaten up

294
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,280
and he would never stop.

295
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,040
It's not necessary to be so powerful

296
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,440
when you fight in a boxing fight.

297
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,520
Aren't you afraid of me?

298
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What's there to be afraid of?

299
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,240
Then why don't you dare to look at me?

300
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,520
To Dad

301
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,140
Hello,

302
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,240
a sandwich

303
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,480
also

304
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,520
a glass ofconcentrate milk tea.

305
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,520
Let me treat you to it.

306
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I misunderstood you.

307
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,800
You're not

308
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,000
good at apologizing, are you?

309
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,520
Do you want me to say it?

310
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
I don't drink milk tea.

311
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Then pour it in.

312
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,240
I won't take back

313
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
what I gave you.

314
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
Please have some.

316
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,040
Thanks.

317
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
There's no straw.

318
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,720
Yue Chao, your sandwich.

319
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Where's the milk tea?

320
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
You can leave now.

321
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,400
I just came out of the hospital.

322
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yi Wei,

323
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,600
go to your grandma's house

324
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
for the next two days.

325
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
What's wrong?

326
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,000
I've been busy recently.

327
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,600
Go to her house.

328
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Someone will take care of you.

329
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,600
Her house is close to your school.

330
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
Good morning, Qingmei.

331
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
I'm here to see you.

332
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
I'm here to see you.

333
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
I'm here to see you.

334
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
I'm here to see you.

335
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Good morning, Officer Qing.

336
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
I'm here to see you.

337
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
May I come in?

338
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Please.

339
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Good morning.

340
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,880
A friend from the police station

341
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,800
informed me

342
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
that you reported to the police last night.

343
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,080
I've checked it for you.

344
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,800
Someone must have tried to steal.

345
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,400
We've reinforced the patrol

346
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
of the nearby police.

347
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,000
Thank you for your help.

348
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You have to go out in person.

349
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
I'm a little worried.

350
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,000
They still don't give up

351
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
on the bomb incident last time.

352
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,600
So I'll help you deal with it as soon as possible.

353
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,400
Anyway, you've been out recently.

354
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
Be careful.

355
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Do you have anything else?

356
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,600
I'm in a hurry to send her to school.

357
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,400
If you have anything to ask,

358
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
call me at any time.

359
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
Okay.

360
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Take care.

361
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Okay.

362
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
Bye.

363
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
Coach.

364
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
I'm sorry.

365
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,200
I've got you involved in my business.

366
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,000
It's okay. It's all in the past.

367
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Don't mention it again.

368
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
I drank because I was unhappy.

369
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,600
I miss my mom very much.

370
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm also from a single-parent family.

371
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,000
I know your mother died.

372
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,800
But it's not the reason why you drank.

373
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
No.

374
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's different.

375
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm sorry.

376
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,200
My mother

377
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,200
committed suicide.

378
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,500
The def Eyes are playing on her.

379
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Darn autumn for girls.

380
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,400
Hello.

381
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,200
How can I calm down? How can I explain to him?

382
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,400
We have no way out.

383
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,000
I think giving up is the best way to save him.

384
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
No, no, no. You can't do that.

385
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,400
If you do that, it will really harm him and you.

386
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,800
Last night, a few strangers were standing at my door.

387
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,000
Who were they?

388
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I don't know. I walked out and they left.

389
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,400
But I suspect that they might be from the Han Kui Long.

390
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Even he knows?

391
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,000
I can't be sure. But what I can be sure is

392
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
he won't give up easily.

393
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,600
If you call the police, he will know.

394
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,800
By then, you won't be able to escape.

395
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,000
You have a wife and children.

396
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
What should I do?

397
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
The only thing you can do now is

398
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,000
that A'Bao can't admit his crime.

399
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,600
If A'Bao admits his crime,

400
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,400
Han Kui Long will kill everyone related to this case.

401
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,600
Including me and my son.

402
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,800
You and your wife. And two children.

403
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,400
Remember, we can't say anything now.

404
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,200
A'Bao too.

405
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,600
But I can't contact A'Bao.

406
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,400
Why?

407
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,200
That money last time,

408
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
he and his mother don't trust me anymore.

409
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,600
Even my wife is watching me.

410
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,000
What about Lawyer Zhou?

411
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Lawyer Zhou told me that he resigned.

412
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,640
If A'Baofps

413
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,280
ruktur Yao

414
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,600
Hello, Wen.

415
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,400
You, don't talk with A'Bao anymore.

416
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Are you okay?

417
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Drink some water.

418
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Thank you.

419
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
How is it?

420
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Is it better?

421
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
I'm not drunk.

422
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,400
It's just that I feel a little depressed and uncomfortable.

423
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
I'm sorry.

424
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
I messed up the case you gave me.

425
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
Don't be silly.

426
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,400
The case of the lawsuit is always a win-win situation.

427
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
You don't want to give up, do you?

428
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Sometimes I also want to be as strong as my master.

429
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,400
I'm not as strong as you think.

430
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
When my wife died,

431
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,400
I lost my sense of direction.

432
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
My wife committed suicide.

433
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
The thing I can't let go of is

434
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,400
I can't figure out why she committed suicide.

435
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
I can never figure it out.

436
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
I think

437
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,400
Mrs. Li should have her reasons.

438
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,400
I believe you have tried your best.

439
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
But in this world,

440
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
not everything has an answer.

441
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,400
I've never told anyone about this.

442
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
I just want you to know

443
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,400
that whether you're a judge or a lawyer,

444
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
you can't show our weaknesses in front of people.

445
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Because these weaknesses

446
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
will be used by others.

447
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
What happened?

448
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
I don't know.

449
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
I just want to know.

450
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
What happened?

451
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Tang Xuan asked me.

452
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
He also showed me a photo.

453
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
It's a young man who was badly hurt by the hot oil.

454
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Because I went to the old city,

455
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
because I was interviewed by the media,

456
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
all of this started because of me.

457
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
You only told me that Ma Shanbao stole the car.

458
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
But now,

459
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
it's all about the Black Gang's murder.

460
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
I can't do it.

461
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
I really can't do it.

462
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Tang's police station

463
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,400
caught a suspect during the investigation.

464
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
The only purpose he has now

465
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
is to find evidence

466
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
to sue this suspect.

467
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
But it's obvious that he has not enough evidence.

468
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
How do you know?

469
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
If you have enough evidence,

470
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
you don't need to be scared by the photo.

471
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
They said Ma Shanbao is in danger now.

472
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
It's the safest way to protect him.

473
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
They said that

474
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
they just want to get time to sue the suspect.

475
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
These are their usual methods.

476
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
Why did you go to the old city?

477
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
I went to find evidence that Ma Shanbao was not there.

478
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
What evidence?

479
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
When the car accident happened,

480
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Ma Shanbao was stealing another car.

481
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
This is the evidence that he was not there.

482
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
I'm here.

483
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Hello.

484
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Han Lie.

485
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
And avoid my personal number.

486
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,400
I'm calling you

487
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
so that you can specifically take action.

488
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
They killed my friend.

489
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Who was killed?

490
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
We are investigation them.

491
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
They killed our friend.

492
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,800
He has a three-year-old child in his house.

493
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,000
I told you.

494
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,440
The police are investigating.

495
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,320
Do we need to investigate?

496
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,640
Who else is there besides Qi Changlong?

497
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,680
Besides,

498
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,440
what about my brother's case?

499
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,120
You said you were investigating.

500
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,360
What about the murderer?

501
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,120
Did you catch him?

502
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,880
About the hot oil case,

503
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,720
do you have any exclusive clues

504
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,240
to provide to the police?

505
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,000
What?

506
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,760
He is such a pervert.

507
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,860
You ...

508
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,600
He is really lit.

509
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,480
His father sweetly wished this to me.

510
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,880
You look so tired.

511
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,720
And you are awake already?

512
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,960
I have been feeling anxious.

513
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,600
Mr. Ye.

514
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,840
I've sent someone to the Iron Head's house

515
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,720
to comfort his family.

516
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,480
The family expenses are all settled

517
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,680
as you said.

518
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,680
He has been with me for so many years.

519
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,600
No matter what,

520
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,680
I want him to be more decent.

521
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,440
Qi Changrong is so arrogant.

522
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,600
We must win him over.

523
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,600
We must win him over.

524
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,880
Mr. Long has ordered

525
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,800
that we can't act without permission.

526
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,800
What do you mean?

527
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,280
You want me to hide in the house

528
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,560
and be a coward?

529
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,200
Xiaolian.

530
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,120
Don't be so angry.

531
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,360
Your brother is in the hospital now.

532
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,840
If anything happens outside,

533
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,880
we'll be the one to suffer.

534
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,720
You have to trust your dad.

535
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,600
He's not moving because he's afraid.

536
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,600
He has his own plan.

537
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,840
I don't not trust him.

538
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,640
I don't trust those cops.

539
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,440
We can sell the black police.

540
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,920
Qi Changrong can do the same.

541
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,640
No one can count on him.

542
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,600
I can only count on myself.

543
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,360
Wait. What did you say?

544
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,160
What did you say?

545
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,440
You're stealing another car.

546
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,640
What evidence do you have?

547
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,560
What did Ma Shanbao tell you?

548
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,960
You can't reveal the conversation

549
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,400
with the person.

550
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,160
Didn't you teach me that?

551
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,160
Yes. Yes.

552
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,000
I just think Ma Shanbao

553
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,120
has a pretext and a secret.

554
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,480
I don't know if he believes

555
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,000
what he said.

556
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,640
He has another accomplice.

557
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,160
I went to the old city district

558
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,040
to find him.

559
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,960
What other accomplice?

560
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,240
Who is he? What's his name?

561
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,600
I want to analyze it for you.

562
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,680
I know.

563
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,000
He's also from the old city district.

564
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,600
He's one year younger than Ma Shanbao.

565
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,920
Did you find him?

566
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,240
Don't mention it.

567
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,200
As soon as I went in,

568
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
they chased me away with a broom.

569
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,480
They kept scolding me.

570
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,040
In fact, most of the people

571
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,320
in the old city district

572
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,520
are Qi Changrong's people.

573
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,760
The information they got

574
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,960
is unreliable.

575
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,960
I think you should

576
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,000
focus your energy

577
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,360
on Ma Shanbao.

578
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,240
You know that

579
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,000
he's being imprisoned alone now.

580
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,160
He must feel lonely

581
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,360
and helpless.

582
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,200
If you don't help him,

583
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,120
no one will help him.

584
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,400
How should I tell him?

585
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,280
You'd better tell him not to say anything.

586
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,120
Because no matter what he says,

587
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,320
he'll be misunderstood.

588
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,720
Mr. Qin.

589
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,440
You're Mr. Qin?

590
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,640
Mrs. Cao, is Wei here?

591
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,000
Unless you tell me

592
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,120
what you and Bao

593
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,160
did that night.

594
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,360
Who?

595
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,960
What happened to the money

596
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,600
and the car?

597
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,480
Tell me now!

598
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,200
Give me the phone.

599
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,080
Give it to me.

600
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,920
Give it to me?

601
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,320
Hello?

602
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:46,800
Wei,

603
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,720
you must help me.

604
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,000
Or we'll both die.

605
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,960
In Jiucheng District,

606
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,080
there's a young man called Bei.

607
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,720
He's 17 years old.

608
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,920
He runs a grocery store.

609
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,640
Do you know him?

610
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,800
Do you want water?

611
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,600
Or food?

612
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,720
No, thanks.

613
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,160
If you find him,

614
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,120
ask him to hide for a while.

615
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,880
My wife is more active in Jiucheng District.

616
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,240
I'll ask her.

617
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,360
Okay.

618
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,880
Did you see him?

619
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,240
No.

620
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,320
They said he went to the infirmary.

621
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,680
I know

622
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,440
you cherish

623
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,880
your friendship with Judge Qin.

624
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,480
But no matter it's Qi Changrong

625
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,440
or Han Kuilong,

626
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,200
we can't afford to bother him.

627
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,160
Do you know

628
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,200
a man called Bei?

629
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,480
He's 17 years old.

630
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,240
He runs a grocery store.

631
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,400
Why are you looking for him?

632
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,680
You can't tell me.

633
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,240
Don't you remember

634
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,560
there are two children in our family?

635
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,080
I have this family

636
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,960
just for the sake of two children.

637
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,000
I have no choice.

638
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,680
I'm not going home.

639
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,040
I'm going to the police station.

640
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,600
What?

641
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,000
You...

642
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,720
Wait for me.

643
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:46,800
What's up?

644
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,320
Ma Shanbao said

645
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,720
it's an old white Benz.

646
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,400
I asked them to check

647
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,080
if Ma Shanbao's fingerprints were on the car

648
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,280
and asked

649
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,800
the friend who stole the car with him.

650
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,800
Is it credible?

651
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,400
Actually, I left a copy.

652
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,560
Look.

653
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,480
I think I took the car

654
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,920
Ma Shanbao stole at that time.

655
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,520
As long as I find that car,

656
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,120
it can prove that Ma Shanbao is not there

657
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,720
and it can also prove

658
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,120
the real murderer is someone else.

659
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,360
My car

660
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,600
was missing that morning.

661
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,760
How do you know?

662
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,160
Because that morning,

663
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,960
around ten o'clock,

664
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,840
when I went out,

665
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,040
I found Ma Shanbao

666
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,560
near my house.

667
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:35,920
What?

668
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,760
When I was in the police station,

669
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,120
I told the police.

670
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,320
Why didn't you tell me?

671
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,400
Because my car

672
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,200
and the car accident

673
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,320
happened two hours apart.

674
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,120
No, is it you

675
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,080
who should tell me first?

676
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,040
A lot of things happened during this time.

677
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,080
Maybe it's

678
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,120
a very important clue.

679
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,360
Maybe Ma Shanbao stole my car

680
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,480
and someone hit someone

681
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,200
in my car.

682
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,080
Why didn't you tell me

683
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,720
that you recognized Ma Shanbao?

684
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,520
Because I didn't want to

685
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,160
affect your judgment.

686
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,040
So I didn't tell you

687
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,320
if you wanted to give up this case.

688
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,840
Three hours ago,

689
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,880
I really wanted to give up this case.

690
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,160
You can tell him.

691
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,280
You asked me to insist.

692
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,400
You can tell him.

693
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,400
You said Ma Shanbao admitted

694
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,760
that he agreed to use his car

695
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,880
for the sake of the owner.

696
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,520
This crime

697
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,880
will last for at least two years.

698
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,400
You are asking for a time limit.

699
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,280
He might let it go

700
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,080
in three months.

701
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,600
Do you think Han Kuilong

702
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,560
will be patient

703
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,520
and let Ma Shanbao

704
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,480
get out of prison alive?

705
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,920
You are a lawyer, not a bodyguard.

706
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,480
Yes.

707
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,720
I am a lawyer.

708
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,720
You were a lawyer once.

709
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,920
A lawyer's duty

710
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,480
is to protect

711
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,840
the biggest interests of the parties.

712
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,480
I'm sorry, Master.

713
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,080
I think there are

714
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,360
many things wrong with this case.

715
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,040
I will continue to deal with this case

716
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,920
in my own way.

717
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,800
Officer Tang.

718
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,800
I told you

719
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,760
that the car accident

720
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,800
happened in the past.

721
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,600
I was the one

722
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,560
who stole this car.

723
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,520
The young man with Ma Shanbao

724
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,320
is Xiaobei.

725
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,120
He is 17 years old.

726
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,640
He is also from the old city district.

727
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,000
He runs a grocery store.

728
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,600
If it can prove

729
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,560
that the one who hurt Han Gang

730
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,520
is not Ma Shanbao,

731
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,320
Han Kuilong

732
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:28,960
will have no reason

733
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,240
to fight against the old city district.

734
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,040
The car accident happened in the past.

735
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,320
The car accident happened in the past.

736
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,600
The car accident happened in the past.

737
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,040
The car accident happened in the past.

738
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,560
The car accident happened in the past.

739
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,080
The car accident happened in the past.

740
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,600
The car accident happened in the past.

741
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,040
The car accident happened in the past.

742
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,560
The car accident happened in the past.

743
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,160
The car accident happened in the past.

744
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,760
The car accident happened in the past.

745
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,680
The car accident happened in the past.

746
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,440
The car accident happened in the past.

747
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,200
The car accident happened in the past.

748
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,200
The car accident happened in the past.

749
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,040
The car accident happened in the past.

750
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,960
The car accident happened in the past.

751
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,880
The car accident happened in the past.

752

00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,960
The car accident happened in the last 20 years.

756
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,600

757
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,140

Inner heart that has a heart with an ingratitude

00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,380
Your eyes arevable

794
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,440

796
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,080
Some attack...
