00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 16

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,840
There's no such thing as fairness in this world.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Be happy, you brat.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Fatty!

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,760
Let go!

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,560
Help!

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,480
Help! Help!

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,560
Help!

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,160
Help!

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,480
The report of the painting house of Peng Wuji hasn't come out yet.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Who is so anxious to kill Ma Shanbao?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What? Isn't the one who was forced to travel called Xu Xiong?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But Ma Shanbao was right next to Xu Xiong.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Who dares to say that their real target is not Ma Shanbao?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Moreover, Ma Shanbao's identity has always been kept secret.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How would the informant know?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The person below.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's possible that the person above also knows.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Who said that no one knows about the secret?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Anyway, I think the whole thing is very strange.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't get involved in this.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Just do your job.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You have to protect yourself.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now Ma Shanbao is like a knife.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Everyone wants to use it to stab each other.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Not afraid to die.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The painting house of Peng Wuji

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The painting house of Peng Wuji

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The painting house of Peng Wuji

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Officer Tang, welcome.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't you have a lot of cases to deal with?

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Are you still Ma Shanbao's agent lawyer?

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If so, please answer my question.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If not, I won't waste your time.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You say it.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do you know that you are in the media interview?

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't know.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't know.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't know.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't know.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't know.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You say it.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Do you know that you are in the media interview?

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Will expose Ma Shanbao's identity.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I never mentioned the three words Ma Shanbao.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But you said he was from the old city district.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Did Ma Shanbao mention to you?

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He was involved in a traffic accident.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The case of Zhao Shi and Tao Yi.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't need to tell you.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The conversation between me and my client.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You can not say it.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But I can tell you.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That one was hit badly.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Still in the ICU.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The person who was hit was Han Gang.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He is Han Kuilong's eldest son.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Do you know that the police used all means to block the news?

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You exposed all the questions.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I am just stating the facts.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
His name is Xu Xiong.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He is from the old city district.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
When he was hit badly.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He was right next to Ma Shanbao.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The police do not rule out their real target.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It is Ma Shanbao.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Who did it?

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The police arrested Ma Shanbao.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They transferred him to the prison.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If you insist on protecting him.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No one can guarantee his safety.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Think about it.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Ma Shanbao.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why are you not eating?

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Who is the one who broke the hot oil?

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Ask.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Of course, the Han family.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They are always in disagreement with the old city gang.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Everyone knows.

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But this time, it was hit badly.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You are also from the old city district.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Be careful.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Has my lawyer been here?

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No.

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I have to call him.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Hello.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is Zhou Luo Wen's message box.

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hello.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is Zhou Luo Wen's message box.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I can't answer the phone right now.

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Please leave a message.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Protecting the city.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why don't you just call the lawyer to shut up?

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What is the difference between us and the Han Kui Long?

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Hu San.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We can't just stand by and watch like we are fighting.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Now Xu Xiu and Han Gang are in the same hospital.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If we don't think of a way.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The hospital will be on the battlefield at any time.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Come in.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Sir.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Madam.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You'd better come out and have a look.

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Sir. Madam.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What is this?

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Qi Chang Rong sent it.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't know what he means.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's obviously a way to pay respect to the emperor.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Xu Xiu is his man.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He is showing us his power.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The man he wants to pay respect to is Han Kui Long.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Please help me give it to Han Kui Long.

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Since he is fond of hot oil.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'll treat him to fried pork head with oil.

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Will Qi Chang Rong be too arrogant?

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is clearly a provocation.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why don't you throw it away?

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's too bad.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I can't throw it away.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How can I waste my family's good intentions?

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You are going to deliver the goods?

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Since it is a private dish made for Han Kui Long.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Of course I have to deliver it while it's hot.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll go.

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I knew you would come.

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But I didn't expect that you would come in person.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Eat it while it's hot.

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's a gift from my family.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If you want to trouble me.

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Deliver it to that crazy dog.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Aren't you afraid that others will say that we are working together?

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Just with a pig's head.

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No wonder you are going to throw it away

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
with a anonymous call.

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you can't hand it over.

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Next time, you might not only throw hot oil.

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Your eldest son didn't die.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He has regained his life.

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Sit down.

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What's the difference between him and death?

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I know you found the suspect.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I also know that you have a spray gun

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that you found at the scene.

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's not that I force you to say it.

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Even if you don't say it.

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I can still find it.

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Then I can just point out a person from the old city district.

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I can point out that he did it.

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Then I can see him die.

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If you are happy.

153
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I can also solve the case.

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We win.

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But you know I won't do that.

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I am not the black police that you bought with money.

157
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I know that you came here not just to deliver food.

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I will definitely investigate this case.

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But I need time.

160
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay.

161
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You can investigate it slowly.

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
As long as you can't find it.

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You have to clean up every day.

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
This is not right.

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hold on.

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hold on, son.

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I heard that your son Han Lie is back.

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What?

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Dad is in jail.

170
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I am in jail.

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I am in jail.

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I am in jail.

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Brother is in a coma.

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He is in jail.

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Brothers are deeply in love.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's normal.

177
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Father and son are deeply in love.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He is in jail with you.

179
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Do you have evidence?

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
According to your rules.

181
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What evidence do you want?

182
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I said I have.

183
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But I know.

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Han Gang is your successor.

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
In your mind.

186
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's the most important to keep your son.

187
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Go.

188
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Spare me.

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We will definitely investigate this case.

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,160
But during this period,

191
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,360
don't play tricks.

192
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,960
Don't let your subordinates come here.

193
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,640
Especially your little boy, Han Lie.

194
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,720
I've applied for a paper from the superior.

195
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,800
You can go out and visit your eldest son.

196
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,400
Just once.

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:13:09,120
Peambot

198
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,080
Old Han,

199
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,600
is the pig's head tasty?

200
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,600
Qi Changru.

201
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,880
The cow isn't hot enough.

202
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,120
The skin isn't crispy enough.

203
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,440
I'll fry it more crispy next time.

204
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,600
Shut up!

205
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,880
You!

206
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,600
Stop!

207
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,440
Don't move!

208
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,240
Let's go!

209
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,600
Name your meat.

210
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,360
Fried orange.

211
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,240
You workday.

212
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,040
Name your meat.

213
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,160
Hands up.

214
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,160
Turn around.

215
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,520
Turn.

216
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,840
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,840
Save me.

218
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,480
Tell me.

219
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,000
Does it have anything to do with you

220
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,160
that Da Xiong is in this state?

221
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,720
You asked me to persuade A'bao to confess.

222
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,320
You said that money

223
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,560
was used to buy him a few years' prison.

224
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,320
So, you bought

225
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,400
A'bao's life.

226
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,440
What money?

227
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
When Da Xiong was in trouble,

228
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,920
A'bao was also there.

229
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,280
I don't know who the next person

230
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,440
who was in trouble would be.

231
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,080
What's wrong with the money

232
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,880
that Uncle Xue said?

233
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,800
I've found the best way to get the money.

234
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,840
I'll give it to you.

235
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,800
I'll give it to you.

236
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
I'll give it to you.

237
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
I'll give it to you.

238
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
I'll give it to you.

239
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,840
The best doctor

240
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,240
will be fine.

241
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,560
Who did he

242
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,400
wrong us?

243
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,840
Don't worry.

244
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,720
Da Xiong is my brother

245
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,640
and my family.

246
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,800
A'bao is also my brother.

247
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,720
You can tell me

248
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
whatever you want.

249
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,200
I'm here to avenge

250
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,920
the death of Uncle Xue.

251
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,800
Tell me what happened to the money.

252
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,640
Why did you give it to Xue?

253
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,280
Where did you get the money?

254
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,800
How much did you give him?

255
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,640
Honey, I'm scared.

256
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,640
We're still young.

257
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,280
I'm scared of Xi Changrong.

258
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,360
I know

259
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,640
I won't let anything happen to you.

260
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,040
I'm more scared of you.

261
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,600
What happened that night?

262
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,200
Why was A'bao

263
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,920
detained by the police

264
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,960
and not bailed?

265
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,440
What did you and Jin Waguan

266
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,200
hide from me?

267
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,240
Tell me!

268
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,560
Who is it?

269
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,040
Jin Waguan.

270
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,760
Answer it.

271
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,240
Answer it!

272
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,400
Fine, I'll answer it for you.

273
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,720
Jin Waguan.

274
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,640
Judge Qin, we're ready to go to court.

275
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,920
Is my brother feeling better?

276
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,040
No obvious improvement.

277
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,840
But fortunately, he's not getting worse.

278
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,520
But he's been lying down for a long time.

279
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,560
His muscles are easy to shrink.

280
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,080
If you have time,

281
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,040
you can massage his hands and legs.

282
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,160
It will be better if the blood circulates.

283
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,680
I'm not used to

284
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,840
my brother being like this.

285
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,200
He used to go out to fight.

286
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,480
He never stopped

287
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,200
until he beat everyone to death.

288
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,360
He will never stop.

289
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,240
It's not necessary to be so powerful

290
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,560
when you're fighting with a fist.

291
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,600
Aren't you afraid of me?

292
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,080
What's there to be afraid of?

293
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,280
Then why don't you dare to look at me?

294
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,320
Hello.

295
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,520
One sandwich,

296
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,680
and

297
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,600
another cup of milk tea,

298
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,240
please.

299
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,080
I think Jin Waguan

300
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,400
really needs your massive offer.

301
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
Just take it.

302
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,400
Alright.

303
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,600
I misunderstood you before.

304
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,520
You're not good at apologizing, are you?

305
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,040
Do you want me to say it?

306
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,200
I don't drink milk tea.

307
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,720
Then pour it in.

308
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,880
I won't take back

309
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,160
what I gave you.

310
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,040
I saw someone

311
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,920
at your skin before.

312
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,680
Maybeivas mom.

313
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,820
Let's go.

314
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,660
Over there...

315
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,800
Probablyas mom.

316
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,020
Okay.

317
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,600
I'll wait here.

318
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,000
I just came out of the hospital.

319
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,200
Yivui,

320
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,960
go to your grandma's house for the next two days.

321
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,720
What's wrong?

322
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,600
I'm busy recently.

323
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,000
Go to her house.

324
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Someone will take care of you.

325
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,200
Her house is close to your school.

326
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,360
Morning, Officer Qin.

327
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,160
Long-distance investigation.

328
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
May I come in?

329
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,400
Please.

330
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,160
Morning.

331
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,560
A friend from the investigation center informed me

332
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,480
that you reported to the police last night.

333
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,840
I checked it for you.

334
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,560
Someone wanted to make an apology.

335
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,120
We've reinforced the patrol of the nearby police.

336
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,840
Thank you for asking you to go out in person.

337
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,560
I'm a little worried.

338
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,240
They still don't give up on the incident

339
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,360
of the bomb.

340
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,880
So I'll deal with it for you as soon as possible.

341
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,520
Anyway, you've been out recently.

342
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,480
Be careful.

343
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,520
Do you have anything else?

344
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,040
I'm in a hurry to send her to school.

345
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,560
If you have anything else to ask,

346
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,800
call me at any time.

347
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,320
Okay.

348
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,880
Be careful.

349
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,120
Bye.

350
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,080
Bye.

351
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,440
Coach.

352
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,320
I'm sorry.

353
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,320
I got you involved in my matter.

354
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,240
It's okay. It's over.

355
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,160
Don't mention it again.

356
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,720
Thank you for your hard work

357
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,780
I feelIT's because I feel sad

358
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,820
I miss my mom

359
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,380
I am originally from a family of Yunnan

360
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,780
I know your mother died.

361
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,620
But this is not the reason for you to drink.

362
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,580
No.

363
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,620
It's different.

364
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,260
г

365
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,100
My mother

366
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,460
owner of suicide.

367
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,380
Go.

368
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,380
Hello.

369
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,380
Baobao was replaced by them to be in the prison.

370
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,380
I don't know if I want to protect him or to deal with him.

371
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,380
Calm down.

372
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,380
How can I calm down?

373
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,380
How can I explain to him?

374
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,380
We have no way out.

375
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,380
I think giving up is the best way to get back.

376
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,380
No, no, no.

377
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,380
You can't do that.

378
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,380
If you do that, you will really hurt him and you.

379
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,380
Last night, some strangers stood at my door.

380
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,380
Who are they?

381
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,380
I don't know.

382
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,380
They left as soon as I left.

383
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,380
But I suspect that they might be from the Han Kui Long.

384
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,380
Even he knows?

385
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,380
I can't be sure.

386
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,380
But what I can be sure is that he won't give up easily.

387
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,380
If you call the police, he will know.

388
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,380
By then, you can't escape.

389
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,380
You have a wife and children.

390
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,380
What should I do?

391
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,380
The only thing you can do now is that Baobao can't admit his guilt.

392
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,380
If Baobao admits his guilt,

393
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,380
Han Kui Long will kill all people related to this case.

394
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,380
Including me and my son.

395
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,380
You and your wife.

396
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,380
And two children.

397
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,380
Remember, we can't say anything now.

398
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,380
Baobao too.

399
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,380
But I can't contact Baobao.

400
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,380
Why?

401
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,380
The money last time,

402
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,380
he and his mother don't believe me anymore.

403
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,380
Even my wife is watching me.

404
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,380
What about lawyer Zhou?

405
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,380
Lawyer Zhou told me that he resigned.

406
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,380
I don't know.

407
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,380
Hello, Luo Wen.

408
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,380
Are you okay?

409
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,380
Drink some water.

410
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,380
Thank you.

411
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,380
How is it?

412
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,380
Do you feel better?

413
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,380
I'm not drunk.

414
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,380
I just feel depressed and uncomfortable.

415
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,380
I'm sorry.

416
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,380
I messed up the case you gave me.

417
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,380
Don't be silly.

418
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,380
In the case of court, there is a win and a loss.

419
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,380
You don't want to give up, do you?

420
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,380
Sometimes I also want to be as strong as my master.

421
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,380
Actually I'm not as strong as you think.

422
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,380
After my wife died,

423
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,380
I lost my sense of direction.

424
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,380
My wife committed suicide.

425
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,380
What I can't let go of is,

426
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,380
I can't think of anything.

427
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,380
Why did she commit suicide?

428
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,380
I can never figure it out.

429
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,380
I think,

430
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,380
my wife should have her reasons.

431
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,380
I believe you have tried your best.

432
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,380
But in this world,

433
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,380
not everything has an answer.

434
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,380
I never told anyone about this.

435
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,380
I just want you to know,

436
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,380
no matter you are a judge or a lawyer,

437
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,380
you can't show your weaknesses in front of people.

438
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,380
Because these weaknesses will be used by others.

439
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,380
What happened?

440
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,380
Tang Xuan asked me.

441
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,380
He also showed me a picture.

442
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,380
It's a young man who was seriously burned by the hot oil.

443
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,380
Because I went to the old city,

444
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,380
because I was interviewed by the media,

445
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,380
all of these started because of me.

446
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,380
You only told me that Ma Shanbao stole the car.

447
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,380
But now,

448
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,380
it's already involved in the black gang's murder.

449
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,380
I can't do it.

450
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,380
I really can't do it.

451
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,380
During the investigation of this case,

452
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,380
Tang Ducha caught a suspect.

453
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,380
His only purpose now is to find the suspect as much as possible.

454
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,380
And it's obvious that he doesn't have enough evidence.

455
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,380
How do you know?

456
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,380
If the evidence is sufficient,

457
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,380
you don't need to be scared by the picture.

458
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,380
They said Ma Shanbao is in danger now.

459
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,380
It's the safest way to protect him.

460
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,380
They said that

461
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,380
they just want to take the time to interrogate that prisoner.

462
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,380
These are their usual methods.

463
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,380
I don't know.

464
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,380
These are the usual methods.

465
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,380
Why did you go to the old city?

466
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,380
I went to find the evidence that Ma Shanbao was not there.

467
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,380
What evidence?

468
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,380
When the car accident happened,

469
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,380
Ma Shanbao was stealing another car.

470
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,380
This is the evidence that he was not there.

471
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,380
Hello.

472
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,380
Han Lie.

473
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,380
This is my private phone.

474
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,380
I just called you.

475
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,380
It's faster than calling the police.

476
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,380
They killed my people.

477
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,380
Who did it?

478
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,380
We are investigating.

479
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,380
Our people were burned to death.

480
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,380
They were in the garbage team like garbage.

481
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,380
There are still three-year-old children in his family.

482
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,380
I said that the police are investigating.

483
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,380
Do you still want to investigate?

484
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,380
Who else is there besides Qi Changlong?

485
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,380
And

486
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,380
my brother's case.

487
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,380
You said you were investigating.

488
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,380
Where is the murderer?

489
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,380
Did you catch him?

490
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,380
Do you have any exclusive clues

491
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,380
for the police

492
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,380
about the Puerou case?

493
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,380
Mr. Lie.

494
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,380
Mr. Lie.

495
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,380
Mr. Lie.

496
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,380
Mr. Lie.

497
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,380
Mr. Lie.

498
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,380
Mr. Lie.

499
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,380
We have sent someone to the Iron Head's house

500
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,380
to comfort his family.

501
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,380
We have paid the family expenses

502
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,380
according to your request.

503
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,380
No matter what,

504
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,380
let him leave with dignity.

505
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,380
Qi Changlong is so arrogant.

506
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,380
We must take it back.

507
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,380
Mr. Long has ordered

508
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,380
that we can't act without permission.

509
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,380
What does it mean?

510
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,380
We should ask a bodyguard to hide in the house

511
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,380
and be a coward.

512
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,380
Mr. Li.

513
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,380
Mr. Li.

514
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,380
Don't be so angry.

515
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,380
Your brother is in the hospital now.

516
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,380
If anything happens outside,

517
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,380
we will be the ones to suffer.

518
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,380
You have to trust your father.

519
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,380
He is still in the dark.

520
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,380
It's not because he is timid.

521
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,380
He has his own plan.

522
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,380
I don't believe him.

523
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,380
I don't believe those police.

524
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,380
We can sell the black police.

525
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,380
Qi Changlong can do the same.

526
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,380
No one can rely on him.

527
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,380
I can only rely on myself.

528
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,380
Wait. What did you say?

529
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,380
You are stealing another car.

530
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,380
Why don't you have any evidence?

531
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,380
What did Ma Shanbao say to you?

532
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,380
You can't reveal

533
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,380
your conversation with the person.

534
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,380
Didn't you teach me this?

535
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,380
Yes. Yes.

536
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,380
I just think that Ma Shanbao

537
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,380
has money and a secret enemy.

538
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,380
I don't know if he will believe what he said.

539
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,380
He has another accomplice.

540
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,380
I went to the old city district

541
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,380
just to find him.

542
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,380
What other accomplice?

543
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,380
Who is he? What's his name?

544
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,380
I want to analyze it for you.

545
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,380
I know.

546
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,380
He is also from the old city district.

547
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,380
He is one year younger than Ma Shanbao.

548
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,380
Did you find him?

549
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,380
Don't mention it.

550
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,380
As soon as I went in,

551
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,380
they used a broom

552
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,380
to drive me away

553
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,380
and kept scolding me.

554
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,380
In fact, in the old city district,

555
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,380
most of them are people from Qi Changrong.

556
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,380
The information they got in there

557
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,380
is unreliable.

558
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,380
I think you should

559
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,380
focus your energy

560
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,380
on Ma Shanbao.

561
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,380
You also know

562
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,380
that he is now imprisoned alone.

563
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,380
He must feel very lonely

564
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,380
and helpless.

565
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,380
If you don't even care about him,

566
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,380
no one will help him.

567
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,380
What should I tell him?

568
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,380
You'd better tell him

569
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,380
not to say anything.

570
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,380
Because no matter what he says,

571
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,380
others will misunderstand.

572
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,380
No matter what he says,

573
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,380
others will misunderstand.

574
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,380
I think he has to

575
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,380
think about it.

576
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,380
I think he has to think about it.

577
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,380
I think he has to think about it.

578
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,380
Are you the criminal?

579
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,380
Madam Cao.

580
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,380
Is Wei here?

581
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,380
Unless you tell me

582
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,380
Who is it?

583
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,380
What's going on with the money and the car?

584
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,380
Tell me!

585
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,380
Give me the phone.

586
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,380
Give it to me.

587
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,380
Give it to me?

588
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,380
Hello?

589
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,380
Wei, you must help me.

590
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,380
Or we'll both die.

591
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,380
There's a young man called Xiao Bei

592
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,380
who's 17 years old.

593
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,380
He runs a grocery store.

594
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,380
Do you know him?

595
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,380
Do you want water?

596
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,380
Do you want to eat something?

597
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,380
No, thanks.

598
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,380
If you find him,

599
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,380
ask him to hide for a while.

600
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,380
My wife will be there in the old city.

601
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,380
I'll ask her.

602
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,380
Did you see him?

603
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,380
I didn't see him.

604
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,380
They said Ma Shan Bao went to the infirmary.

605
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,380
I'm not sure.

606
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,380
I'm not sure.

607
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,380
I'm not sure.

608
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,380
I'm not sure.

609
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,380
I'm not sure.

610
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,380
I'm not sure.

611
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,380
I'm not sure.

612
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,380
Do you?

613
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,380
I'm not sure.

614
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,380
I have to meet some officers

615
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,380
and!

616
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,380
We must go need them!

617
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,380
I'm not here to see hacking.

618
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,380
Later!

619
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,380
ifully,

620
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,380
but I didn't even have time to drink anything

621
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,380
and I'm already my fulleon!

622
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,380
Just don't drink again

623
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,380
I'll say itbleeply!

624
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,380
You don't have to drink again.

625
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,500
A man named Xiaobei.

626
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,700
17 years old.

627
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,540
He runs a grocery store.

628
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,660
Why are you looking for him?

629
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:13,940
I can't tell you.

630
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,380
Don't you remember

631
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,900
there are two children in our family?

632
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,300
I have this family

633
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,220
just for two children.

634
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,260
I have no choice.

635
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,420
I'm not going home.

636
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,740
I'm going to the police station.

637
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,300
What?

638
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:35,820
You...

639
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,500
You wait for me.

640
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,380
What's up?

641
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,900
Ma Shanbao said

642
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,380
it's an old white Benz.

643
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,820
I asked them to check

644
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,740
if there were Ma Shanbao's fingerprints on the car.

645
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,020
And I asked the friend

646
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,380
who stole the car with him.

647
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,460
Is it credible?

648
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,980
Actually, I left a hand.

649
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
I'm not going home.

650
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
I'm going to the police station.

651
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,500
I'm going to the police station.

652
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,260
I...

653
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,460
Look.

654
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,700
The car I'm holding

655
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,860
is the car Ma Shanbao stole.

656
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,300
As long as I find the car,

657
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,100
it can prove

658
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,060
that Ma Shanbao is not there.

659
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,700
At the same time, it can also prove

660
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,860
that the real killer is someone else.

661
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:23,980
My car

662
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,380
was gone that morning.

663
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,660
How did you know?

664
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,940
Because that morning,

665
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,140
When I left,

666
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,380
I found Ma Shanmao

667
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,860
near my house.

668
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,180
What?

669
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,980
When I was in the police station,

670
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,340
I told the police.

671
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,540
Why didn't you tell me?

672
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,380
Because my car and the accident

673
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,580
happened two hours apart.

674
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,380
But shouldn't you

675
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,300
tell me first?

676
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,180
A lot of things happened.

677
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,420
Maybe Ma Shanmao stole my car.

678
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,740
Maybe someone hit someone

679
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,340
with my car.

680
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,260
Why didn't you tell me

681
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,980
you recognized Ma Shanmao?

682
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,220
Because I didn't want to affect your judgment.

683
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,180
So I didn't tell you

684
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,500
if you wanted to give up the case.

685
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,060
Three hours ago,

686
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,860
I really wanted to give up the case.

687
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,020
You can tell him...

688
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,260
You told me to stick to it.

689
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,580
You can tell him.

690
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,540
You said Ma Shanmao would admit

691
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,820
that he didn't agree to use his car.

692
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,660
This crime

693
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,020
would last for two years.

694
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,580
If you ask him to be released,

695
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,060
he might be released in three months.

696
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,660
Do you think Han Kuilong

697
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,820
will be patient

698
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,620
and let Ma Shanmao

699
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,500
get out of prison alive?

700
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,860
You're a lawyer, not a bodyguard.

701
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,540
Yes.

702
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,740
I am a lawyer.

703
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,700
You were a lawyer once.

704
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,940
The duty of a lawyer

705
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,860
is to protect the biggest interests of the parties.

706
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,940
I'm sorry.

707
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,420
I'm sorry, Master.

708
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:42,980
I think there are many

709
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,300
wrong things in this case.

710
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,140
I will continue to deal with this case

711
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,140
in my own way.

712
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,860
Tang Ducha.

713
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,740
Tang Ducha.

714
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,060
When I told you

715
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,220
that the car accident happened,

716
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,980
I was the one who stole this car.

717
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,380
A young man named Xiaobei,

718
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,380
17 years old,

719
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,980
is also from the old city district.

720
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,580
He runs a grocery store in his home.

721
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,780
If it can be proved

722
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,780
that the one who hit Han Gang

723
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,780
wasn't Ma Shanmao,

724
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,780
then there's no reason

725
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,580
for Han Kuilong to fight the old city district.

726
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,940
Han Kuilong has no reason

727
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,220
to fight the old city district.

728
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,540
restricted business

729
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,480
Xihu.

730
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,300
The old city district is the closest to me.

731
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,180
I'll go there myself.

732
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,260
Just wait for me here.

733
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,860
It's between us.

734
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,140
I'll go with you.

735
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,820
I can handle it myself.

736
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,860
You're the president of the court.

737
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,740
Don't take the risk.

738
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,220
I'm the one who got you into trouble.

739
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,300
Let's go together.

740
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,660
The car should be in front.

741
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:01,940
This one.

742
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:02,460
This one.

743
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,180
It's this one.

744
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,140
Wei.

745
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,100
Wei.

746
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,140
There's a police car.

747
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,140
Run.

748
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:21,740
Hurry.

749
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,340
Hurry.

750
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:22,980
Hurry.

751
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:23,780
Hurry.

752
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,380
Hurry.

753
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,140
Hurry.

754
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:25,820
Hurry.

755
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,580
Hurry.

756
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,500
Run.

757
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,020
Where?

758
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:32,820
Behind.

759
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,420
Come on.

760
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:43,740
Hurry.

761
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:44,820
Let's go.

762
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:30,580
shining

763
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:32,860
suffering has suppressed my love

764
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:52,380
Why it's not as strong as before
