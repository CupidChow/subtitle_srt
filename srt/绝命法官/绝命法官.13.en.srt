1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
If order comes

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,960
We are being almost elected

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:11,840
Fuhun

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,360
React

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,360
Rands up.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,360
Let's split it.

7
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,360
Fine.

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,360
Continue.

9
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,360
Wait.

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,360
Tang Jingfang,

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,460
where's you father?

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,640
You're hurting me.

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,920
Help! Help!

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,780
Help!

15
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,000
Lock Skills

16
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,320
Episode 06

17
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,600
Dad.

18
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,280
You look good.

19
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,440
How are things inside?

20
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,040
They know I'm your son.

21
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,480
They don't care about me.

22
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,440
That's good.

23
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,960
Less contact. Less friction.

24
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,400
Remember.

25
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,560
If anything happens,

26
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,960
remember to find Yujin.

27
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,160
You're an adult.

28
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,240
You have to protect yourself.

29
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes.

30
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,600
Dad.

31
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,080
If you have to be punished for your mistakes,

32
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,320
why can some people

33
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,560
be free from the law?

34
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,360
It won't happen.

35
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
You have to pay for your mistakes.

36
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,880
I can't be an exception.

37
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,360
Coffee is ready.

38
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,880
Who wants to go back to the palace?

39
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,920
Uncle Fei.

40
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,600
Once you get the judge,

41
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,560
the judge will come.

42
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,360
It's almost 1 o'clock.

43
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,520
The coffee is ready.

44
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,440
I'll pour it for you.

45
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,600
Judge Qin.

46
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,240
Your coffee.

47
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,640
Okay.

48
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,240
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,800
I'm the one who should be sorry.

50
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,040
Take off the ring.

51
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,760
I'll clean it for you.

52
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,360
Okay.

53
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,440
Come on.

54
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,280
It's all wet.

55
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm a man of my word.

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,840
Don't say that.

59
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,240
Thank you.

60
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,800
Okay.

61
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,440
Thank you.

62
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:05,960
See you tomorrow.

63
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,280
Yanyan.

64
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,680
You're leaving so soon.

65
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,560
Yes.

66
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,480
I'm leaving.

67
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,280
What's wrong with your face?

68
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,840
Nothing.

69
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,440
Just now...

70
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,160
Right?

71
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,800
He raped a nurse.

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,200
Did you wipe your ass clean?

73
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,720
I paid for it.

74
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,640
I shouldn't have talked nonsense.

75
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,320
Is there any mistake with the blood?

76
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,360
Sometimes.

77
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,080
But it's not as serious as before.

78
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,200
I can't hear the real pain.

79
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,400
Anyway, after I see the bride tomorrow,

80
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,480
I won't need to take medicine.

81
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,240
I can beat the tiger to death.

82
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
It's arranged.

83
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,360
It's in the small church nearby.

84
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,000
Xiaolei.

85
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,400
Slow down.

86
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,440
It's not completely healed yet.

87
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,760
It's too slow.

88
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,000
Where does it hurt?

89
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,120
You guess.

90
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,280
Here.

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,920
It hurts.

92
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,360
Thank you.

93
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,600
Brother.

94
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,600
Do you really believe in the blood donation?

95
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,720
I'm just waiting in line.

96
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,160
It's not our turn to go to heaven.

97
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,880
Do you remember

98
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,440
I almost died last time?

99
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,400
A godfather gave me a bracelet and I was fine.

100
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,520
It's the same this time.

101
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,920
Brother will recover soon.

102
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,440
Xiaolei.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,880
Dad is in prison.

104
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,600
If brother dies,

105
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,200
spit out your saliva and say it again.

106
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,280
Okay.

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,320
Then you'll be in charge of the Han family business.

108
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,600
Although

109
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,120
my brother and dad all know that you grew up

110
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,720
and don't want to manage the Han family business, right?

111
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,760
We're all Han.

112
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,680
We have nothing to think about.

113
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Anyway, as long as my brother is still here,

114
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,080
he will support you.

115
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,920
Do whatever you want.

116
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,600
Okay?

117
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,280
What are you going to do now?

118
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,000
What to do?

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,600
You took off my chain.

120
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,680
Okay, take it.

121
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,400
Why did you give me the bracelet?

122
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,680
I just said it.

123
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,000
Brother and dad will support you and protect you.

124
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:02,080
Kong Futing

125
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,280
So un gateshifted to me?

126
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,680
You hate to work as a night shift

127
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,920
to avoid me?

128
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,640
dob tÃªm demonstrated

129
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,080
I just know there will be no sadness for me.

130
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,380
I must think or not think.

131
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,680
I will.

132
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,280
I will think of way.

133
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,280
I have no other way.

134
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,280
I understand.

135
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,680
Have you done it?

136
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,240
Almost done.

137
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,920
Wow, you're so pretty.

138
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,840
You're so handsome.

139
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,480
You're really a man.

140
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,680
Master, it's ready.

141
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,560
You can go in.

142
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,040
Got it.

143
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,680
Get out of the way.

144
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,480
What's the matter?

145
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,640
Let's go.

146
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,120
You're afraid that the god father will eat me.

147
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,000
Let's go. It's okay.

148
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,640
Come on.

149
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,920
Close the door.

150
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
Push the wheelchair away.

151
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,560
Let's go.

152
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
Hello, god father.

153
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,480
Hello.

154
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,840
My name is Han Gang.

155
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,520
The thing is

156
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,200
I've been a little unlucky recently.

157
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,440
I hit a car and hurt my leg.

158
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,520
So I want you to help me

159
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,000
to bleed.

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,240
Take your time.

161
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,080
Don't worry.

162
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,280
It will be quick.

163
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,240
I'll chat with your boss.

164
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,520
Qi Yu.

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,400
Kneel.

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,520
Okay.

167
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,360
It's easy to say.

168
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,840
Close your eyes.

169
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,240
The Godfather

170
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,240
Episode 16

171
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,280
Jenny.

172
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,000
What's the matter, judge Qin?

173
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,440
I accidentally

174
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,680
made the B04's confession dirty.

175
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,840
Can you print it again?

176
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,400
Okay.

177
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,960
Sorry.

178
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,480
It's okay.

179
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,720
Can you give me the money before the court is held at two o'clock?

180
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,360
No problem.

181
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,040
I'll give it to you soon.

182
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,560
Thank you.

183
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:08,920
Madam.

184
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,160
Han Gang was shot in the head.

185
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,120
He's dead.

186
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,400
We can't find any witnesses at the scene.

187
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,520
The man found the Godfather in the prayer room.

188
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,640
He was unconscious.

189
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,200
He's been taken to the hospital.

190
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,400
We'll talk about it later when he wakes up.

191
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,320
That's all for now.

192
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,960
Are you the victim's family?

193
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,200
He's the victim's brother.

194
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,160
Then look.

195
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,120
Is he your brother Han Gang?

196
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,080
Godfather.

197
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,280
The Godfather must have taken some

198
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,840
sedative drugs.

199
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,360
And he has lost consciousness.

200
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,960
Fortunately, it didn't cause too much harm

201
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,280
to his body.

202
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,240
He'll wake up soon after the night.

203
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,120
A few weeks ago,

204
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,080
a student from the drug trade group

205
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,520
was taken to the drug trade site

206
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,320
at about 8.20 a.m. on October 2nd.

207
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,160
After receiving the school's report,

208
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,840
the drug group followed a student

209
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,480
to the drug trade site.

210
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,160
What did you say?

211
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,000
He was shot in the church.

212
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,360
Brother, he...

213
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,840
Dad.

214
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
Dad, what's wrong?

215
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,120
Dad.

216
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,280
Dad!

217
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,800
Doctor!

218
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,360
Dad!

219
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,040
Find someone to come here!

220
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
Who do you think

221
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,080
is the murderer?

222
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,200
Madam.

223
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,400
You're the murderer.

224
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,520
I'm the murderer.

225
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,440
I'm the murderer.

226
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,360
I'm the murderer.

227
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
I'm the murderer.

228
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
I'm the murderer.

229
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,080
Madam.

230
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,920
This kind of person

231
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,720
deserves to be punished.

232
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,400
You can take it as his retribution.

233
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,320
It's good.

234
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,280
If you want to destroy the devil, you'll meet the devil.

235
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,160
What do you know?

236
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,480
It's not the devil.

237
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,600
It's not the time to be punished.

238
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,800
It's not the time to be punished.

239
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,440
Yeah.

240
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,680
Then, no more investigation.

241
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,360
Yeah.

242
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,200
No more investigation.

243
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,640
The murderer didn't kill the late father.

244
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,760
It doesn't look like the gang or the killer.

245
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,320
What if we take him as revenge?

246
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,760
If the murderer knows Han Gang,

247
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,880
then we can make it clear.

248
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,880
I agree.

249
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,000
The murderer knows Han Gang very well.

250
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,960
Before he did it,

251
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,440
he must have been observed and planned.

252
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,520
You take back the surveillance video

253
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,960
of the nearby hospital and church last week.

254
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,640
Check it carefully.

255
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,480
Maybe the murderer is in there.

256
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,560
Yes, madam.

257
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,400
Mr. Fei.

258
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,000
Mr. Qin, why are you here?

259
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,240
Do you want to drink my coffee?

260
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240
No.

261
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,360
I don't know where I lost my ring today.

262
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,480
I've been looking for it for a long time.

263
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,680
I think it might be here.

264
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,480
Today?

265
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,680
Have you been here?

266
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,720
I come here every day.

267
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,520
Yeah, you're used to it.

268
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,480
Every day.

269
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,720
You can have a look.

270
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,520
Yes.

271
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,640
I...

272
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,440
I'm here to get coffee.

273
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,640
I'll go to the bathroom.

274
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,360
Okay.

275
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,120
Okay.

276
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,720
Okay.

277
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,360
Okay.

278
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,720
I'm here to get coffee.

279
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,440
Yeah.

280
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,120
After getting coffee,

281
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,360
I usually don't touch anything else.

282
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:46,920
Yeah.

283
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,800
I'll get sugar when I get here.

284
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
Is it in the jar?

285
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,920
Have a look.

286
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,720
Check it out.

287
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,240
It's really here.

288
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,280
Is it?

289
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,960
Yeah.

290
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,280
I'm so careless.

291
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,760
Fortunately, it's in the jar.

292
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,400
You must keep it well in the future.

293
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,120
Okay, thank you.

294
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,920
You're welcome.

295
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,400
Okay, bye.

296
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,040
Okay.

297
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,760
You're welcome.

298
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,400
Bye.

299
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,360
Hello, uncle.

300
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,480
I'm Tang Xuan,

301
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,560
Senior Inspector of Dongqu Police Division.

302
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,360
Hello, officer Tang.

303
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,120
May I have a word with you?

304
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,960
Sure.

305
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,120
We found a bottle at the scene.

306
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,600
Besides the grass,

307
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,720
there are some sedative residues.

308
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,760
Do you remember

309
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,920
the bottle of sedative

310
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,160
that was in the warehouse?

311
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,920
Yes.

312
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,760
I found it.

313
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
I found it.

314
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,760
I found it.

315
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,560
I found it.

316
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,560
I found it.

317
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,560
I found it.

318
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,560
I found it.

319
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,560
I found it.

320
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,560
I found it.

321
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,880
Who gave you

322
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,120
the bottle of sedative?

323
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,040
I brought it there myself.

324
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,240
Do you remember

325
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
anyone touched the bottle of sedative?

326
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,120
No.

327
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,200
Because there were too many letters.

328
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,320
Before you fainted,

329
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,560
who took you to the police?

330
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,240
I remember that.

331
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,800
It was a man.

332
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,200
He was holding me.

333
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,080
I even looked at him.

334
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,760
Can you make a map for us?

335
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,800
I can try.

336
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
Okay.

337
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,400
Come in.

338
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,680
Madam.

339
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,400
The map made by the priest is out.

340
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,280
Congratulations, Dean Lu.

341
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
You're a wise man.

342
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,480
You're the true king.

343
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,280
Thank you, thank you.

344
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,080
Come on, come on.

345
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,840
I hope you'll support me more.

346
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,400
Let's toast to Dean Lu.

347
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,240
Come on, come on.

348
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
Cheers.

349
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
Congratulations.

350
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
Come on.

351
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
Cheers.

352
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
Cheers.

353
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,760
Cheers.

354
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
Cheers.

355
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Cheers.

356
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
Cheers.

357
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Cheers.

358
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
Cheers.

359
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
Cheers.

360
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,760
Cheers.

361
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,760
The police are here.

362
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Let's go.

363
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Come on.

364
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Come on.

365
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
Come on.

366
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,760
Come on.

367
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Come on.

368
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Come on.

369
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,760
Come on.

370
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,760
Come on.

371
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Come on.

372
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
Come on.

373
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,760
Come on.

374
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Come on.

375
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Come on.

376
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
Come on.

377
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
Come on.

378
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
Come on.

379
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,760
Come on.

380
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Come on.

381
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Come on.

382
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Come on.

383
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,760
Come on.

384
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,760
Come on.

385
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,760
Come on.

386
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,760
Come on.

387
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,760
Come on.

388
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
Come on.

389
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,060
Go.

390
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,060
Go.

391
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,060
Go.

392
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,060
tijd Lu.

393
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,520
I hereby report that someone is defrauding.

394
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,280
If he's spying on me

395
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,220
he's trying to Mrs Man little dance.

396
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,780
Are there some semen mistakes?

397
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,740
My crew

398
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,940
I have some questions.

399
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,420
Did we happen to be on the same road?

400
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,300
I'm right here now.

401
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,300
What do you want to ask?

402
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,140
What do you mean?

403
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,620
This is a copy of the painting of Sha Hangang.

404
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,540
Judge Qin, what do you think?

405
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,260
It looks familiar.

406
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,500
But I don't remember where I've seen it.

407
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,460
Don't you think these eyes

408
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,460
look like yours?

409
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,500
The eyes look a bit like yours.

410
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,580
The time of Hangang's death

411
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,460
is from 1 to 2 in the afternoon.

412
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,660
Judge Qin,

413
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,860
where were you at the time?

414
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,060
Are you asking me now?

415
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,180
Do you want to go to the interrogation room?

416
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,260
Tell me where you were.

417
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,660
It's not the easiest,

418
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,860
to just get rid of the suspicion.

419
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,660
Don't make it so complicated.

420
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,460
In the criminal investigation,

421
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,780
the responsibility of the public

422
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,060
is in the control room.

423
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,660
You have to get a clear evidence.

424
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,580
The defendant doesn't need to prove his innocence.

425
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,460
Are you refusing to answer now?

426
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,860
It's the responsibility of every citizen

427
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,060
to assist the police.

428
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,860
If I saved some procedures

429
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,060
because I knew you,

430
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,060
it seems not right.

431
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:31,740
Second

432
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,080
Fei Shu

433
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,080
in the court?

434
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,880
Most of my clients are old customers.

435
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
If they are familiar customers,

436
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,080
most of them are familiar customers.

437
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,680
It's so close to the court.

438
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,080
Are there many guests

439
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
from there?

440
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,480
Yes.

441
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,880
Just like Judge Qin.

442
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,280
He comes to Guanggu every day.

443
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,480
After lunch,

444
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,080
he orders a cup of coffee.

445
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
He is punctual.

446
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,680
One guest per day.

447
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,880
He is a judge.

448
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,480
Do you remember last Friday?

449
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,080
Did he come on time?

450
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,280
Last Friday?

451
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,080
Yes.

452
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,480
I remember last Friday,

453
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,680
many of my clients

454
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,480
made me dizzy.

455
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,280
Then,

456
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,480
when the door was about to close,

457
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,280
he came to the store and told me

458
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,680
that his ring was dropped here.

459
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,080
I also found it

460
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,880
in the candy jar.

461
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
So,

462
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,280
I have a deep impression.

463
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,080
I know Judge Qin,

464
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,880
but I don't think

465
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,080
he wears rings.

466
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,880
Yes.

467
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,280
One time,

468
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
he accidentally spilled coffee

469
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,480
and burned himself.

470
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,880
I even cleaned it for him.

471
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,080
I even removed his ring

472
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,080
and wiped it.

473
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,680
Maid,

474
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,280
what do you want to ask?

475
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,280
I have finished.

476
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
Thank you for your cooperation.

477
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,680
Thank you.

478
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
Come again.

479
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,280
Take care.

480
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,480
Now,

481
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,280
Judge Qin has no evidence.

482
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,880
I also asked his secretary.

483
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,680
He also said that

484
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,880
Judge Qin bought coffee that day.

485
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,480
Later, he even scanned the documents

486
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,480
and asked him to reprint it.

487
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
What do you think, Maid?

488
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,880
Everything is perfect.

489
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,280
But it's not real.

490
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Let's talk about it when we get back.

491
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,880
Dad,

492
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,680
they owe us.

493
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,680
Have you already got it back?

494
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,680
I have.

495
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,880
You don't need to worry about these things.

496
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
Don't worry.

497
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,880
Just take care of yourself in there.

498
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,680
Do you understand?

499
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,680
Let's go.

500
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,680
Father,

501
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,880
didn't you help the police to make the map?

502
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,880
You can help us too.

503
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,680
Killing is a long life.

504
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,480
I believe the God will agree.

505
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
Judge Qin.

506
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,680
Judge Qin.

507
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,280
Your car was destroyed last night.

508
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,680
Do you know who did it?

509
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,280
I'm sorry.

510
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,880
Judge Qin,

511
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,280
do you think this is a signal

512
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,480
that Haogang's security is deteriorating?

513
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,680
Actually, Haogang's security is deteriorating

514
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,280
not for a day or two.

515
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,880
If the police is ignored,

516
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,280
the law is threatened by violence,

517
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,880
such things will continue to happen.

518
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,680
And it will get worse.

519
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,680
I'm not afraid of the police.

520
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,880
I'm not afraid of the police.

521
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,080
I'm not afraid of the police.

522
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,280
I'm not afraid of the police.

523
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
I'm not afraid of the police.

524
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,480
I'm not afraid of the police.

525
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,880
I've prepared

526
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,680
for the psychological preparation of the law.

527
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,680
Judge Qin,

528
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,680
someone called Huang Xiao's doctor is here.

529
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,880
He wants to see you.

530
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,480
Please come in.

531
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,880
Doctor Huang, please come in.

532
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
Hello, Doctor Huang.

533
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,280
Hello, Judge Qin.

534
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,880
I came to say hello to you

535
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,280
because of what happened last night.

536
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,080
Thank you.

537
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,880
Please sit here.

538
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:02,680
Okay.

539
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
As a member,

540
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,480
I care about the citizens

541
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,480
and the core values of Haogang.

542
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,680
Economic development and legal system

543
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,880
are closely related.

544
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,280
If the legal system is damaged,

545
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,880
I'm afraid that investors

546
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,080
will lose confidence in us.

547
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,880
So I absolutely understand

548
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
the violent behavior of Judge Qin.

549
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,480
Since my son was sentenced to jail,

550
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,880
many words of violence have happened to me.

551
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,680
Recently, there are also real damage.

552
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,080
What I'm most worried about

553
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,480
is my son's safety in prison.

554
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,480
I absolutely understand your feeling.

555
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,880
Judge Qin,

556
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,680
I'm actually a member of the Supervision Committee of the Education Bureau.

557
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,880
How about I tell the director

558
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,080
to pay special attention to

559
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,480
your son's safety?

560
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,680
Is that convenient?

561
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,480
No problem.

562
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,680
Come on.

563
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,280
Hello, director.

564
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,680
I'm Huang Xiao's doctor.

565
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,280
Hello, Director Huang.

566
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,080
The car that Judge Qin drove last night

567
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,080
was broken by someone.

568
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,880
I think you've seen the news, right?

569
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,880
Yes.

570
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,680
I think this is definitely

571
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,080
a targeted violent act.

572
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,080
I'm worried that Judge Qin's son, Qin Yiwei,

573
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,280
will become the next target of attack.

574
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,280
Can you do something

575
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,880
to ensure his son's safety?

576
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,080
Director Huang, don't worry.

577
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,280
I know what to do.

578
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
I promise Qin Yiwei

579
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,880
will not lose a hair.

580
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,280
Thank you, Brigadier Liu.

581
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,680
I'll contact you later.

582
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,880
Goodbye.

583
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,880
Judge Qin,

584
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,680
the director agreed.

585
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,080
You should be relieved now.

586
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,280
Thank you, Director Huang.

587
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,280
Don't mention it.

588
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,280
If you encounter any problem in the future,

589
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,480
you can contact me anytime.

590
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,080
I think we will have

591
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,680
a lot of time to cooperate in the future.

592
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
Okay, I won't bother you.

593
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,680
Okay, this way, please.

594
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,480
Goodbye.

595
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,480
Okay.

596
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,880
Judge Qin,

597
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,080
is your car broken?

598
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,680
Yes, the tire suddenly leaked.

599
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,080
It's hard to hit the car at this time.

600
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
If you don't mind,

601
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,480
take my car.

602
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
Thank you.

603
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,680
What's your name?

604
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,280
Which department are you from?

605
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,080
I caught you today.

606
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,680
I want to send you to my brother.

607
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,880
You don't know how long you have been kidnapped.

608
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,880
Up to 15 years.

609
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,480
You are very filial.

610
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,480
You want to be in jail with your father.

611
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,880
15 years of kidnapping.

612
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,080
But what about murder?

613
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,880
What will you do if you kill my brother?

614
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,880
What do you want to do?

615
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,280
Why do you want to kill my brother?

616
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,680
Do you need a reason?

617
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
I just asked once,

618
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,480
why do you want to kill my brother?

619
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,280
Because your brother is a scumbag.

620
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,480
Your whole family is scumbags.

621
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
Why?

622
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
Why?

623
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,080
Why do you want to kill my brother?

624
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,880
Why do you want to kill my brother?

625
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,880
Why?

626
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,880
You tell me.

627
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,280
You don't want to tell me, right?

628
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,280
Then I will kill you.

629
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,280
I will kill your son.

630
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,280
Get up.

631
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,080
If I can get out of this door alive,

632
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
I will kill you too.

633
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,680
You are quite noble.

634
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,480
You took off your judge's robe.

635
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,680
You know nothing.

636
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,080
Don't shoot.

637
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,480
I will say it.

638
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,880
I will say it.

639
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,280
Because your whole family is scumbags.

640
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,480
Then I will kill you to avenge my brother.

641
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,880
Okay.

642
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,880
If you have guts, shoot.

643
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,880
Come on.

644
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,080
Stop shooting.

645
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,680
What's the matter?

646
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,680
Someone is coming outside.

647
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
You must go.

648
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,080
It's not your business.

649
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,080
Keep an eye on him.

650
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,880
Yes.

651
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,480
Your Highness.

652
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,080
This is Huang Xiao.

653
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,680
Huang Yi Yuan?

654
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,880
We seem to have nothing to do.

655
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
I can't go to see him.

656
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,880
I will go to see him.

657
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,080
What's the matter?

658
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,080
I am deeply sorry for your brother's departure.

659
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,080
I came to comfort you.

660
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Thank you, Guan Xian.

661
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
Find a place to chat.

662
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,080
Today

663
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,280
is not convenient.

664
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,680
Huang Yi Yuan.

665
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,480
This way.

666
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,880
I guess you are not here for comfort.

667
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,280
Why don't

668
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,880
you just tell me the truth?

669
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,480
I like to talk to smart people like you.

670
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,880
It saves me a lot of time.

671
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,280
I want you to let judge Qin go.

672
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,680
Because Haogang needs this judge

673
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,480
who is loyal and righteous.

674
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,880
Loyal and righteous?

675
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,880
So what if I don't let him go?

676
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,680
No.

677
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,280
If judge Qin dies,

678
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,680
your brother won't be revived.

679
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,680
Why don't you find something

680
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,480
meaningful to do?

681
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,480
There are some signs.

682
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,480
You have to be careful when you see them.

683
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,280
Bonds.

684
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
Bonds.

685
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,080
Black peach.

686
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Businesses.

687
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,480
Police.

688
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880
And documents.

689
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,680
Seeing these,

690
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
you have to be careful.

691
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,080
They are loyal and righteous.

692
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,080
I think we can't convince each other.

693
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,280
We'd better not waste time.

694
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,880
Han Er Shao.

695
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
What we waste

696
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,680
is your father's time in prison.

697
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,280
What do you mean?

698
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,480
Just like a chess game.

699
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,680
Every chess game has its function.

700
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,680
You can't just move it.

701
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,680
If you move it,

702
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,080
it will affect the layout.

703
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
If it affects the layout,

704
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,280
it will affect the winning.

705
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
If it affects the winning,

706
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,680
it will affect the interests.

707
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,880
You should understand.

708
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,880
Who is the one who controls the chess game?

709
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,680
You.

710
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,080
I'm just a messenger.

711
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,080
That means

712
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,280
my father is a chess player.

713
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,480
That's right.

714
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,680
The judge is also a chess player.

715
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,480
He will be.

716
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,480
How do you know he will listen to you?

717
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480
Everyone has his weakness.

718
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,280
I don't want him to listen to me.

719
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,880
I want the overall situation.

720
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,080
The overall situation

721
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,280
is the future interests of your father.

722
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,080
I know my father too well.

723
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,080
He can't compete with my brother in any way.

724
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,080
I'm the same.

725
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,280
That's a pity.

726
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,080
A useless chess piece has no value.

727
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,680
How dare you touch my father?

728
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,680
I'm just a messenger.

729
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,880
I've brought the painting.

730
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
Think it over.

731
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,680
Judge Qin.

732
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,680
Judge Huang wants to ask you to get in the car.

733
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,280
Judge Qin.

734
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,880
Judge Huang.

735
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,680
Get in the car.

736
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,880
Okay!

737
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,080
How is it?

738
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,880
All of a sudden,

739
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,000
Liu Ge shocked me

740
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,320
and selective

741
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,520
teacher,

742
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,080
called me by name.

743
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,600
And tonight,

744
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,000
We are just a bridge between communication and marriage.

745
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I know what happened.

746
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,200
Judge Jin,

747
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,600
why don't we pretend that nothing happened tonight?

748
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,400
I also believe that it won't happen again.

749
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,400
I'll take you home to rest.

750
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,600
Thank you.

751
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Why didn't you kill that judge?

752
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,200
The court judge is here.

753
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,800
He's here for the sake of Haogang's anger.

754
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
He wants me to release him.

755
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,200
You're scared now?

756
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,600
Dad, you said it yourself.

757
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,400
When you meet these people, you can only talk about interests.

758
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,000
Interests are the most powerful weapons.

759
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Your big brother is the only one who has the best interests.

760
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,200
He's not.

761
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,200
A useless chess piece is worthless.

762
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,800
You dare to touch my dad?

763
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,800
I've brought the words. Think about it.

764
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,200
Dad, that judge won't let his son run away.

765
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,800
He can kill me anytime.

766
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,200
But I won't let them hurt you.

767
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,400
I'm not afraid of them.

768
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,200
I don't believe they dare to touch me.

769
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,800
I can help them. I can also fight them.

770
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,400
But who's afraid of who?

771
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Dad.

772
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,600
Don't talk anymore. You go out first.

773
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,400
I won't let you down.

774
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,000
I won't let you down.

775
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,600
I will avenge my big brother.

776
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,200
I won't let you down.

777
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,000
Don't be so angry.

778
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,400
It's fine.

779
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:08,720
Dad, let's talk about the people we've

780
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,800
JeÅli.

781
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,200
We'll cooperate.

782
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,600
Okay.

783
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,800
Find a weird character from that jerk.

784
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,600
I don't think you're right.

785
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,000
Dad, what did you have to do to be like this?

786
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,600
I already hit you for this, right?

787
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,200
Dad, I've just got a piece of a business score.

788
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,200
I have such a crappy team.

789
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,600
One person persists,ãã.

790
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,240
I've thought about it.

791
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,960
His ring can be put in in advance.

792
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,240
Other things can also be deployed in advance.

793
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,240
What about the witness?

794
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,680
Do you think Fei Shu is his time witness?

795
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,760
He can't kill people while buying coffee.

796
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,000
This is also something I can't figure out.

797
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,920
Sorry, I'm talking about work again.

798
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,240
Why don't we go watch a movie?

799
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,640
I should be the one to say sorry.

800
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,480
I'm going to see the hooligan after eating.

801
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:02,880
To the city?

802
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,000
No.

803
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,520
After he agreed to do the surgery,

804
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,880
I asked someone to pick him up.

805
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,800
As long as there is a chance,

806
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,400
no one is willing to wait for death.

807
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,960
I hope he can really give you new clues.

808
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,880
I hope so.

809
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,160
I'll be back at a few o'clock.

810
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,000
We'll go out to watch a movie when we have time.

811
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,160
Okay.

812
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,240
After you finish your medicine,

813
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,520
the patient will fall asleep very quickly.

814
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,840
Don't talk for too long.

815
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,760
Okay.

816
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,960
Are you okay, Brother Mao?

817
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,640
It doesn't hurt after taking the medicine.

818
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,880
It's a blood-stain relationship.

819
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,320
Brother Mao,

820
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,320
do you remember who Lin Qian is?

821
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,880
She's also in Haogang.

822
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,160
She said she would visit you later.

823
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,600
I know.

824
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,760
I know.

825
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,480
I know.

826
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,120
I know.

827
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,720
I know.

828
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,400
I know.

829
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,000
I know.

830
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,600
I know.

831
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,480
I know.

832
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,520
God punishes me.

833
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,320
I'm the most ungrateful.

834
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,600
Shi Tou,

835
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,720
I know why you came to me.

836
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,240
It's for your family.

837
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,840
Actually, the one who was drunk

838
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,480
was not Zhen Xiu.

839
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,320
Do you know who Zhen Xiu is?

840
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,520
I was a noble man in the back.

841
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,640
Now the one who is drunk

842
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,120
is still young.

843
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,040
I can't forgive him.

844
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,160
Shi Si,

845
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,640
this is the trial report

846
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,800
of the fire case in the Mupeng District of the 78th year.

847
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,000
So all the evidence is in here?

848
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,400
Yes.

849
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,320
All of them are recorded.

850
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:39,960
Thank you.

851
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,560
You're welcome.

852
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,560
Height is only 1.6 meters.

853
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,800
He doesn't fit that height.

854
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,640
No wonder Liu Mao said

855
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,960
that man is a scarecrow.

856
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:22,960
You're back.

857
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,040
It seems that you've decided

858
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,000
to move your office to my house.

859
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,520
Yes.

860
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:34,720
What?

861
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,520
Do you have any objection?

862
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,960
No.

863
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,720
I don't know how good it is.

864
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,760
I just want to

865
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,960
have a good time with you.

866
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,920
I'm sorry.

867
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,680
I'm sorry.

868
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,440
I'm sorry.

869
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,120
I'm sorry.

870
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,720
I'm sorry.

871
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,480
I'm sorry.

872
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,200
I'm sorry.

873
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:47,960
I'm sorry.

874
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,640
I'm sorry.

875
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,360
I'm sorry.

876
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,080
I'm sorry.

877
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,800
I'm sorry.

878
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,640
I'm sorry.

879
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:52,800
Have you eaten?

880
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,480
No.

881
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,920
I'm waiting for you to eat.

882
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,560
Okay.

883
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,200
I'll cook.

884
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,200
What do you want to eat?

885
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,440
How about I cook for you today?

886
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,120
Since I cooked

887
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,320
the Guali Pao Rice last time,

888
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,080
I haven't cooked for you.

889
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,600
Outsider,

890
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,320
are you sure that you cooked

891
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,800
the Guali Pao Rice

892
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,120
with Huangfu Trash?

893
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,960
What's wrong?

894
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,640
Can it be Guali Pao Rice?

895
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,920
You go to Chang'an.

896
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,040
I'll cook it.

897
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,600
I won't bother you, okay?

898
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,720
No.

899
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,920
I want to make

900
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,120
homemade crispy seafood soup for you.

901
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,520
You want to make crispy skin?

902
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,400
Come on.

903
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,920
Let's see what the real Guali Pao Rice is.

904
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,800
So this is the color.

905
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,240
What?

906
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,080
After you met Liu Mao today,

907
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,160
what new clues do you have?

908
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,560
Based on the information provided by Liu Mao

909
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,840
and the evidence

910
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,280
found in the information box in the police station,

911
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,840
the murderer of that one-meter six

912
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,640
must be a scapegoat.

913
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,600
Because Liu Mao said

914
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,240
the real murderer of the fire

915
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,480
is a tall man.

916
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,080
That's all?

917
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,160
That's a lot of tea.

918
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,280
There is one person who can help me.

919
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,960
He is the medical examiner

920
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,440
of this case.

921
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,920
Qin Yu?

922
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,280
The medical examiner

923
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,080
can receive the most complete evidence

924
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,040
of this case.

925
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,040
That is to say,

926
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,280
those who are most likely to be the real ones

927
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,280
will receive the most authentic evidence and testimony.

928
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,200
It's really Qin Yu?

929
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,840
I'm going to find you

930
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,360
to help the suspect who is involved in the murder case.

931
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,360
Are you angry?

932
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,240
It's all the same.

933
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,920
I'm worried

934
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,080
he's not the Qin Yu he used to be.

935
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,240
He might not help you.

936
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,800
We'll have to try.

937
00:47:48,280 --> 00:48:17,160
I will help the

938
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,680
I simply read through this case.

939
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,080
Did you find anything wrong?

940
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,080
I don't remember the case from 1978 very clearly.

941
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,880
You said you couldn't remember the content,

942
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,280
but the crime was in 1978.

943
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,480
You remember it clearly.

944
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,080
With××ª

945
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,080
Okay. Thank youaime profiteer.

946
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,880
Sorry for being carded.

947
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,680
Come in

948
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,160
Dasi, why are you looking for me?

949
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,280
I think this liquid coffee is dangerous.

950
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,680
Come, sit and have a taste.

951
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,280
Thank you

952
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:30,480
I heard that you are interested in some old cases recently

953
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,600
I just want to know the truth

954
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,920
The technology is not so advanced

955
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,720
The skills of investigation are more particular

956
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,720
And the cases that have been settled

957
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,240
are not so good to refer to

958
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,760
Times have changed

959
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,120
The method of handling the case will be different

960
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,880
It's hard to distinguish right from wrong

961
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,520
Let bygones be bygones

962
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,240
It's the

963
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,920
If you investigate it again, it won't be a good time

964
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,440
Actually, back then

965
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,680
You asked me why I didn't tell you the truth

966
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,120
Because I lost my seal

967
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,320
Then who gave it to you?

968
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,480
I don't know him

969
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,080
But he was also a scapegoat

970
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,160
After I got the money, I went out to have a look

971
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,160
He was standing next to the car

972
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,640
Chatting with a tall foreigner

973
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,920
That foreigner was drawing blood

974
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,080
I'm a big boss

975
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,000
You have been in the police for so many years

976
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,240
You have a good reputation

977
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,880
I plan to recommend you to the imperial decree at the end of the year

978
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,880
What do you think of the police?

979
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,760
In that case, sister-in-law

980
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,760
I really have to thank you for your recommendation

981
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,760
You don't have to say polite words

982
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,920
From now on, you should think about your work

983
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,360
It's too troublesome

984
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,360
Don't touch a case that has no benefits

985
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,760
I will leave this place to you

986
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,760
I won't let you down

987
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,560
I was also suspicious of whether the fight was a black police

988
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,560
Now you don't have to doubt it

989
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,360
Dajia Ma has always been very fond of Han Kuilong

990
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,880
Is it Han Kuilong who is colluding with him?

991
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,880
I don't think Han Kuilong is the only one

992
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,880
There should be a higher-ups behind Dajia Ma

993
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,080
What are you going to do now?

994
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,680
Of course it's a thing a police should do

995
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,320
Dajia Ma knows you are going to re-investigate the fire

996
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,080
Did he always send people to watch you?

997
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,080
He still wants to bribe me

998
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:55,080
I guess he doesn't know that I'm going to investigate him

999
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:01,080
Then Liu Mao will be your best witness

1000
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,080
For the sake of interests

1001
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:12,080
How many lives have become their sacrifices?

1002
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,080
Dajia Ma

1003
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,080
The fire of the heart burns every possible

1004
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:56,080
Light is as strong as the force to chase

1005
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,080
Heart, the heart is in the heart

1006
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,080
Half drunk, the body is confused

1007
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,080
Not knowing the fire burns like a fire

1008
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:13,080
The same is true for the wrong

1009
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,080
The heart is blinded by smoke

1010
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:20,080
The light and dark are in the front

1011
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,080
The seven corners of the body are close

1012
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,080
This is not a heart

1013
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,080
Let the conscience ask

1014
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,080
Who is the one who is not righteous

1015
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,080
And is willing to be punished

1016
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,080
Only ask the right thing

1017
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,080
Looking at the poor people

1018
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,080
But I am rational

1019
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,080
Push to the side of the foot, the heart is in the center

1020
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,080
Why can't you look at it?

1021
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,080
I can't stop looking back

1022
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,080
I think you are more cruel

1023
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:59,080
The road is long, good days are right

1024
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:03,080
But look at the heart in the fire

1025
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,080
Looking at the poor people

1026
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,080
But I am rational

1027
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,080
Push to the side of the foot, the heart is in the center

1028
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,080
Why can't you look at it?

1029
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,080
I can't stop looking back

1030
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:23,080
I think you are more cruel

1031
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:30,080
The road is long, good days are right

1032
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:34,080
But look at the heart in the fire

1033
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:47,080
The road is long, good days are right
