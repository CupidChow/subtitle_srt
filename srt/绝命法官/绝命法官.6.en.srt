1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
the

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,840
down

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,840
the

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,840
the

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,300
the

6
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,800
And I'm sorry, you don't need to change those letters forever.

7
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
I always want to be happy.

8
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,300
Li Omotar strong fleece!

9
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,300
Heavenly Suicide

10
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,800
Episode 7

11
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,300
I called you yesterday but you haven't picked up.

12
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,800
I was the one that came.

13
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,300
But you've been staying in the hospital.

14
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
You're in the medical room.

15
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,580
They're going to sue me

16
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,540
for going there without a care

17
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,540
for the son of Han Kuilong.

18
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,180
What do you think?

19
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,420
You went there and you went there?

20
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,940
Did you find the white Benchi?

21
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,500
I did.

22
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,060
But they burned the car last night.

23
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,740
What about Xiaobei?

24
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,620
Did you talk to her?

25
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,180
I couldn't find her.

26
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,220
She was afraid to hide.

27
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,980
The police may sue you for

28
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,980
escaping responsibility.

29
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,180
So if you have any evidence

30
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,780
that can help you,

31
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,820
don't hide it anymore.

32
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,260
Can I transfer the evidence?

33
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,580
I don't know what you're afraid of.

34
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,420
But if you can provide

35
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,260
clues to the case

36
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,580
and reach an agreement with the控方,

37
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,020
I can ask for special protection.

38
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,020
They can't protect us here.

39
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,100
Except me.

40
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,980
Unless I can leave,

41
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,220
the whole family will leave together.

42
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,380
As long as I'm in Haogang,

43
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,900
I can't say anything.

44
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,180
Lao Wen.

45
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,980
I just met Ma Shanbao.

46
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,100
He wants to talk to the控方.

47
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,820
He wants to confess the car accident?

48
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,020
He wants to transfer the evidence.

49
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,300
Who does he want to testify?

50
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,780
As long as he can provide

51
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,060
enough protection to his family and him,

52
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,500
he will tell the truth.

53
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,660
What truth?

54
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,420
He will tell the truth about the man who hit Han Gang.

55
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,900
So he didn't tell you who the murderer was?

56
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,940
Ma Shanbao is very afraid now.

57
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,820
He doesn't believe anyone, including me.

58
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,860
Then why do you believe

59
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,580
a person who doesn't believe you?

60
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,980
Because I have confidence in Ma Shanbao.

61
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,060
I know the person he wants to talk to must be

62
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,780
an important figure that no one dares to touch.

63
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,820
That's why he's so afraid.

64
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:32,980
Qi Changlong?

65
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,300
I don't know.

66
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,580
But if it's him,

67
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,180
I don't think it's an accident.

68
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,700
Qi Changlong.

69
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,660
Who is the chief judge?

70
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,980
Zhang Jian, Zhang Songshan.

71
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,860
Zhang Songshan.

72
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,860
Zhang Songshan is from Jiucheng District.

73
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,020
This is his weakness.

74
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,700
You mean...

75
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,460
People in Jiucheng District

76
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,620
never want to cooperate with the police.

77
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,780
When did you see

78
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,140
five witnesses from Jiucheng District?

79
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,620
Tell him

80
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,100
that you'll pay him three years' living expenses

81
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,260
to help Ma Shanbao immigrate to Jiandao.

82
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,060
Will Zhang Jian accept this?

83
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,420
Does this have anything to do with Jiucheng District?

84
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,100
You have such a big condition.

85
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,420
He will believe that

86
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,420
there's a tiger behind you.

87
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,260
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,140
If Zhang Songshan

89
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,300
really becomes the prosecutor,

90
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,420
he will tell others about the person

91
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,380
who saved Jiucheng District.

92
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,020
But will Zhang Jian

93
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,660
believe me?

94
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,140
Only if the new person

95
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,820
dares to make such a condition

96
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,660
will he believe in his value.

97
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,380
So my next step

98
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,980
is to make Zhang Jian believe

99
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,260
that Ma Shanbao must accept his condition

100
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,420
if he wants to tell the truth.

101
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,180
This is a golden opportunity.

102
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,860
It's the only way to help Ma Shanbao.

103
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,580
Thank you, Master.

104
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:49,460
The

105
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,900
Hurry up

106
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,900
the work focus

107
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,380
Don't report it.

108
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,380
Luo Wei, are you really welcoming your good friend like this?

109
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,380
Madam, Mr. Zhou is here.

110
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,380
Sit.

111
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,380
Didn't you insist on not having your client here?

112
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,380
Is Ms. Zhang not here yet?

113
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,380
Didn't you say you would meet at 11?

114
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,380
Ms. Zhang is not here yet.

115
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,380
I'm not here yet.

116
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,380
I'm not here yet.

117
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,380
I'm not here yet.

118
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,380
Didn't you say you would meet at 11?

119
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,380
Ms. Zhang just called.

120
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,380
She said she had a traffic jam at the court.

121
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,380
You used to be a real captain.

122
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,380
Now you're in this kind of trouble.

123
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,380
You're feeding four people at once.

124
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,380
Four people at once?

125
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,380
If you have something to say, say it.

126
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,380
How much can this guy make at once?

127
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,380
Not as much as you make by killing people.

128
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,380
Yes.

129
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,380
So, 200,000 is not a small amount to you.

130
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,380
It's not easy to get such a big sum of money at once.

131
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,380
A'Bao calls you uncle.

132
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,380
Sasha and her mother are sisters.

133
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,380
This is your family business.

134
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,380
But now Daxiong is being made a living.

135
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,380
I'm their boss.

136
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,380
I have to come out and defend my brother.

137
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,380
Han Gang is in a coma.

138
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,380
Daxiong is injured.

139
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,380
It's going to be a long war between me and Han Kuilong.

140
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,380
But now there are so many problems because of A'Bao.

141
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,380
I asked her mother.

142
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,380
That night you called A'Bao out.

143
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,380
Say it.

144
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,380
What did you call her out for?

145
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,380
Where did the 200,000 come from?

146
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,380
Who are you going to cover?

147
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,380
Don't say it.

148
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,380
It's okay if you don't say it.

149
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,380
This has nothing to do with you.

150
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,380
What do you want?

151
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,380
It's simple.

152
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:11,380
To kill Han Kuilong, it's not enough to get more people and a few guns.

153
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,380
It's not enough.

154
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,380
You need some big guys to win.

155
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,380
For the sake of Sasha and her two children,

156
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,380
you can help me.

157
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,380
You have to help yourself.

158
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,380
It's a good idea.

159
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,380
Zhang Jian, please.

160
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,380
Zhang Jian.

161
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,380
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,380
There was a lot of work this morning.

163
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,380
I was stuck in the car.

164
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,380
It's okay.

165
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,380
Is it Zhou Wenluo?

166
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,380
Please.

167
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,380
It's Zhou Luowen.

168
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,380
Okay, Zhou Lawyer.

169
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,380
Take your time.

170
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,380
Get to the point.

171
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,380
My client wants to make a deal.

172
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,380
He's willing to admit his crime, right?

173
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,380
He wants to turn into a false witness.

174
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,380
But he's the only one who reported the whole case.

175
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,380
The police have no direct evidence

176
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,380
to prove that my client stole a car and caused a traffic accident.

177
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,380
The case is based on the defendant's case.

178
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,380
The court may be able to prove it without a crime.

179
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,380
But if my client is willing to tell the truth,

180
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,380
it will save the legal resources

181
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,380
and benefit both parties.

182
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,380
You said Ma Shanbao wasn't there.

183
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,380
Now you say he knows the truth.

184
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,380
What do you mean?

185
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,380
I can tell you one more thing.

186
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,380
This car accident may not be an accident.

187
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,380
You mean the victim was a victim?

188
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,380
I don't rule out this possibility.

189
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,380
This is my client's request.

190
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,380
If you agree, he will tell the truth.

191
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,380
Canada.

192
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,380
And his family.

193
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,380
And his living expenses.

194
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,380
Qi Changrong's family has been living in the old city.

195
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,380
No one dares to be a false witness.

196
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,380
Because they don't dare to cooperate with the police.

197
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,380
It's their tradition.

198
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,380
The police should know this.

199
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,380
He's just a thief.

200
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,380
What can he know?

201
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,380
Ma Shanbao grew up in the old city.

202
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,380
He's a member of Qi Changrong.

203
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,380
I'm sorry.

204
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,380
Lawyer Zhou, right?

205
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,380
I heard you said you're familiar with the old city.

206
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,380
Do you know the difference between the people in the old city and Qi Changrong?

207
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,380
This case is your first case of your own independence, right?

208
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,380
I appreciate your courage.

209
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,380
But you can't be so greedy, you know?

210
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,380
You're so weak because of my low self-esteem.

211
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,380
Lawyer Zhou, you can't be so aggressive.

212
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,380
The lion will bite you to death.

213
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,380
Zhang Jian, you're from the old city, too.

214
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,380
What? What did you say?

215
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,380
Who said I'm from the old city?

216
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,380
You're not.

217
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,380
Zhang Jian grew up abroad.

218
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,380
He came back after graduation.

219
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,380
My identity shouldn't be part of the negotiation.

220
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,380
I don't think we need to talk about it.

221
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,380
Lawyer Zhou Luowen, right?

222
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,380
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,380
I'll send her out first.

224
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,380
Hello, how's it going?

225
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,380
Oh, no. Zhang Jian is not from the old city.

226
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,380
No, you've seen his information.

227
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,380
His parents are all from the old city.

228
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,380
What happened?

229
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,380
He's very sensitive to the old city.

230
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,380
He doesn't let me talk about it.

231
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,380
Don't be afraid. There must be a way.

232
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,380
The old city.

233
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,380
You don't know how many years it took me to take off this hat.

234
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,380
Zhang Jian doesn't have to argue with the newcomers.

235
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,380
Transferred to a slum witness and even had the whole family immigrated abroad.

236
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,380
How can he be so confident to make such a condition?

237
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,380
Let's sue him according to the original charge.

238
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,380
Zhang Jian,

239
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,380
look at this report first.

240
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,380
What is this?

241
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,380
The DNA report that was tested on the spot.

242
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,380
You're showing me now?

243
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,380
I just received it.

244
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,380
I was going to give it to you as soon as you came.

245
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,380
I didn't expect Lawyer Zhou to arrive very early.

246
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,380
There are two DNA samples on this.

247
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,380
They're all the same.

248
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,380
One is from a burglary on the ground.

249
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,380
The other one is on the sprayer of the school.

250
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,380
I believe it's from the real murderer.

251
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,380
It should be that he was too nervous when he was working on the case.

252
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,380
It caused the picture.

253
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,380
Wait.

254
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,380
It's not compatible with Ma Shanbao's DNA?

255
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,380
We really found the wrong person.

256
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,380
And the police have no reason to continue to detain him.

257
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,380
His lawyer doesn't know about this report yet.

258
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,380
Only we know.

259
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,380
He's still in front of the police.

260
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,380
He's making fun of me.

261
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,380
Do you think he's just trying to sell me out?

262
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,380
It's their usual way to get your confidence.

263
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,380
Did you make any conditions?

264
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,380
Did they respond?

265
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,380
What's the bottom line?

266
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,380
I didn't say the bottom line.

267
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,380
Zhang Jian just refused.

268
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,380
This means Ma Shanbao will continue to stay.

269
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,380
Wait a minute.

270
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,380
The police just sent me a message.

271
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,380
He asked me to go back and continue to talk.

272
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,380
Did you ask why?

273
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,380
No.

274
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,380
Remember, unless they agree to all the conditions,

275
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,380
you don't have to talk.

276
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,380
Keep your bottom line.

277
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,380
I understand.

278
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,380
Lawyer Zhou, you did deviate from the topic a little bit.

279
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,380
But fortunately, Zhang Jian is reasonable.

280
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,380
He's willing to give you another chance.

281
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,380
I understand.

282
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,380
I'm sorry about earlier.

283
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,380
Enough.

284
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,380
Ma Shanbao's request can be discussed.

285
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,380
But there's a precondition.

286
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,380
I have to know how much he's going to reveal the truth.

287
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,380
Who is the one who is going to hurt Xu Yi?

288
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,380
Because he never mentioned it.

289
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,380
I need to ask for my client's consent before I can answer you.

290
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,380
You can call him now.

291
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,380
I have a phone call.

292
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,380
What do you think?

293
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,380
I believe someone behind him must have taught him how to do it.

294
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,380
It's not like he's a newcomer who can do it.

295
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,380
Let's see how capable he is to do it.

296
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,380
How is it?

297
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,380
They want to know who the real murderer is.

298
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,380
This is your bottom line.

299
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,380
If you reveal it too soon, you won't have a bargaining chip.

300
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,380
Tell them your client doesn't agree.

301
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,380
I understand.

302
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,380
I understand.

303
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,380
My client doesn't agree.

304
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,380
If I go to the detention center to see him, I can get his consent.

305
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,380
I'll give you one day.

306
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,380
We'll talk here tomorrow.

307
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,380
I have another request.

308
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,380
What is it?

309
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,380
I'll apply to the court to let my client go home

310
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,380
and accept the police's detention.

311
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,380
Although you said it would be dangerous outside,

312
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,380
it's not safe in the detention center.

313
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,380
My client wants to go home and see his family.

314
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,380
I have to meet his conditions

315
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,380
so I can convince him.

316
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,380
At the same time, I want to know who the murderer is.

317
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,380
I can convince him.

318
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,380
At the same time, I need Zhang Jian to support my application.

319
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,380
I'll go back and prepare the information for the court.

320
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,380
Thank you.

321
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,380
This is the only chance to find the murderer.

322
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,380
Stop the two gangs from fighting.

323
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,380
If you don't mind, Zhang Jian...

324
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,380
I don't mind.

325
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,380
I'll do as the procedure.

326
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,380
Thank you, Zhang Jian.

327
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,380
Okay.

328
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,380
I'll go.

329
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,380
Aren't you done with class?

330
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,380
Why are you back?

331
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,380
Can we talk?

332
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,380
Psychological counseling...

333
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,380
They can't help me.

334
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,380
I'm sorry.

335
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,380
I can't help you either.

336
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,380
Coach.

337
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,380
I know drinking is a burden on you.

338
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,380
But I'm really grateful

339
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,380
that you were there with me.

340
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,380
This is for you.

341
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,380
I apologize.

342
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,380
No need.

343
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,380
Just take care of yourself.

344
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,380
Qin Wei!

345
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,380
Qi Changrong knew I was giving A Bao more money.

346
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,380
He put this matter on my head.

347
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,380
He threatened me with my wife and child.

348
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,380
He asked me to help him get a batch of weapons.

349
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,380
You won't agree to it, will you?

350
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,380
Do I have the right to choose?

351
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,380
Is there really no other way?

352
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,380
We have a bigger problem now.

353
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,380
A Bao is going to be a false witness.

354
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,380
Who told you that?

355
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,380
Lawyer Zhao said A Bao hasn't told me yet.

356
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,380
As soon as he speaks,

357
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,380
he will tell you and me.

358
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,380
You have one night to persuade A Bao to change his mind.

359
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,380
A Bao is now being held alone.

360
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,380
I can't even see him.

361
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,380
How can I convince him?

362
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,380
He will be released in a while.

363
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,380
He will be held by the police.

364
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,380
We have already agreed on the situation.

365
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,380
The situation is clear.

366
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,380
The court and the控方 have agreed.

367
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,380
Tonight is our last chance.

368
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,380
I will go back and discuss it with my wife.

369
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,380
We are in a lot of trouble.

370
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,380
Don't involve her anymore.

371
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,380
What should I do?

372
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,380
If you really find her,

373
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,380
tell her that the police don't have any evidence.

374
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,380
As long as she passes this test,

375
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,380
I can think of a way.

376
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,380
Tell her to change her mind when she meets Lawyer Zhou.

377
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,380
And keep silent.

378
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,380
In the end,

379
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,380
you are afraid that something will happen to yourself.

380
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,380
What am I afraid of?

381
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,380
I don't want to let go of the guards.

382
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,380
Even if the police really go to arrest people,

383
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,380
they won't arrest Yi Wei.

384
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,380
I won't let her go to jail.

385
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,380
You are going to run away like this?

386
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,380
You treat your friend like this?

387
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,380
If I don't treat you as a friend, I won't ask you to go to A Bao.

388
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,380
I am helping you and everyone.

389
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,380
Do we want to run away?

390
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,380
It depends on whether you can shut A Bao up.

391
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,380
You can go home tonight.

392
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,380
Really?

393
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,380
It's the police's house.

394
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,380
But at least you can go home

395
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,380
and see your mother and brother.

396
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,380
What are their conditions?

397
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,380
Who is the real murderer?

398
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,380
What about my request?

399
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,380
What about the money?

400
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,380
Where will our family go?

401
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,380
The real murderer is not a murderer.

402
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,380
The real murderer is a pre-conditioned condition.

403
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,380
The truth must be convincing

404
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,380
so that they can start a false witness plan.

405
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,380
How about this?

406
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,380
I'll let you think about it.

407
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,380
When you get home, you can discuss it with your mother.

408
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,380
Tonight,

409
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,380
I can really go home?

410
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,380
But the deadline

411
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,380
is tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.

412
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,380
You must tell them the real murderer's name.

413
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,380
Otherwise, they will arrest you immediately

414
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,380
and then there will be no false witness plan.

415
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,380
Because they will think you don't believe them.

416
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,380
Mom,

417
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,380
Uncle is back!

418
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,380
Uncle is back!

419
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,380
Mom, Uncle is back!

420
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,380
Uncle is back!

421
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,380
Uncle is back! Look!

422
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,380
Uncle is back!

423
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,380
Can you untie the handcuffs?

424
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,380
Don't let his brother and sister see it.

425
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,380
Untie it.

426
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,380
I can do it.

427
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,380
I hope you will keep your promise.

428
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,380
A'Bao!

429
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,380
Uncle is back!

430
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,380
Uncle is back!

431
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,380
You are back!

432
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,380
You miss me?

433
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,380
Give me a hug.

434
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,380
Brother!

435
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,380
Let's go inside.

436
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,380
Brother, you are back!

437
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,380
You miss me?

438
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,380
Brother, it's good that you are back.

439
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,380
Dad!

440
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,380
Why can't I find your passport?

441
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,380
What are you doing?

442
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,380
Buying a flight ticket.

443
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,380
What happened?

444
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,380
Three cups!

445
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,380
Three cups!

446
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,380
Three cups!

447
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,380
Three cups!

448
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,380
Three cups!

449
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,380
Three cups!

450
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,380
Three cups!

451
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,380
Three cups!

452
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,380
A'Bao, time to eat.

453
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,380
Time to eat!

454
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,380
Hurry up and eat.

455
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,380
Thank you, Mom.

456
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,380
Brother.

457
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,380
A'Bao, eat more.

458
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,380
Brother, eat!

459
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,380
Okay, eat by yourself.

460
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,380
Thank you.

461
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,380
It's good.

462
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,380
It's good.

463
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,380
I'm sorry.

464
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,380
I'm sorry.

465
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,380
Since you are here,

466
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,380
come in and sit for a while.

467
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,380
That's right.

468
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,380
My mom will kick you out even if you come in.

469
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,380
You little kid,

470
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,380
you have no manners.

471
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,380
When you called me a scoundrel,

472
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,380
did you treat me like a kid?

473
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,380
I'm sorry.

474
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,380
I'm the one who got you into trouble.

475
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,380
I didn't expect things to turn out like this.

476
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,380
But now that you brought the police back,

477
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,380
what will the people in the old city think of you?

478
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,380
There's no future.

479
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,380
I will leave.

480
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,380
What about your mom?

481
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,380
What about your brother and sister?

482
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,380
We will leave together.

483
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,380
I will definitely leave.

484
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,380
I will definitely not go to jail.

485
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,380
Otherwise, I will definitely be killed by the people of the hanguilong.

486
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,380
What conditions do you want to propose to the police?

487
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,380
Hello?

488
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,380
A'Wei, what's the situation now?

489
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,380
I don't know.

490
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,380
A'Bao won't say anything.

491
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,380
Dad, Hu Zhao,

492
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,380
are you really leaving?

493
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,380
You decided everything by yourself.

494
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,380
Do we have the right to choose?

495
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,380
Not this time.

496
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,380
We will leave in an hour.

497
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,380
Pack up what you want to take.

498
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,380
That scoundrel judge.

499
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,380
A'Bao,

500
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,380
you know how much the police don't like

501
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,380
the people in the old city.

502
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,380
Do you remember

503
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,380
how they made me unable to be a police?

504
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,380
Do you really think the police

505
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,380
really want you to be a scoundrel?

506
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,380
Believe me,

507
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,380
I will definitely find a way to help you.

508
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,380
If I am caught,

509
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,380
our two families will be finished.

510
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,380
Then,

511
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,380
will I be the only one sacrificed?

512
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,380
It's worth it.

513
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,380
Okay.

514
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,380
In the detention center,

515
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,380
no one was able to sleep.

516
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,380
Did you tell grandma that we are going to Canada?

517
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,380
We will inform her when we arrive.

518
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,380
Why is it so sudden?

519
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,380
Master,

520
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,380
Ma Shan Bao just sent me a message.

521
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,380
She told me to prepare all the documents tomorrow.

522
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,380
I think

523
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,380
she is ready to tell us who the real murderer is.

524
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,380
That's good.

525
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,380
I didn't think we could really succeed.

526
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,380
Thank you, Master.

527
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,380
Okay.

528
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,380
Keep working.

529
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,380
The travel agency

530
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,380
is going on a trip?

531
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,380
It's so late.

532
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,380
We are going on a trip.

533
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,380
Yes, we are going on a trip. It's obvious.

534
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,380
How can I go to school?

535
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,380
I will arrange it.

536
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,380
You always arrange it yourself.

537
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,380
You never tell me anything.

538
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,380
You never discussed it with mom.

539
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,380
Yi Wei,

540
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,380
in the middle of the year,

541
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,380
because of your mom,

542
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,380
I never talked to you seriously.

543
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,380
She is my favorite.

544
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,380
I never thought

545
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,380
she would leave me like this.

546
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,380
This time,

547
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,380
it might be a test for us.

548
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,380
Now, there are only us two left.

549
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,380
We must unite.

550
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,380
Don't question me anymore.

551
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,380
Okay?

552
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,380
Will you never come back?

553
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,380
Yi Wei.

554
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,380
Don't talk to me about mom.

555
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,380
Why did you become like this?

556
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,380
You didn't let me start over.

557
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,380
No, you hit someone.

558
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,380
The police are going to arrest you.

559
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,380
Then let them arrest me.

560
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,380
Yi Wei.

561
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,380
Yi Wei.

562
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,380
Yi Wei.

563
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,380
Yi Wei.

564
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,380
Yi Wei.

565
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,380
Yi Wei.

566
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,380
Yi Wei.

567
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,380
Yi Wei.

568
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,380
Wei Wei.

569
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,380
What's wrong?

570
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,380
What happened?

571
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,380
Where is your dad?

572
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,380
I knew something must happen.

573
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,380
You two never talk about anything.

574
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,380
Grandma.

575
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,380
Can you let me rest?

576
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,380
Don't ask me now.

577
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,380
I won't ask you.

578
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,380
I won't ask you anything.

579
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,380
Come on, get in.

580
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,380
Don't be afraid.

581
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,380
I will always welcome you.

582
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,380
Ma Shan Bao is ready

583
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,380
to tell us who the real murderer is.

584
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,380
Ma Shan Bao.

585
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,380
I'm sorry.

586
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,380
I didn't mean to kill you.

587
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,380
I just wanted to save my son.

588
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,380
Someone told me that

589
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,380
it was the same person.

590
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,380
He said he was the one who hit the murderer.

591
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,380
He said he was the one who hit the murderer.

592
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,380
He said the one who hit the murderer

593
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,380
is called Ma Shan Bao.

594
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,380
He lives in the old town.

595
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,380
Now, there is a police to protect him.

596
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,380
Ma Shan Bao

597
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,380
Qian Yu.

598
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,380
What the hell are you doing?

599
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,380
You didn't answer my phone or go home.

600
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,380
Did YiWei go to your house?

601
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,380
She did.

602
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,380
What happened?

603
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,380
I asked her

604
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,380
but she refused to tell me.

605
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,380
Remember, don't let her leave.

606
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,380
I'll pick her up tomorrow.

607
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,380
Can you stop this?

608
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,380
You won't tell me anything.

609
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,380
When things get serious, I can't help you.

610
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:47,380
I'm telling you, I won't let Lanlan's story repeat itself.

611
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,380
Tomorrow.

612
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,380
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

613
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,380
Remember, don't let Yiwei leave.

614
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,380
She's asleep.

615
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,380
See you tomorrow.

616
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,380
Yiwei.

617
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,380
Uncle.

618
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,380
Uncle.

619
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,380
Go back.

620
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,380
A'bao.

621
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,380
I'm sorry.

622
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,380
I'm sorry.

623
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,380
I'm sorry.

624
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,380
I'm sorry.

625
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,380
I'm sorry.

626
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,380
A'bao.

627
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,380
I won't blame you for this.

628
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,380
You're innocent.

629
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,380
You'll be fine.

630
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,380
I beg you.

631
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,380
Take care of your auntie and cousin.

632
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,380
Uncle.

633
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,380
I won't betray you.

634
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,380
What did you say?

635
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,380
I'll give them a name.

636
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,380
A bad name.

637
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:03,380
Then my mom, brother, and sister will leave.

638
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,380
Don't worry about them.

639
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,380
You're going to lie to them?

640
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,380
Lawyer Zhou said they agreed.

641
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,380
As long as I sign their names at nine,

642
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,380
the plan will start.

643
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,380
Then our family can leave.

644
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,380
I'm sorry.

645
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,380
Hello?

646
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,380
Master.

647
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,380
Why can't you reach your phone?

648
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,380
I'm about to leave.

649
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,380
I hope everything goes well.

650
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,380
Okay.

651
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,380
Be careful.

652
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,380
Judge Jin.

653
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,380
A'bao won't say anything.

654
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,380
Don't worry.

655
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,380
I'm sorry.

656
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,380
I'm sorry.

657
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,380
I'm sorry.

658
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,380
I'm sorry.

659
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,380
I'm sorry.

660
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,380
Xiao Xue.

661
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,380
We bought breakfast.

662
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,380
Where's A'bao?

663
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,380
Brother, don't play here.

664
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,380
Eat something.

665
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,380
Breakfast.

666
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,380
Come.

667
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,380
Eat something.

668
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,380
Come.

669
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,380
Eat this.

670
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,380
Didn't the lawyer say he would come?

671
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,380
He said he would come this morning.

672
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,380
He should be here soon.

673
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,380
I'll get them some.

674
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,380
Let me.

675
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,380
They'll be relieved to see me.

676
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,380
Come.

677
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,380
Eat.

678
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,380
Have some porridge.

679
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,380
Eat.

680
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,380
Come.

681
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,380
Watch out!

682
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,380
Run!

683
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,380
Run!

684
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,380
Run!

685
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,380
Run!

686
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,380
Run!

687
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,380
Watch them.

688
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,380
A'bao!

689
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,380

A'bao!

697
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,380
Don't scare me!

Don't scare me!
