1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,020
Ha!

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

3
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The Man Who Killed the Dragon

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Episode 17

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yesterday I called you for a whole day, but you didn't pick up.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I was here.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But you were in the clinic.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
They are going to sue me for going there regardless of the fact that I hit Han Kuilong's son.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What should I do?

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You just go.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Did you go?

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Did you find the white Benz?

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I went.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But they burned the car last night.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What about Xiaobei?

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Did you talk to her?

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I can't find her.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
She might be too afraid to hide.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The police might sue you for escaping responsibility.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So if you have any evidence to help yourself,

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
don't hide it anymore.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Can I transfer the five witnesses?

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't know what you're afraid of.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But if you can provide clues to the case and reach an agreement with the控方,

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I can help you apply for special protection.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
They can't protect me here.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Unless I can go,

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
the whole family can go together.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
As long as I'm in Haogang for a day,

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can't lose anything.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Lao Wen.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I just met Ma Shanbao.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He wants to talk to the控方.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Does he want to admit to the car accident?

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He wants to transfer the five witnesses.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Who does he want to testify?

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If you can give him and his family enough protection,

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
he will tell the truth.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What truth?

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He will tell the truth about the accident.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So he didn't tell you who the murderer was?

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Ma Shanbao is very afraid now.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He doesn't believe anyone, including me.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why do you believe someone who doesn't believe you?

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Because I have confidence in Ma Shanbao.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I know he wants to say that he is an important person that no one can touch.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's why he is so afraid.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Qi Changrong?

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't know.

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But if it's him,

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't think it's an accident.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Who is the chief judge?

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Zhang Jian. Zhang Songshan.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Zhang Songshan.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Zhang Songshan is from the old town district.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This will be his weakness.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You mean...

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
People in the old town district never want to cooperate with the police.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
When have you seen a five-point witness from the old town district?

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Talk to his son.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Tell him that he will pay three years' living expenses to his family.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He will help Ma Shanbao immigrate to the city.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Will Zhang Jian accept this condition?

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Does this have anything to do with the old town district?

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You have such a big condition.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He will believe that there is a big tiger behind you.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That's why he has this value.

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If Zhang Songshan really becomes the chief judge of this case,

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
he will tell others that the old town district can have such a chief judge.

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But will Zhang Jian believe me?

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Only because the newcomers dare to make such a condition,

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
they will believe in its value.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So my next step is to make Zhang Jian believe that

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
if Ma Shanbao wants to tell the truth,

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
he must accept his condition.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This is a golden opportunity.

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's the only way to help Ma Shanbao.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank you, Master.

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Hurry up.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hurry up.

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Stop the car.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Luo Wei, are you really welcoming your good friend like this?

96
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Madam,

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Lawyer Zhou is here.

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Sit.

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Sit.

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You insisted that your client wasn't there.

103
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Isn't Zhang Jian here yet?

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Didn't we meet at 11 o'clock?

105
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Zhang Jian just called.

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He said that there was a traffic jam at the court.

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You used to be a real leader.

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Now you are in this kind of trouble.

109
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You feed four people at a time.

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Say it quickly.

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
How much can this kind of trouble earn at a time?

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's not as much as you kill people and set fire.

113
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes.

114
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So, 200,000 is not a small amount for you.

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You took out such a big sum of money.

116
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It must be hard.

117
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
A Bao called you uncle.

118
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Sasha and her mother are sisters.

119
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is your family business.

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But now Daxiong is being played around and killed.

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I am their boss.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I have to come out and help my brothers.

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Now Han Gang is in a coma.

124
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Daxiong is injured.

125
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's too late for me and Han Kuilong to fight.

126
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But now there are so many troubles because of A Bao.

127
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I asked her mother.

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You called A Bao out that night.

129
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Say it.

130
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You called A Bao out.

131
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Say it.

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What did you call her out for?

133
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Where did the 200,000 come from?

134
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Who are you going to cover up?

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Don't say it.

136
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It doesn't matter if you don't say it.

137
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This matter has nothing to do with you.

138
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
How is it going?

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's simple.

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
To kill Han Kuilong, it's not enough to kill a few people and a few guns.

141
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You need some big guys to win.

142
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
For the sake of Sasha and her two children,

143
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
you can help me.

144
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You have to help yourself.

145
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's a good idea.

146
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Zhang Jian, please.

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Zhang Jian.

148
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Zhang Jian.

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The case was very good this morning.

151
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I was blocking the car.

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's okay.

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Is Zhou Wenluo a lawyer?

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Please say it.

155
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's Zhou Luowen.

156
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay, Zhou Lawyer.

157
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Take your time and get into the right track.

158
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
My client wants to make a deal.

159
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He's willing to admit his crime, right?

160
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He wants to turn into a false witness.

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But he's the only defendant in the case.

162
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The police have no direct evidence to prove that my client stole a car and caused a traffic accident.

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Based on the suspicion of the defendant,

164
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
the court may be able to prove it without any charges.

165
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But if my client is willing to tell the truth of the car accident,

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
it will save the judicial resources and benefit both parties.

167
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You insisted that Ma Shanbao was not there.

168
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Now you suddenly say he knows the truth.

169
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What do you mean?

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I can tell you one more thing.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This car accident may not be an accident.

172
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You mean the victim was a victim of a fraud?

173
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't rule out this possibility.

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This is the request I made to my client.

175
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
If you agree, he will tell the truth.

176
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh, he's a big family.

177
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
He needs a family and a living expenses.

178
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Qi Changrong's family has been living in Jiucheng District for a long time.

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
No one dares to be a false witness.

180
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Because they don't dare to cooperate with the police.

181
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's their tradition.

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The police should know this.

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What can a thief know?

184
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Ma Shanbao grew up in Jiucheng District.

185
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
He is Qi Changrong's man.

186
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Lawyer Zhou, right?

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You said you are familiar with Jiucheng District.

189
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Do you know the difference between the people in Jiucheng District and Qi Changrong?

190
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
This case is your first case of your own independence, right?

191
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I appreciate your courage.

192
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But you can't be so greedy, you know?

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You are so capable because of my limited resources.

194
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You can't be so urgent as a lawyer.

195
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
If you say something, you will choke to death.

196
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Zhang Jian, you are also from Jiucheng District.

197
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What?

198
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What did you say?

199
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Who said I'm from Jiucheng District?

200
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You are not.

201
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Zhang Jian grew up abroad.

202
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He came back after graduation.

203
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
My identity should not be part of the negotiation.

204
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't think it's necessary to continue.

205
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Lawyer Zhou Luowen, right?

206
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'll send her out first.

208
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Hello, how is it going?

209
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm done.

210
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Zhang Jian is not from Jiucheng District at all.

211
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
No, you have seen his information.

212
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
His parents are all from Jiucheng District.

213
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What happened?

214
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He is very sensitive to the three words Jiucheng District.

215
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He doesn't let me continue.

216
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Don't be afraid, there must be a way.

217
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Jiucheng District.

218
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You don't know how many years I spent to take off this hat.

219
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Zhang Jian doesn't have to argue with the newcomers.

220
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Zhang Jian is a good man.

221
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Transferred to a false witness

222
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and even wants the whole family to immigrate abroad.

223
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Where did he come from to be so confident?

224
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
According to the original criminal charge.

225
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Zhang Jian,

226
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
look at this report first.

227
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What is this?

228
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The DNA report that was tested on the spot.

229
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You show me now.

230
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I just received it.

231
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I was going to give it to you as soon as you came.

232
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I didn't expect Lawyer Zhou to arrive very early.

233
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
There are two DNA samples on this.

234
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The first one is the same.

235
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
One is from the burglary on the ground.

236
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The other one is on the sprayer of the laughing.

237
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I believe it's from the real murderer.

238
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It should be that he was too nervous when he was committing the crime.

239
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Causing the burglary.

240
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Wait.

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's not compatible with Ma Shanbao's DNA?

242
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We should really have found the wrong person.

243
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And the police have no reason to continue to keep him.

244
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
His lawyer doesn't know about this report.

245
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Only we know about it.

246
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
He is still in front of the Tang Ducha.

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He is making fun of me for being greedy.

248
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Do you think he is just trying to sell me out?

249
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's their usual way to get your confidence.

250
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Have you proposed any conditions?

251
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Did they respond?

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What is the bottom line?

253
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I didn't say the bottom line.

254
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Zhang Jian just refused.

255
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
This means that Ma Shanbao will continue to stay.

256
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Wait a minute.

257
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Tang Ducha just sent me a message.

258
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He asked me to go back and continue to talk.

259
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Did you ask why?

260
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
No.

261
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Remember.

262
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Unless they agree to all the conditions.

263
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Otherwise, you don't have to talk.

264
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Keep your bottom line.

265
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I understand.

266
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Lawyer Zhou.

267
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You did have a point just now.

268
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You deviated from the theme.

269
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But fortunately, Zhang Jian is reasonable.

270
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
He is willing to give you another chance.

271
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I understand.

272
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm sorry about that.

273
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Enough.

274
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Ma Shanbao's request can be discussed.

275
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But there is a precondition.

276
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I must know how much he is going to reveal the truth.

277
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Who is the one who is going to hurt people?

278
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Because he never mentioned it.

279
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I need to ask for the consent of my client before I can answer you.

280
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You can call him now.

281
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I have my own phone number.

282
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What do you think?

283
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I believe someone behind him will teach him how to do it.

284
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's not like he is a newcomer.

285
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
He can do it.

286
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Then let's see how capable he is.

287
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What tricks can he do?

288
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
How about it?

289
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
They want to know who the real murderer is.

290
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
This is your card.

291
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If you reveal it too soon, you won't have any chance to negotiate.

292
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Tell them that your client doesn't agree.

293
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Roger.

294
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
My client doesn't agree.

295
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
If I ask him to meet me at the detention center, I can make him agree.

296
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I give you one day.

297
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
We can talk here tomorrow.

298
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I have one more request.

299
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I want to talk to you.

300
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I have one more request.

301
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What is it?

302
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I will apply to the court to let my client go home and accept the police's home detention.

303
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Although you said it would be dangerous outside, it is not safe in the detention center.

304
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
My client wants to go home and see his family.

305
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
If I satisfy his condition, I will have confidence to convince him.

306
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
At the same time, I need Zhang Jian to support my application in court.

307
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I will go back and prepare the information for the court.

308
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Thank you.

309
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
This is the only chance to find the real murderer.

310
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Stop the two gangs from fighting.

311
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
If you don't mind, Zhang Jian...

312
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Actually, I don't mind.

313
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I will follow the procedure.

314
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Thank you.

315
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Okay.

316
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I am sorry.

317
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Isn't it time to go home?

318
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Why are you back?

319
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Can we talk?

320
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Psychological counseling...

321
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
They can't help me.

322
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I am sorry.

323
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I can't help you.

324
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Coach.

325
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I know drinking is a burden to you.

326
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But I am really grateful that you were there with me.

327
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I will give it to you.

328
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I am sorry.

329
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
No need.

330
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Just take care of yourself.

331
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Qin Wei.

332
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Qi Changrong knew that I gave money to A'bao.

333
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
He put this matter on my head.

334
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
He even took my wife.

335
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He even took my wife and child to threaten me.

336
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
He asked me to help him to grab a batch of weapons.

337
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You won't agree to it, will you?

338
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Do I have the right to choose?

339
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Is there really no other way?

340
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We have a bigger problem now.

341
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
A'bao is going to be a false witness.

342
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Who told you that?

343
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Lawyer Zhao said that A'bao hasn't said it yet.

344
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
As soon as he speaks, he will tell us.

345
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You have one night to persuade A'bao to change his mind.

346
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
A'bao is now being held alone.

347
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I can't even see him.

348
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
How can I persuade him?

349
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You will let him go later.

350
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Accept the police's restraints.

351
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The relationship between the控方 and the court has been agreed.

352
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Tonight is the last night.

353
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Tonight is the last chance.

354
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I will go back and discuss with my wife.

355
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We are in trouble.

356
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Don't involve him anymore.

357
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What should I do?

358
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
If you really find him,

359
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
tell him that the police don't have any evidence.

360
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
As long as he passes this level, I can think of a way.

361
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Tell him to change his mind when he meets Lawyer Zhao.

362
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And keep silent.

363
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
In the end, you are afraid that something will happen to you.

364
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What am I afraid of?

365
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I don't want to let go of the guards.

366
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Even if the police really arrest people, they won't take the guards away.

367
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I won't let him go to jail.

368
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You are going to run away like this?

369
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You treat your friend like this?

370
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I don't treat you as a friend.

371
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I won't ask you to find A Bao.

372
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I am helping you and everyone.

373
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Do we want to run away?

374
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It depends on whether you can shut A Bao up.

375
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You can go home tonight.

376
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Really?

377
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's the police's home.

378
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
But at least you can go home and see your mother and brother.

379
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What are their conditions?

380
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Who is the real murderer?

381
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What about my requirements?

382
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What about the money?

383
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Where will our family go?

384
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The real murderer has preconditions.

385
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
If the truth is convincing, they will start a false witness plan.

386
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
How about this?

387
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'll let you think about it.

388
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You can discuss it with your mother when you get home.

389
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I can really go home tonight?

390
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
But the deadline is tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.

391
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You must say the name of the real murderer.

392
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Otherwise they will arrest you immediately.

393
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And then there will be no false witness plan.

394
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Because they will think you don't believe them.

395
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Mother, brother is back.

396
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Brother is back.

397
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Look, brother is back.

398
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Brother is back.

399
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Look, brother is back.

400
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Brother is back.

401
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Can you untie the handcuffs?

402
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Don't let his brother and sister see it.

403
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Untie it.

404
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I can do it.

405
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I hope you will keep your promise.

406
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
A'Bao.

407
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Brother is back.

408
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Brother is back.

409
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Brother is back.

410
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Brother, you miss me?

411
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Give me a hug.

412
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You are so brave.

413
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Brother is back.

414
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Brother is back.

415
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Brother, you are back.

416
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Brother, you miss me?

417
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Brother, you are back.

418
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Brother is back.

419
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Dad.

420
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Why I can't find your passport?

421
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
What are you going to do?

422
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Buy a ticket.

423
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
What happened?

424
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
3 cups.

425
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
3 cups.

426
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
A'Bao, time to eat.

427
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Time to eat.

428
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Come on.

429
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Thanks mom.

430
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Brother.

431
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Come on.

432
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
A'Bao, eat more.

433
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Brother, eat.

434
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Thank you.

435
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Delicious.

436
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Delicious.

437
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Delicious.

438
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Since you are here,

439
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
come in and sit for a while.

440
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Right.

441
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
My mom will kick me out

442
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
if I come in.

443
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Little kid, you are so rude.

444
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
When you told me to do the dirty work,

445
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
did you treat me as a kid?

446
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I got you into trouble.

447
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I didn't expect it to be like this.

448
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
But now you bring the police back.

449
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
What will the people in the old city think of you?

450
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
There is no future.

451
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I will leave.

452
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
What about your mom?

453
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
What about your brother and sister?

454
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
We will leave together.

455
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I can't go to jail.

456
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Otherwise I will be killed by the people of Han Kuilong.

457
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
What do you want to say to the police?

458
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Hello.

459
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Wei, what's going on?

460
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I don't know.

461
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
A'Bao doesn't want to say anything.

462
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Dad.

463
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
The passport.

464
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Are you really leaving?

465
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You decide everything by yourself.

466
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Do we have the right to choose?

467
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Not this time.

468
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
We will leave in an hour.

469
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Pack up your things.

470
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
That bastard judge.

471
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
A'Bao.

472
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You know how much the police don't like

473
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
the people in the old city.

474
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Do you remember how they

475
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
made me a police?

476
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Do you really think the police

477
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
really want you to be a witness?

478
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Believe me.

479
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I will find a way to help you.

480
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
If I am caught,

481
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
our family will be ruined.

482
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Then I will be the only one

483
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
who will be sacrificed.

484
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It's worth it.

485
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm tired.

486
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
In the prison,

487
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
no one sleeps.

488
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Did you tell grandma

489
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
we were going to Canada?

490
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Not until we arrived.

491
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Why so suddenly?

492
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Master.

493
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Ma Shanbao just sent me a message.

494
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
He told me to prepare all the documents tomorrow.

495
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I think he is ready

496
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
to tell us who the real murderer is.

497
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
That's good.

498
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I didn't expect

499
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
we could succeed.

500
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Thank you, master.

501
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Okay. Keep working.

502
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Travel agency.

503
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Just take it as a trip.

504
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's so late.

505
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
We are going to run away.

506
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Yes, we are running away. It's obvious.

507
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
How can I go to school?

508
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You still have to work?

509
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I will arrange it again.

510
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You always arrange it yourself.

511
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You don't tell me anything.

512
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You didn't discuss with mom.

513
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yiwei.

514
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
In the past half year,

515
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
because of your mom,

516
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I didn't talk to you seriously.

517
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
She is my favorite.

518
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I didn't expect

519
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
she would leave me like this.

520
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
This time,

521
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
maybe it's a test for us.

522
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Now there are only us two left.

523
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
We must unite.

524
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Don't question me.

525
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Don't question me again.

526
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Okay?

527
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Will you never come back?

528
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Yiwei.

529
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Don't talk about mom with me.

530
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Why did you become like this?

531
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You didn't let me start over.

532
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
No, you hit someone.

533
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
The police will arrest you.

534
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Then they will arrest me.

535
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Yiwei.

536
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yiwei.

537
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Yiwei.

538
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Weiwei.

539
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
What's wrong?

540
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
What happened?

541
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Where is your dad?

542
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I knew something must happen.

543
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You two don't want to say anything.

544
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Grandma.

545
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Can you let me rest?

546
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Don't ask me now.

547
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I won't ask you.

548
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I won't ask you anything.

549
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Come on, go in first.

550
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Don't be afraid.

551
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I will always welcome you here.

552
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Come on.

553
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Ma Shanbao is ready to tell you

554
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
who the real murderer is.

555
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Ma Shanbao.

556
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I'm sorry.

557
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I didn't mean to kill you.

558
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I just want to save my son.

559
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Someone is trying to kill me.

560
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's the same person.

561
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Someone hit the man who just got hurt.

562
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
His name is Ma Shanbao.

563
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
He lives in the old town.

564
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Now the police are protecting him.

565
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Jin Yu.

566
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
What are you doing?

567
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You didn't answer my call.

568
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You're not at home.

569
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Did Yiwei go to your place?

570
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
She's here.

571
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
What happened between you two?

572
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I asked her, but she refused to tell me anything.

573
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Remember.

574
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Don't let her leave.

575
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
She's at your place.

576
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Don't let her leave.

577
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You're not her uncle.

578
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You're not her auntie.

579
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Remember.

580
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Don't let her leave.

581
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I'll pick her up tomorrow.

582
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Can you stop?

583
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You won't tell me anything.

584
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
When things get serious, I can't help you.

585
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm telling you.

586
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I won't let Lanlan's story repeat.

587
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Tomorrow.

588
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

589
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Remember.

590
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Don't let Yiwei leave.

591
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
She's asleep.

592
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
See you tomorrow.

593
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I'll pick her up tomorrow.

594
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Don't let her leave.

595
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I'll pick her up tomorrow.

596
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Don't let Yiwei leave.

597
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

598
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'll pick her up tomorrow.

599
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Don't let Yiwei leave.

600
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

601
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

602
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

603
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

604
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

605
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

606
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

607
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Go.

608
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Go.

609
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Go.

610
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Go.

611
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Uncle.

612
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Uncle.

613
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Uncle.

614
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Uncle.

615
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Leave now.

616
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Okay.

617
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
A'bao, I won't blame you for this.

618
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You are innocent.

619
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You will be fine.

620
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I beg you for one thing.

621
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Take care of your aunt and cousin for me.

622
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Uncle.

623
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I won't betray you.

624
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
What did you say?

625
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I will give them a name.

626
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
A bad name.

627
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Then my mom, brother and sister will leave here.

628
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Don't be afraid of them.

629
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You are going to lie to them?

630
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Can you do it?

631
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Lawyer Zhou said they have agreed.

632
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
As long as I sign their name at nine o'clock,

633
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
the plan of the false witness will start.

634
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Then our family can leave here.

635
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Phone ringing.

636
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Hello.

637
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Master, why can't you reach your phone?

638
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I am going now.

639
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I hope everything goes well.

640
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Ok.

641
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Be careful.

642
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Phone ringing.

643
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Listen to the message.

644
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Judge Qin.

645
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
A'bao won't say anything.

646
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Don't worry.

647
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It's off.

648
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
What day is next week?

649
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
What day is next week?

650
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
That happens to me.

651
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
The brush shop is close to the borders.

652
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
How could they let you go?

653
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Xue, we bought breakfast.

654
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Where's A Bao?

655
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Brother, don't play here.

656
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Come on, eat something.

657
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Let's have breakfast.

658
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Come on.

659
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Let's have breakfast.

660
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Come on, put it here.

661
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Eat this.

662
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Didn't the lawyer say he would come?

663
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
He said he would come this morning.

664
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
He should be here soon.

665
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I'll get some for them.

666
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Let me do it.

667
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
They will be more relieved to see me not running away.

668
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Come on.

669
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Eat it.

670
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Have some porridge.

671
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Eat some.

672
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Thank you.

673
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Come on.

674
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Watch out!

675
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Run for them.

676
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Run!

677
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Run!

678
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Run!

679
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Run!

680
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
You watch them.

681
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
A Bao!

682
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
A Bao!

683
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
A Bao!

684
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
A Bao!

685
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
A Bao!

686
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
A Bao!

687
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
A Bao!

688
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
A Bao, are you okay?

689
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
A Bao!

690
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Don't scare me!

691
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
A Bao!

692
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Don't do this!

693
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
A Bao!

694
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Wake up, A Bao!

695
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Don't scare me!

696
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
A Bao!

697
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
A Bao!

698
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Wake up, A Bao!

699
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Don't wake him up!

700
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Don't do this to me!

701
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Don't do this to me!

702
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I'm begging you, don't do this to me!

703
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I'm begging you!

704
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Don't do this to me!

705
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Don't do this to me!

706
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Don't do this to me!

707
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Don't do this to me!

708
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Don't do this to me!

709
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Don't do this to me!
