1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
In order to avoid the re-examination of Ma Shanbao's case,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
he is alone in the prison, and blocked the news.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's to ensure Qin Yivei's

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
necessary safety measures.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It can only be kept a secret for a while.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
As long as this case goes to court,

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
it will be exposed.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
By then,

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Han Kuilong will know that

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Qin Yivei almost killed his son.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I suggest that from now on,

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
everyone can cancel the vacation.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Find someone to keep an eye on Han Lie and Qi Changlong for 24 hours.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Why should I keep an eye on him?

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
People like Qi Changlong

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
like to be in the middle of a mess,

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
fearing that the world will be in chaos.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Officer Qin,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
you can talk to him in private.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Call me after you're done.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay, thank you.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yivei,

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
are you okay?

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Are you okay?

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not okay.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But I can hold on.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Dad,

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
don't argue with grandma.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If I get like this,

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
she will be sad.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Grandma gave it to me.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I couldn't find it all the time.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It was with you.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yivei,

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
don't be afraid.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
First of all, you are the first offender.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You took the initiative to turn yourself in.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And it was an accident.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not afraid of you.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not afraid of you.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But I am afraid of you.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll take the risk.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I won't be afraid of you.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Dad,

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
it's not an accident.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What did you say?

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I did it on purpose to pretend to be that scumbag.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
On purpose?

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I did it for my mom.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Mom?

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I said I knew why mom would kill herself.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Mom,

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Nope.

110
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's fine.

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Sir.

119
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Aten days had them OP move.

120
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Less than the first time.

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But...

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Aten days.

123
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,760
because he knew your dream.

124
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,360
You were afraid that Han Guilong would go to jail,

125
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,400
so you raped him.

126
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
I raped my mother.

127
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,600
Calm down.

128
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,200
It's okay.

129
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,960
It's okay.

130
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,640
Louder.

131
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,600
Look at me.

132
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,280
My name is Han Kang.

133
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,680
My father's name is Han Guilong.

134
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,760
Remember to tell your father.

135
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,920
Remember me.

136
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,160
You can hit me whenever you want.

137
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,080
Bye.

138
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,680
I will never forget

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,320
how you were.

140
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,760
Bye.

141
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,480
It's okay.

142
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,280
It's okay.

143
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,560
I'm fine.

144
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,040
He didn't want me to call the police.

145
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,320
He didn't want to hurt you.

146
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,520
So he didn't want anyone to know.

147
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,200
But the next day,

148
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,400
he couldn't care about his own suicide.

149
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,880
I'm so angry.

150
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,680
I hate myself.

151
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,600
I met him on the street.

152
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,000
He was wearing his mother's necklace.

153
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,040
I drove to follow him.

154
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,720
I want him dead.

155
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,440
I want revenge.

156
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,600
Yes.

157
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,160
ac something Let you beat your head Oh shit

158
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,760
be what What do I want to do

159
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,960
Marry me

160
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,520
then

161
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,120
afraid to ask

162
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,640
you

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,400
I'm afraid of losing you.

164
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,400
You really can't push it this time?

165
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,400
Because that judge of the primordial god suddenly got sick.

166
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,800
If I don't take it,

167
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,200
the case will be postponed.

168
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
But the defense has opinions.

169
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
I can't push it.

170
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,600
But that Han Black Panther,

171
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,200
they really have great power.

172
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,600
I know what you're worried about.

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
I can't back down because I'm afraid.

174
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,200
I have to tell everyone

175
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,800
that nothing can be done legally.

176
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
How is it? Is it good?

177
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,800
Dad, catch it.

178
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
It's my turn. Come on.

179
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Let's eat.

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Honey.

181
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,800
Sit.

182
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,600
Dad,

183
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
we'll go to the competition next week.

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,400
We'll wear blue.

185
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,600
Mom will wear red.

186
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Weiwei,

187
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,800
do you know that your dad

188
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,000
is reviewing a very important case recently?

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Again?

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,800
When will dad stop reviewing cases?

191
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Here's the thing.

192
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,600
Because this case is more complicated.

193
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,800
It takes a long time to review a Black Panther boss.

194
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,400
The case is complicated.

195
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,600
So this time, our trip...

196
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Dad,

197
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
you're a judge.

198
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,000
You always say something that doesn't count.

199
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,000
You suggested the competition.

200
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
What do you mean?

201
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Besides the case,

202
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,600
it doesn't matter if it's me or mom.

203
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,600
How about we wait for them to come next time?

204
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Or we'll wait for your dad to take a vacation.

205
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,200
We'll go abroad.

206
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,600
We'll fly there, okay?

207
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
You go by yourself.

208
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Weiwei.

209
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Ignore him.

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,200
The most important thing is

211
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,600
if you think so too.

212
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,800
I'm not a kid.

213
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,400
Don't worry.

214
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,800
I'll be fine after I coax him.

215
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
After I review this case,

216
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
I'll apply for a vacation.

217
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,400
We'll go on a trip together.

218
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,800
We'll have a sweet vacation.

219
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay.

220
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,200
Let's go camping.

221
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Weiwei likes it.

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let's eat first.

223
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Honey.

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What's wrong, honey?

225
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Honey.

226
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
Why are you so cold?

227
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,800
Honey.

228
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Why are you so cold?

229
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Why are you so cold?

230
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
What's wrong?

231
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
What's wrong?

232
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,200
What's wrong?

233
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,600
Mom.

234
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,200
Why are you so cold?

235
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Why are you so cold?

236
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Weiwei.

237
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Bring the quilt here.

238
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,400
Your mom is very cold.

239
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,200
Hurry up.

240
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,800
Hurry up.

241
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,600
Bring the quilt here.

242
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Help her.

243
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Help your mom.

244
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,400
Honey.

245
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,600
You're cold.

246
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,400
Your mom is cold.

247
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,600
Honey.

248
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,000
Honey.

249
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,600
No.

250
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,200
Honey.

251
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,000
Honey, no.

252
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,400
No, honey.

253
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No.

254
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
No.

255
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
No.

256
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No.

257
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
No.

258
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
No.

259
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
No.

260
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
No.

261
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
No.

262
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
No.

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
No.

264
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No.

265
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No.

266
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No.

267
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
No.

268
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No.

269
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
No.

270
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
No.

271
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No.

272
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No.

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No.

No.

276
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No.

277
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
No.

278
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000

No.

285
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
No.

286
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No.

287
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No.

288
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
No.

289
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No.

290
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
No.

291
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
No.

292
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
No.

293
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No.

294
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No.

295
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
No.

296
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No.

302
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000

315
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
No.

318
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
No.

319
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
No.

321
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
No.

322
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
No.

323
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
No.

324
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
No.

325
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
No.

326
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
No.

327
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
No.

328
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
No.

329
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
No.

330
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
No.

331
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No.

332
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
No.

333
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
No.

334
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000

335
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
No.

338
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No.

339
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The police station in the district.

340
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,240
Even if you're in jail,

341
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,440
the news is so clear.

342
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,280
As long as there's someone

343
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,600
and money,

344
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,960
what news can't be bought?

345
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,680
When the court sentences him to jail,

346
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,960
I promise he'll live to the day he's out of prison.

347
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,480
Only I can judge

348
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,000
who killed my son.

349
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,640
I'll sentence him to death.

350
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,360
Okay.

351
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,440
I'll arrange it.

352
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,480
How's your brother's recovery?

353
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,360
He's fine.

354
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,480
Yesterday, he asked me if I could

355
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,160
arrange two cows to serve him.

356
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,480
I guess he'll recover soon.

357
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'll wait for him.

358
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,480
Lin.

359
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,000
You can do it.

360
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
Our Han family

361
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,360
will depend on you two in the future.

362
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,000
I know, boss.

363
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,040
Get in.

364
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,880
Squat down.

365
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,000
Squat down. Don't move.

366
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,760
I'll leave this to you.

367
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,560
They're all kids.

368
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,160
Okay.

369
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,400
Sit properly.

370
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,240
What's your attitude?

371
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,760
Be polite.

372
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,400
Sit properly.

373
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,520
Who's our boss?

374
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,720
None of your business.

375
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,760
What's going on here?

376
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,320
What are you doing, sir?

377
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,360
Why did you arrest me?

378
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,920
You're arrested.

379
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,160
You're in a prison.

380
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,920
You have an attack weapon.

381
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,880
Are you arrested?

382
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,880
Sit properly.

383
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,320
Or I'll tell the police.

384
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,640
Hello.

385
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,320
Yes.

386
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,200
Wait.

387
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
I'll bring the message to you.

388
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,520
Okay.

389
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,080
My phone is broken.

390
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,600
You're so ungrateful.

391
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,640
How dare you steal in the capital?

392
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,560
Keep your eyes closed.

393
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,920
Luckily, he didn't steal your gun.

394
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,800
Okay. Thank you.

395
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,360
Hu Ze.

396
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,200
Do you know that the outside is so chaotic?

397
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,320
It's all planned.

398
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,640
Someone is really trying to attack us.

399
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,000
Their purpose is to arrest Qin Yiwei.

400
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,160
All the newly arrested criminals

401
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,120
can't stay here.

402
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,960
I've asked the Western Bureau

403
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,800
for help.

404
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,560
They accepted our criminals.

405
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,160
At the same time, God approved it.

406
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,440
He said if there were too many people,

407
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,720
they could be transferred to the prison

408
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,280
as temporary residence.

409
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,120
It's a tough battle.

410
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,520
We can't let them win.

411
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,200
Boss.

412
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,720
He was really slow.

413
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,280
Be careful.

414
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,120
You run faster than me.

415
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,840
Okay.

416
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,040
Go back.

417
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,040
Be careful.

418
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,440
Slow down.

419
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,440
Come.

420
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,480
abisrize.

421
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,520
I'll give you half an hour to take a shower.

422
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,320
Master Gao, what's wrong with you?

423
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,960
You...

424
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,600
Master Gao, are you okay?

425
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,520
Get lost!

426
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
Get lost!

427
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Get lost!

428
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Master Gao, are you okay?

429
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
Get lost!

430
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Get lost!

431
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
Get lost!

432
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
Master Gao,

433
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
Master Gao,

434
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,280
this is the hospital.

435
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,360
Yes, this is the hospital.

436
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
Hey,

437
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,160
how about this?

438
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,400
Help me get a girl in.

439
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,800
Just pretend to be a nurse.

440
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Mr. Li is looking for me.

441
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,360
Hey,

442
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
take care of the coach.

443
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,880
No need.

444
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,440
Take them away.

445
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,280
Let's go.

446
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,480
Don't be so impatient.

447
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,360
Hey, Luo Qiang.

448
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
I want two girls.

449
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
I want to see Luo Qiang.

450
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Luo Qiang?

451
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Luo Qiang?

452
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
Luo Qiang?

453
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
Luo Qiang?

454
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
Luo Qiang?

455
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Luo Qiang?

456
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Luo Qiang?

457
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
Luo Qiang?

458
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Luo Qiang?

459
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
Luo Qiang?

460
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Luo Qiang?

461
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Luo Qiang?

462
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Luo Qiang?

463
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Luo Qiang?

464
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
Luo Qiang?

465
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Luo Qiang?

466
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Luo Qiang?

467
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
Luo Qiang?

468
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
Luo Qiang?

469
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Luo Qiang?

470
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
Luo Qiang?

471
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Luo Qiang?

472
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Luo Qiang?

473
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
Luo Qiang?

474
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
Luo Qiang?

475
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Luo Qiang?

476
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Luo Qiang?

477
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
Luo Qiang?

478
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Luo Qiang?

479
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Luo Qiang?

480
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Luo Qiang?

481
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Luo Qiang?

482
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
Luo Qiang?

483
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
Luo Qiang?

484
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Luo Qiang?

485
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
Luo Qiang?

486
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Luo Qiang?

487
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
Luo Qiang?

488
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
Luo Qiang?

489
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Luo Qiang?

490
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Luo Qiang?

491
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
Luo Qiang?

492
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
Luo Qiang?

493
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
Luo Qiang?

494
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
Luo Qiang?

495
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
Luo Qiang?

496
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,880
Luo Qiang?

497
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,880
Luo Qiang?

498
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
Luo Qiang?

499
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Luo Qiang?

500
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,880
Luo Qiang?

501
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Luo Qiang?

502
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Luo Qiang?

503
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Luo Qiang?

504
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,880
Luo Qiang?

505
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Luo Qiang?

506
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
Luo Qiang?

507
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Luo Qiang?

508
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Luo Qiang?

509
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
Luo Qiang?

510
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
Luo Qiang?

511
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
Luo Qiang?

512
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
Luo Qiang?

513
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Luo Qiang?

514
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,880
All right.

515
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
Hurry.

516
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
Hurry.

517
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
Let's wait here.

518
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,880
Take these away.

519
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Hurry up.

520
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Don't let everything pass.

521
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,880
Come on.

522
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Come on.

523
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Round off the phone and answer.

524
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
Get your hands off.

525
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,880
I told you before.

526
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
guitar

527
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,540
Li Wan strange

528
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,800
Let go.

529
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,800
Congratulations.

530
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,480
This is your trick to lure the snake out of the hole, right?

531
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,280
Wait.

532
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,480
Tell me about it.

533
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,080
It's very simple.

534
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,280
Since they can't send people in,

535
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,680
they can only use the people who were locked up here to do it.

536
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,880
I've checked.

537
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,480
The people who were locked up here before,

538
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,080
there are two people waiting in the court.

539
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,480
The probability is the highest.

540
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,880
Because they are all from the Han Kui Long.

541
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,880
And one of them,

542
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,280
after Qin Yi Wei went in,

543
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,680
called him.

544
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,280
Then he told our men that he had a stomachache.

545
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,880
He must go to the toilet.

546
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,680
I just followed the flow and let him go to the toilet.

547
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,680
You mean you let Qin Yi Wei in and forced him to do it?

548
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
That's right.

549
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Amazing.

550
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,280
He didn't send Qin Yi Wei to the court for a day.

551
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,680
Our mission is not over yet.

552
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,080
So I mean,

553
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,680
you still want to work hard like Mai?

554
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,080
I want to work hard, Hu San Er.

555
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,480
Wait.

556
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,480
I really have a question for you.

557
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,680
Is the prisoner really having a stomachache or not?

558
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,080
Go to the toilet yourself.

559
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,880
Lin Shao.

560
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,480
The money for the family expenses of the brothers who were caught today are already settled.

561
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,080
What about A Li's?

562
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,980
He's hoping to live a life of

563
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,480
money and a house for his family.

564
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,080
It's worth it to exchange Qin Yi Wei's life.

565
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,480
Hello.

566
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,080
Lin Shao, A Li made a mistake.

567
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Lin Shao, A Li made a mistake.

568
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,680
It's only a matter of time.

569
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,080
Wait until he's locked up in prison,

570
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,480
then slowly ask him.

571
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,880
deaths they radiate artists

572
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
Sir! belong!

573
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,880
flora has been placed

574
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,020
Okay, we'll call you later.

575
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,820
Trust me.

576
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,700
Lady Qi.

577
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,820
Recently,

578
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,020
I have heard the quick rotten dough of the party

579
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,380
system confused you incarnate-

580
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:50,600
what is necessary as vai

581
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,520
would have been able to Lepruch

582
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,920
I don't think you need to report to Judge Qin.

583
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,320
If something happens to him, who will be responsible?

584
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,120
Why would your son take this last step to jail?

585
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,920
Whose responsibility is it?

586
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,720
Maybe you should think about it yourself.

587
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,320
Giving up is a act of regret and willingness to take responsibility.

588
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,320
The judge will take the punishment as an excuse.

589
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,320
Plus, in your university, many teachers and classmates wrote a petition letter.

590
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,120
So the punishment should be one year.

591
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,120
If you perform well, you will be released soon.

592
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,120
Judge, the defendant Qin Yiwei,

593
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,520
after the accident, went away without a care.

594
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,920
He died after being killed.

595
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,120
The court here is requesting the judge

596
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,720
to make a case of escape from the law of road traffic.

597
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,520
The crime is set.

598
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,920
And according to the actual damage he caused,

599
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,120
he will be punished severely.

600
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,320
What is the reply from the defense?

601
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,520
Judge, first of all, I represent my client.

602
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,720
I sincerely apologize to the victim in the accident.

603
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,320
The accident was caused by a car collision.

604
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,120
My client was extremely panic and caused a miscarriage.

605
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,520
So he made a wrong choice.

606
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,120
He felt very regretful afterwards.

607
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,120
He felt very sad every day.

608
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,920
He finally couldn't bear the condemnation of his conscience

609
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,120
and went to the police station to turn himself in.

610
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,920
He hoped to make up for all his mistakes

611
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,720
and take his responsibility.

612
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,920
The defendant's condemnation is definitely worth it.

613
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,520
But I must remind the defendant that

614
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,720
escaping from the responsibility

615
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,720
caused irreparable damage to the victim.

616
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,720
Judge, half a year ago,

617
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,320
my client's mother committed suicide without any evidence.

618
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
For a young man,

619
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,120
this is undoubtedly a very serious blow.

620
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,920
According to the psychological report,

621
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,280
my client had a tendency to be

622
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,520
biased and prejudiced.

623
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,320
So he made an incorrect judgment in the accident.

624
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,720
My client's father is also a well-educated judge.

625
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,920
He is strict in his law and upholds justice.

626
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,720
But he sacrificed his care and company for his son.

627
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,520
He was unable to take care of his son during his growth.

628
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,520
And when he lost his mother, he felt that he was alone.

629
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
The defendant in the criminal column

630
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,920
is a college student who has no criminal record.

631
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,920
He regrets his actions

632
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,120
and hopes to make up for his mistakes.

633
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,920
Fifty college students

634
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,520
wrote a petition for him.

635
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,320
They hoped that the court would give him a chance to change his mind.

636
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,120
They also hoped that the judge

637
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,120
would put these factors into consideration.

638
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,920
Thank you.

639
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,720
The escape of Zhao Shi after the accident

640
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
is a serious crime.

641
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,320
He must be sentenced to life imprisonment to play the role of a criminal.

642
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,120
But considering that the defendant was only 19 years old when he was accused,

643
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,320
he was immature.

644
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,120
He was laughing and laughing when something happened.

645
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,120
And he also took the initiative to turn himself in.

646
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,920
He showed his attitude of taking responsibility.

647
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,320
And the college student wrote a petition for him.

648
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,120
They also let the client believe that the defendant is indeed a promising young man.

649
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,920
The court should give him a chance to change his mind.

650
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,920
I now pronounce the defendant, Qin Yiwei,

651
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,920
guilty of escaping the punishment of the road traffic law.

652
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,520
The defendant will be sentenced to 12 months.

653
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
Weiwei, don't worry.

654
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,720
If there's anything you need, I will take care of it.

655
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,120
You should learn to protect yourself.

656
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,720
Let's go.

657
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,920
Let's go.

658
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,120
Don't worry too much.

659
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,720
He must be very uncomfortable in prison.

660
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,920
I won't send you in. I have something to do.

661
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,120
What do you want to do? Don't do anything rash.

662
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,120
I know I won't.

663
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:51,320
Judge Qin, a prison is a place that must follow the rules.

664
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,920
To manage a prison, you need to follow the rules.

665
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,720
In here, the rules are equal to everyone.

666
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,520
Yes. I hope you understand.

667
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,720
I'm not here to ask for any privilege.

668
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,920
I'm here to tell you that I'm the one who sentenced Han Kuilong.

669
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,520
My son is in here now.

670
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,120
He might send his men to deal with my son.

671
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,520
If you don't let my son to be imprisoned alone,

672
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,520
you will give them a chance.

673
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,120
Judge Qin, to be honest,

674
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,720
recently, there are no good people in here.

675
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,120
There are many people who have their own problems.

676
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,320
If everyone who is in here tells me to be imprisoned alone,

677
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,120
then is this a prison or a hotel?

678
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,720
According to what you said, do you have to wait for my son to get into trouble to make arrangements?

679
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,120
I'll be honest with you.

680
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,520
In fact, my son has been attacked once during the detention of the Eastern District Police Department.

681
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,720
This is because their safety measures are not well done.

682
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,120
We are in a prison.

683
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,520
There are targeted safety measures to ensure the safety of every prisoner.

684
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,520
If you don't have confidence in the system of the prison,

685
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,720
you can always make your opinion.

686
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,320
But you are not here to say these for someone's benefit.

687
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,720
How are you long?

688
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,020
Have you heard that you are not having long?

689
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,520
No one knows you.

690
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,520
Only you tell me.

691
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,620
Okay.

692
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,320
Since you are worried about what happened,

693
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,360
tell me how to handle it.

694
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,620
Come on.

695
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,120
I will tell you how to apply for recovery treatment.

696
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,720
I'm interested in the case of Xu.

697
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,200
What's your opinion, Mr. Lu?

698
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,480
I won't make any comments on the cases.

699
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,840
Because we have to respect the judgment of the court.

700
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,280
But we can analyze it from the perspective of legal system.

701
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,720
If someone knows the law in a case,

702
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,320
but doesn't follow the law,

703
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,840
it's like someone else is running away from responsibility.

704
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,800
They use their influence to interfere with the judicial process.

705
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,840
It's not only a violation of the law,

706
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,680
but also a violation of the judicial system.

707
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,080
If a case involves a high-ranking official

708
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,320
to hinder judicial justice,

709
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,720
how should we solve it?

710
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,640
I strongly suggest

711
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,520
that the relevant departments conduct an investigation immediately

712
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,360
and punish the most worthy person.

713
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,480
Hello?

714
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,280
This Lu is really a private servant.

715
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,800
He used the radio interview to attack you.

716
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,760
He was afraid that you would take the position of the president of the court.

717
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,360
He said that

718
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,600
it would soon cause public opinion to be angry.

719
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,000
He said that you are a judge and you are looking for death.

720
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,880
Why didn't you respond?

721
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,240
You let them scold you?

722
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,840
He did this to make Yiwei safer.

723
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,360
He knows to use the media,

724
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,960
we can do the same.

725
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,840
As the president of the court who has retired,

726
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,360
it is my honor and responsibility

727
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,560
to contribute to the protection of women's rights.

728
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,240
Now in society,

729
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,720
there is a violent warm bed that is often neglected,

730
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,840
which is the prison.

731
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,400
One of the biggest purposes of the prison

732
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,120
is to give criminals a chance to reform themselves.

733
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,720
But if you are in the prison

734
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,320
and are constantly immersed in the force,

735
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,440
no matter who is the victim,

736
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,120
they will be severely distorted.

737
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,680
It will be very difficult

738
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,720
for society to return to the past.

739
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,240
Violence not only harms individuals,

740
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,600
but also the whole society.

741
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,360
So we should stand up

742
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,280
to build a more just and more humane society

743
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,480
to contribute our own strength.

744
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,920
Thank you.

745
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,840
Our goal

746
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,800
is to help every person in the society

747
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,880
to build a new life,

748
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,080
to help them to re-enter society

749
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,640
and reduce the crime rate.

750
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,480
To bring peace to society.

751
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,320
This is a very meaningful and noble goal.

752
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,720
Yuzhang.

753
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,360
Yes.

754
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,760
Can I go into the prison to have a look?

755
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,280
Open the door.

756
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,000
Stand up.

757
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,320
Stand up.

758
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,520
Stand up.

759
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,040
The discipline and the environment are good.

760
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,920
Yuzhang, you manage it very well.

761
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,720
Thank you.

762
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,680
This is my responsibility.

763
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,160
Hello, everyone.

764
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,160
I am a member of the Imperial Council.

765
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,680
Do you have any complaints

766
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,440
or any opinions to express?

767
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,040
No, sir.

768
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,560
I am not a officer.

769
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,920
I am just a channel for collecting opinions

770
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,200
on behalf of the government.

771
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,040
Young man,

772
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
what crime did you commit?

773
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,720
I was not able to get out of the car accident.

774
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,400
I was sentenced to 12 months.

775
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,240
Did you reflect on it after you were locked in?

776
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,880
You are young.

777
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,720
If you are willing to change,

778
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,320
I believe you will make contributions

779
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,120
to the future society.

780
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,800
I believe you can do it.

781
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,800
She is your colleague.

782
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:25,760
Huang Yu Yuan.

783
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,000
Huang Yu Yuan.

784
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,640
Huang Yu Yuan.

785
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,160
Huang Yu Yuan.

786
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,080
What do you think

787
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,640
after comfortable into prison?

788
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,760
The Crthood Education Bureau's management is good.

789
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,280
But I think

790
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,160
improvement needs to be done.

791
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
and education issues.

792
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
Especially,

793
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,160
recently, there have been some violent comments in the society.

794
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,160
If these violent comments

795
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
are spread to the prison,

796
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,160
it will definitely affect the reformation of the prisoners.

797
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
So I will never allow

798
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,160
hatred and violence to spread in the prison.

799
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,160
Are you referring to

800
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,160
the recent abuse against the prison judge?

801
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,160
You reminded me.

802
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,160
This is a good example.

803
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
I think that a person who has broken the law

804
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,160
and is punished in a proper way

805
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
should be sentenced to a period of time.

806
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
But recently, many people

807
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,160
have used violence as a life-threatening attack.

808
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,160
This kind of thing is absolutely not allowed in society.

809
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,160
I don't know the judge Qin.

810
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,160
But from his previous case,

811
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,160
I think he is a

812
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,160
great judge without personal interest.

813
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,160
May I ask what specific arrangements

814
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
do you have for the next round?

815
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,160
I will write everything I see and hear in the report.

816
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,160
As a medical report for the future legislation,

817
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,160
I will make sure that the public's right to ask questions is respected.

818
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Thank you.

819
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,160
Excuse me.

820
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,160
There is another schedule for the medical report.

821
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,160
If you have any questions,

822
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,160
you can contact me anytime.

823
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,160
This is my business card.

824
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
Boss.

825
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,160
You really want to call him here?

826
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,160
Brother Jiang said that

827
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,160
he was seriously injured before.

828
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
He almost died.

829
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
He was seriously injured.

830
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,160
He almost died.

831
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,160
I think this is a good chance to prove that

832
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,160
he is innocent.

833
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,160
I think

834
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
he is innocent.

835
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
I think

836
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,160
he is innocent.

837
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,160
I think

838
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
he is innocent.

839
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
I think

840
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,160
he is innocent.

841
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
I think

842
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,160
he is innocent.

843
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,160
Fortunately, I found a priest to do his work.

844
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,160
He said that his shoes were stolen by ghosts.

845
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,160
So he wanted to find a priest

846
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,160
to take his shoes off.

847
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,160
This way,

848
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,160
he wanted to find a priest to take his shoes off.

849
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,160
That way,

850
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160
he wanted to find a girl to be discovered.

851
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
Luckily, I was smart.

852
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,160
I woke up at 1 a.m.

853
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,160
and asked the priest to come and take my shoes off.

854
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
Then I took the time

855
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
to arrange a massage for him.

856
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,160
Come on.

857
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,160
Come on.

858
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
Be careful.

859
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,160
Sit down and drink slowly.

860
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,160
Uncle Fei,

861
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,160
you have a good business.

862
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
It's thanks to the bookworms.

863
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,160
Just like you,

864
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
I read one book every day.

865
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,160
When I think of the priest,

866
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,160
the priest comes.

867
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
I didn't notice it even if you didn't tell me.

868
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,160
I feel uncomfortable

869
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,160
without drinking your coffee every day.

870
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,160
Wait a minute today.

871
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,160
I'll pour you a cup of coffee right away.

872
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,160
Okay.

873
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,160
I'm sorry.

874
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
I failed.

875
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
There's still a whole year

876
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
and time.

877
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
Don't worry.

878
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,160
It's all because of that guy.

879
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
He went to the prison.

880
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
Now the prison is very tight.

881
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,160
I said I had time.

882
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
Don't worry.

883
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
Luo Qiang

884
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,160
said your brother

885
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
wanted to invite the priest.

886
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
My brother said

887
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,160
he thought Dian Xian was a ghost.

888
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,160
He didn't want to take the medicine.

889
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
So he wanted to find the priest to help him get rid of the evil.

890
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
He's really smart.

891
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,160
I don't think so.

892
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,160
Besides the priest,

893
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
he also wants to find the girl.

894
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
I don't know how normal it is.

895
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,160
Xiaoli.

896
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,160
You brothers are close.

897
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
I'll leave the family

898
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,160
to you brothers.

899
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,160
You didn't like to participate in the past.

900
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,160
So I won't let you know

901
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
about many things.

902
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
You don't know.

903
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,160
So you can't guess

904
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
what decision I will make.

905
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Twenty years ago,

906
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,160
why can I

907
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
get so fast?

908
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,160
Because I was watched by

909
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,160
a very powerful

910
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,160
interest group.

911
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,160
How big is it?

912
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
The town.

913
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,160
Jing Hei.

914
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
They all have it.

915
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,160
They never show up.

916
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,160
They only find

917
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,160
some middlemen to spread the word.

918
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,160
I'll help them.

919
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,160
They will support me.

920
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,160
I can

921
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,160
grow up step by step.

922
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,160
Since they are so powerful,

923
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,160
why do you still want to go to jail?

924
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,160
I was too arrogant before.

925
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,160
They used the case of the businessman

926
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,160
to teach me a lesson.

927
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,160
They have agreed

928
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,160
the interests of my future.

929
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,160
Is it worth it?

930
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,160
Yes.

931
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,160
It can support you brothers.

932
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
It can also

933
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,160
make our Hanshi Group

934
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,160
the biggest

935
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,160
gambling company in Hong Kong.

936
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,160
It's worth it.

937
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,160
It's worth it.

938
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,160
It's worth it.

939
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,160
We are not far from the goal.

940
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
The Jiuhengqi Bookstore Project

941
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,160
will be implemented soon.

942
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
We don't want to do

943
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,160
unnecessary things.

944
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,160
We want to preserve our strength.

945
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,160
People who only talk about interests

946
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
never talk about morality.

947
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,160
We will only make them the victims.

948
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,160
It won't be a loss if we do so.

949
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,160
Their identities are highly secretive.

950
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,160
Ordinary people can't see them.

951
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
But there are some signs.

952
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,160
You have to be careful when you see them.

953
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,160
The plum blossoms

954
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,160
are our black beans.

955
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,160
The red heart is the block.

956
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,160
Black peaches are the business world,

957
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,160
the police and the political world.

958
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,160
Be careful when you see them.

959
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,160
Be careful.

960
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
These people can't run away.

961
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,160
Don't offend them.

962
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,160
They only talk about interests.

963
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,160
Interests are your biggest weapon.

964
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
Do you understand?

965
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,160
The Jiuhengqi Bookstore Project

966
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,160
Son.

967
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Go and see your sister.

968
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,160
Be good.

969
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,160
See what else you need.

970
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,160
I can hold on for a while.

971
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,160
I can't be like this with my child.

972
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,160
Any news from the Jiucheng District?

973
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,160
My dad secretly told me

974
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,160
Qi Changrong's men

975
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,160
suddenly became honest.

976
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,160
They didn't kill or set fire.

977
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,160
They didn't fight.

978
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,160
They didn't fight or make trouble.

979
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,160
But they sent someone to my house.

980
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,160
They must have suspected me.

981
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,160
Because you are the last person

982
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,160
who saw Qi Changrong.

983
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,160
They can't guess

984
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,160
that you will stay here.

985
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,160
If Qi Changrong's body is found,

986
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,160
it will be more than the Jiucheng Gang.

987
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,160
The police won't let me go.

988
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,160
So I have to leave here as soon as possible.

989
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,160
I will arrange for you to leave.

990
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,160
Can you leave after Friday?

991
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,160
Why?

992
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,160
What is more important

993
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,160
than this thing now?

994
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,160
Because someone will die that day.

995
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,160
I will send you away.

996
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,160
I promised Wei.

997
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
Qi Changrong

998
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,160
Sir.

999
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,160
We love the kids.

1000
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,160
You have to be careful.

1001
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,160
Come back safely.

1002
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,160
Okay.

1003
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,160
The End

1004
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,160
The End

1005
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,160
The End

1006
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,160
The End

1007
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,160
The End

1008
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,160
The End
