00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 16

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Doctor, is there anything wrong?

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,000
Xiao Gang!

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,000
Xiao Gang!

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,000
What happened?

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,600
Xiao Gang is awake!

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,400
Xiao Gang!

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,200
Xiao Gang!

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,600
Xiao Gang...

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:59,000
Xiao Gang...

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,620
The

12
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,740
I will treat someone who much better than you.

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,600
ud quality.

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,380
Who?

15
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,460
It's me.

16
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,260
What do you want?

17
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,900
A'bao is your nephew

18
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,380
and also my good brother.

19
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,700
Isn't it worth

20
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,940
for us to have a good chat?

21
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,740
You come in alone.

22
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,060
Wait for me here.

23
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,300
A'bao is still very young.

24
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,420
He doesn't know what is the world.

25
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,260
He doesn't know what is the world.

26
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,940
He doesn't know what is the world.

27
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,020
He doesn't know what is the world.

28
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,020
He was deceived by others.

29
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,380
What do you want to say?

30
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,180
You don't want to mention A'bao?

31
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,020
Then let's talk business.

32
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,420
I have nothing to talk with you about business.

33
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,300
You added 200,000 yuan to A'bao's account.

34
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,020
Isn't it a business

35
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,580
that bribes people?

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,340
Lou Wei.

37
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,020
Sha Sha knows you are bad.

38
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,300
Otherwise, how could she leave you

39
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,860
and take the child away?

40
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,860
Sha Sha is a good girl.

41
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,460
She is so loving.

42
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,260
Shut up.

43
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,940
So many men want to marry her.

44
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,860
But she chose you.

45
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,860
Guess if she

46
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,660
regrets it now?

47
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,620
I will have a good chat with her another day.

48
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,500
How dare you!

49
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,060
You added 200,000 yuan to A'bao's account

50
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,780
and made her son confess.

51
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,380
But you killed A'bao.

52
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,620
But you dare not to go to the police.

53
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,260
Because you were fired.

54
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,540
You hate the police.

55
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,380
But I don't care.

56
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,820
I can go to the police station

57
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,100
and get a bonus.

58
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,700
Sha Sha is from the old city district.

59
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,260
You married her.

60
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,700
You are her husband.

61
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,540
Her husband

62
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,300
will take care of her.

63
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,380
You should understand it.

64
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,820
I am going to give a big gift to Han Kuilun.

65
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,460
You'd better move faster.

66
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,780
I am a hurry.

67
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,700
I don't know what will happen.

68
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,500
Brother.

69
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,500
Brother.

70
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,940
Doctor.

71
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,180
Can he hear us?

72
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,300
He can.

73
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,980
But he may not understand it now.

74
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,860
Brother.

75
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,060
I am Xiaolian.

76
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,500
Xiaolian.

77
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,020
Xiaolian.

78
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,940
Xiaolian.

79
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,860
Xiaolian.

80
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,780
Xiaolian.

81
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,300
It's good that you are fine.

82
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,140
I am worried about you.

83
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,300
Do you remember what happened?

84
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,540
You rode a motorcycle.

85
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,780
Someone hit you.

86
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,460
Do you remember?

87
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,580
Do you have something to say?

88
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,620
Brother.

89
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,060
Answer me.

90
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,780
Brother.

91
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,780
You have been unconscious for half a month.

92
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,460
Brother.

93
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,860
Calm down.

94
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,500
He just woke up.

95
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,580
It takes time to fully recover.

96
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,140
Nurse Tang is right.

97
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,540
We can't rush the patient.

98
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,860
Give him some time.

99
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,460
Take your time.

100
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,260
Sorry.

101
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,500
I was too excited.

102
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,020
I am so sorry.

103
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,740
楊哥.

104
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,260
I was too nervous.

105
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,320
Wait for us.

106
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,840
We will wait for you outside the hospital.

107
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,080
Then we can open the door.

108
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,700
See how much they burdens about him.

109
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,920
It was 오늘 ofWei Yi.

110
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,860
Are you going to give me Show house back?

111
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,880
What?

112
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,420
I will return it in time.

113
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,420
But youfried your mother.

114
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,420
to escape from the criminal law.

115
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,420
Even if you cooperate with the investigation,

116
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,420
you can't make compensation

117
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,420
to the victim's family.

118
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,420
You can't make up for the damage

119
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,420
caused by the crime.

120
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,420
I believe

121
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,420
that as a mother,

122
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,420
you can understand

123
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,420
the actions of the defendant,

124
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,420
but you can't forgive them.

125
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,420
You must pay a price

126
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,420
for your actions.

127
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,420
The judgment

128
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,420
is not only about the punishment,

129
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,420
but also about the hope

130
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,420
that the similar tragedy

131
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,420
will not happen again.

132
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,420
The judgment of this episode

133
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,420
is that all the charges

134
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,420
of the defendant, Huang Juan,

135
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,420
are established.

136
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,420
The judgment is five years in advance.

137
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,420
However,

138
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,420
this episode

139
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,420
will not be shared with you.

140
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,420
You must bear it in mind.

141
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,420
Go.

142
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,420
Go.

143
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,420
Go.

144
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,420
Go.

145
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,420
Go.

146
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,420
Go.

147
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,420
Go.

148
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,420
Go.

149
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,420
Go.

150
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,980
I heard that you will get better.

151
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,740
It's just a matter of time.

152
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,220
Time is the problem.

153
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,620
Why did I let them set me up here?

154
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,020
Because once I left,

155
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,820
in the past few decades,

156
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,020
all the lands I conquered were gone.

157
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,420
I even took advantage of the crazy Qi Chang Rong.

158
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,420
I promised to go to jail

159
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,420
and someone could take me.

160
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,820
I promised to go to jail

161
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,620
and someone could take me.

162
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,420
I promised to go to jail

163
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,020
and someone could take me.

164
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,020
Someone could take the credit.

165
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,020
Someone could take the benefits.

166
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,820
They and I

167
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,620
were on the same boat.

168
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,420
It was all a deal.

169
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,420
A deal doesn't need to be fair.

170
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,420
To win,

171
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,020
it doesn't matter how strong you are.

172
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,620
It depends on who has the least bottom line.

173
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,620
You are a wolf.

174
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,420
He is no match for your brother.

175
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,420
Your brother is more cruel and ferocious than you.

176
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,020
You brothers can help each other.

177
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,820
But if you do something bad,

178
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,820
let your brother do it.

179
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,820
As long as my brother can get better,

180
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,220
I don't care about anything.

181
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,220
Dealing with your brother

182
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,220
is also dealing with the Han family.

183
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,620
No.

184
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,620
You killed the thief

185
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,820
just to give them an excuse

186
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,020
to let that crazy dog to investigate.

187
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,020
Your brother

188
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,220
will be in trouble

189
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,220
during his stay in the hospital.

190
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,020
We must stop him.

191
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,620
But we can't hurt Yuan Qi.

192
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,620
I see.

193
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,420
Take good care of your brother.

194
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,420
I see.

195
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,220
Come and have a look.

196
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,420
How is it?

197
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:46,820
So cute.

198
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,420
Which one do you like?

199
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,020
Thank you.

200
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,220
Do you like this one?

201
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,220
Thank you.

202
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,820
Tell me, Shan Bao.

203
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,820
What a poor kid.

204
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,620
He is only 18 years old.

205
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,820
I have known his mother for a long time.

206
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,420
I saw him this morning.

207
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,820
I can't even open my eyes.

208
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,820
Who did it?

209
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,220
If I knew who did it,

210
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,020
he would have gone to die with A'Bao.

211
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,820
He is from your Jiucheng Gang.

212
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,020
Me?

213
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,820
I don't have a gang.

214
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,220
Everyone living in Jiucheng District is a family.

215
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,220
I, Qi Changlong,

216
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,620
love protecting kids.

217
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,220
So cute.

218
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,420
Xiaojun.

219
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,020
Xiaojun.

220
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,020
Mom.

221
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,820
Xiaojun.

222
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,020
Xiaojun.

223
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,820
Let me go.

224
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,420
Hurry.

225
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,220
Don't go.

226
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,220
Xiaojun.

227
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,620
Don't go.

228
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,020
Xiaojun.

229
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,420
Do you have kids?

230
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,420
Madam is asking you now.

231
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,020
Not you.

232
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,220
I'm not.

233
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,220
I'm not.

234
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,020
The crime happened at 7 a.m.

235
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,620
Where were you?

236
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,620
At home.

237
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,020
With my girlfriend on the bed.

238
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,420
Do you want me to describe the details?

239
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,420
I'm telling the truth.

240
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,620
You know how many cases you have.

241
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,620
I can arrest anyone I want.

242
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,420
You should know who killed A'Bao.

243
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,420
I know, so I don't need to call you.

244
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,220
You caught A'Bao

245
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,420
because he was hit by a steel bar.

246
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,020
Do you think he would let A'Bao go easily?

247
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,420
You mean Ma Shanbao was hit by a steel bar?

248
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,820
Tang, don't act like a fool in front of me.

249
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
You pretend to be a righteous man.

250
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,620
You did many bad things in the North.

251
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,220
You know better than me who did it.

252
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,420
You're a coward.

253
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,220
Hey.

254
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,420
Don't go too far.

255
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,420
Qi Changrong.

256
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,820
What?

257
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,420
Are you going to arrest me now?

258
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,020
If not,

259
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,820
I'll leave.

260
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,820
I'll go.

261
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,820
I told you to go.

262
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,420
Go.

263
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,820
Get up.

264
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,820
Go.

265
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,820
Han Ertiao.

266
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,220
You're not a good aunt.

267
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,620
Why are you here?

268
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,620
Have you ever thought about your own mother?

269
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,220
I'm afraid she can't sleep well in the coffin.

270
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,820
If you're so filial,

271
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,420
then go down

272
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,020
and be your filial son.

273
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,420
Be careful not to fall.

274
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,020
I'll make you pay for this.

275
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,820
Qi Changrong, don't make trouble.

276
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,420
Hello?

277
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,420
Wei.

278
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,420
They took Xiao Yue.

279
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,420
What did you say?

280
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,020
It's Qi Changrong.

281
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,020
I can bear his car.

282
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,820
Don't be afraid, Shasha.

283
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,020
Lock the door and watch your daughter.

284
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,420
Your son will be fine.

285
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,620
I'll bring him back.

286
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,220
Wei.

287
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,020
Wait for me.

288
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,420
Qi Changrong.

289
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,820
Come to me if you can.

290
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,020
Don't disturb my family.

291
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,420
Wei, I told you I'm impatient.

292
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,620
I hate to coax kids.

293
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,220
If I coax them twice,

294
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,420
I'll slap them.

295
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,820
I'll help you steal and rob.

296
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,020
Let my son go first.

297
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,620
Look.

298
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,620
Who said we have no business to talk about?

299
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,220
We can talk about it.

300
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,820
Ha?

301
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,420
I haven't mentioned the türkish name.

302
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,820
Where are you going?

303
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:54,300
Art some

304
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,620
Madam will be here soon.

305
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,100
I'm fine.

306
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,860
I'm fine.

307
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,460
I'm fine.

308
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,340
I'm fine.

309
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,540
Take your time.

310
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,180
I'm fine.

311
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,140
Don't cry.

312
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,740
I'm fine.

313
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,980
I'm fine.

314
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,060
I'm crying.

315
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,220
I'm fine.

316
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,220
I'm fine.

317
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,860
You haven't started yet,

318
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,980
but you're writing your own words.

319
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,300
I saw Qi Changrong leaving.

320
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,020
What?

321
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,460
You bought the detention center?

322
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,660
You can't put him in?

323
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,620
You gave me some useful clues,

324
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,300
so I opened a room to take care of him.

325
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,940
Didn't the suspect who kidnapped my brother

326
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,860
get replaced by you?

327
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,260
The suspect is Ma Shanbao.

328
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,300
No.

329
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,180
We should change the name.

330
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,820
We should call him Ma Shanbao, the victim of the shooting case.

331
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,300
For your brother, Han Gang,

332
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,300
you have a good reason to kill Ma Shanbao.

333
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,540
Madam,

334
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,620
if you have any evidence,

335
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,580
you won't just ask me to come back to ask for your opinion.

336
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,540
You can ask the Flying Tiger Team to come over at midnight.

337
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,260
No need to wait until midnight.

338
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,900
If you want to go to jail,

339
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,620
I can send you in at any time.

340
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,900
I'm warning you.

341
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,860
Don't make things worse.

342
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,220
You're not your brother or your dad.

343
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,860
Don't make yourself look so bad.

344
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,060
I want all the bloodshed and violence to stop.

345
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,980
That Ma Shanbao,

346
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,500
are you sure he's the murderer of my brother?

347
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,300
If it wasn't him,

348
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,700
why would someone want to kill him to avenge his death?

349
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
You police are so capable.

350
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,900
Why did you let this person

351
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,700
break into my brother's ward last night?

352
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,100
He's Qi Changrong's man.

353
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,900
He's not Qi Changrong's man.

354
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,900
Are you sure?

355
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,100
The people of the Old City Gang

356
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,300
can smell the smell of their own body from a distance.

357
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,300
The Old City Gang

358
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,700
Coach.

359
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,300
You're looking for me?

360
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,300
Qin Yiwei.

361
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,500
I was going to leave like this.

362
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,900
There's really no need to say goodbye.

363
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,700
Your problem,

364
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,900
your family's problem,

365
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,300
I really can't solve it.

366
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,300
I don't want it to become my problem in the end.

367
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,700
You guys go find the Zheng family to help.

368
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,900
I'm leaving.

369
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,700
No need to say goodbye.

370
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,700
I'm leaving.

371
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,700
Why aren't you turning on the light?

372
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,500
Don't. Don't talk.

373
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,700
Close your eyes.

374
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,300
Give me your hand, dear.

375
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,500
I'm here.

376
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,900
Come with me.

377
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,700
Okay, you can sit down.

378
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,900
Okay, you can sit down.

379
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,700
Everyone, please close your eyes.

380
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,500
So pretty.

381
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,100
Hold on a second.

382
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,500
Very soon,

383
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,700
you can open your eyes.

384
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,700
Happy birthday.

385
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,500
Happy birthday to you.

386
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,300
Happy birthday to you.

387
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:03,100
Happy birthday to you.

388
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,500
Happy birthday to you.

389
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Come, make a wish. Eat a candle.

390
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,500
Thank you.

391
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,900
Hey, what's wrong?

392
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,700
On guard.

393
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,500
Okay, you watch over her for me. I'll be right over.

394
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,100
What's the matter?

395
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,500
I was still investigating the fire in Boom Ferold.

396
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,900
I suspect the man who died of illness in the prison was a scapegoat.

397
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,100
He's probably the one who killed the person behind the scene.

398
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,500
What's the situation now?

399
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,300
I know a person named Liu Mao.

400
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,900
We used to play together when we were younger.

401
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,700
Lin Jian said that he heard rumors saying

402
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
he saw a real murderer in Boom Ferold.

403
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,700
Later on, he left Haokang and disappeared.

404
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,700
Someone told me on the phone that she saw him in Tun City.

405
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,580
Then go to Tun City now.

406
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,900
It's your birthday today.

407
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,900
Birthdays can be celebrated anytime.

408
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,700
Hurry and go.

409
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,900
Then you have to wait for me to come back before you can cut the cake.

410
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,900
Why?

411
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,500
Because if you don't wait for me to come back, it will explode.

412
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,900
Okay.

413
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,100
Sorry.

414
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100
Okay, go now.

415
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,100
Sorry.

416
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,700
Wait for me. I'll be back soon.

417
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,100
So this person was the one who entered Han Gang's room?

418
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,300
Who is he?

419
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,300
Watch the next video.

420
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,500
This is the same person.

421
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,700
I didn't expect Han Lie to be good at drawing.

422
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,500
Who is he?

423
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,100
He doesn't look like a little mixed-race.

424
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,500
Of course not.

425
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
You know him?

426
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,100
Judge Qin, Tang Du Chan is here.

427
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,500
Tang Du Chan.

428
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,100
Is it convenient for you to chat?

429
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,100
Sit.

430
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,500
Aren't you investigating Ma Shanbao's case?

431
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,300
Do you have any clues?

432
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,900
The Special Investigation Department is currently following up.

433
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,300
I came to ask you about something else.

434
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,500
How are you and your son lately?

435
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,300
Did you two still have a fight?

436
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,900
Nothing.

437
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,300
What's wrong?

438
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,300
The night before, he went to the hospital.

439
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,500
I didn't hear him say he was not feeling well. How did you know?

440
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,100
Because Ma Shanbao is a very good person.

441
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,100
Because of Ma Shanbao's case, when I was looking for Han Lie to enter the palace,

442
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,500
he told me that someone broke into his brother's ward.

443
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,700
So I went to the hospital to check the surveillance footage.

444
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,100
I saw this picture.

445
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,700
Just by looking at this picture...

446
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,500
And this one.

447
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,300
I think that this picture is very suspicious.

448
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,100
It's a picture of the person who broke into Han Gang's ward.

449
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,500
I think that this picture is very suspicious.

450
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,900
I think that this picture is very suspicious.

451
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,300
I want to know why your son went into Han Gang's ward

452
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,500
and was wearing a white coat.

453
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,100
This picture looks a bit strange.

454
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,100
I'll go back and ask.

455
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,100
This is Han Gang's ward.

456
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,900
Go see Han Gang.

457
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,300
Do you really think that there is nothing to do with this?

458
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,700
I don't dare to answer this question. I'll go back and ask him.

459
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,900
My suggestion is that you should immediately bring him to the police station.

460
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,300
Let us ask him.

461
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,900
Of course, you can investigate again. This is your right.

462
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,100
This is the best way to get rid of his suspicion.

463
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,300
What suspicion?

464
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,700
You know what I'm investigating.

465
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,100
Okay.

466
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,700
I'll go back and arrange it. I'll notify you again.

467
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,100
Okay.

468
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,700
Yi Wei, where are you?

469
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,700
What is it?

470
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,700
Have you dropped out of school? I came to pick you up.

471
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:30,500
Dad, do you still remember the ice cream shop next to the gas station?

472
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,100
I remember.

473
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,100
I remember.

474
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,900
I remember.

475
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,700
I remember.

476
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,700
I remember.

477
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,900
We used to go there every week.

478
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,300
I remember that mom loved to have the lemon ice cream.

479
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,300
She said that the ice cream had sugar and milk to make it healthier.

480
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,700
But I don't like it. I like to eat ice cream with ice.

481
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,500
But I also bought the lemon ice cream earlier.

482
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,900
Is it good?

483
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,100
It's so bad.

484
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,500
I also went there last week.

485
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,900
I passed by there last week.

486
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,060
The shop closed.

487
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,580
Where are you now?

488
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,340
Why did you go to the hospital?

489
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,540
Why did you go to Han Gang's ward the other day?

490
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,900
You've been seen.

491
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,380
You've been found.

492
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,900
I just want them to see me.

493
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,860
I've been working so hard.

494
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,300
I can't hold on anymore.

495
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,500
You haven't answered me.

496
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,180
Why did you show up there?

497
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,100
Mom never acts like you.

498
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,340
I'm not your prisoner.

499
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,580
I don't want to answer your question.

500
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:33,940
You ch remind me that

501
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,060
want to meet Tang Jia?

502
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,780
He got off work early today

503
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,020
You slow drink double.

504
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,960
Don't catch a cold.

505
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,040
Tong Jia.

506
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,720
What's up?

507
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,640
Thank you for taking care of my last brother.

508
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,600
You can have it.

509
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,800
No, it's only my job.

510
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,800
No, no need.

511
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Really, no need.

512
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Why is your son

513
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
going into Han Gang's ward

514
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
and wearing a white coat?

515
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
I dare not answer this question.

516
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
I'll go back and ask him.

517
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
You should take him to the police station right away.

518
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Let us ask him.

519
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,800
This is the best way to get rid of his suspicion.

520
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
What suspicion?

521
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
You're back.

522
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Why are you sitting here alone

523
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
and not turning on the TV?

524
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
I'm thinking about something.

525
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
Thinking about something?

526
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
What are you thinking about?

527
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
I'm thinking

528
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
if what I'm thinking is true,

529
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
I'll find it hard to accept the truth.

530
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Okay,

531
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
let's not talk about the official business.

532
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
By the way, what are the arrangements for today?

533
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
I've arranged everything.

534
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
First,

535
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
we'll go eat

536
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,800
the self-serve meal that I've been looking forward to for a long time.

537
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
Then, we'll go sing K-pop.

538
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
It's my birthday,

539
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
and you've been looking forward to the self-serve meal for a long time.

540
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
It's us.

541
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
You've been looking forward to singing K-pop for a long time, right?

542
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
I didn't kick it.

543
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
It was Brother Shi's order.

544
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
I'm sorry.

545
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
I didn't kick it.

546
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
I didn't kick it.

547
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
It was Brother Shi's order.

548
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
He said he wanted me to accompany you to go crazy.

549
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
He doesn't want you to know all day long

550
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
that you're working, working, working,

551
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
thinking about something, thinking about something, thinking about something.

552
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
You're right. You're right.

553
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Go change your clothes.

554
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
I'll go out after I wash my hands.

555
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Okay, okay, okay.

556
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
The birthday gift is in the bag.

557
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
You can put it on yourself.

558
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
Thank you.

559
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
Birthday gift?

560
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
This is my breakfast for tomorrow.

561
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Sister,

562
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
you're just a nurse.

563
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
You're just a nurse.

564
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
You gave me such a generous gift.

565
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
You're not a senior, are you?

566
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
You violated the customs regulations.

567
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
No.

568
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,800
This is your birthday gift.

569
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
This is...

570
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
This is Han Lie.

571
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
He gave it to me today.

572
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Han Lie, the son of Han Kuilong.

573
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
His eldest brother lives in the nursing home.

574
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
He said thank you to me

575
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
for taking care of his brother.

576
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
Thank you for taking care of his brother

577
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
and giving you a watch worth more than ten thousand yuan.

578
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
I don't know either.

579
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,800
I just saw it.

580
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
You opened it.

581
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
I told you not to deal with people like this.

582
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
I didn't.

583
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
He gave it to me at the subway station

584
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
when I was off work today.

585
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,800
No need to say it.

586
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
Let's go.

587
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
Then you...

588
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,800
Change your clothes quickly.

589
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
Han Lie.

590
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
Tang Xuan.

591
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
Madam.

592
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
What's up?

593
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
Hongwawei's small square.

594
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
Can you get there in 15 minutes?

595
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Okay.

596
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
That's it.

597
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Hello?

598
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Hello, Director Tang.

599
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
I'm Qin Yu.

600
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
I want to talk to you again.

601
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
Okay.

602
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
I'm at your house now.

603
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Can we meet now?

604
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
I'll find you later.

605
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
I'm outside now.

606
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
Okay.

607
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
How is it, Madam?

608
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
Did you find out who entered my brother's ward?

609
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
Tang Xuan.

610
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
The watch is for you.

611
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
It's not for you.

612
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
I don't care what your purpose is.

613
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
From now on,

614
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
keep your distance from him.

615
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
Why?

616
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
I don't want my family

617
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
to have anything to do with the black community.

618
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
How is it going with the black community?

619
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
It's fine.

620
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,800
But I don't want to see them

621
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
in the dark.

622
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
But...

623
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
But I don't want to see them

624
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,800
in the dark.

625
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
What do you mean?

626
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
I don't want to see them

627
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
in the dark.

628
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
But I don't want to see them

629
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
in the dark.

630
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,800
You're back.

631
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
I'm here.

632
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,800
I found it.

633
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Did you find it?

634
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Yes.

635
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,800
You're back.

636
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Dad.

637
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,800
Where are you?

638
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
I'm in the hospital.

639
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
I need to go to the hospital.

640
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,800
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

641
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Okay.

642
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,800
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

643
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Okay.

644
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,760
I'm at the gate of the police station.

645
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,800
What are you doing at the gate of the police station?

646
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,080
Can you pick me up?

647
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,800
Okay.

648
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,680
Don't go away. I'll be right there.

649
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,400
Mr. Qin, I'm home.

650
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,960
You can come anytime.

651
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,800
It's too late today.

652
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
We'll meet another day.

653
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,240
Your son is still wearing a white coat

654
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,480
and going to see Han Gao.

655
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,040
Do you really think

656
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,480
there's nothing to do with this?

657
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,920
You should bring him to the police station right away

658
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,080
and let us ask him.

659
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,800
Okay.

660
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,520
This is the best way to clear his suspicion.

661
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,360
Dad.

662
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,120
Stop talking.

663
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,800
Eat something first.

664
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,280
Yi Wei.

665
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,640
We're staying here now.

666
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,880
What we should remember

667
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,800
is the unhappy things.

668
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,960
If I want to leave,

669
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,880
will you stay with me?

670
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,680
Is it because of me?

671
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,080
It's because of us.

672
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,000
I won't live well if something happens to you.

673
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,760
I've also given you a bonus.

674
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,280
If you really want to leave,

675
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,880
let's leave together.

676
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,600
Okay.

677
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,560
Okay.

678
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,480
It's not too late.

679
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,720
No.

680
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,840
Eat something.

681
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,480
Dad.

682
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,520
Okay.

683
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,800
Give him some vegetables.

684
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,480
It's delicious.

685
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,880
Delicious.

686
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,800
Eat some.

687
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,680
Eat some.

688
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:49,960
Here.

689
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,800
Eat some vegetables.

690
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,120
Thank you, dad.

691
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:54,960
Here.

692
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,160
I'll give you some.

693
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,880
It's good that you're back.

694
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,400
This place will always be your home.

695
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,680
Thank you.

696
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,800
Okay.

697
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,880
Eat.

698
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,320
Eat.

699
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,720
Here.

700
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,160
Eat some vegetables.

701
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,120
Come on, Brother Wei.

702
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,280
Come on.

703
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,080
Can you help me?

704
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,040
Brother Wei.

705
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,800
I won't make it hard for you.

706
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,800
I don't need you to do it.

707
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
I'll arrange it well.

708
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,240
Okay?

709
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,600
Just one word.

710
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,760
Today,

711
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,560
I'll return this favor to you.

712
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,720
Okay.

713
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,360
It's a military fire.

714
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,120
Be careful on the road.

715
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,680
Okay.

716
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,600
Be careful.

717
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,120
Yes.

718
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,560
Mr. Clayrr.

719
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,760
nursing bay

720
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:17,800
Brother Ling.

721
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,240
What's wrong?

722
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:19,920
My stomach hurts.

723
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,040
No.

724
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,160
Do you still need to be so proud?

725
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,060
Mr. Zheng.

726
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,180
Someone told me that

727
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,700
you really love girls.

728
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,800
This is what you jealous little girl?

729
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,440
Miss Sun,

730
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,080
can you cover up the intelligence communicator?

731
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,380
This isarti by Northern power.

732
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,400
Chris!

733
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,700
What do you want?

734
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,700
Sir.

735
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,780
Don't you know the tire is leaking?

736
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,220
Leaking?

737
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,700
Why did you come here?

738
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,500
I'll tell you if you want to.

739
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,940
I think

740
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,900
you'll want to know something.

741
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,100
Is that so?

742
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,500
Last night, around 7 or 8 p.m.,

743
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,220
I drove past a small square

744
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,700
near Tang Ducha's house.

745
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,940
I saw him meeting Han Lie.

746
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,220
Tang Xuan and Han Lie?

747
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,220
Yes.

748
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,300
Tang Ducha was holding

749
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,620
a very precious watch in his hand.

750
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,700
You mean...

751
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,660
Han Lie seemed to be thanking Tang Ducha.

752
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,860
In fact,

753
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,700
it's obvious now.

754
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,220
Tang Ducha

755
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,060
hid the missing evidence of Ma Shanbao

756
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,580
because he knew Han Kuilong

757
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,620
would seek revenge from the Old City Gang.

758
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,180
In order to stop the assassination,

759
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,500
he leaked the news to Han Lie.

760
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,420
He chose to sacrifice Ma Shanbao.

761
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,420
He's a policeman.

762
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,460
Can a policeman

763
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,140
let ordinary people die?

764
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,340
You saw them

765
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,860
meet in private.

766
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,940
You saw Tang Xuan and Han Lie?

767
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,980
They just met.

768
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,580
Tang Ducha could say

769
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,380
he was seeking revenge from Han Lie.

770
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,940
He was holding a watch in his hand.

771
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,820
But it doesn't mean he accepted it.

772
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,740
If I were a judge,

773
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,980
I would say

774
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,300
I have enough evidence.

775
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,780
Then why did you tell me

776
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,620
about this?

777
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,380
The police can find the truth

778
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,220
by looking at the surveillance footage

779
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,820
near the crime scene.

780
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,420
Can I say something?

781
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,700
Two weeks ago,

782
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,940
you introduced me to a client.

783
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,340
But you didn't tell me

784
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,140
that the client stole your car.

785
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,580
Then,

786
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,020
the client was involved in Han Gang's case.

787
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,540
You knew about it.

788
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,260
But you didn't tell me

789
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,020
anything again.

790
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,140
Yes.

791
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,060
You finally told me.

792
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,620
You even gave me a way

793
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,580
to prove the client's innocence.

794
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,580
But what happened?

795
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,620
You saw it.

796
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,020
Today,

797
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,060
you suddenly came to tell me these things.

798
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,900
You wanted to tell me

799
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,500
a story that I can't tell you anymore

800
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,220
and then make up some story?

801
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,860
Or you want to tell me

802
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,060
what I did again?

803
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,020
Yes.

804
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,940
You're right.

805
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,020
This matter

806
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,340
is indeed related to me.

807
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,220
A'Bing, thank you.

808
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,660
You have half an hour.

809
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,060
That's enough.

810
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:30,900
Brother Wei,

811
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,780
I'm sorry.

812
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,540
I'll repay you

813
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,060
in my next life.

814
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,060
SP650, please help me.

815
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,100
We're attacked in the city.

816
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,140
Chief Di,

817
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,460
I read it.

818
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,780
What's wrong?

819
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,140
What's wrong?

820
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:51,900
Chief Ru,

821
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,300
taste the tea tree.

822
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,500
You have some!!

823
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,580
I'll do it.

824
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:00,860
Be carefulGod!

825
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,860
The one who hit Han Gang while driving

826
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,540
is my son, Qin Yiwei.

827
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,220
I didn't want to get you involved.

828
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,740
I just wanted you to help Ma Shanmao.

829
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,140
But what happened later

830
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,580
was totally out of control.

831
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,940
Judge Qin Yu.

832
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,420
You were my teacher in law school.

833
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,300
You taught me what law is

834
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,780
and what justice is.

835
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,380
What is law that you can't obey?

836
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,100
You bowed to the law.

837
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,140
I've always respected you.

838
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,500
No!

839
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,060
Gao Shanmao.

840
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,180
Gao Shanmao!

841
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,740
What are you doing?

842
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,860
Did she die or stay alive?

843
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,660
Nobody knows.

844
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,500
What are you doing?

845
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:22,380
Gao Shanmao!

846
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:23,820
Gao Shanmao!

847
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,340
Gao Shanmao!

848
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,420
Gong Shanmao!

849
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:27,900
Gao Shanmao!

850
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,420
I'll kill you!

851
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,180
Don't shoot.

852
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,060
Don't move.

853
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,020
Don't shoot.

854
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,340
Don't shoot.

855
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,060
Hands up.

856
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:35,660
Don't move.

857
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,420
Don't shoot.

858
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,060
Go.

859
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,060
I don't want to force you.

860
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,020
You can choose not to help me.

861
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,300
Or you can pretend nothing happened.

862
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,940
Even if you think I'm a bad person,

863
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,460
you can tell me.

864
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,740
I won't help you.

865
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,980
But I won't choose to escape.

866
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,060
You want to know if I will tell you,

867
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,100
right?

868
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,020
You're a judge.

869
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,380
You're guilty and not guilty.

870
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,140
You can judge it yourself.

871
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,980
But I don't want to hear it from you.

872
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,100
I will use my own way

873
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,380
to clear Ma Shanbao's name.

874
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:49,260
Luo Wen.

875
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,180
I'm sorry.
