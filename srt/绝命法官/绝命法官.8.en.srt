00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 16

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Doctor, is there anything wrong?

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,000
Xiao Gang!

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,000
Xiao Gang!

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,000
What happened?

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,600
Xiao Gang is awake!

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,400
Xiao Gang!

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,200
Xiao Gang!

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Xiao Gang!

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,800
Xiao Gang!

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,800
Xiao Gang!

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,400
Fei request riddance 100 times

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,280
please go home

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,000
Go home who?

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,880
Brother

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,300
Take a photo with me.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's me.

18
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
What do you want?

19
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,120
A'bao is your nephew

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,520
and my good brother.

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,720
Isn't it worth

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,200
a good chat?

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,120
You come in alone.

24
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,320
Wait for me here.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,520
A'bao is still young.

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,800
He doesn't know what is good and what is bad.

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,080
That's why he was cheated.

28
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,360
What do you want to say?

29
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,120
You don't want to talk about A'bao?

30
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,960
Then let's talk about business.

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,360
I have nothing to talk about with you.

32
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,160
The 200,000 you gave A'bao

33
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,000
is just a business

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,560
that bribes people.

35
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,280
Lou Wei.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,960
Sasha knows you are bad.

37
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,280
Otherwise, how could she leave you

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,840
and take the child away?

39
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Sasha is a good girl.

40
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,000
She is so loving.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,760
Shut up.

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,560
So many men want to marry her.

43
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,440
But she chose you.

44
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,560
Guess if she

45
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,160
regrets it now.

46
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,320
I will talk to her another day.

47
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,040
How dare you!

48
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,320
You gave A'bao

49
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,840
200,000.

50
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,240
You gave him 200,000.

51
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,920
You made him confess.

52
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,520
But you killed A'bao.

53
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,840
But you dare not to go to the police.

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,400
Because you were fired.

55
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,640
You hate the police.

56
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,480
But I don't care.

57
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,880
I can go to the police.

58
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,240
And I can get the bonus.

59
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,960
Sasha is from the old city district.

60
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,480
You married her.

61
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,920
You are her own man.

62
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,920
Your own man

63
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,560
will take care of her.

64
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,640
You should understand it.

65
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,960
I am going to give a big gift to Han Kuilong.

66
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,640
You'd better move faster.

67
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,240
I am a man of few words.

68
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,240
I will be the first one to give you a gift.

69
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
I will be the first one to give you a gift.

70
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,240
I will be the first one to give you a gift.

71
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,240
I will be the first one to give you a gift.

72
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,240
I don't know what will happen if I get angry.

73
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Brother.

74
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
Brother.

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Doctor.

76
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,800
Can he hear us?

77
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
He can.

78
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,640
But he may not understand it now.

79
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
I will do it.

80
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Brother.

81
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,320
I am Xiaolian.

82
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,040
I am glad you are fine.

83
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,840
I was worried about you.

84
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,040
Do you remember what happened?

85
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,280
You were riding a motorcycle.

86
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,440
Someone crashed into you.

87
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,040
Do you remember?

88
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,200
Do you have anything to say?

89
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240
Brother.

90
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Answer me.

91
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Brother.

92
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
You have been unconscious for half a month.

93
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,240
Calm down.

94
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,640
He just woke up.

95
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,640
It takes time to fully recover.

96
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,240
Doctor Tang is right.

97
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,640
We can't rush the patient.

98
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,240
Give him some time.

99
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,640
Take your time.

100
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
Sorry.

101
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,640
I was too excited.

102
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:36,980
Are these the

103
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,800
to make compensation to the victim's family.

104
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,520
And you can't make up for

105
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,120
the damage.

106
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
I believe

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,480
that as a mother,

108
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,160
you can understand

109
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,960
what the defendant did.

110
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,480
But you can't forgive him.

111
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,400
You have to pay for

112
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,840
what you did.

113
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,320
The judgment

114
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,520
is not only a punishment for the defendant.

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,960
It's a hope

116
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,720
that similar tragedies

117
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,120
will never happen again.

118
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,080
The judgment

119
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,520
is that all the four charges

120
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,800
of the defendant, Huang Juan,

121
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,960
have been established.

122
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,080
The judgment

123
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
is five years in advance.

124
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,880
Be careful along the way.

125
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,160
You're awake.

126
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,360
Aren't you happy?

127
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,920
I just woke up

128
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,720
and couldn't do anything else.

129
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,160
The doctor said

130
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,740
This can be done without any lip service.

131
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,880
Time is the problem.

132
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Why did I let them arrest me in prison this time?

133
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,160
Because when I left,

134
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,160
the country I had conquered in the past decades was gone.

135
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,160
It even took advantage of the crazy Qi Changrong.

136
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
I promised to go to jail,

137
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,160
so that someone could take the credit and take the benefits.

138
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,160
I and them are on the same boat.

139
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
It's all a deal.

140
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
A deal doesn't need to be fair.

141
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,160
To win, it's not how strong you are.

142
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,160
It depends on who has the least bottom line.

143
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,160
You are a wolf, but compared to your brother,

144
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,160
your brother is more ruthless and ferocious than you.

145
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,160
You brothers can help each other,

146
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,160
but if you do something bad, let your brother do it.

147
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
As long as my brother can get better,

148
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
I don't care about anything.

149
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,160
Dealing with your brother is also dealing with the Han family.

150
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,160
The Han family?

151
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
You killed that thief

152
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,160
just to give them an excuse to let that crazy dog come to check.

153
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,160
Your brother has been living in the hospital for a while.

154
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,160
That crazy dog will definitely make trouble.

155
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,160
We must stop.

156
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,160
But we can't hurt Yuanqi.

157
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
I understand.

158
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Take good care of your brother.

159
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
I understand.

160
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Come and take a look.

161
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
So many.

162
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Do you like this?

163
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
Tell me, Shanbao.

164
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,160
This child is so pitiful.

165
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
He's only 18 years old.

166
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,160
I've known his mother for a long time.

167
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,160
I saw him this morning.

168
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,160
He cried so much that he couldn't open his eyes.

169
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Who did it?

170
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
If I knew who did it,

171
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,160
he would have gone down to die with A'bao.

172
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
He's from your Jiucheng Gang.

173
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Me? I don't have a gang.

174
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,160
Everyone living in Jiucheng District is a family.

175
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,160
I, Qi Changlong, like to protect children.

176
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
So cute.

177
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
Xiaojun.

178
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Xiaojun.

179
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Mom!

180
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Xiaojun!

181
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
Xiaojun!

182
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Give me back my child!

183
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Xiaojun!

184
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
My child!

185
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
Do you have children?

186
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
No.

187
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Madam is asking you now.

188
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Not you.

189
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,160
The crime happened at 7 a.m. that day.

190
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Where were you?

191
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
At home.

192
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,160
With my girlfriend.

193
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Yes.

194
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,160
Do you want me to describe the details?

195
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,160
Did you ask me to keep you for 48 hours?

196
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,160
How many cases are you carrying?

197
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,160
You know it in your heart.

198
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,160
I can arrest anyone who comes out.

199
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,160
You should know who killed A'bao.

200
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,160
I know, so I don't need to call you.

201
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,160
You caught A'bao because he was hit by a steel.

202
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Do you think he would let A'bao go easily?

203
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,160
You mean Ma Shanbao hit a steel?

204
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,160
Tang, don't pretend to be ignorant in front of me.

205
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,160
You police pretend to be righteous.

206
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,160
How many bad things have you done?

207
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,160
You know better than me who did it.

208
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
You bastard.

209
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Don't go too far, Qi Changlong.

210
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
What?

211
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,160
Are you going to arrest me now?

212
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
If not,

213
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
I'll leave.

214
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,160
I told you to leave.

215
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
Leave.

216
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
Get up.

217
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,160
Leave.

218
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,160
Leave.

219
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Han Ertao.

220
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,160
You are not a good aunt.

221
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Why are you here?

222
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,160
Have you ever thought about your own mother?

223
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,160
I'm afraid she can't sleep well in the coffin.

224
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,160
If you are so filial,

225
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,160
then go down and be filial to your mother.

226
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
Be careful. Don't fall.

227
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,160
I'll deal with you.

228
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,160
Qi Changlong, don't make trouble.

229
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Hello.

230
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,160
A'bei, they took Xiaoxuan away.

231
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
What did you say?

232
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
It's Qi Changlong.

233
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Qi Changlong, I can bear the car he has.

234
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Don't be afraid, Shasha.

235
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
Go home and lock the door and watch your daughter.

236
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
He will be fine.

237
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
I'll bring him back.

238
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
A'wei.

239
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,160
Wait for me.

240
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,160
Qi Changlong, come to me if you can.

241
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
Don't disturb my family.

242
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,160
A'wei, I told you I'm impatient.

243
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
I hate to coax kids.

244
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
If you coax them twice,

245
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160
I'll slap you.

246
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
I'll help you steal and rob.

247
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
Let my son go first.

248
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,160
Look.

249
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Who said we have no business to talk about?

250
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,160
We can talk about it.

251
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Madam, come here.

252
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Do you have paper?

253
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,160
Xiaoxuan.

254
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
Xiaoxuan.

255
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
Xiaoxuan.

256
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
Xiaoxuan.

257
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,160
It's okay.

258
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
I'm here.

259
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
It's okay.

260
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Don't cry.

261
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
It's okay.

262
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
It's okay.

263
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,160
Don't cry.

264
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
It's okay.

265
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
I haven't started yet.

266
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
I'm writing the words.

267
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,160
I saw Qi Changlong leave.

268
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
What?

269
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
The detention center is full?

270
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
I can't put him in.

271
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,160
You gave me some useful clues.

272
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,160
I'll open a room to take care of him.

273
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
Didn't the suspect who broke into my brother's room

274
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,160
get replaced by you?

275
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,160
The suspect is called Ma Shambang.

276
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
No.

277
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
No.

278
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
We should change it now.

279
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,160
We should call the victim Ma Shambang.

280
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
For your brother, Han Gang,

281
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,160
you have a good reason to kill Ma Shambang.

282
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
Madam.

283
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
If you have any evidence,

284
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,160
you won't just call me back to ask questions.

285
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Instead, you'll go to the Flying Tiger Team

286
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
and bring me here in the middle of the night.

287
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,160
No need to wait until the middle of the night.

288
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,160
If you want to go to jail,

289
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,160
I can send you in at any time.

290
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
I'm warning you.

291
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,160
Don't make things worse.

292
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
You're not your brother or your father.

293
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Don't make yourself look so bad.

294
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,160
I want all the blood, violence and violence to stop.

295
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,160
That Ma Shambang,

296
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,160
are you sure he's the murderer who broke into my brother's room?

297
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
If it wasn't him,

298
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,160
why would someone want to kill him to avenge his death?

299
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,160
You're so capable.

300
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Why did you let this person

301
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,160
break into my brother's ward last night?

302
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
He's from Qi Changrong?

303
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
He's not from Qi Changrong.

304
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
Are you sure?

305
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,160
The people from the Old City Gang

306
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,160
are all from Qi Changrong.

307
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,160
They're all from Qi Changrong.

308
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,160
They're all from Qi Changrong.

309
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,160
The people from the Old City Gang

310
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,160
can smell the smell of their own body from afar.

311
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,160
Coach.

312
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
You're looking for me?

313
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
Qin Yiwei,

314
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
I was going to leave like this.

315
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
There's really no need to say goodbye.

316
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Your problem,

317
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,160
your family's problem,

318
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,160
I really can't solve it.

319
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,160
I don't want it to end up being my problem.

320
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
You guys go find the Zheng family to help.

321
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
I'm leaving.

322
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
No need to say goodbye.

323
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Don't say anything.

324
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Just close your eyes.

325
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
Give me your hand, dear.

326
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,160
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

327
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,160
I'll try to find the person who can help you.

328
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,160
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

329
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
I'll try to find the person who can help you.

330
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,160
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

331
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

332
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,160
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

333
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
I'm here.

334
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Come with me.

335
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
Okay, you can sit down.

336
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Yes, don't open your eyes yet.

337
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
So beautiful.

338
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
Wait a minute.

339
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
Very soon,

340
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
you can open your eyes.

341
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Open your eyes.

342
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,160
Happy birthday.

343
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,160
Happy birthday to you.

344
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,160
Happy birthday to you.

345
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Happy birthday to you.

346
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,160
Happy birthday to you.

347
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
Come, make a wish.

348
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
Blow out a candle.

349
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Thank you.

350
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
Hello, what's wrong?

351
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,160
Okay, you watch her for me.

352
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
I'll be right there.

353
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
What's the matter?

354
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
I've been investigating the fire in the wooden house.

355
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
I suspect that the person who died in the prison was a scapegoat.

356
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
There should be a black hand in the wood fire.

357
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
What's the situation now?

358
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
I know a person called Liu Mao.

359
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
We used to play together when we were kids.

360
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
Lin Jian said that she heard him bragging

361
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,160
that she had seen the real murderer of the fire.

362
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,160
Then she left the station and disappeared.

363
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,160
Someone told me on the phone

364
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,160
that she had seen him in the city.

365
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,160
Then go to the city.

366
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
Let's go.

367
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Today is your birthday.

368
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,160
Birthdays can be celebrated anytime.

369
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,160
Hurry up.

370
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,160
You can only cut the cake when I come back.

371
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Why?

372
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Because if you don't wait for me to come back,

373
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,160
it will explode.

374
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Okay.

375
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Okay, go.

377
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,160
I'm sorry.

378
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
Wait for me. Come back soon.

379
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,160
It's this person

380
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,160
who entered Han Gang's room.

381
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,160
Who is he?

382
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,160
Watch the next video.

383
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,160
This is the same person.

384
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,160
I didn't expect Han Lie to be good at drawing.

385
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,160
Who is he?

386
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,160
He doesn't look like a little mixed-race.

387
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,160
Of course not.

388
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,160
You know him?

389
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Judge Qin, Tang Ducha is here.

390
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Tang Ducha.

391
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Can I have a word with you?

392
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Sit.

393
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Aren't you investigating the case of Ma Shanbao?

394
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
Do you have any clues?

395
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
Special Investigation Department is following up.

396
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,160
I came this time to ask you about something else.

397
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,160
How are you and your son?

398
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,160
Did you have a fight?

399
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Nothing.

400
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
What's wrong?

401
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,160
He went to the hospital the night before.

402
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,160
I didn't hear him say he was not feeling well.

403
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
How did you know?

404
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Because of Ma Shanbao's case,

405
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
when I was looking for Han Lie to enter the palace,

406
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,160
he told me that someone had entered his brother's ward.

407
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,160
So I went to the hospital to check the surveillance footage.

408
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,160
I saw this picture.

409
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
This picture?

410
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
And this one.

411
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Judge Qin, I want to know

412
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,160
why your son went into Han Gang's ward

413
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
and wore a white coat.

414
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
This picture is from the night before.

415
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,160
I saw it.

416
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,160
I saw it.

417
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,160
It's a white coat.

418
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
This picture looks a bit strange.

419
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,160
I'll go back and ask.

420
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,160
This is Han Gang's ward.

421
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,160
The one who ran into Han Gang was your car.

422
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,160
Now your son is wearing a white coat to see Han Gang.

423
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Do you really think there is nothing to do with this?

424
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,160
I dare not answer your question.

425
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,160
I'll go back and ask him.

426
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,160
The suggestion is that you should bring him to the police station

427
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,160
and let us ask.

428
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,160
Of course, you can investigate again.

429
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
This is your right.

430
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,160
This is the best way to get rid of his suspicion.

431
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,160
What suspicion?

432
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
You know what I'm investigating.

433
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
Okay.

434
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
I'll go back and arrange it.

435
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,160
I'll let you know again.

436
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,160
Okay.

437
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,160
I'll go back and ask.

438
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,160
I'll go back and ask.

439
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,160
I'll let you know again.

440
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,160
I'll go back and ask.

441
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
I'll let you know again.

442
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,160
I'll go back and ask.

443
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,160
I'll let you know again.

444
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,160
I'll go back and ask.

445
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,160
I'll go back and ask.

446
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
I'll go back and ask.

447
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
I'll go back and ask.

448
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
I'll go back and ask.

449
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,160
I'll go back and ask.

450
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,160
I'll go back and ask.

451
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,160
I'll go back and ask.

452
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,160
I'll go back and ask.

453
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,160
Yi Wei, where?

454
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,160
Have you dropped out of school? I'll pick you up.

455
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Dad, do you remember the ice cream shop next to the gas station?

456
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
I do.

457
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,160
We used to go there every week.

458
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,160
I remember that mom loves to eat lemon ice cream.

459
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,160
She said that ice cream with no sugar is healthier.

460
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,160
But I don't like it. I like to eat sweet food.

461
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,160
I know.

462
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,160
But I also bought some ice cream.

463
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
Is it good?

464
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
It's so bad.

465
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,160
I also went there last week.

466
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,160
That shop closed down.

467
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
Where are you now?

468
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,160
Why did you go to the hospital?

469
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Why did you go to Han Gang's ward the other day?

470
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Someone saw you.

471
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
Someone found you.

472
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,160
I just want them to see me.

473
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,160
I'm so tired.

474
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,160
I can't hold on.

475
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
You haven't answered me.

476
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Why did you show up there?

477
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,160
Mom never acts like you.

478
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,160
I'm not your prisoner.

479
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,160
I don't want to answer your question.

480
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
I'm sorry.

481
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,160
I'm sorry.

482
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,160
I'm sorry.

483
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,160
I'm sorry.

484
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
I'm sorry.

485
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
I'm sorry.

486
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
I'm sorry.

487
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
I'm sorry.

488
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
I'm sorry.

489
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,160
I'm sorry.

490
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
I'm sorry.

491
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
I'm sorry.

492
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,160
I'm sorry.

493
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,160
I'm sorry.

494
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,160
I'm sorry.

495
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
I'm sorry.

496
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,160
I'm sorry.

497
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,160
I'm sorry.

498
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
I'm sorry.

499
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,160
I'm sorry.

500
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,160
I'm sorry.

501
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,160
I'm sorry.

502
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,160
I'm sorry.

503
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,160
I'm sorry.

504
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
I'm sorry.

505
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,160
I'm sorry.

506
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,160
I'm sorry.

507
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,160
I'm sorry.

508
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
I'm sorry.

509
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,680
Let's go to Tony richer.

510
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Look for 👩라고स?

511
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,760
He went to work early today.

512
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,760
He just left.

513
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,640
👩 corro

514
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,880
What's the matter

515
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,640
Thank you for caring for my brother.

516
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,760
This is my job.

517
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
I said

518
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,040
this is for you.

519
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,760
No, thanks.

520
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,880
I really don't need it.

521
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,320
Why is your son

522
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,720
in Han Gang's ward

523
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,520
and wearing a white coat?

524
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,080
I don't dare to answer this question.

525
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,280
I'll go back and ask him.

526
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,080
You should take him to the police station right away.

527
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,200
Let us ask him.

528
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,280
This is the best way

529
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,160
to clear his suspicion.

530
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,520
What suspicion?

531
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,240
You're back.

532
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,840
Why are you sitting here alone

533
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
and not turning on the TV?

534
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm thinking about something.

535
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,840
Thinking about something?

536
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
What are you thinking about?

537
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,160
I'm thinking

538
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,680
if I can really think about it,

539
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,760
it won't be hard to accept the truth.

540
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,600
Okay.

541
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,120
Let's not talk about the formula.

542
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,600
By the way, what are the arrangements today?

543
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,200
I've arranged everything.

544
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,160
First,

545
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,280
we'll go to eat

546
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,520
the self-serve meal that I've been looking forward to for a long time.

547
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,800
Then,

548
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,840
we'll go to sing K-pop.

549
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,480
You've been looking forward to

550
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,240
the self-serve meal that I've been looking forward to.

551
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:27,880
It's us.

552
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,760
You've been looking forward to singing K-pop, right?

553
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,920
It's not me who kicked it.

554
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,160
It's Brother Shi.

555
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,200
He said he wanted me to accompany you to go crazy.

556
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,560
He doesn't want you to know that

557
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,480
you're working all day

558
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,840
and thinking about something.

559
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,680
You're right.

560
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,440
Go and change your clothes.

561
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,800
I'll go after I wash my hands.

562
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,680
Okay.

563
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,320
The birthday gift is in the bag.

564
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,120
You can check it yourself.

565
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,440
Thank you.

566
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,120
Birthday gift?

567
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,680
This is my breakfast for tomorrow.

568
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,040
Sister,

569
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,480
you're just a nurse.

570
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,560
You gave such a generous gift.

571
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,480
Is it a high-level interview?

572
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,480
You violated the customs regulations.

573
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,160
No.

574
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,200
This is your birthday gift.

575
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
This is...

576
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,840
This is Han Lie.

577
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,680
He gave it to me today.

578
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,720
Han Kui Long's son, Han Lie.

579
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,840
His eldest brother lives in the nursing home.

580
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,000
He said thank you

581
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,920
for taking care of his brother.

582
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,880
Thank you for taking care of his brother

583
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,520
and giving you a watch worth more than ten thousand yuan.

584
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,560
I don't know either.

585
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,840
I just saw it.

586
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,240
You opened it.

587
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,560
I told you not to deal with people like him.

588
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,280
I didn't.

589
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,680
He gave it to me

590
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,200
at the subway station when I was off work today.

591
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,400
No need to say it.

592
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,080
Let's go.

593
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,520
Then you...

594
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,640
Change your clothes quickly.

595
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,600
Han Lie.

596
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,840
Tang Xuan.

597
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,160
Madam.

598
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,600
What's up?

599
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,600
Hongwawei's small square.

600
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,800
Can you get there in 15 minutes?

601
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,240
Okay.

602
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,760
That's it.

603
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,240
Hello?

604
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,560
Hello, Director Tang.

605
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,400
I'm Qin Yu.

606
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,560
I want to talk to you again.

607
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,440
Okay.

608
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,720
I'm at your house now.

609
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,600
Can we meet now?

610
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
I'll find you later.

611
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,160
I'm outside now.

612
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,400
Okay.

613
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,880
Okay.

614
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
How is it, madam?

615
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,640
Did you find out who entered my brother's ward?

616
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,560
Tang Xuan.

617
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,760
Here's your watch.

618
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,480
I didn't give it to you.

619
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,320
I don't care what your purpose is.

620
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,160
Anyway, from now on,

621
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,840
stay away from him.

622
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,720
Why?

623
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,720
I don't want my family

624
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,400
to have anything to do with the Black Society.

625
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,440
How is the Black Society?

626
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,000
Dad.

627
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,800
Where are you?

628
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,400
I'm at the police station.

629
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,400
Why are you at the police station?

630
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,760
Can you pick me up?

631
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,520
Okay.

632
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,320
Don't go away. I'll be right there.

633
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:16,720
Okay.

634
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,280
Be careful, mom.

635
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,160
оюke.

636
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,360
I'm back.

637
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,680
You can come at any time.

638
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,360
to see Hangang.

639
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,720
Do you really think

640
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,280
there's nothing to do with it?

641
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,480
You should take him to the police station right away

642
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,760
and let us ask him.

643
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,680
This is the best way

644
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,560
to clear his suspicion.

645
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,440
The police station

646
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,160
Dad.

647
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:24,880
Stop talking.

648
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,760
Eat something first.

649
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,240
Yi Wei.

650
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,600
Now we're here.

651
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,840
What we should remember

652
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,760
is the unhappy things.

653
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,960
If I want to leave,

654
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,240
you should stay with me.

655
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,920
Is it because of me?

656
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,320
Yes.

657
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,000
I won't be happy if something happens to you.

658
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,840
I also gave him a bonus.

659
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,320
If you really want to leave,

660
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,000
let's leave together.

661
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:10,800
Okay.

662
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,760
Okay.

663
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,000
Man.

664
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,600
When will that end?

665
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,680
Tomorrow.

666
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,120
It still hasn't taken me this far.

667
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,560
It's time to eat.

668
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,560
Come on, it's delicious.

669
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,560
Delicious.

670
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,560
Eat some.

671
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
Here.

672
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,560
Eat some vegetables.

673
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Thank you.

674
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
It's good that you're back.

675
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
This place will always be your home.

676
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,560
I'm happy.

677
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Okay.

678
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,560
Eat.

679
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Thank you.

680
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,560
Here.

681
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,560
Thank you.

682
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
Eat more.

683
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,560
Brother Wei.

684
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,560
Can you help me?

685
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
Brother Wei.

686
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,560
I won't make things difficult for you.

687
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,560
I don't need you to do it.

688
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
I will arrange it well.

689
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,560
Okay?

690
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,560
Today, I will return this favor to you.

691
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Be careful.

692
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,560
Okay.

693
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,560
Be careful.

694
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,560
Brother Ying, what's wrong?

695
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
My stomach is growling.

696
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
No.

697
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
I need to go to the toilet.

698
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,560
Five minutes.

699
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
I will be done soon.

700
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
Okay.

701
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,560
Sir.

702
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,560
Do you know the air leak in the tire?

703
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
Air leak?

704
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,560
You don't ask why I came here?

705
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,560
I will tell you if you want to.

706
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,560
I think

707
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,560
there are some things you want to know.

708
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,560
Really?

709
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,560
Last night, around 7 or 8 p.m.,

710
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,560
I drove through a small square

711
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,560
near the house of Tang Ducha.

712
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,560
I saw him meeting Han Lie.

713
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,560
Tang Xuan and Han Lie?

714
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,560
Yes.

715
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,560
Han Lie was holding a very precious watch

716
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,560
in his hand.

717
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,560
You mean...

718
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,560
Han Lie seemed to be thanking Tang Ducha.

719
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,560
Actually,

720
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,560
it's obvious.

721
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,560
Tang Ducha hid the evidence

722
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
of Ma Shanbao's absence

723
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,560
because he knew Han Kuilong

724
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,560
would seek revenge from the Old City Gang.

725
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,560
In order to stop the assassination,

726
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,560
he leaked the news

727
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,560
to Han Lie.

728
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,560
He chose

729
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,560
to sacrifice Ma Shanbao.

730
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,560
He is a police officer.

731
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,560
Can a police officer

732
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,560
ignore the lives of ordinary citizens?

733
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,560
You said you saw them

734
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,560
meet in private.

735
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,560
You even saw Tang Xuan's meeting.

736
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,560
They just met.

737
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,560
Tang Ducha

738
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,560
could say that he was

739
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,560
seeking evidence from Han Lie.

740
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,560
He was holding a watch in his hand.

741
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,560
But it doesn't mean he accepted it.

742
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,560
If I were a judge,

743
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,560
I would say

744
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,560
that the evidence is not bad.

745
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
Then why did you

746
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,560
tell me about this?

747
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,560
The police can

748
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,560
find the truth

749
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,560
if they find the evidence.

750
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,560
Let me tell you my thoughts.

751
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,560
Okay?

752
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,560
Two weeks ago,

753
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,560
you introduced me to a client.

754
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,560
But you didn't tell me

755
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,560
that the client stole your car.

756
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Then,

757
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
the client was involved in Han Gang's case.

758
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,560
You knew about this.

759
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,560
But you didn't tell me

760
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,560
anything.

761
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,560
Yes. You finally told me

762
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,560
that you had a way

763
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,560
to prove the client's innocence.

764
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,560
But what happened?

765
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,560
You saw it.

766
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,560
Then today,

767
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,560
you suddenly came to tell me these things.

768
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,560
Do you want to turn this

769
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,560
story that was not told

770
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,560
into a joke?

771
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,560
Or do you want to

772
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,560
know what I'm going to do

773
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,560
in the future?

774
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,560
Yes.

775
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,560
You guessed it right.

776
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,560
This matter

777
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,560
is indeed related to me.

778
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,560
A'Bing, thank you.

779
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,560
You have half an hour.

780
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,560
Enough.

781
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,560
Brother Wei,

782
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,560
I'm sorry.

783
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,560
I'll pay you back

784
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,560
in the next life.

785
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,560
SP650, please help.

786
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,560
We're being attacked in the city.

787
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,560
That's right.

788
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,560
This case

789
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,560
is closely related to me.

790
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,560
Because the person who hit Han Gang

791
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,560
was my son,

792
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,560
Qin Yiwei.

793
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,560
I didn't want to get you involved.

794
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,560
I just wanted you to help Ma Shanmao.

795
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,560
But what happened later

796
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,560
was totally out of control.

797
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,560
Judge Qin Yu,

798
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,560
you're the teacher

799
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,560
I taught at the law school.

800
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,560
You taught me

801
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,560
what is law,

802
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,560
what is justice,

803
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,560
what is law

804
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,560
that you can't bow to.

805
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
I've always respected you.

806
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,560
Let's go.

807
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,560
Bastard, he said he has half an hour.

808
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,560
Police!

809
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,560
Don't move!

810
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,560
Don't shoot!

811
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,560
Don't move!

812
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,560
Don't shoot!

813
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,560
Don't shoot!

814
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,560
Don't move!

815
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,560
Don't move!

816
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,560
Don't move!

817
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,560
Don't move!

818
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,560
I don't want to force you.

819
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,560
You can choose not to help me.

820
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,560
Or you can just pretend

821
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,560
nothing happened.

822
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,560
Even if you think I'm a bad person,

823
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,560
you can tell me.

824
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,560
I won't help you.

825
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,560
But I won't choose to escape.

826
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,560
You want to know

827
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,560
that I'm going to punish you, right?

828
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,560
You're a judge.

829
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,560
You can judge

830
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,560
if you're guilty or not.

831
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,560
But I don't want to hear from you.

832
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,560
I'll use my own method

833
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,560
to clear Ma Shanbao's name.

834
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,560
Luo Wen,

835
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,560
I'm sorry.

836
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,560
I'm sorry.
