1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,760
Was that a brief rule to look at and go straight to the premier?

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,200
Please stand straight.

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,240
Judge Qin.

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,400
Your son should have been in Hanzhang's room

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,960
with his jacket on.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,240
a filth spray.

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,760
It has your DNA on it.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,280
If they compare the filth spray

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,320
with the O2O,

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,320
but

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,000
it doesn't have my name on it,

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,400
how would they know it's me?

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,120
Someone has stolen our trash can this morning.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,560
The trash has your filth spray

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,920
and your DNA on it.

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,320
If you compare the three things,

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,720
it can prove

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,640
that you've been to the scene.

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,040
Gluttony

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,800
Luo Wen.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,920
Can I come in?

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,880
Is there an important matter?

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,120
I have to leave.

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,640
Tang Xuan came to see me.

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,960
MP Ma Sh spiders people

26
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,440
They are not actual killers

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,320
It's just a form ofkill

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:22,960
It's not real

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,120
They are not guilty

30
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:45,000
If there is no Market

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,320
I'm not responsible for keeping winery

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,160
unhappy

33
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,960
It's a different story to find the murderer.

34
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,560
If today, as an agent lawyer,

35
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,160
what do you think I should tell my client?

36
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,760
I don't think you should take this case.

37
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,760
Luo Wen, you have your own goal.

38
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,760
You are a good lawyer.

39
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,760
Thank you. I'm leaving.

40
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Yi Wei.

41
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Dad.

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
Stay at home. Wait for me to come back.

43
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
What happened?

44
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,760
I'll tell you when I come back.

45
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
I'll be right back.

46
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
Dad.

47
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
The police found you.

48
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,760
I guess they will take action soon.

49
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,760
Han Kuilong is in the police station.

50
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,760
That's what I'm most worried about.

51
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,760
Dad, you can't wait to go to court.

52
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,760
Are we really leaving this time?

53
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,760
We really have to leave this time.

54
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,760
Okay.

55
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,760
Pack up your things.

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,760
We'll leave tonight.

57
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Okay.

58
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Son.

59
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,760
We may never come back.

60
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,760
Dad, Ma Shanshan's death,

61
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
was it caused by us?

62
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,760
Not us. It was me.

63
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,760
I'll be a ten-year-old man if I keep talking about it.

64
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,760
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Don't say thank you.

66
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
Pack up your things.

67
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,760
The police found the suspect.

68
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,760
The suspect is the one who killed the police.

69
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,760
The suspect is the one who killed the police.

70
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
The suspect is the one who killed the police.

71
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
The suspect is the one who killed the police.

72
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,760
The suspect is the one who killed the police.

73
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,760
The suspect is the one who killed the police.

74
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,760
The suspect is the one who killed the police.

75
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,760
The suspect is the one who killed the police.

76
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
The suspect is the one who killed the police.

77
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
The suspect is the one who killed the police.

78
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
The suspect is the one who killed the police.

79
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,760
The suspect is the one who killed the police.

80
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,760
The suspect is the one who killed the police.

81
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,760
Thepts

82
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:27,480
Episode

83
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
What's wrong?

84
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
Someone is following us.

85
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
He found us.

86
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
Let's go.

87
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,760
Go.

88
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
Go.

89
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Hello.

90
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
Hello, Mr. Hu.

91
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,760
I need you to apply for a ban on going out.

92
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Who are you going to ban?

93
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Qin Yu's son, Qin Yiwei.

94
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,760
Why?

95
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
I'll explain to you later.

96
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,760
He is going to the airport.

97
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
You must stop him before he leaves.

98
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Hey, you are still on vacation.

99
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,760
If you interfere in this case again,

100
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,760
let the people in the internal investigation department know.

101
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,760
The consequences will be very serious.

102
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,760
If he leaves Haogang,

103
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
everything will be too late.

104
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
Believe me.

105
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,760
I have evidence to prove it.

106
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
I've been with you for so many years.

107
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
When have I ever tried to control people?

108
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Brother Qi didn't tell you when he would come back.

109
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
If you continue like this,

110
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,760
you will be down before he comes back.

111
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
Oh, my.

112
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
Hello.

113
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Where are you, Mr. Qin?

114
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
I can't find you in the court.

115
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
What's the matter?

116
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
Oh, my.

117
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,760
It turns out that the saying that fate makes people is true.

118
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
If you ask me for help,

119
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
if it doesn't matter,

120
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
the chief inspector of the central investigation team, Hu San,

121
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
won't come to the door.

122
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
Tell me the point.

123
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,760
He came to ask me to sign a restriction on the travel ban.

124
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,760
The restriction is called Qin Yiwei.

125
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
I don't remember what your son's name is.

126
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,760
But the address above is written.

127
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
The address where you live now.

128
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
Did you sign it?

129
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Mr. Qin.

130
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,760
I'm looking for you because I hope you understand.

131
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
I'm just doing my job.

132
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
I'm definitely not trying to take revenge on you.

133
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Dad, are you okay?

134
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
I'm fine.

135
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
I have something to do.

136
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
I'll be back in about two hours.

137
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
Don't leave this room.

138
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Don't contact anyone, okay?

139
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
If you're hungry,

140
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
call for takeout.

141
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
Don't call again.

142
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
I'll buy you something to eat later.

143
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
Dad.

144
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Listen to me.

145
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Don't leave this room.

146
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
I'll be back soon, okay?

147
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
I'm sorry.

148
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
I'm sorry.

149
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
I'm sorry.

152
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
I'm sorry.

154
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
I'm sorry.

155
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
Yi Wei.

156
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,760
We'll definitely get through this.

157
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,760
You're my son.

158
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,760
I won't leave you.

159
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
No matter what happens, I won't.

160
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Understand?

161
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Lock the door.

162
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,760
The End

163
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
Everyone is a private.

164
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
You should talk to them.

165
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,760
Cancel the restriction.

166
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
You're talking about your son.

167
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
He was killed in a car accident.

168
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
I have some misunderstandings with the director of the Tang's.

169
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
He didn't have time to report.

170
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
I'll explain to them.

171
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
Is that so?

172
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,760
Does the director have evidence?

173
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,760
He said he'd give it to me later.

174
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
You signed the restriction without evidence.

175
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
This is against the rules.

176
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
I can complain to you.

177
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,760
Your son is going abroad.

178
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
And it's just right.

179
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,760
It's when the police suspect him.

180
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
Yes.

181
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
My son has asthma.

182
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
And it's getting worse.

183
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
I've looked for a lot of ways.

184
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
I've looked for a lot of doctors.

185
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
I couldn't cure it.

186
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Until I found this special guest.

187
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
So I have to go there tonight.

188
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
You have children.

189
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,760
As a parent, you should know.

190
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,760
As long as you use the reason for the disease.

191
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
Can cancel the restriction.

192
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
I won't do that.

193
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Am I not clear?

194
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,760
I did mention the procedure.

195
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,760
But it's not like I don't have the heart.

196
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,760
Helping the police is our duty.

197
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,760
As long as he can fill the evidence.

198
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,760
Fill the evidence.

199
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Everything is legal.

200
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
What if the evidence is insufficient?

201
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
It's not my fault.

202
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,760
The delay of my son's treatment.

203
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
Causing him to get worse.

204
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
Even if there's a life threat.

205
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
You must be responsible.

206
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
If I go to complain.

207
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
You will be judged as the coldest.

208
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
The most inhuman judge.

209
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
For you to be elected to the court.

210
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
Do you think you have a chance?

211
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
I have.

212
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Sometimes, it's real to investigate.

213
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
It depends on luck.

214
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
But as a person.

215
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,760
The opinion is very important.

216
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Thank you.

217
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,680
Take these two and go right away.

218
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,440
An Wei disappeared!

219
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:21,800
What?

220
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,320
Are you sure?

221
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,280
They said Ji Mushroom took An Wei away.

222
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,260
I went to Da Jia to look for him,

223
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,060
but he hasn't come back yet.

224
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,720
Is there any way?

225
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
Say something!

226
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,880
You made Wei like this.

227
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,360
You can't leave him alone!

228
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,440
Where are you now?

229
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,440
I'm home.

230
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,920
I hope Qi Qi will show up.

231
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,960
But she's not here.

232
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,760
Wei hasn't come back.

233
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:52,960
Okay.

234
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,160
I'll be right there.

235
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,480
Yiyue.

236
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,600
You can leave the room now.

237
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,400
But I have something to do.

238
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,680
Wait for me in the room.

239
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,000
Hello, Yiyue.

240
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,400
I heard it.

241
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,240
I'm sorry.

242
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,040
I'm sorry.

243
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,800
I'm sorry.

244
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,600
I'm sorry.

245
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,480
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,360
I'm sorry.

247
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,320
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
I'm sorry.

249
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,240
Bye.

251
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,960
He has been waiting for me all day long.

252
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,680
I object.

253
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,040
Go for the new8000 power.

254
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,760
It's late.

255
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,240
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,800
Hello?

257
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,920
Qi Shaorong,

258
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,120
you finally answered the phone.

259
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,360
My door will always be open for you.

260
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,800
I can't go to your house right now.

261
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,840
We'll talk outside.

262
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,920
Where?

263
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,120
Do you remember the temple?

264
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,200
Yes.

265
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,440
We used to go to the God's Palace Opera when we were kids.

266
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,360
You wanted to...

267
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,040
That's good.

268
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,080
See you later.

269
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,160
Who is it?

270
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,040
Weiwei, it's Grandma.

271
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,120
Weiwei.

272
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,320
Grandma, come in.

273
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,320
Weiwei, why are you here?

274
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
What happened?

275
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,040
I'm here to see you.

276
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
I'm here to see you.

277
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
I'm here to see you.

278
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
I'm here to see you.

279
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
What happened?

280
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,200
Grandma,

281
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
I have something to tell you.

282
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,240
Sha Sha.

283
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,640
You should know why I'm here.

284
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,640
Why are your eyes swollen?

285
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,840
Did you cry?

286
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,360
I want to go into the incense.

287
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,680
I want to bless Weiwei.

288
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,600
Good.

289
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,480
Brother Qi, there's no one inside.

290
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,600
It's safe.

291
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,360
Fei Xuan, you two stay here.

292
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,960
Okay.

293
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,440
I want to ask you a question in front of the gods.

294
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,080
Answer me honestly.

295
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,280
You asked me to come here

296
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,800
just to ask me something.

297
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,960
Where is Wei?

298
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
She's safe.

299
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,360
Where is she?

300
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,480
I don't know.

301
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
I don't know.

302
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,480
I don't know.

303
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,280
I don't know.

304
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,360
Where is she?

305
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,440
L ind because ofμη.

306
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,400
She ran away

307
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,360
and left.

308
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,680
And she won't tell me?

309
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,120
I asked her

310
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,520
to let me look after you.

311
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,680
You asked her?

312
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,720
We're from the Jiu Hero annex.

313
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,200
How's this related to each other?

314
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
I'm not going to tell you.

315
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
I can only say this much.

316
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
Call him now.

317
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
I want to talk to him.

318
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
You're only concerned about him now.

319
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,080
Didn't you take the child back to your mother's house?

320
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,280
Lou Wei is a useless man.

321
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,680
He broke into the goods

322
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,480
and left you to run away.

323
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
That's it.

324
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
You're not going to tell me?

325
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
I'm not going to tell you.

326
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,280
I'm not going to tell you.

327
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
Where is Wei?

328
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
Where is he?

329
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,680
She's his wife.

330
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
You shouldn't ask her.

331
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
Where is he?

332
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,080
Do you know who you ran into?

333
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,880
There aren't many people and cars on that road.

334
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,880
It should be a wanderer.

335
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
But I don't know why

336
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,880
I didn't want to stop.

337
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,280
It's not necessarily a bad person who ran away.

338
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,480
It's often because of his instinct.

339
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,880
He was too panic because of his fear.

340
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
Especially a young man like you.

341
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,080
The court will also consider these factors.

342
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,880
Why didn't your father take you to turn yourself in?

343
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
He did take me.

344
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
I didn't dare to go.

345
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,680
So everything he's doing now

346
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
is for me.

347
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,880
Where is he now?

348
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
He's gone.

349
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
He's gone.

350
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
Wei.

351
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,880
With these secret lives,

352
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,480
you'll suffocate yourself.

353
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,280
Do you know that?

354
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,280
I know.

355
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,880
So I decided to turn myself in.

356
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,480
I'm still a lawyer.

357
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,280
I will be with you.

358
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
Where is he?

359
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,680
He's nearby.

360
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,480
I asked you where he is.

361
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,480
Every tree here is the same.

362
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Where is he?

363
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Over there.

364
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,880
Where is he?

365
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
He's over there.

366
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
Where is he?

367
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
He's over there.

368
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,880
Where is he?

369
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,080
I don't know.

370
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,880
It's hard for me to find him.

371
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,680
Let's go.

372
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
Come on.

373
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
Stay by your side.

374
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,480
Come on.

375
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
Let's go.

376
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Let go.

377
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
Khong-He.

378
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,340
I haven't death neither.

379
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,400
I heard that it has been filled with thorns andivea's flavor.

380
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,680
But I actually didn't think it that way.

381
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,980
God, quickly kill this whole thing now.

382
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,580
Go!

383
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,180
Everything, you...

384
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,000
Yes, God.

385
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,140
Since the death of Han Though not dead,

386
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,140
A'Ming!

387
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,140
A'Ming!

388
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,140
A'Ming!

389
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,140
A'Ming!

390
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,140
A'Ming!

391
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:44,140
Hello, if you need any message, please leave your message behind the signal.

392
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:50,140
Yi Wei, I'm on my way back. Is your sister okay?

393
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,140
You...

394
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,140
Dad, I'm going to turn myself in. I'm sorry.

395
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,140
Tang Xuan!

396
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,140
Senior, do you have the result?

397
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,140
The result of the gene comparison test you asked for is out. It's in there.

398
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,140
What is the result?

399
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,140
I think you asked for it.

400
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,140
Thank you, Senior. I owe you a favor.

401
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,140
Where is my son Qin Wei's father?

402
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,140
He's recording a statement.

403
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,140
Chief Qi, you can't go in.

404
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,140
My son is recording a statement. I have to accompany him.

405
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,140
He already has a lawyer to accompany him.

406
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,140
Who?

407
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,140
Lawyer Shen Ning.

408
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:58,140
Please recall the incident and tell us in detail.

409
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,140
I just got the driver's license.

410
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,140
There were few cars on the road that day.

411
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,140
I want to try to accelerate.

412
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,140
But there seems to be a car behind me that wants to overtake.

413
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,140
I was on the left lane.

414
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,140
My attention is concentrated on the right.

415
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,140
Who knew it would overtake from the left?

416
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,140
I hit it in the end.

417
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:31,140
Weiwei, didn't you say you hit a hiker?

418
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,140
How did it turn into a car crash?

419
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,140
I remember it wrong.

420
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,140
After the accident, did you tell anyone except Lawyer Shen?

421
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,140
No.

422
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,140
No.

423
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:55,140
I drove home and hid in the room.

424
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,140
I didn't tell anyone.

425
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,140
Even my father didn't know.

426
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,140
I'll repeat what you said.

427
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,140
You were an intern driver.

428
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,140
You were driving on the left lane.

429
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,140
Then a car suddenly overtook.

430
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,140
You were very scared.

431
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,140
When the car overtook, the car collided.

432
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,140
Because you were scared, you didn't stop.

433
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,140
You drove home.

434
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,140
You didn't tell anyone when you got home.

435
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,140
Then the car was stolen.

436
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,140
This is your statement. Is there any problem?

437
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,140
You went without caring after the accident.

438
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,140
I didn't know what to do.

439
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,140
Did you get off the car?

440
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,140
Did you try to get close to the victim?

441
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,140
No.

442
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,140
Do you remember what car you hit?

443
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,140
Motorbike.

444
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,140
Check the record.

445
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,140
There was only one car accident that day.

446
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,140
It was a private car colliding with a motorcycle.

447
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,140
The driver fled.

448
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,140
The motorcycle driver was seriously injured.

449
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,140
The victim was not Liu Lanhan.

450
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,140
It was Han Kuilong's son, Han Gang.

451
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,140
Stop.

452
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,140
I need to talk to my client.

453
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,140
Don't ask anymore.

454
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,140
Up!

455
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,140
You're late.

456
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,140
Do you know where they event is now?

457
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,140
You we're holding the hearing!

458
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,140
He layers all the real restrictions on the car scene.

459
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,140
Put the car on the side.

460
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:01,140
The car in the car is just left here.

461
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,140
What by the way,

462
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,140
after meeting the judge,

463
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,380
I've always thought

464
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,940
you're the most intelligent

465
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,300
among the people I know.

466
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,060
I didn't expect you to do

467
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,420
such a stupid thing.

468
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,300
This is

469
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,380
the DNA test report.

470
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,980
The sample of the smoke

471
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,180
on the smoke-smoking spray

472
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,100
found at the scene of the car accident

473
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,540
is completely compatible with the DNA

474
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,780
of the suspect I recently suspected.

475
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,100
Let me tell you.

476
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,380
If the process of your search

477
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,460
is illegal,

478
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,340
including the garbage in the head,

479
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,100
it's the same as the one in the body.

480
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,620
The same thing can't be done

481
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,060
as evidence.

482
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,260
Judge Qin is really Judge Qin.

483
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,980
Since the suspect has come to turn himself in,

484
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,140
I'll apply for a new sample

485
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,580
and re-test it.

486
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,540
The result is the same.

487
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,420
Weiwei,

488
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,020
why are you lying to your grandmother?

489
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,580
I'm afraid you'll stop me

490
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,140
from turning myself in if you know who I ran into.

491
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,020
I really want to say that

492
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,180
I don't want to get anyone else involved.

493
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,620
I...

494
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,180
I don't need a lawyer to represent me.

495
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,620
I just want to take the responsibility.

496
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,020
I understand.

497
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,620
You've grown up.

498
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,620
You can make your own decisions.

499
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,100
But my grandmother will be with you.

500
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,820
I will protect your interests

501
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,860
in the legal level.

502
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,740
Don't be afraid.

503
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,700
Okay.

504
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,020
Continue.

505
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,540
Continue.

506
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,780
Yiyue.

507
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,180
Yiyue.

508
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,340
Judge Qin, you can't do this.

509
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,300
Say something.

510
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,300
Say something.

511
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,540
Son.

512
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,700
It's okay.

513
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,340
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

514
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,300
Father,

515
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,740
I told them what happened that day.

516
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,020
It's all my fault.

517
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,700
It has nothing to do with you.

518
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,820
I'm sorry.

519
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,380
I'm sorry.

520
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,180
I'm sorry.

521
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:32,940
I'm sorry.

522
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,660
I'm sorry.

523
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,500
I'm sorry.

524
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,300
I'm sorry.

525
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,140
I'm sorry.

526
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,740
What crime do you want to sue him?

527
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,740
He is charged with

528
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,060
breaking the road traffic law

529
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,140
and escaping responsibility.

530
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,340
We have arrested him.

531
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,100
I want to bail him.

532
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,620
Did you file for bail?

533
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,060
Don't you think I know?

534
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,220
He's rejected.

535
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,260
It's estimated that he may be jailed.

536
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,300
So during this period,

537
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,780
he can't be bailed.

538
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,940
We will lock the suspect

539
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,660
directly in the detention center.

540
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:05,860
Take her away.

541
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:06,860
Yes, sir.

542
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:08,660
Don't be afraid.

543
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,100
I'll figure something out.

544
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,220
Trust me.

545
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,180
Trust me.

546
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,140
Don't be afraid.

547
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:15,900
Trust me.

548
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,140
Let's go.

549
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,260
I have something to ask you.

550
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,780
We'll talk when we get back.

551
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:35,820
Okay.

552
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:49,700
Wang Xuan.

553
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,300
I told you

554
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,540
not to interfere

555
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,540
in the investigation

556
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,660
during your vacation.

557
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,060
Didn't you get the ban

558
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,260
for going out and entering the capital?

559
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,500
I collected the information

560
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,460
and took action.

561
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,180
But you didn't approve

562
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,500
the police's authority.

563
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,380
Do you think the internal investigation department

564
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,620
doesn't have enough evidence to sue you

565
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,140
and you took the initiative to go to the door?

566
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,180
Yes.

567
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,500
It's my fault.

568
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,540
But it's worth it

569
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,300
to find the real murderer.

570
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,860
Okay.

571
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,300
After the case is over,

572
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,780
I think the internal investigation department

573
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,620
will think you're capable.

574
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,580
If you break the case,

575
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:27,780
they won't

576
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,940
target you anymore.

577
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,660
The case won't end so soon.

578
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,900
Qin Yu has been misleading me.

579
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,780
Stop talking about it.

580
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,980
Didn't her son say

581
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,980
his father didn't know about it?

582
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:39,900
Besides,

583
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,700
you have no evidence to prove

584
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,780
that Qin Yu is involved.

585
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,700
If you want me to resign,

586
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,020
I can go find evidence.

587
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,380
I've been in charge of this case.

588
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,420
Okay.

589
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,540
I can let you investigate.

590
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,100
But you have to promise me

591
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,620
not to target Qin Yu anymore.

592
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,540
Because I don't want others

593
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,140
to think you're thoughtful.

594
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,140
Do you understand?

595
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,260
I won't let him go so easily.

596
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,600
I'll go find some Roundruk

597
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,580
for you to back down.

598
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:08,820
Thank you.

599
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,900
Whatever he did last night,

600
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:31,140
heこんな nabi можно nabi doa總

601
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,340
I did nothing wrong.

602
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,940
Shouldn't I do that?

603
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,660
You did

604
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,500
so many abnormal things before.

605
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,660
Now I have a reasonable explanation.

606
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,820
Let me ask you again.

607
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,020
You'd better tell me honestly.

608
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,860
In the process of helping Weiwei hide,

609
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,140
have you ever done anything illegal?

610
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,620
Have you ever involved innocent people?

611
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,340
I'm not afraid of anything.

612
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,540
I'm not afraid of anything.

613
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,740
I'm not afraid of anything.

614
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,980
I'm not afraid of anything.

615
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,140
I'm not afraid of anything.

616
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,300
I'm not afraid of anything.

617
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,460
I'm not afraid of anything.

618
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,620
I'm not afraid of anything.

619
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,780
I'm not afraid of anything.

620
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,940
I'm not afraid of anything.

621
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,100
I'm not afraid of anything.

622
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,260
I'm not afraid of anything.

623
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,420
I'm not afraid of anything.

624
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,580
I'm not afraid of anything.

625
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,740
I'm not afraid of anything.

626
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,900
I'm not afraid of anything.

627
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,060
I'm not afraid of anything.

628
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,220
I'm not afraid of anything.

629
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

630
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,540
I'm not afraid of anything.

631
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,700
I'm not afraid of anything.

632
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

633
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,020
I'm not afraid of anything.

634
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,180
I'm not afraid of anything.

635
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,180
I'm not afraid of anything.

636
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,340
I'm not afraid of anything.

637
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,500
I'm not afraid of anything.

638
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

639
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,820
I'm not afraid of anything.

640
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,980
I'm not afraid of anything.

641
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,140
I'm not afraid of anything.

642
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,300
I'm not afraid of anything.

643
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,460
I'm not afraid of anything.

644
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,620
I'm not afraid of anything.

645
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,780
I'm not afraid of anything.

646
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,940
I'm not afraid of anything.

647
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,100
I'm not afraid of anything.

648
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,260
I'm not afraid of anything.

649
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,420
I'm not afraid of anything.

650
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,580
I'm not afraid of anything.

651
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,740
I'm not afraid of anything.

652
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,900
I'm not afraid of anything.

653
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,060
I'm not afraid of anything.

654
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,220
I'm not afraid of anything.

655
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

656
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,540
I'm not afraid of anything.

657
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,700
I'm not afraid of anything.

658
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

659
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

660
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,020
I'm not afraid of anything.

661
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,180
I'm not afraid of anything.

662
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,340
I'm not afraid of anything.

663
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,500
I'm not afraid of anything.

664
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

665
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,820
I'm not afraid of anything.

666
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,980
I'm not afraid of anything.

667
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,140
I'm not afraid of anything.

668
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,300
I'm not afraid of anything.

669
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,460
I'm not afraid of anything.

670
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,620
I'm not afraid of anything.

671
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,780
I'm not afraid of anything.

672
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,940
I'm not afraid of anything.

673
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,100
I'm not afraid of anything.

674
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,260
I'm not afraid of anything.

675
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,420
I'm not afraid of anything.

676
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,580
I'm not afraid of anything.

677
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,740
I'm not afraid of anything.

678
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,900
I'm not afraid of anything.

679
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,060
I'm not afraid of anything.

680
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,220
I'm not afraid of anything.

681
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

682
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,540
I'm not afraid of anything.

683
00:36:54,540 --> 00:37:15,800
The

684
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,900
I've canceled the vacation.

685
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,500
I'm in charge of this case again.

686
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,100
You didn't ask me to go to the police station.

687
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,460
I just want to ask a few facts.

688
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,060
There will be no deviation in the direction of investigation.

689
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,780
It's fair for your son.

690
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,300
You don't object, do you?

691
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,500
That day, you said Ma Shanbao was a thief who stole cars.

692
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,980
But now, your son came to the police station to surrender.

693
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,100
He said he was the one who hit Han Gang.

694
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,980
Can you explain?

695
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,620
Yes.

696
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,780
Then you listen carefully.

697
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,820
I told you that day.

698
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,340
I found Ma Shanbao near my house.

699
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,140
And the police found Ma Shanbao a thief.

700
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,300
It has nothing to do with me.

701
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,460
Are you satisfied with this answer?

702
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,180
I showed you the surveillance photos of Qin Yivei

703
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,980
in the hospital.

704
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,020
You promised me that you would bring him to the police station

705
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,180
to help with the investigation.

706
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,500
But not long after,

707
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,180
I was reported by the police.

708
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,660
I'm going to be investigated internally.

709
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,660
You also blamed me for the night when I asked Han Lie to meet me.

710
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,260
You told me that you were already near my house.

711
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,900
So the person who most likely saw me

712
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,340
and Han Lie meeting is you.

713
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,300
But the person who most likely reported me

714
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,780
is Zhou Luo Wen, a lawyer.

715
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,220
You really don't know anything about this matter.

716
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,580
Is it really just a coincidence?

717
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,140
The mechanism of the complaint

718
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,660
is strictly confidential to the person who reported me.

719
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,460
You shouldn't reveal it to the third party.

720
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,820
As a judge, I can't just sit around and do nothing.

721
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,980
But we are not having a formal conversation this time.

722
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,340
I can pretend that I didn't hear what you said just now.

723
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,300
But I want to remind you that

724
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,020
it is the law to violate the confidentiality system.

725
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,020
Qin Yivei's statement

726
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,380
has clearly explained the time and location of the accident.

727
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,980
But that night,

728
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,860
you came to the police station in person to report the car.

729
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,220
According to the record,

730
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,780
you said that the car was stolen around 10 a.m.

731
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,980
I want to ask how you knew that the car was stolen at 10 a.m.

732
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,860
I want to ask

733
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,700
what is the difference between what you said

734
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,260
and what your son Qin Yivei said.

735
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,540
He and I are relatives.

736
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,260
Unless you actively reveal the confession

737
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,740
and let me know that he didn't do anything when he was misled,

738
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,620
otherwise, I will apply for the original reason to choose Min Zexuan

739
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,140
to avoid making a statement that is unfavorable to him.

740
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,780
Judge Qin is really amazing.

741
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,940
Thank you for your cooperation.

742
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,420
This matter is not over yet.

743
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,460
I will come again.

744
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,540
Hello, Douglas, my old friend.

745
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,500
I came to talk with you again

746
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,300
because the vision softly creeping

747
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,540
that this is why I was sleeping

748
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:38,580
and the visions that was planted in my brain

749
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:50,180
still remain within the sound of silence.

750
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:56,780
Nice.

751
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,740
Don't mind it.

752
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,860
It's been a long time since we talked.

753
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,020
I want to borrow this song

754
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,380
to help you break the case.

755
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,780
The real murderer is dead,

756
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,620
but the accomplice is still free from the law.

757
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,620
Judge Qin Yu is a good judge.

758
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,620
He has always been a good judge.

759
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,420
Don't forget that you used to trust him.

760
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,140
You were hurt by your hand

761
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,300
because you protected him.

762
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,460
That doesn't mean he can break the law.

763
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,020
He didn't break the law.

764
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,100
He just used the benefits of himself

765
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,700
when he was implementing the legal procedures.

766
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,340
This is smart.

767
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
Smartness is not a crime.

768
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,580
Smartness is not a crime.

769
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,540
He has implicated the innocent.

770
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,940
The court is judging the evidence.

771
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,660
It can't judge morality and conscience.

772
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,940
Why do you keep saying good things for him?

773
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,500
I do appreciate him,

774
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,220
but I hope you don't be so persistent.

775
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,540
Don't talk about me.

776
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,700
Let's talk about you.

777
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:58,900
How is it going?

778
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,860
Is there any new progress in Liu Meng?

779
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,660
Well...

780
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,700
I've been in touch with him.

781
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,140
He is hesitating

782
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,620
to get the surgery.

783
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,620
You said he had a late pregnancy.

784
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,420
Could it be...

785
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,260
Yes.

786
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,020
So it's really hard to talk to him about other things.

787
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,620
If this clue is broken...

788
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,260
Let's not talk about this.

789
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,340
Let's talk about serious things.

790
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,900
I want you to learn this song.

791
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,020
This song is divided into two parts.

792
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,180
If you learn it,

793
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,140
I can help you to harmonize the notes.

794
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,620
It's romantic, isn't it?

795
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,780
I learn it?

796
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,300
Yes.

797
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,740
I need to learn it for a long time.

798
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,740
It doesn't matter how long it takes.

799
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,980
Just try it.

800
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,020
Try it.

801
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,540
There's something.

802
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,660
Can you hear the sound?

803
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,020
Help me check it.

804
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,500
What?

805
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,140
I spent 10,000 yuan to buy these.

806
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,220
Not bad. Take your time.

807
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:51,980
Help me check it.

808
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,820
I'll pack up my things.

809
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:53,980
Hey.

810
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:01,820
I'll go now.

811
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,380
You're here.

812
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:24,820
Thank you.

813
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:25,240
Here.

814
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,300
the court hold a court hearing on this matter.

815
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,440
protector to justice.

816
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,460
New faze and a lawsuit in both cases.

817
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:43,940
I It is reset the destroyer.

818
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,700
Can't complete.

819
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,280
It is reset the destroyer.

820
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,480
Now, we are

821
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,360
only family.

822
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,000
If I can't get your cooperation,

823
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,360
I will be in a difficult position.

824
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,480
As long as it's for Yiwei's good,

825
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,240
I will cooperate with you in everything.

826
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,120
Okay.

827
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,120
Wait.

828
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,320
Where did you find it?

829
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,520
It's not me.

830
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,240
Weiwei found it.

831
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,120
Yiwei?

832
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,120
Luo Wen.

833
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,640
What's up?

834
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,960
I heard that

835
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,240
your son has turned himself in.

836
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,840
What about you?

837
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,280
Everyone does wrong things

838
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,640
at a price.

839
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,400
Why can you be in danger?

840
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,000
Because...

841
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,800
Because you are a judge.

842
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,840
I blindly believe that

843
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,160
I have to pay the price.

844
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,520
I will stop the case.

845
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,000
I will leave here.

846
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,960
I will reflect on myself.

847
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,160
What should I do after this?

848
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,360
Luo Wen.

849
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,120
You don't need to do this.

850
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,680
Justice

851
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,640
is the core of the rule of law.

852
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,320
The rule of law

853
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,320
is the foundation of maintaining social order

854
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,640
and stability.

855
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,280
It guarantees the rights and freedoms

856
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,160
of each of us.

857
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,120
It protects us

858
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,080
from violence and oppression.

859
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,080
It's fair,

860
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,520
just

861
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,600
and equal.

862
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,160
It's the moral standard of our society.

863
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,680
You taught me all these.

864
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,680
I hope you can teach yourself

865
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,480
to think about it.

866
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,240
Do you deserve to be a judge?

867
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,080
After opening part 2 of the《 Ela Publishing》

868
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,200
I and Mr.Wang A sleeve

869
00:46:53,200 --> 00:47:17,520
show the

870
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,800
role and power of the Rabbi

871
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:27,840
religious

872
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,600
Life is lonely

873
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:41,800
Un etwa

874
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,080
sc contour

875
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:20,080
The road is built for good days

876
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:24,080
But look at the heart in pain

877
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,080
Do you know that I am not good enough?

878
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,080
Do you know that I am not good enough?

879
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,080
Looking at the horizon

880
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,080
But I am rational

881
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,080
Go to the edge of the foot and stand still

882
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,080
Why can't you be silent?

883
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,080
I can't kill the road back

884
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,080
The road is built for good days

885
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,080
But look at the heart in pain

886
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:16,080
The road is built for good days
