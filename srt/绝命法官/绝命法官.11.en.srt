00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,040
Do not have anything to do with it

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,680
because the police in crime Wild Grace

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,240
found a battalion of anglers

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,600
There's your DNA on it.

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,040
If they compare the DNA of the filth spray

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,120
with the one O2O used...

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,240
But...

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,840
There's no name on the filth spray.

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,200
How do they know it's me?

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,960
Someone broke our trash can this morning.

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,400
There's your filth spray in the trash.

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,800
There's your DNA in it.

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,160
If you compare the three things,

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,560
it can prove that

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,480
you've been to the scene.

May I come in?

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,800
Do you've something important

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,000
to tell me?

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,540
Tang Xuan came to find me.

29
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,440
I guess he's like me.

30
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,680
he knew you were leading him wrongly.

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,120
So he went to you

32
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,800
to persuade you to testify against me.

33
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,920
Are you worried?

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,440
He was sure to tell me

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,640
that Ma Shanbao wasn't the murderer.

36
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,280
He would find out the truth sooner or later.

37
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,840
It's a different story to find out the murderer.

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
If today

39
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,560
I, as an agent lawyer,

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,560
would have to go to the police,

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,280
how would I persuade my client?

42
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
I don't think

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,040
you should take this case.

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,720
Ou Wen,

45
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,320
you have your own goal.

46
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,080
You're a good lawyer.

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,240
Thank you.

48
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,040
I'm leaving.

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,880
Thank you.

52
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,800
Stay at home.

53
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,520
Wait for me.

54
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,480
What happened?

55
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
I'll tell you when I'm back.

56
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,880
Dad.

57
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,160
Dad.

58
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,680
The police have found out it's you.

59
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,000
I guess they'll act quickly.

60
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,920
It's a shame that Long is in the police camp.

61
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,600
That's what I'm most worried about.

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,320
If you're arrested,

63
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,320
you won't be able to go to court.

64
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,560
Are we really leaving this time?

65
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,120
We're really leaving this time.

66
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,480
Okay.

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,320
Pack up your things.

68
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,640
We'll take the plane tonight.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,560
Okay.

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,240
Son.

71
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,440
We might not be back.

72
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,240
Dad.

73
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,720
Did we cause

74
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,320
Ma Shanbao's death?

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,760
Not us.

76
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,160
It's me.

77
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,320
I'll be in jail

78
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,760
for ten years.

79
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,920
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,720
Don't say thanks.

81
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,840
Pack up your things.

82
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,520
The police have found out it's you.

83
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,040
I guess they'll act quickly.

84
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,440
That's what I'm most worried about.

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,920
I guess they'll act quickly.

What happened?

130
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,120
Someone is following us.

131
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,880
가.

132
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,280
Lucky that he didn't notice it?

133
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,640
What?

134
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,640
Hello.

135
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,540
Hello, Mr. Hu.

136
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,540
I need you to apply a ban to get out of jail.

137
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,340
Who are you going to prohibit?

138
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,540
Qin Yu's son, Qin Yiwei.

139
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,140
Why?

140
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,340
I'll explain it to you later.

141
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,540
He's on his way to the airport.

142
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,500
We must stop him before he leaves.

143
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,220
You're still on vacation.

144
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,340
If you interfere in this case again,

145
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,940
the internal investigation department will know

146
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,980
that the consequences will be severe.

147
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,020
If we let him leave Haogang,

148
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,300
it'll be too late.

149
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,580
Trust me.

150
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,900
I have solid evidence to prove him.

151
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,220
I've been with you for so many years.

152
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,140
When did I ever accuse anyone?

153
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,420
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,300
Brother Qi didn't tell you when he'll be back.

155
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,220
If you continue like this,

156
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,900
you'll be in trouble if he's not back.

157
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,740

Hello?

161
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,940
Where are you, Mr. Jin?

162
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,900
I can't find you in the court.

163
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,180
You want to see me?

164
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,700
I see.

165
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,020
It turns out that

166
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,060
fate is really a big deal.

167
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,700
If you're not looking for me,

168
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,860
if it's not important,

169
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,300
Chief Investigation Officer Hu

170
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,740
won't come to the door.

171
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,660
Tell me the point.

172
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,740
He came to ask me to sign a

173
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,380
restricted access order.

174
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,540
The person who restricted it was

175
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,860
Qin Yiwei.

176
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,500
I don't remember what your son's name is.

177
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,300
But the address above

178
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,140
is written.

179
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,100
The address where you live now.

180
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,820
Did you sign it?

181
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:10,940
Yes.

182
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,700
I'm looking for you

183
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,940
because I hope you understand.

184
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,620
I'm just doing my job.

185
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,380
I'm definitely not trying to take revenge on you.

186
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,460
Dad, are you okay?

187
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,580
I'm fine.

188
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,100
I have something to do.

189
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,020
I'll be back in two hours.

190
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,900
Don't leave this room.

191
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,380
Don't contact anyone, okay?

192
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,300
If you're hungry,

193
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,620
call for takeout.

194
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,060
Don't call again.

195
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,700
I'll buy you something to eat later.

196
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,860
Dad.

197
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,180
Listen to me.

198
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,660
Don't leave this room.

199
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,940
I'll be back soon, okay?

200
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,940
Yiwei.

201
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,060
We'll get through this.

202
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,100
You're my son.

203
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,780
I won't abandon you.

204
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,820
No matter what happens, we won't.

205
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,340
Okay?

206
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,700
Lock the door.

207
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,260
Hey.

208
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,700
We're all private.

209
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,860
Let's talk it over.

210
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,580
Cancel the restriction.

211
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,340
Huse said your son

212
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,940
committed suicide after the accident.

213
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,900
I have some misunderstandings with the director of the party.

214
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,300
He didn't have time to report it.

215
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,580
I'll explain it to them.

216
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,260
Is that so?

217
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,900
Does Huse have any evidence?

218
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,540
He said he'd give it to me later.

219
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,820
You signed the restriction without evidence.

220
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,100
It's against the rules.

221
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,420
I can complain to you.

222
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,060
Your son is going abroad.

223
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,900
And the police are suspecting him.

224
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,300
Yes.

225
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,980
My son has asthma.

226
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,740
It's getting worse.

227
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,260
I've tried many ways

228
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,860
and tried many doctors.

229
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,340
I've found this specialist.

230
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,220
I must go there tonight.

231
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,020
You have children.

232
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,900
You should know it well as a parent.

233
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,180
You can cancel the restriction

234
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,620
just because you're treating him.

235
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,820
I won't do that.

236
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,540
I've made it clear.

237
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,060
I've made it clear.

238
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,180
But it's not without a precedent.

239
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,220
It's our duty to help the police.

240
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,740
As long as he's on the case,

241
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,300
everything will be legal.

242
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,220
What if the evidence is insufficient?

243
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,340
It's not my responsibility.

244
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,740
The delay in my son's treatment

245
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,380
makes him more and more serious.

246
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,100
If he's in danger,

247
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,780
you must take the responsibility.

248
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,900
If I go to complain,

249
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,300
you'll be judged as

250
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,260
the most cold-blooded and inhuman official.

251
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,420
Do you think you can win

252
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,860
if you go to the court?

253
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,580
Sometimes,

254
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,460
luck is the key.

255
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,180
But from a humanitarian standpoint,

256
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,540
it's important to see the truth.

257
00:13:59,180 --> 00:13:59,820
Thank you.

258
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,500
Wei is missing.

259
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:16,940
What?

260
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,260
Are you sure?

261
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,140
They said Ji Changrong took Wei away.

262
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,060
I went to his house to find him,

263
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,940
but he never came back.

264
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,460
Wei,

265
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,260
don't you always have a way?

266
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,260
Say something!

267
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,380
You made Wei suffer.

268
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,900
You can't leave him alone!

269
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,980
Where are you now?

270
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,460
I went home.

271
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,900
I hoped a miracle would happen,

272
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,020
but it didn't.

273
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,820
Wei never came back.

274
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,020
Okay.

275
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,220
I'll be right there.

276
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,060
Yiwei.

277
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,940
You can leave now.

278
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,820
But I have something to do.

279
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,300
Wait for me in the room.

280
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,420
Hello, Yiwei.

281
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:29,900
I heard you.

282
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,900
He waited for me all day and night.

283
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,540
Yeah.

284
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:45,860
Change a battery.

285
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,460
No battery.

286
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:06,780
Hello?

287
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,060
Ji Changrong,

288
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,220
you finally answer the phone.

289
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,300
My door will always be open for you.

290
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,060
I can't go to your house now.

291
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,940
Let's talk outside.

292
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:17,940
Where?

293
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,220
Do you remember the temple?

294
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,420
Yes.

295
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,860
We used to go to the magic show when we were kids.

296
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,500
You wanted to...

297
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,220
Okay.

298
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,180
See you later.

299
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,100
Who is it?

300
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,940
Weiwei, it's your grandma.

301
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:48,980
Weiwei.

302
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,180
Grandma, come in.

303
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,100
Weiwei, why are you here?

304
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,140
What happened?

305
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:02,980
Grandma,

306
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,380
I have something to tell you.

307
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,060
Sasha.

308
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,420
You should know why I've come here.

309
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,300
Why are your eyes swollen?

310
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,580
Did you cry before?

311
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,460
I want to take the incense in

312
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,460
to ensure Weiwei's safety.

313
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,340
Okay.

314
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,100
Brother Qi.

315
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,500
Brother Qi, there's no one inside.

316
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,540
It's safe.

317
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,460
Pei Xue, you two stay here.

318
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:45,940
Okay.

319
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,740
I want to ask you a question in front of Shen Ming.

320
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,220
You answer me.

321
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,820
You asked me to come here

322
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,980
just to ask me a question.

323
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,220
Where is Wei?

324
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,500
She's safe.

325
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,620
Then where is she?

326
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,900
Lou Wei got into trouble.

327
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,860
I arranged her to run away.

328
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,980
She left.

329
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,020
She didn't tell me.

330
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,780
She left and asked me to take good care of you.

331
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,100
She asked you to take care of me?

332
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,980
We're all from the old city.

333
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,940
Is it a problem to take care of each other?

334
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,420
You arranged her to run away.

335
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,340
Where did she go?

336
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,740
She's well-behaved.

337
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,100
I'll tell you.

338
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,300
That's all I can say.

339
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,940
Call her now.

340
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,380
I want to talk to her.

341
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,740
You're only concerned about her now.

342
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,700
Didn't you take the child back to your mother's house?

343
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,860
Lou Wei is a useless man.

344
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,060
She got into trouble and left you to run away.

345
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,380
That's it.

346
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,780
Where is Wei?

347
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,620
Where is she?

348
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,100
She's his wife.

349
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,500
You shouldn't ask her.

350
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Where is she?

351
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,340
Do you know who you bumped into?

352
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,180
There weren't many people and cars on that road.

353
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,060
It was a wanderer.

354
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,660
But I don't know why

355
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,180
I didn't want to stop.

356
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,540
It's not necessarily a bad person to run away.

357
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,020
It's often because of his instinct

358
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,100
that he was too scared to run away.

359
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,300
Especially young people like you.

360
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,380
The court will consider these factors.

361
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,300
Why didn't your father take you to turn yourself in?

362
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,260
He did take me.

363
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,140
I didn't dare to go.

364
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,940
So everything he's doing now

365
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,780
is for me.

366
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,180
Where is he now?

367
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,860
Wei,

368
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,300
with these secrets,

369
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,540
you'll suffocate yourself.

370
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,380
Do you know that?

371
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,180
I know.

372
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,260
So I decided to turn myself in.

373
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,580
I'm still a lawyer.

374
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,460
I'll be with you.

375
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,740
Where is she?

376
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,820
She's nearby.

377
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,980
Where is she?

378
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,980
I'll ask you.

379
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,780
Where is she?

380
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,380
Every tree here is different.

381
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,180
Where is she?

382
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,180
Over there.

383
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,780
Where?

384
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,780
Dig it up.

385
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,100
Dig it up!

386
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,580
🦃 onions

387
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,180

398
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,780
Hello.

399
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,780
If you need any message,

400
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,780
please leave your message behind the signal.

401
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,780
Yi Wei.

402
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,780
I'm on my way back.

403
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,780
Is your sister okay?

404
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,780
Dad, I'm going to turn myself in.

405
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,780
I'm sorry.

406
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,780
I'm sorry.

407
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,780
I'm sorry.

408
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,780
I'm sorry.

409
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,780
I'm sorry.

410
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,780
I'm sorry.

411
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,780
I'm sorry.

412
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,780
I'm sorry.

413
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,780
I'm sorry.

414
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,780
I'm sorry.

415
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,780
I'm sorry.

416
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,780
Tang Xuan.

417
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,780
Sister, do you have the result?

418
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,780
The result of the gene comparison test you asked for is out.

419
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,780
It's in there.

420
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,780
What's the result?

421
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,780
It should be what you want.

422
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,780
Thank you, Sister.

423
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,780
I owe you a favor.

424
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,780
Where is my son Qin Yi Wei's father?

425
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,780
He's recording a statement.

426
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,780
Chief Qin, you can't go in.

427
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,780
My son is recording a statement.

428
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,780
I have to accompany him.

429
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,780
He already has a lawyer to accompany him.

430
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,780
Who?

431
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,780
Lawyer Shen Ning.

432
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,780
Please, Mr. Qin Yi Wei,

433
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,780
try to recall the incident.

434
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,780
Tell us in detail.

435
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,780
I just got the license.

436
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,780
There were few cars on the road that day.

437
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,780
I wanted to try accelerating.

438
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,780
But there seemed to be a car that was going to overtake.

439
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,780
I was on the left lane.

440
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,780
My attention was concentrated on the right.

441
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,780
Who knew he would overtake from the left?

442
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,780
In the end, I hit him.

443
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,780
I hit him.

444
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,780
I hit him.

445
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,780
I hit him.

446
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,780
I hit him.

447
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,780
I hit him.

448
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,780
Wei Wei,

449
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,780
didn't you say you hit a wanderer?

450
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,780
How did it turn into a car crash?

451
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,780
I remembered it wrong.

452
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,780
After the accident,

453
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,780
did you tell anyone

454
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,780
except for Lawyer Shen?

455
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,780
No.

456
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,780
I...

457
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,780
I drove the car home right away

458
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,780
and hid in the room.

459
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,780
I didn't tell anyone.

460
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,780
I didn't...

461
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,780
I didn't even know my dad.

462
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,780
I'll repeat what you said.

463
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,780
You were an intern driver.

464
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,780
You were driving on the left lane.

465
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,780
Then a car suddenly overtook you.

466
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,780
You were scared.

467
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,780
When the other person overtook you,

468
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,780
the car collided.

469
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,780
Because you were scared,

470
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
you didn't stop.

471
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,780
You drove home.

472
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,780
You didn't tell anyone when you got home.

473
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,780
Then the car was stolen.

474
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,780
This is your confession.

475
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,780
Is there any problem?

476
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,780
You ignored it

477
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,780
after the accident.

478
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,780
I didn't know what to do.

479
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,780
Did you get off the car?

480
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,780
Did you try to get close to the victim?

481
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,780
No.

482
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,780
Do you remember

483
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,780
what car you hit?

484
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,780
Motorbike.

485
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,780
The inspection records

486
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,780
show that there was only one traffic accident.

487
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,780
A private car hit a motorcycle.

488
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,780
The driver of the private car fled.

489
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,780
The motorcycle driver was seriously injured.

490
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,780
The victim was not Liu Lanhan.

491
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,780
It was the son of the Han family,

492
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,780
the Han Kuilong of the Han family,

493
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,780
Han Gang.

494
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,780
Stop. Stop for now.

495
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,780
I need to communicate with my client.

496
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,780
Don't ask anymore.

497
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,780
Judge Qin.

498
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,780
I heard that your son came to turn himself in.

499
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,780
I'm sorry.

500
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,780
It's my request to leave the capital.

501
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,780
I know.

502
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,780
You're the one who followed me.

503
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,780
I always think

504
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,780
you're the wisest person

505
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,780
I know.

506
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,780
I didn't expect you to do

507
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,780
such a stupid thing.

508
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,780
This is the DNA test report.

509
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,780
The sample of the smoke bomb

510
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,780
found at the scene of the car accident

511
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,780
and the night-time sample

512
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,780
are completely compatible

513
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,780
with the DNA of the suspect

514
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,780
I suspect recently.

515
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,780
I'm telling you.

516
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,780
If the process of your search

517
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,780
is illegal,

518
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,780
including the garbage in the head,

519
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,780
it can't be used as evidence.

520
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,780
Judge Qin is really a judge.

521
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,780
Since the suspect has come to turn himself in,

522
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,780
I'll apply for a new sample

523
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,780
and re-examine it.

524
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,780
The result is the same.

525
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,780
The suspect has been found.

526
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,780
I'm afraid that

527
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,780
you can't turn yourself in.

528
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,780
I'm afraid that

529
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,780
you can't turn yourself in.

530
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,780
I'm afraid that

531
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,780
you can't turn yourself in.

532
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,780
Weiwei,

533
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,780
why are you lying to your grandma?

534
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
I'm afraid that you know

535
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,780
who I ran into

536
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,780
and you'll stop me from turning myself in.

537
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,780
I really want to say that

538
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,780
I don't want to

539
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,780
turn myself in.

540
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,780
I...

541
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,780
I don't need a lawyer to represent me.

542
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,780
I just want to take the responsibility.

543
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,780
I understand.

544
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,780
You've grown up.

545
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,780
You can make your own decisions.

546
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,780
I'll protect your interests

547
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,780
in the legal sense.

548
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,780
Don't be afraid.

549
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,780
Okay.

550
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,780
Go on.

551
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,780
Go on.

552
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,780
Yiwei.

553
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,780
Yiwei.

554
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,780
Judge Qin, you can't do this.

555
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,780
Let him say a few words.

556
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,780
Let him say a few words.

557
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,780
Son.

558
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,780
It's okay.

559
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,780
Don't be afraid.

560
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,780
I'm here.

561
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,780
Dad.

562
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,780
I told them

563
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,780
what happened that day.

564
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,780
It's all my fault.

565
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,780
It's none of your business.

566
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,780
What crime are you going to sue him for?

567
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,780
He's only guilty of

568
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,780
breaking the traffic law

569
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,780
and escaping from responsibility.

570
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,780
We've arrested him now.

571
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,780
I want to bail him out.

572
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,780
Did you apply for bail?

573
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,780
You think I don't know?

574
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,780
He's rejected.

575
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,780
He's likely to escape.

576
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,780
So during this period,

577
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,780
he can't be bailed out.

578
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,780
We'll lock the suspect

579
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,780
in the detention center.

580
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,780
Take him away.

581
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,780
Yes, sir.

582
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,780
Don't be afraid.

583
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,780
I'll figure something out.

584
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,780
Trust me.

585
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,780
Trust me.

586
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,780
Don't be afraid.

587
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,780
Trust me.

588
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,780
Let's go.

589
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,780
I have something to ask you.

590
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,780
We'll talk when we get back.

591
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,780
Wang Xun.

592
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,780
I told you

593
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,780
not to interfere

594
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,780
in the investigation

595
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,780
during the vacation.

596
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,780
Didn't you get the ban

597
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,780
from the capital?

598
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,780
I collected the information

599
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,780
and took action.

600
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,780
But you didn't approve

601
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,780
the police's power.

602
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,780
Do you think

603
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,780
the internal investigation department

604
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,780
doesn't have enough evidence

605
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
to sue you?

606
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,780
So you sent him to jail?

607
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,780
Yes.

608
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,780
It's my fault.

609
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,780
But it's worth it

610
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,780
to find the real culprit.

611
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,780
Okay.

612
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,780
After the case is over,

613
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,780
I think the internal investigation department

614
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,780
will see that you're capable.

615
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,780
If you solve the case,

616
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,780
they won't

617
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,780
keep targeting you.

618
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,780
The case won't end so soon.

619
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,780
Qin Yu has been misleading me.

620
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,780
Stop talking about it.

621
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,780
Okay?

622
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,780
Didn't his son

623
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,780
say

624
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,780
his father didn't know about it?

625
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,780
And

626
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,780
you have no evidence

627
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,780
to prove that Qin Yu

628
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,780
is involved.

629
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,780
If you want me to resign,

630
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,780
I can go find evidence.

631
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,780
Anyway,

632
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,780
I'm responsible for this case.

633
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,780
Okay.

634
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,780
I can let you investigate.

635
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,780
But you have to promise me

636
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,780
not to target Qin Yu again.

637
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,780
Because I don't want others

638
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,780
to think you're being thoughtful.

639
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,780
Do you understand?

640
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,780
I won't let him go so easily.

641
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,780
Did you ask Yi Wei to resign?

642
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,780
I was just about to ask you

643
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,780
if you asked Yi Wei

644
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,780
to hide, lie and lie to me.

645
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,780
He was hurt

646
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,780
by Han Kuilong's son.

647
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,780
Do you think he's still alive

648
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,780
after he was sentenced to prison?

649
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,780
He asked me to do it.

650
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,780
He regrets it.

651
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,780
He blames himself.

652
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,780
He wants to be responsible for his mistakes.

653
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,780
It's not wrong to do that.

654
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,780
Shouldn't he do that?

655
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,780
You had

656
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,780
so many unusual behaviors before.

657
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,780
Now I have a reasonable explanation.

658
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,780
Let me ask you one more time.

659
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,780
You'd better tell me honestly.

660
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,780
In the process of hiding Weiwei,

661
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,780
have you ever done anything illegal?

662
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,780
Have you ever implicated innocent people?

663
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,780
I'm not afraid of darkness.

664
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,780
The truth is the absolute truth.

665
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,780
Perfect.

666
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
Drunk.

667
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,780
Drunk with you and me.

668
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,780
Disgrace.

669
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,780
My face is all black.

670
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,780
Love and hate are all extinguished.

671
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,780
But they are just opposite.

672
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,780
Who is guilty?

673
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,780
Who is regretful?

674
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,780
I'll chase you with my life.

675
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,780
I'll be honest and honest.

676
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,780
I'll be sincere.

677
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,780
I'll change my mind.

678
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,780
I'll be ready for anything.

679
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,780
I'll be the best.

680
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,780
I'll be the best.

681
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,780
I'll be the best.

682
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,780
I'll be the best.

683
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,780
I'll be the best.

684
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,780
I'll be the best.

685
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,780
I'll be the best.

686
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,780
I'll be the best.

687
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,780
I'll be the best.

688
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,780
I'll be the best.

689
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,780
I'll be the best.

690
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,780
I'll be the best.

691
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,780
I'll be the best.

692
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,780
I'll be the best.

693
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,780
I'll be the best.

694
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,780
I'll be the best.

695
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,780
I'll be the best.

696
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,780
I'll be the best.

697
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,780
I'll be the best.

698
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,780
I'll be the best.

699
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,780
I'll be the best.

700
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,780
I'll be the best.

701
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,780
I'll be the best.

702
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,780
I'll be the best.

703
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
I'll be the best.

704
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,780
I'll be the best.

705
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,780
I'll be the best.

706
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,780
I'll be the best.

707
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,780
I'll be the best.

708
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,780
I'll be the best.

709
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,780
I'll be the best.

710
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,780
I'll be the best.

711
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,780
I'll be the best.

712
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,780
I'll be the best.

713
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,780
I'll be the best.

714
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,780
I'll be the best.

715
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,780
I'll be the best.

716
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,780
I'll be the best.

717
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,780
I'll be the best.

718
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,780
I'll be the best.

719
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,780
I'll be the best.

720
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,780
I'll be the best.

721
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,780
I'll be the best.

722
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,780
I'll be the best.

723
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,780
I'll be the best.

724
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,780
I'll be the best.

725
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,780
I'll be the best.

726
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,780
I'll be the best.

727
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,780
I'll be the best.

728
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,780
I'll be the best.

729
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,780
I'll be the best.

730
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,780
I'll be the best.

731
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,780
I'll be the best.

732
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,780
I'll be the best.

733
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,780
I'll be the best.

734
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,780
I'll be the best.

735
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,780
I'll be the best.

736
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,780
I'll be the best.

737
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,780
I'll be the best.

738
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,780
I'll be the best.

739
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,780
I'll be the best.

740
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,780
I've canceled my leave.

741
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,780
I will be in charge of this case again.

742
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,780
You didn't ask me to sue you,

743
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,780
which means this is a non-assessment.

744
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,780
I just want to ask a few things.

745
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,780
There will be no bias towards the investigation direction.

746
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,780
Your son's opinion is fair.

747
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,460
Right?

748
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,740
You said Ma Shanbao was a thief that day.

749
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:37,980
But now,

750
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,140
your son came to the police station to confess.

751
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,260
He said he was the one who hit Han Gang.

752
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,140
Can you explain?

753
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,620
Yes.

754
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,900
Then listen carefully.

755
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,980
I told you that day

756
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,540
Ma Shanbao was found near my house.

757
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,300
The police found Ma Shanbao a thief.

758
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,340
It has nothing to do with me.

759
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,580
Are you satisfied with this answer?

760
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,260
I showed you the surveillance photos

761
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,980
of Qin Yiwei in the hospital.

762
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,060
You promised me that you would bring him to the police station

763
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,060
to help with the investigation.

764
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,420
But not long after,

765
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,100
I was reported as a person

766
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,580
and I was to be investigated internally.

767
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,460
You also asked me to meet Han Lie

768
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,580
when I asked him to meet Han Gang.

769
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,780
You told me that

770
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,180
you were already near my house.

771
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,020
So the person who most likely saw me

772
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,340
and Han Lie meeting was you.

773
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,260
But the person who reported me as a person

774
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,740
was Zhou Luo Wen, a lawyer.

775
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,180
You really didn't know anything about this?

776
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,540
Is it really just a coincidence?

777
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,220
Yes.

778
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,580
The mechanism of the complaint

779
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,100
is to keep the person in the dark.

780
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,980
You shouldn't reveal it to the third party.

781
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,860
As a judge,

782
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,340
I can't just sit around and do nothing.

783
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,420
But we are not talking about

784
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,500
a formal matter.

785
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,180
I can be the one

786
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,780
to listen to what you said.

787
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,700
But I have to remind you

788
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,580
that you have to take legal responsibility

789
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,500
for breaking the confidentiality system.

790
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,900
Qin Yi Wei's confession

791
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,540
has clearly explained

792
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,260
the time and location of the accident.

793
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,940
But that night,

794
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,660
you came to the police station

795
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,700
and reported the car.

796
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,140
According to the records,

797
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,820
you said that the car

798
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,620
was stolen at around 10 a.m.

799
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,340
I want to ask you how you knew

800
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,820
that the car was stolen at 10 a.m.

801
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,740
I want to ask you clearly

802
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,980
what is the difference between

803
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,540
what you said and the confession

804
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,140
that Qin Yi Wei made to your son?

805
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,420
He and I are related by blood.

806
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,020
Unless you reveal the confession

807
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,300
and let me know

808
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,420
that he didn't do anything

809
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,580
when he was misled,

810
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,460
I will apply for the Yuan Yi Min Zexuan

811
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:36,900
to avoid making

812
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,940
any negative comments to him.

813
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,620
Judge Qin is really something.

814
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,780
Thank you for your cooperation.

815
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,340
This matter is not over yet.

816
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,380
I will come again.

817
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:24,100
My

818
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:31,420
Life is this why I was sleeping

819
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:39,420
And the visions that was planted in my brain

820
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:50,420
Still remain within the sound of silence

821
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,420
Good

822
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,420
Don't mind it, it's been a long time since we last played

823
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:01,420
I want to borrow this song to help you succeed in your plan

824
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:07,420
The real murderer is dead, but the accomplice is still free

825
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,420
Qin Yu is a judge, he's always been a good judge

826
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,420
Don't forget, you used to trust him

827
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,420
You even protected him

828
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,420
This doesn't mean he can break the law

829
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,420
He didn't break the law

830
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,420
He just used the benefits of his own factors when he was implementing the law

831
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,420
This is smart, smart is not a crime

832
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,420
He got the innocent people involved

833
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,420
The court is judging evidence

834
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,420
It can't judge morality and conscience

835
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,420
Why do you keep saying good things about him?

836
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,420
I do appreciate him, but I hope you don't be so persistent

837
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,420
Don't talk about me, let's talk about you

838
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,420
How is it going? Is there any progress on Liu Meng?

839
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,420
I've been in contact with him all the time

840
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:02,420
He's now hesitating whether to have surgery or not

841
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,420
I'm afraid he's not thinking about it

842
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:09,420
He's now hesitating whether to have surgery or not

843
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,420
You said he had a late pregnancy, would it be...

844
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:18,420
Yes, so it's really hard to tell him anything else now

845
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,420
If even this clue is broken

846
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,420
Let's not talk about this anymore, let's talk about something serious

847
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,420
I want you to learn this song, this song is divided into two parts

848
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,420
If you learn it, I can help you harmonize the sound

849
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,420
Very romantic, right?

850
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,420
I learn it?

851
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,420
Yes

852
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,420
It takes a long time

853
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,420
It doesn't matter how long it takes, just try it first

854
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,420
Try it, there's something

855
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,420
Can you hear what it is?

856
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,420
Help me see what it is

857
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,420
I spent ten thousand yuan to buy these

858
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,420
Not bad, take your time

859
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,420
Help me see

860
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,420
You're here

861
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,420
Thank you

862
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,420
Here

863
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,420
Mother-in-law, I want to tell you

864
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,420
I want to tell you

865
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,420
I want to tell you

866
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,420
I want to tell you

867
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,420
I want to tell you

868
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,420
I want to tell you

869
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,420
Something has developed to this day

870
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:40,420
My father and the judge's identity are intertwined

871
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,420
But these two identities

872
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,420
Also made the decision to protect Yiwei

873
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:50,420
So I hope you don't ask about some things

874
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,420
Now you and I are Yiwei's only family

875
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,420
If I can't get your cooperation

876
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,420
I will be embarrassed

877
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,420
As long as it's for Yiwei

878
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,420
I will cooperate with you in everything

879
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,420
Okay

880
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,420
Wait

881
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,420
Where did you find it?

882
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,420
It's not me

883
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,420
Weiwei found it

884
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,420
Yiwei

885
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,420
How's it going?

886
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,420
Are you okay?

887
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,420
I'm fine

888
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,420
Luo Wen, why are you here?

889
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:56,420
I heard that your son had given up

890
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:00,840
Was there a crime that you committed that caused constant Lind proposing?

891
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,860
학är

892
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,880
I did it for my personal sake

893
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,900
There's nothing wrong with me

894
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,620
My principal and I didn't sacrifice our justice

895
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,800
Angel the handled

896
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,600
are with us

897
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,660
We deserve to be alive

898
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,060
Nowen, you don't need to do this.

899
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,580
Justice

900
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,540
is the core of the rule of law.

901
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,220
The rule of law

902
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,540
is the foundation of maintaining social order and stability.

903
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:44,060
It guarantees the rights and freedoms of each of us.

904
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,980
It protects us from violence and oppression.

905
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,100
It's fair and just.

906
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,100
It's equal.

907
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,540
It's the moral standard of our society.

908
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,140
You taught me all these.

909
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,140
I hope you can teach yourself

910
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:18,940
to think

911
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,020
whether you deserve to be a judge.

912
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,100
You deserve to be a judge.

913
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,220
You deserve to be a judge.

914
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,820
You deserve to be a judge.

915
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,260
You deserve to be a judge.

916
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,620
You deserve to be a judge.

917
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,060
You deserve to be a judge.

918
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,260
You deserve to be a judge.

919
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,620
You deserve to be a judge.

920
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,980
You deserve to be a judge.

921
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,540
That's what weили means,

922
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,140
right?

923
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,300
Right?

924
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,580
Law of the law

925
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,260
about the law of the law

926
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:12,980
Isso

927
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,180
Let's talk about it later.

928
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,300
Is the law of law

929
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,460
an important Ziqi law?

930
00:47:54,660 --> 00:48:18,500
Either ask or answer, I refuse to

931
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,120
Only rec sk Nup

932
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,320
Rest our hearts together
