1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
The

2
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,200
This lunch is very important.

3
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,440
I sent it to you in person

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,960
because I didn't want to be killed by others.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,840
If there is any result,

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,200
you can only inform me.

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,840
Hello.

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,120
I know who hurt Han Gang.

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,120
Who are you?

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,840
Who are you?

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,520
If Han Kuilong knows

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,480
that the one who hurt his son is Qi Changrong,

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,200
this matter will be over.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's Qi Changrong from the Old City Gang.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,320
Don't stay here.

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Are you all right, Father?

17
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,660
Episode 16

18
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,260
Enough.

19
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,960
You're all so smart.

20
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Go play with the eggs.

21
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Go.

22
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
Go play with the eggs.

23
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,960
You haven't been back for a long time.

24
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
Go inside and talk.

25
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
Brother Qi.

26
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Let Xiaobei get two boxes of pork and pork, right?

27
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
And chili sauce.

28
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
Yes, Brother Qi.

29
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
I still remember that you like spicy food.

30
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
I'll go get some.

31
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
Brother Qi, beer.

32
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,960
Do you know why I called you here?

33
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
No.

34
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Xue came to see me last night.

35
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,960
She cried so much that her eyes were swollen.

36
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,960
You should know about her son, Ma Shanbao.

37
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
I heard about it.

38
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,960
A'bao is the eldest son.

39
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
His father died.

40
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,960
He's the only one who can support the family.

41
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
To steal a car,

42
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,960
this is not a good deal, right?

43
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,960
Xue told me that A'bao was caught that night.

44
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Someone asked him to go out.

45
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
Do you know who it was?

46
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,960
It's your husband, Cao Wei'er.

47
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
Speaking of which,

48
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,960
he was fired by the police and offended all his brothers.

49
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
He can't get along with them.

50
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,960
He just needs to get some money.

51
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Can he support the family?

52
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
Our life is simple.

53
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
We just need to have a place to live.

54
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
We can live in a good place.

55
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
I'm sure we can live in a good place.

56
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Brother Qi, the pig is here.

57
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
Don't go anywhere if you have nothing to do.

58
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Stay at home.

59
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Thank you, Brother Qi.

60
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Although you married an outsider,

61
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
I still hope you can be happy.

62
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,960
But the one who stays in the old city

63
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
is my wife, Qi Chengrong.

64
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
I can't leave her alone.

65
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Go in.

67
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
You're from the old city?

68
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
Come.

69
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Come.

70
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
This way.

71
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
My name is Da Xiong.

72
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
I'm the fat bear.

73
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,960
No one dares to touch you with me.

74
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
I'll take care of you.

75
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Sit.

76
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
I'm the fat bear.

77
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
I'm the fat bear.

78
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Sit.

79
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
What's your name?

80
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,960
A'bao.

81
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
A'bao?

82
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Xiong,

83
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
what did you do?

84
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Why do you ask so many questions

85
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
for Brother Qi?

86
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
What about you?

87
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
They said I stole a car.

88
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,960
It's not impossible to not let you know

89
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
about a small matter like stealing a car.

90
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,960
Tell me the truth.

91
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
A'bao.

92
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Ma Changbao,

93
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
your lawyer is here.

94
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
Was Lou Wei at home that night?

95
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Yes.

96
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
A'bao came to see her.

97
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Sha Sha,

98
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
I know you won't say anything

99
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,960
that's bad for your husband.

100
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
But don't force me, Qi Chengrong.

101
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
You're using your child as an excuse.

102
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
Do you understand?

103
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
What did they talk about?

104
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
Do you know Han Kuilong?

105
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
No.

106
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
Everyone knows

107
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
that Han Kuilong and I are not on the same side.

108
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
The war will start sooner or later.

109
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
His eldest son is in the hospital now.

110
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
The guy who hit him has been hiding for a long time.

111
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,960
The whole world says that I did it.

112
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
So the police

113
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
are sure that A'bao did it.

114
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
If Han Kuilong's son is dead,

115
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
A'bao is not only as simple as stealing a car,

116
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
but also as murder.

117
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
Kill him.

118
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
Your husband

119
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
will never be able to get out of this.

120
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
A'bao,

121
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
do you want me to help you?

122
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
You're my client.

123
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
If you want me to help you,

124
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
you have to tell your uncle

125
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
that you can't fire me.

126
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
I want to see my mom.

127
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
You can only see the lawyer for now.

128
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,960
If we cooperate,

129
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
I can try my best to apply for bail.

130
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Then you can go home and see your mom.

131
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
She...

132
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,960
They said that I'm not only stealing a car,

133
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
but also a car accident

134
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
that seriously hurt someone.

135
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Did you say who you hit?

136
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
Where? When?

137
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
I didn't hit anyone at all.

138
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
According to the police records,

139
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
that car was stolen

140
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
from 10 a.m. to 12 a.m.

141
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Where were you during that time?

142
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Why did you drive a car

143
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
and get arrested by the police?

144
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,960
Do you have any difficulties?

145
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Or someone doesn't want you to tell?

146
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
If the car accident

147
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,960
seriously hurt someone,

148
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
you must be sentenced to five years.

149
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
If you didn't steal a car

150
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
or hit anyone,

151
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
where were you during that time?

152
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
I was in the old town.

153
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Did anyone see you?

154
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
At that time,

155
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
I was with my friend.

156
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
What's his name?

157
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
I have to find him

158
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
to help you make the evidence that he's not there.

159
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
So you can go home.

160
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Can I really trust you?

161
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
His name is Xiaobei.

162
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
At that time, he and I

163
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,960
stole another car in the old town.

164
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
A white Benz

165
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
of the same style.

166
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
It's rare to see it in the old town.

167
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
The police caught someone that night.

168
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
But they haven't released any news yet.

169
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Then give them money.

170
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
It's not necessarily

171
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
that someone is trying to steal the money.

172
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
I don't care.

173
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
I must know who this person is

174
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
and where he is hiding.

175
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
What are you doing?

176
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
I'm giving the needle to someone.

177
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
The doctor said that I have to give the needle every four hours.

178
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Who are you?

179
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
The previous nurse wasn't you.

180
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
The previous nurse asked for leave.

181
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
I transferred from the northern district.

182
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
If you have any questions,

183
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
you can directly ask the nurse.

184
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
May I give the needle?

185
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Yes.

186
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
He looks handsome.

187
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,960
But he is a member of the gang.

188
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
Yes.

189
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
It's scary.

190
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,440
The blood on the

191
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
filth spray has been confirmed.

192
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
It's from Han Gang.

193
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
Also,

194
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
we have some incomplete fingerprints

195
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
that are being compared.

196
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,120
What about the

197
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,440
late-night DNA on the spray?

198
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
We have already tested it for you.

199
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
A machine is a machine.

200
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
The time is fixed.

201
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
It's no use being anxious.

202
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
Okay.

203
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
I will give it to you as soon as possible.

204
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Thank you, Senior Sister.

205
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
Tang Ducha.

206
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,440
I have evidence that Ma Shanbao is not present.

207
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
He didn't run into anyone or run away from Zhao's family.

208
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
Tell me about it.

209
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
When Ma Shanbao said that it was a crime,

210
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,440
he was with a friend from the old city district.

211
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
This person can prove that he wasn't at the crime scene.

212
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Lawyer Zhou,

213
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
although you were handed over by Judge Qin,

214
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
you still need to accumulate experience by yourself.

215
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
You can't learn it in class.

216
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Ma Shanbao is a very good lawyer.

217
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
He is very experienced.

218
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,920
A criminal with a pretext like Ma Shanbao

219
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
heard some stories in the prison.

220
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
After hearing it,

221
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,920
he thought it was his own story

222
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,920
and planned to escape punishment.

223
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
And these so-called evidence...

224
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
Yes.

225
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,920
There are time, location, and people.

226
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,920
But who can be cheated in the end?

227
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
It may only be you, Lawyer Zhou.

228
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
You can check it in the old city district.

229
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,920
There is a stolen white old-fashioned branch

230
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
that is rarely seen in the old city district.

231
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
As long as I find that car,

232
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
I can give you evidence that Ma Shanbao is not present.

233
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Because of your one word,

234
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
you have to search the old city district

235
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
to find this car.

236
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Do you know how big the old city district is?

237
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
How much effort do I have to make?

238
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Since there is a doubt,

239
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
the police should investigate it.

240
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Isn't this your duty?

241
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Yes.

242
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
As soon as possible.

243
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
As soon as possible?

244
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Lawyer Zhou,

245
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
you may only have this case.

246
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
But what about us?

247
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Look at it yourself.

248
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
All the cases here

249
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
are equally important to us.

250
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Including yours.

251
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
Listen to me.

252
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
As soon as possible.

253
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Coach.

254
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,880
Where are you going?

255
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
I am being suspended from school for investigation.

256
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
I have made the worst plan.

257
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
I am sorry.

258
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
What is the use?

259
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
I will go home now.

260
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Tell my dad to explain the whole thing to the school.

261
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Don't do it.

262
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
I have to come back to answer the question tomorrow.

263
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,360
I don't want to cause any more trouble.

264
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
Every time I meet you,

265
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360
you are pretty.

266
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Too bad.

267
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:42,880
Nothing will produce us is your

268
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
flux,

269
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
It's all innocent.

270
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,880
Hello strangler,

271
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Are you...

272
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Hello brother?

273
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
Old bound.

274
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,360
May I help you?

275
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Who are you?

276
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,160
I'm a friend of Xiaobei's,

277
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,120
a lawyer of Ma Shanbao.

278
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,200
My surname is Zhou.

279
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,440
Who are you looking for?

280
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,280
He's looking for Xiaobei.

281
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,800
He said he's A'bao's lawyer.

282
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,640
Yes.

283
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,600
Ma Shanbao needs Xiaobei's help.

284
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,920
Help?

285
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,120
Help what?

286
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,240
A'bao was caught by the police, right?

287
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,800
That's the thing.

288
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,400
I need Xiaobei to tell me

289
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
where the car he stole from Ma Shanbao.

290
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,320
What did you say?

291
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,040
Steal the car?

292
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,960
What are you talking about?

293
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,680
What lawyer?

294
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,240
I knew you were a cop at first sight.

295
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,120
It's not like that.

296
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,640
Go in first.

297
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,840
Let me talk to Xiaobei.

298
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,160
Go in. Don't let Xiaobei out.

299
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,080
Xiaobei.

300
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,640
Ma Shanbao needs your help.

301
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,160
Get lost.

302
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,200
Only you can help Ma Shanbao.

303
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,040
Get lost.

304
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,080
Xiaobei.

305
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,040
Don't be afraid.

306
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,840
I'm here.

307
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,960
Get lost.

308
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,640
There's a cop here.

309
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:46,960
Get lost.

310
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,680
Don't let me see you again.

311
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,120
Xiefu.

312
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,720
Every good done comes with a prize.

313
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,480
You,

314
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,880
Xie him tomorrow.

315
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,200
You're not the meditation master yet.

316
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,080
Okay.

317
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,240
Xia Mo.

318
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,680
I'm going to school tomorrow.

319
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,560
Don't worry about it.

320
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,960
Just take care of yourself.

321
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,960
How are you going to tell the principal?

322
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,160
Let's talk inside.

323
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,160
Coach, he's innocent.

324
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,800
He took my wine and didn't let me drink it.

325
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,120
He shouldn't have drunk it with me.

326
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,880
It's my fault.

327
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,520
I'm sorry.

328
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
It has nothing to do with him.

329
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,080
What are you doing? Why are you so nervous?

330
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,320
Sit down.

331
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,920
Sit down first.

332
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,280
Come on.

333
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
You can talk slowly if you want.

334
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,440
You can talk to me.

335
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,200
I shouldn't drink when I'm unhappy.

336
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,400
I've got you in trouble.

337
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,280
I don't want to get anyone else in trouble.

338
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,080
I promise you.

339
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,440
I'll only listen to what Coach Yu

340
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,400
wants to say tomorrow.

341
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,960
But I also want you to promise me.

342
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,600
If you want to drink next time,

343
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,720
ask me to accompany you.

344
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,520
Okay?

345
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,320
Come on.

346
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,480
Pick up your things.

347
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,080
Come on.

348
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,840
Right.

349
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,200
I want to check the record.

350
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,520
Is there a white old

351
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,040
old-fashioned book that has been published

352
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
on that day or the day after that?

353
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,320
Yes.

354
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,880
That's it.

355
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,720
Please inform me as soon as you have news.

356
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,680
Okay. Thank you.

357
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,920
I'm sorry.

358
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,800
I totally don't remember.

359
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You don't remember me at all, right?

360
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,440
After you joined the crime team,

361
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,440
you always break the promise.

362
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,520
I don't know how Brother Shi can bear it.

363
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,520
Because he also breaks the promise often.

364
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,120
I believe you.

365
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,720
I'm not lying to you.

366
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,600
It's true.

367
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,400
I don't want to talk to you.

368
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,040
Don't be angry.

369
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,560
Well...

370
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,080
Have you eaten?

371
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,040
Of course I have.

372
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,720
I know.

373
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,720
I can't get sick.

374
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,280
I have to take care of patients when I go back to the hospital.

375
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,920
I have to take care of you when I go back home.

376
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,520
Don't deny it.

377
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,600
Here.

378
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,240
What's this?

379
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,600
Do you remember you told me

380
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,240
that your stomach medicine doesn't work now?

381
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,720
I've put new medicine for you.

382
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,880
I'm warning you.

383
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,440
If you don't change

384
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,000
these terrible habits,

385
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,520
it's useless to eat anything.

386
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,320
Hey, nurse Tang.

387
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,600
You've already got off work.

388
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,840
Don't always treat me

389
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,440
as your patient.

390
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,480
You always talk about me.

391
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,360
Okay?

392
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,120
I guess you haven't eaten yet.

393
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,360
Here.

394
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
I've cooked porridge.

395
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,840
Don't worry about whether it tastes good or not.

396
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,440
The most important thing is

397
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,760
it's easy to digest and good for the stomach.

398
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,960
It must be delicious.

399
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,680
Of course.

400
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,240
But,

401
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,360
you've only been in the North District for two years.

402
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,480
Why are you getting more and more nagging?

403
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Be careful.

404
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,720
No one wants you.

405
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,000
I...

406
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,720
I seem to be nagging only to you.

407
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,720
But I also think

408
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,520
that after two years of leaving,

409
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,120
the East District has really changed a lot.

410
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,840
It's much more complicated.

411
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,040
Which department are you in?

412
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,200
S.U.

413
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,520
Household Security Department.

414
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,320
Household Security Department.

415
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,320
People from the Han family are less exposed.

416
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm a nurse.

417
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,440
I don't have to work if I don't have contact with them.

418
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,480
Anyway, listen to me.

419
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,760
Don't talk to them.

420
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,720
Okay?

421
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,600
Be careful.

422
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,960
I know.

423
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,520
I bought you breakfast.

424
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,120
Did I wake you up?

425
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,920
I didn't sleep all night.

426
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,720
Did your daughter cry again in the middle of the night?

427
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,360
I've been looking for you all day yesterday.

428
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,320
Why didn't you answer my call?

429
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,120
I went out to collect some goods.

430
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,800
I didn't find any signal.

431
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,080
I've met Qi Changrong.

432
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,560
Why did you look for him?

433
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
I was looking for him.

434
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,000
I was looking for him.

435
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,040
Did he tell you to come here?

436
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,920
He asked me to see him.

437
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,800
Did he do anything to you?

438
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,960
Did he kill Changlan?

439
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,840
You and I have two children.

440
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,120
He still won't give up.

441
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,040
You're always thinking about such boring things.

442
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,800
Why did you come here?

443
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,320
It's about A'bao.

444
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
What did he say?

445
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,360
Get off the car.

446
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,640
Get off the car.

447
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,000
A'bao, what's up?

448
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,400
Do you take me as a friend?

449
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,480
Are you my brother?

450
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,000
Can you put the gun down first?

451
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,520
What are you talking about?

452
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,640
What's the difference

453
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,240
between you and those bastards?

454
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,480
I have two children

455
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,400
to help you.

456
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,160
Do you want to lose their lives?

457
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,080
Let me explain first.

458
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,120
What do you want to explain?

459
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,000
Keep lying.

460
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,920
You know that the car hit someone.

461
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,400
You know who hit you.

462
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,640
Why did you drag me into the water?

463
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,240
I don't want to drag you into the water.

464
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,240
Okay.

465
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,720
You pointed the gun at me first.

466
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,040
Can I continue?

467
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,040
Yes.

468
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,040
My car hit someone.

469
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,520
That's why I caused so much trouble.

470
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,160
Wei.

471
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,160
I'm sorry.

472
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,560
I lied to you.

473
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,720
From the car hit someone,

474
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,480
I don't remember how many people I've lied to

475
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,760
and how many lies I've told.

476
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,200
Wei.

477
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,160
The one who hit someone

478
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
was Qin Yiwei.

479
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,200
Then,

480
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,960
how did Bao's case develop like this?

481
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,600
I don't know why.

482
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,040
If you think I deserve to die,

483
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,920
it's reasonable for you to shoot.

484
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,920
Do you know who Yiwei hit?

485
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,880
You only know that you did so many things.

486
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,400
I sentenced Han Kuilong to jail.

487
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,640
What if my son is in jail?

488
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,400
He must be so miserable.

489
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
You have a son.

490
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,520
What would you do if it were you?

491
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,400
Now you shoot.

492
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,480
Two people will die.

493
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,920
Do you hear it?

494
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,120
Don't shoot!

495
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,400
Right!

496
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
I'm so pushed.

497
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,320
Not really.

498
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,800
Until you send فè Sa Spo来了.

499
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,320
Give me a word.

500
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,360
Ignore her roots.

501
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,160
She can't get away with this.

502
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,640
Jiushan,

503
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,400
you know,

504
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,480
how to feed her.

505
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,120
The world's evidence

506
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Your wife doesn't know about this.

507
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,320
So that night,

508
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
she saw A'bao drive away.

509
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,920
Will she tell Qi Changrong?

510
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,920
She didn't say anything.

511
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,320
What to do in the future?

512
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,320
You are a father.

513
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,920
I am a father too.

514
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,720
I am a father.

515
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,720
I have two children.

516
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,920
Give me some time.

517
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,920
I will think of a way.

518
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
I will never let anything happen to them.

519
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,920
Mr. Qin.

520
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
Most of your funds are made of gold.

521
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,520
If you take them out now,

522
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,520
the fees are high and not very cost-effective.

523
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,120
But I really need money.

524
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,720
You also have a joint account with Qin Yiwei.

525
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,920
This is Huoqi Village.

526
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,120
You can get money without a limit.

527
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,520
Okay.

528
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,920
I will get money from this account.

529
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,920
I want cash.

530
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,520
Uncle.

531
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,320
Is mom home?

532
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,120
Mom is inside.

533
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,720
Son.

534
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,120
Go play with sister.

535
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,720
Go.

536
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,520
You said yesterday

537
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,320
you would get A'bao out.

538
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,120
Now you suddenly ask him to confess.

539
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,320
What's wrong?

540
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,520
I didn't expect A'bao to be so unlucky this time.

541
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,120
He followed Qi Changrong

542
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,920
to fight the Qi Heng of the old city district.

543
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,320
Now he is allowed to bear all the crimes.

544
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,920
Whether he confesses or not,

545
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,520
A'bao is very difficult to escape now.

546
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,120
What should we do?

547
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,720
The car driver came to me.

548
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,720
He said as long as A'bao confesses,

549
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,320
he can give a sum of money.

550
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,920
Enough for your life.

551
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,120
Him?

552
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
Who is he?

553
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,520
Xue.

554
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,920
If you really want to save your family,

555
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,920
don't ask so much.

556
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,320
I promise you

557
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,720
I will give you the money.

558
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,120
I will take care of your life

559
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,920
until A'bao is out of prison.

560
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,120
But I can't let A'bao

561
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,520
suffer like this.

562
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,120
To be honest,

563
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,920
it's not the first time

564
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,120
A'bao stole something.

565
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
When he grows up,

566
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,920
he may help Qi Changrong

567
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,520
to get rid of the poison

568
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,720
in order to make money.

569
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,720
His future result

570
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,120
may be to go to jail.

571
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,520
It's better

572
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,720
to use this jail

573
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,520
to change his fate.

574
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,320
With money,

575
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,920
you can raise three other children.

576
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,520
With money,

577
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,720
A'bao can go out

578
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,320
and start over.

579
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
Most importantly,

580
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
with money,

581
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,320
you can leave the old city.

582
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
You have diabetes.

583
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,520
You need money to treat your illness.

584
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,920
If you go to my home,

585
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,120
what about the three children?

586
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,720
How is the man

587
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
who was hit by a car?

588
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
He's still in the hospital.

589
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,520
He was hit by a car accident.

590
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,120
Do you know who he is?

591
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,120
No.

592
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,720
Judge Qin.

593
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,720
I heard that

594
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,520
Judge Su

595
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,520
is also on the list

596
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,920
of the president's nomination.

597
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,520
What a pity.

598
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,720
Recently,

599
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,920
he has reported a scandal.

600
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,720
I heard he wanted to quit the election.

601
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,320
If it's true,

602
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
then there are only you and me.

603
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,120
A few days ago,

604
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,920
I saw the police

605
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,920
searching your car.

606
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,920
It seemed to be quite nervous.

607
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,920
Nothing, right?

608
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
I heard that

609
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,920
the police are looking for you.

610
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
I heard that

611
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
you were in the car.

612
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
That madam

613
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,520
has a good relationship with you.

614
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,920
She is really not sensible.

615
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,920
She did such a small action

616
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,320
when she was so sensitive.

617
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,920
Everyone

618
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,920
has high expectations

619
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,720
for the president of the court.

620
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,720
I will respect the court's decision.

621
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
Sometimes,

622
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,520
you really don't have a good position.

623
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,320
I think

624
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,120
you should be stable

625
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,720
and sit in the position

626
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,920
you should sit in.

627
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,120
That's the wise choice.

628
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,520
Brother Qi, Xue is here.

629
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,920
Brother Qi.

630
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
Xue?

631
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,520
Brother Qi,

632
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,320
I beg you to help me.

633
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,720
Please help me to see A'bao.

634
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,920
They won't let me see him.

635
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,120
Didn't he hire a lawyer?

636
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,520
He has no other choice.

637
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,520
What about Luo Wei?

638
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,320
He is A'bao's uncle.

639
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,920
He can't help you.

640
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,120
Brother Qi,

641
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,520
I beg you.

642
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,120
For the sake of our neighbors,

643
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,320
please help me.

644
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,120
Okay?

645
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Brother Qi,

646
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,320
A'bao is locked up in there.

647
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,520
I am very worried about him.

648
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,920
Please help me, Brother Qi.

649
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,520
Brother Qi.

650
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,920
I am afraid women beg me.

651
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,120
Okay.

652
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,720
I have my brother in prison.

653
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,520
I will help you to talk to him.

654
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,920
Remember to give him some money.

655
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,320
I know.

656
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,920
Thank you, Brother Qi.

657
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,520
Let's go.

658
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,320
A'bao.

659
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:45,720
Mom.

660
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,520
A'bao.

661
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,320
Mom.

662
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,320
Mom.

663
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,120
How did you get in?

664
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,120
I gave them some money.

665
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,920
Let's talk for ten minutes.

666
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,120
Mom, where did you get the money?

667
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,120
Mom.

668
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:03,920
Mom.

669
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,720
Don't worry about the money.

670
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,320
But...

671
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:08,920
Mom.

672
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:09,920
It's okay.

673
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,120
What did you tell me?

674
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:12,920
Mom.

675
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,920
I hope you can forgive me.

676
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,920
Just help this family.

677
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,720
A'bao.

678
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
We have no power.

679
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,720
We can't fight with them.

680
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,120
We are not admitting our sins.

681
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,520
We are admitting our illness.

682
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,720
Your father died.

683
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,120
Nothing is left.

684
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,520
Mom is still sick.

685
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,520
If you go to jail,

686
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,920
how do you think this family will survive?

687
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
Mom.

688
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,920
But if you don't do this for nothing,

689
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,120
you can help this family

690
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,920
find a way out.

691
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,520
Look.

692
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,120
I got the first place this time.

693
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,920
I'm sorry.

694
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,720
The teacher told me

695
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,520
she really wants to go to a better school.

696
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,520
Your sister too.

697
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,320
If she's rich,

698
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,520
I can treat her diabetes.

699
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,120
She can buy a clinic.

700
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,920
Mom.

701
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,520
That's my home.

702
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,520
Your mother must be worried about you.

703
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,480
The second half is getting bigger.

704
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,520
Please assume the cup height is €272m.

705
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,880
The first 45 seconds,

706
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,920
what is the drink level?

707
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,160
The third 45 seconds,

708
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,800
in case this incredible pothole wrote down

709
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,720
negative to negative battle situation in the case.

710
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,520
The Education Commission has decided

711
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,520
to terminate the teaching assistant contract

712
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
for the new coach.

713
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,320
Judge Qi,

714
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
is it appropriate for us to deal with this?

715
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,320
I'm only attending today as a parent.

716
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,320
But I think

717
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,320
we can first listen to Coach Yu's explanation.

718
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,520
Coach Yu, what do you want to say?

719
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,120
I repeat it again.

720
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,320
I saw Qin Yiwei drinking in the school

721
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,720
and immediately stopped him.

722
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,920
Did you drink with him?

723
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,520
No.

724
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,520
Then how about

725
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,720
listening to

726
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,720
what the person said?

727
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Coach, he didn't drink.

728
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,320
Only I drank.

729
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,520
As a teacher,

730
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
shouldn't you stop students from drinking?

731
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,120
I already took away his bottle of wine.

732
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,120
Isn't that a stop?

733
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,120
Is it a stop for me to knock him out?

734
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,520
Can I say something?

735
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,720
Judge Qi, please.

736
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,120
Actually, I came here

737
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,320
to thank Coach Yu.

738
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,920
Because Qin Yiwei

739
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,720
has a serious asthma.

740
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,720
If it didn't happen

741
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,520
because of Coach Yu,

742
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,920
he might have been in a coma.

743
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,320
As for how the school

744
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
will handle this,

745
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,920
I will respect the decision of the school.

746
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,720
Judge Qin, please wait.

747
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,520
Coach.

748
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,120
Wait for me in the car.

749
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,720
What's wrong?

750
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,520
I think you need to pay attention

751
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,920
to Qin Yiwei's psychological condition.

752
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,320
It's normal for young people to vent their anger after drinking.

753
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,720
But he has asthma.

754
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,520
I'm sorry. Thank you for your concern.

755
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,920
My client

756
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,320
has repeatedly shown

757
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,720
that he has nothing to do with

758
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
the case of Zhao's escape in the traffic.

759
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
But the police

760
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,120
still didn't have any solid evidence

761
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,920
to detain my client

762
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,120
for no reason.

763
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,920
It's totally unreasonable.

764
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,320
It's totally unreasonable.

765
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
Obviously,

766
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,120
he is abusing the judicial system.

767
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,720
My client

768
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,920
is innocent.

769
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,520
Just because he comes from the old district,

770
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,920
he has to be treated differently?

771
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,320
What did you find?

772
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,720
I found it in a detention center.

773
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,720
But I couldn't find the person.

774
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,720
The police blocked the message.

775
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,320
I don't care.

776
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,120
Anyway, this evidence

777
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,920
must be returned.

778
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,920
At most, two minutes.

779
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,120
All right.

780
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,720
Hello.

781
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,520
It's me.

782
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,520
Brother Qiang, what's up?

783
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,920
Help me to deal with someone.

784
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,320
I want him to die.

785
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,320
Who?

786
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,520
The people from the old district.

787
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,320
Don't worry.

788
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Is there any problem?

789
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,720
There should be.

790
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,920
Let's see if God will give us a way out.

791
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,520
If there is a newly launched plan,

792
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,320
what should we do?

793
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,320
Don't touchcor connects with me

794
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,640
if you want to stop a restr

795
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,920
Baby.

796
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,120
He didn't show up thoughtfully.

797
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,920
What's wrong?

798
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,920
Is your mom looking for you?

799
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,260
How do you finish beat that man?

800
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,680
blast

801
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,280
Zi Bong!

802
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,160
I am as weak as you

803
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:06,280
The heart is in a sea of sleep

804
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,400
In firefighters

805
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:18,140
His eyes blind

806
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:26,560
The first three lines of light and shadow

807
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,660
Putting cold to cold

808
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,240
From Impossible to Fix correctly

809
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,020
Zero

810
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:47,080
Dienne

811
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:53,380
Take figure

812
00:42:53,380 --> 00:43:00,380
The road is long, but the good days are short

813
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,380
But the heart is in pain

814
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:09,380
I can't understand, I can't understand, I can't understand

815
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,380
Looking at the peaceful people, but I am rational

816
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,380
I'm so stubborn that I can't understand

817
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,380
Why can't I get closer

818
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,380
I can't turn back

819
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,380
I'm so stupid that I can't understand

820
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:31,380
The road is long, but the good days are short

821
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:36,380
But the heart is in pain
