crime

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,160
is getting worse

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,600
It impacts至安

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,680
of your brothers

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,380
What happened

8
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,040
You will learn

9
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,140
everything

10
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,700
that the police

11
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,320
learnt from you

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,240
What's going on?

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,720
Duking

14
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,020
has caught the criminal

15
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,860
Interesting

16
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,960

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,840
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,280
What's the matter, Judge Qin?

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,440
Hello.

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,040
I want to ask

22
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,280
how is Wei doing now?

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,680
She only has half a life left.

24
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,200
You're the only one who cares about her now.

25
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,840
Did you get the bullet?

26
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,880
What did the doctor say?

27
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
We're not in the hospital.

28
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,800
Where are you going?

29
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,200
I won't tell you.

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,280
Don't expect

31
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,560
to die for you.

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,280
The King of Blaze

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,280
Episode 16

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,880
Stop the car.

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,000
You didn't tell me

36
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,440
if it was your sister's idea

37
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,400
or yours.

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,880
My sister's idea

39
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
is mine.

40
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,000
It's my duty to take care of the patient.

41
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,760
You don't need to give me a gift.

42
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,600
This is not a wish-granting fee.

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,000
It's my heart.

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,120
My sister is a policewoman.

45
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,960
What does it have to do with it?

46
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,920
Z Charlie

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,960
Mr. Bruce

48
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,560
We're not on the same track.

49
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,560
Mr. нач队

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,760
Sir,

51
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,080
the God of Steel has reacted.

52
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,720
Doctor Li just took

53
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,480
and show him the news of Master Long's treason.

54
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,680
He'll react.

55
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
Eight.

56
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,000
Xia Lin.

57
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,560
Brother.

58
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,600
Brother.

59
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,640
Xia Lin.

60
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,880
Brother.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,840
Xia Lin.

62
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,160
It's good that you're awake.

63
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,880
How is Eight doing in prison?

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,840
He's fine.

65
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,880
He's just worried about you.

66
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,960
I'm worried about him too.

67
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,560
I heard from Dr. Lin

68
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,120
that I was caught by a car

69
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,000
and was in the hospital for half a month.

70
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,920
That's right.

71
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
The person who caught you

72
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,960
is him.

73
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,280
His name is Ma Shanbao.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,880
But don't worry.

75
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,840
We've already avenged you.

76
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,720
He...

77
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,200
It's not him.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,360
He doesn't look like that.

79
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,920
No.

80
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,720
Brother.

81
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,560
Have you seen the murderer?

82
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,720
Do you know who he is?

83
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
I don't know him.

84
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,600
But if I see him again,

85
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll definitely recognize him.

86
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,920
It's not him.

87
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,920
Take your time.

88
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,280
Robbing the army?

89
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,960
I have a big,

90
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,160
killer weapon.

91
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,320
I need to rob it?

92
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,240
Where's the evidence?

93
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,960
You can't catch him,

94
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,640
and you're accusing me of such a good thing.

95
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,120
If there's no evidence,

96
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,600
I'll let you go.

97
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,120
Okay.

98
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,160
I've found it.

99
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,600
Qi Changrong

100
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,800
did have

101
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,360
no evidence when he was robbing the army.

102
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,080
Even if it wasn't him,

103
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,360
he must be the mastermind.

104
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,320
Otherwise, why did he

105
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,440
appear at the scene of the explosion?

106
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,360
He's going to fight Han Lie.

107
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,720
How to deal with him?

108
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,280
They like to fight.

109
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,560
Let them fight first.

110
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,560
If there's really not enough evidence,

111
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,000
let's help him

112
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,320
when the time comes.

113
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,160
Yes, sir.

114
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,640
We robbed his 4-kg Hailuo Eagle

115
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,880
and killed his two men.

116
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,960
His nest in the city

117
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,480
was also taken by us.

118
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,680
We also opened an OK and massage center.

119
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,560
What does that make original evidence out of?

120
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,440
Perry Su?

121
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,160
Yes, please tell you the evidence.

122
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,240
Who is in charge?

123
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,520
There's no place for him to stay.

124
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,320
He can only go back to the old city.

125
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,760
But the old man is shocked.

126
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,720
Enough.

127
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,480
Boss.

128
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,720
Those guns and explosives

129
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,880
were used by Qi Changyong to deal with us.

130
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,480
Even the police have no evidence to arrest him.

131
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,200
Instead, you left the evidence first.

132
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,760
I told you.

133
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,120
We're just standing aside

134
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,600
and watching the fun.

135
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,800
I don't want to be dragged by someone.

136
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,440
We should start with the wall.

137
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,160
How's your brother?

138
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
The doctor said

139
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,880
he'll walk out of the window today

140
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,000
and continue the physical treatment.

141
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,240
Okay.

142
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,160
Boss.

143
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,200
If these were all done by my brother,

144
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,560
don't you think it's okay?

145
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,800
Give me some time.

146
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,600
When your brother recovers,

147
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
you'll find the answer

148
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,240
in his way.

149
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,200
We didn't prepare to rush in.

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,480
Take it to the brothers and check it.

151
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,360
After it's cured,

152
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,000
we'll go to find Han

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,600
and get it all back.

154
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
Okay.

155
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
Thank you, Brother Qi.

156
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,160
Brother Qi.

157
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,520
They took the black-wood house.

158
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,200
The brothers of Gao and I went to get the goods.

159
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,640
They haven't come back yet.

160
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,280
Something might have happened.

161
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,200
Remember.

162
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Remember.

163
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
This is a bad omen.

164
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,600
We'll find Han sooner or later.

165
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,640
But now,

166
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,520
we'll find Cao.

167
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Let's go.

168
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,000
Sha Sha, it's me.

169
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Brother Qi.

170
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,280
I'm afraid someone might follow us.

171
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,560
So I went around.

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,040
I'm sorry, Brother Peng.

173
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,880
I'm sorry to trouble you.

174
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,440
But you really need to help me save A'Wei.

175
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,400
Your father told me to tell you

176
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,120
that he and your mother took two children

177
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,440
to a friend's house.

178
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,720
So you don't have to worry.

179
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,120
Where is the wound?

180
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Here.

181
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,000
The bullet is still in the wound.

182
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,120
The bullet is in there.

183
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,480
If you don't take it out,

184
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,600
you'll get a high fever

185
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,000
and kill yourself.

186
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,000
Then help him

187
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,480
to take out the bullet.

188
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,640
Do you know

189
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,320
Qi Changrong's people

190
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,720
are looking for your husband everywhere?

191
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,240
How can you harass him?

192
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,600
A'Wei did it for us.

193
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,440
Brother Peng, I have no choice.

194
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,040
I'm begging you.

195
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,080
Brother Peng, hurry up.

196
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,320
Please save my husband first.

197
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,280
Your mother helped me before.

198
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,920
I'll return her a favor.

199
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,600
Find him. He must be alive.

200
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,240
Brother Qi.

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,200
The hospital said the dog was dead.

202
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,280
He's not alive.

203
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,200
Stop.

204
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,960
I've heard

205
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,240
that the phone is broken.

206
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,520
He didn't send the goods.

207
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,000
This is not an accident.

208
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,600
Cao Wei'er is a bastard.

209
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,440
He wants to kill me too.

210
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,240
We've found him.

211
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,160
There's no one.

212
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,120
He must have run away.

213
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,400
Brother Qi.

214
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,560
The news said

215
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,520
the robbers who robbed the transport car

216
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
were injured and escaped.

217
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,440
They can't run away.

218
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,040
The police are looking for him everywhere.

219
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,320
He's injured.

220
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,600
He doesn't dare to go to the hospital.

221
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,520
Let the news out.

222
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,720
If any black-hearted doctor

223
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,440
dares to help Cao Wei'er,

224
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,840
he'll be executed with him.

225
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,800
Yes, Brother Qi.

226
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,760
Come on.

227
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,800
Hold the wound.

228
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,960
I'll seal the knot.

229
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,280
Hurry up.

230
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,000
Do you want him to die?

231
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,280
Let go.

232
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,080
The interviewer should choose a red one.

233
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,960
In the future, the director will wear a gray one.

234
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,640
Do you like it?

235
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,680
Do you want me to choose another one for you?

236
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,520
He doesn't seem to be that thin.

237
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,960
He'll be fine after a few more days.

238
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,200
Thank you, Brother Peng.

239
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,640
Can you hear me, Wei?

240
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,280
You'll be fine.

241
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
We'll be fine.

242
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:51,880
Brother Peng.

243
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,440
Here you are.

244
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,520
Who do you think I am?

245
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,640
Thank you, Brother Peng.

246
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,480
He's bleeding.

247
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Buy some food to help him.

248
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,080
Then...

249
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,840
Brother Peng, please.

250
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,880
Can you take care of him?

251
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,520
I'll go out and buy some food for him.

252
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,440
And I'll go to see my two kids.

253
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,080
Thank you.

254
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,040
I can only stay a little longer.

255
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,240
A patient is waiting for me at the police station.

256
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,600
Okay, I'll be there soon.

257
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,360
I'll be there soon.

258
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:23,880
As soon as possible.

259
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,400
Okay.

260
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,240
Thank you, Brother Peng.

261
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,080
Come on.

262
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,800
Officer Qin.

263
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,520
I didn't see you just now.

264
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,240
I was so afraid that you'd get hurt.

265
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,520
Thank you for your concern.

266
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,720
I did a great job in the interview.

267
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,760
I don't know why I have

268
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,920
a very good feeling about this.

269
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,720
I thought you'd figured it out.

270
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,680
You should be at your place.

271
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,360
Don't try to escape anymore.

272
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,720
Thank you for your concern.

273
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Good luck to you.

274
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,200
From the first day I became a judge,

275
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,600
I asked myself

276
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,040
if the punishment

277
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,080
was the only way to protect the hair.

278
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,880
There's a report

279
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,160
that the judges who graduated from the procuratorate

280
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,920
have a higher rate of punishment.

281
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,440
This kind of punishment

282
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,800
is likely to be caused by

283
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,120
the control of the court.

284
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,880
Sometimes,

285
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,480
even they can't feel it.

286
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,240
I've been in the procuratorate

287
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
for half a year.

288
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,760
What you mean is

289
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,400
if you were the court president,

290
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,880
you might be more objective

291
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,000
and fair in the trial.

292
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,600
This is your advantage, right?

293
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,600
I think what the court president is pursuing

294
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,240
shouldn't be the punishment,

295
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,600
but the justice of the court.

296
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,920
Do you remember

297
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,960
Ding Kaiyi's case a year ago?

298
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,000
Did我想看见过

299
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,960
the Cheng's case sometime ago?

300
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,940
Remember,

301
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,000
that was athropies case.

302
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,760
You were only in court twice,

303
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,040
she suddenly asked to change herself.

304
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,280
That's why

305
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,560
the case was to beꀭ İua Mhm Zhang,

306
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,160
as the official party wasted time.

307
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,600
Do you want to explain

308
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,360
why you wanted to do that?

309
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,500
Because the defendant

310
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,260
or even the punishment.

311
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,380
I was afraid that I couldn't

312
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,820
leave the prejudice

313
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,740
and make a judgment to the defendant.

314
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,620
Because at that moment,

315
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,180
my wife died less than a month ago.

316
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,620
I know that my method is not perfect.

317
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:19,500
But...

318
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,460
Don't you think

319
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,260
your method is perfect?

320
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,540
Ma Shanbao,

321
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,460
good Wei,

322
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,980
how many unfair and unjust things

323
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,180
have you done?

324
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,380
Have you ever

325
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,580
felt guilty

326
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,380
or blamed yourself?

327
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,100
Can you sleep

328
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,420
when you sleep at night?

329
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:43,820
You...

330
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,140
What did you say?

331
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,420
I mean

332
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,300
I agree with your method.

333
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,580
There is no perfect thing in this world.

334
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,780
We are not machines.

335
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,740
I believe

336
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,940
if I were you,

337
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,380
I would do the same.

338
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,780
Ass解释一下

339
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,400
为什么要这样做

340
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,020
因为被告和//我 …似.....

341
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,540
The defendant copper

342
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,700
is the order of thenocent Seventh и minor in the Annals of the Thenx.

343
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,660
Let me ask you.

344
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,580
What's the name of the fish?

345
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,940
The number you have dialed is not available at the moment.

346
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,700
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,540
Because of you,

348
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,180
I have two brothers who have been with me for more than ten years.

349
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,860
In fact, what you want the most

350
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,780
is the life of my Qi Changrong.

351
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,580
Right?

352
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,700
The next day

353
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,460
Wei Wei.

354
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,620
Wei Wei.

355
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,420
Open the door.

356
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,300
It's your grandmother.

357
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,420
Wei Wei.

358
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,940
I want to talk to you.

359
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,940
You don't need to go to school, right?

360
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,940
Weiwei, I know.

361
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,940
I was too nervous before.

362
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,940
I just hope that our family

363
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,940
won't have any more bad things happen.

364
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,940
I often quarrel with your father.

365
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,940
It also causes you trouble.

366
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,940
Then I promise you

367
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,940
that you must pay attention to this problem in the future.

368
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,940
Weiwei, say a few words.

369
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,940
Reply to your grandmother.

370
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,940
I have nothing to say.

371
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,940
Do you recognize this necklace?

372
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,940
I do.

373
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,940
This necklace was a gift

374
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,940
that I gave to your mother

375
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,940
three years ago.

376
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,940
Yuanquan represents Yuanlan.

377
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,940
After your mother died,

378
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,940
your father couldn't find it.

379
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,940
You gave it to Coach Yu.

380
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,940
Then he returned it to me.

381
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,940
Where did you get it?

382
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,940
I don't know.

383
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,940
Where did you find this necklace?

384
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,940
Why didn't you tell your father?

385
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,940
Weiwei.

386
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,940
Weiwei.

387
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,940
Hey, Hunter.

388
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,940
What happened?

389
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,940
I don't know why.

390
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,940
The factory suddenly went like this.

391
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,940
What happened?

392
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,940
He was fine before.

393
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,940
He had a fever.

394
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,940
He might have had a head injury

395
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,940
and had a sequela.

396
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,940
We're going to give him a shock.

397
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,940
Let him calm down.

398
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,940
We'll see what happens later.

399
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,940
Say a few words.

400
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,940
If it's about your brother,

401
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,940
the doctor said that his brain was injured.

402
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,940
He needs a long recovery.

403
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,940
It's not my brother.

404
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,940
It's your sister.

405
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,940
My sister?

406
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,940
What happened to my sister?

407
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,940
The police said she was on vacation.

408
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,940
She wouldn't answer my call.

409
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,940
She was forced to take a vacation because of you.

410
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,940
My sister is a police officer.

411
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,940
She can't have anything to do with you.

412
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,940
I wanted to have something to do with her,

413
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,940
but it wasn't her.

414
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,940
What's wrong?

415
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,940
If it's because of me,

416
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,940
your sister was forced to take a vacation,

417
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,940
I'm very sorry.

418
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,940
But I need to ask her something.

419
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,940
My sister has nothing to do with you.

420
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,940
Have or not,

421
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,940
I have the final say.

422
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,940
What do you mean?

423
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,940
The police is investigating me and asking me questions.

424
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,940
I guess they're asking about your sister.

425
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
about your sister?

426
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,380
My sister has nothing to do with you.

427
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,820
Whether she has or not

428
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,380
depends on what I say.

429
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,820
What do you want?

430
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,700
Tell her

431
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,380
I just woke up.

432
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,100
She saw the murderer.

433
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,900
Tang Xuan was forced to take a leave.

434
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,940
Is this the result you want?

435
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,780
Isn't this the result you want?

436
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,500
She hid the evidence.

437
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,500
It's unfair to the parties.

438
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,180
You're always so arrogant

439
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,060
and talk about these false words.

440
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,820
If you come to me this time,

441
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,460
there's nothing else.

442
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,220
You use the people who trust you

443
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,460
to drag innocent people into your life.

444
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,740
Do you really feel no guilt at all?

445
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,860
Wei.

446
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,620
Wei.

447
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,140
Wei.

448
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,340
Wei.

449
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,660
I never thought

450
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,100
things would turn out like this.

451
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,580
I don't want to talk about the past.

452
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,700
But since the first day,

453
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,300
I asked you to help Ma Shanbao.

454
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,740
I really hope you can help Ma Shanbao.

455
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,020
But now Ma Shanbao has sacrificed his life

456
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,820
because of my fault.

457
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,620
It's not your fault.

458
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,580
Your only fault

459
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,260
is to trust me.

460
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,460
Trust me.

461
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,820
It's no longer a problem.

462
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,980
Put down this matter.

463
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,020
You can start from the beginning.

464
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:22,020
Hug Back

465
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,300
Episode C

466
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,360
Ready?

467
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,980
fosse.

468
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,660
My brother is awake.

469
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,300
The one I drew may be the murderer.

470
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,740
You'd better hurry up.

471
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,060
I'll wait for your good news.

472
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,820
Thank you.

473
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,380
My sister is a good police officer.

474
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,060
It's good that you're awake.

475
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,460
Captainlink.

476
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,700
I'mgentian.

477
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,380
We've had a tough battle recently.

478
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,620
Just guess it.

479
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,700
No.

480
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,380
In a group fight,

481
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,740
correct the despicableert aspects.

482
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,660
All right.

483
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,460
I know.

484
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,300
He's not the one who framed me.

485
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:46,980
Then...

486
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,420
Stay away from him.

487
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,540
Did you hear what I said?

488
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,020
Then,

489
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,500
whether it's voluntary or forced,

490
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,060
let's just take a vacation.

491
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,700
How about

492
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,660
we go on a trip

493
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,940
a few days before the night?

494
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,140
I have something to do.

495
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,300
I'll send you back first.

496
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,980
I have to find Shisi.

497
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,820
So this is what you're doing.

498
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,420
You're so naive.

499
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,100
Hello, Tang Dongchao.

500
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,620
How can you call this a vacation?

501
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,460
You want to move the whole office

502
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,900
to my house, right?

503
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,860
I finally figured out

504
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,420
the whole case.

505
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,860
I hope you can listen to me

506
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,820
and say it again.

507
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,740
See if my reasoning is right.

508
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,260
Tang Dongchao, I just got off work.

509
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,380
I'll leave first.

510
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,980
No, no, no.

511
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,900
That's not necessary.

512
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,980
You wrote so many words.

513
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,260
Are your hands tired?

514
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,220
Let me help you.

515
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,420
Wow.

516
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,580
It seems like a close relationship like a spider web.

517
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,380
What's so complicated about it?

518
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,460
Han Kuilong.

519
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,140
I can tell from the name that he's not a good person.

520
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,580
Han, Kuilong, and Long.

521
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,020
Hello.

522
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,580
Officer Qin, I'm Louis.

523
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,060
I heard that you did well in your interview.

524
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,900
Congratulations.

525
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,660
What's up?

526
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,100
I received a letter.

527
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,140
It's about half a year ago.

528
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,220
You accepted the police's question.

529
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,260
It was when your wife committed suicide.

530
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,700
The police thought you were suspicious

531
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,100
and started an investigation on you.

532
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,940
You tried so hard to find my stain

533
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,780
because you wanted me to quit the campaign.

534
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,300
The police are just doing a routine investigation.

535
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,940
I've been cleared.

536
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,500
The point is not whether you're cleared or not.

537
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,020
The point is that you were suspected.

538
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,100
The candidate for the president of the court

539
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,860
is actually the suspect of murder.

540
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,260
I won't quit because of your threat.

541
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,140
If so,

542
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,180
I'll definitely give this letter to the police.

543
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,460
Okay.

544
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,220
Brother, where's Wei?

545
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,980
Where's he?

546
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,380
I saved him.

547
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,140
I've tried my best, right?

548
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,380
You can find Qi Changlong for the rest.

549
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,380
You betrayed me?

550
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,980
You have a husband and a child.

551
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,660
I have a wife and a child.

552
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,180
I want to protect them.

553
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,940
You can offend anyone

554
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,220
but that bastard.

555
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,460
Qin Yu wanted to stop me from taking his son back to the police station

556
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,140
to question him.

557
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,340
He framed me and the black community.

558
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,380
Because that night,

559
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,740
he was right next to my house.

560
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,500
He was the only one who could see me and Han Lie meeting.

561
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Then,

562
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,740
he used Zhou Luo Wen's prejudice against me

563
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,860
to make him complain to the police.

564
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,100
Then he lied to me and gave false statements.

565
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,180
He used Zhou Luo Wen to hinder judicial justice.

566
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,420
He did all this for one purpose,

567
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,020
to protect his son.

568
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,860
Because from the beginning, he knew

569
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,620
that his son was the one who hurt him

570
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,020
and then killed him.

571
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,420
Here's a saying.

572
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,020
A big snake can weigh seven inches.

573
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,780
It's better to be careful.

574
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,860
You must find Qin Yingwei

575
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,420
and find the evidence of his escape after the incident.

576
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,300
Tang Xuan,

577
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,220
you

578
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,460
should protect yourself.

579
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,220
You don't have to put yourself in danger.

580
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,700
There are several caseslaughing about the genocide.

581
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,860
What is possible is in the future.

582
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,860
Right now,

583
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,540
you just pay those companies

584
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,900
with your life and your life,

585
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,260
will not be the problem of our country.

586
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,540
I'm the police chief.

587
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,300
We'll dorm height later.

588
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,340
You should come.

589
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,020
You're the chief of our department.

590
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,700
Who do you think I am?

591
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,220
Where's the1

592
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,820
I'll officially announce it.

593
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,020
No need.

594
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,900
Who else would it be?

595
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,460
You can call me whatever you want.

596
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,460
Don't call me your wife.

597
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,660
Also,

598
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,380
when the police checked my car,

599
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,740
you took the photo.

600
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,540
Right?

601
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,260
It was me.

602
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,860
I may not be a good person,

603
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,580
but you must be a bad person.

604
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,180
I'm sorry.

605
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,300
I'm sorry.

606
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,420
I'm sorry.

607
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:00,860
Yi Wei.

608
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,940
What is it, dad?

609
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,220
Think carefully.

610
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,820
When you hit Han Gang,

611
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,380
did you get off the car?

612
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,460
I walked to his side

613
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,860
and saw blood all over his face.

614
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,180
I was scared and threw up.

615
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,340
Then I went back to the car

616
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,460
and took the defibrillator.

617
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,060
Did you throw up?

618
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,820
Yes.

619
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,700
Why didn't you tell me?

620
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,980
I don't remember.

621
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,620
But it has something to do with it.

622
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,060
Because the police found a defibrillator

623
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,460
at the crime scene.

624
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,460
It has your DNA on it.

625
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,820
If they compare the defibrillator's DNA

626
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,940
with the one Otu used...

627
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,540
But

628
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,060
there's no name on the defibrillator.

629
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,500
How do they know it's me?

630
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,900
Someone broke our trash can this morning.

631
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,420
There's a defibrillator you used in the trash.

632
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,740
It has your DNA on it.

633
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,100
If you compare the three things,

634
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,340
it can prove that

635
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,140
you've been to the crime scene.

636
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,820
Get off the car.

637
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,100
You're so mean.

638
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,980
I'm so sad.

639
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,100
Do you know why?

640
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,540
It's not because my brother was killed by you.

641
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,740
It's not because I was caught by the police.

642
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,500
It's not even because Han Lie

643
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,420
wanted to ruin my business.

644
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,980
I'm so sad because of you.

645
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,540
You swore to steal the defibrillator for me with your child's life.

646
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,380
But you didn't keep your promise.

647
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,780
Who do you think you are?

648
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,620
I didn't lie to you.

649
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,580
I helped you steal the defibrillator.

650
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,020
Who's the one who's pretending to be a bomb

651
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,820
and trying to kill me?

652
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,580
It's either you or the guy who helped you deliver the goods.

653
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,620
Who is it?

654
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,940
Should I find out the evidence

655
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,500
and settle it together?

656
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,340
Who are you looking for?

657
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,660
Hold him.

658
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,220
You...

659
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,220
Are you willing to tell me?

660
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,140
Do you want me to use your other hand to tell you?

661
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,700
Ji Changrong,

662
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,060
I know you won't let me down.

663
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,100
Why don't you just give me a chance?

664
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,220
I'm not afraid of you.

665
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,340
I'm not afraid of you.

666
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,340
Being a police officer is different.

667
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,100
You're really tough.

668
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,580
But I wonder if your precious son,

669
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,340
Bones, is as tough as you.

670
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,820
Maybe you can try.

671
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,460
Ji Changrong,

672
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,620
you swore to

673
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,620
kill him.

674
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,900
Cao Wei'er,

675
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,780
you're the one who swore to kill the kid.

676
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,860
Who do you think God will listen to?

677
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,140
Mr. Lian,

678
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,580
it's Qi Changrong.

679
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,100
He's gone. He's out of weapons.

680
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,300
He's dead.

681
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,420
Han easier.

682
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,420
I want you to sit down and talk.

683
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,940
What's there to talk about?

684
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,900
Want to surrender?

685
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,080
You'll know when you're here.

686
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,180
You're still too timid

687
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,300
a DNA test of a sprayer?

688
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,500
Remember?

689
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,860
Are there any samples of burglary?

690
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,860
I suspect that

691
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,340
the same person did it.

692
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,780
I want you to do a DNA

693
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,060
comparison test for me.

694
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,660
You won't tell me

695
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,140
the source of these samples, right?

696
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,620
You're so smart.

697
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,620
All right.

698
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,860
I'll check it for you as soon as possible.

699
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,740
Thank you.

700
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,940
Let me know if you find anything.

701
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:17,820
Go.

702
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,500
Put the gun away.

703
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,500
Come down.

704
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,980
I have a big gift for you.

705
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,460
Come here.

706
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,020
Go.

707
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,980
You don't know this guy, do you?

708
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,100
Introduce yourself to the hunter.

709
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,260
He's Cao Wei'er.

710
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,620
He used to be a policeman.

711
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,900
He was fired

712
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,580
and now he's a police officer.

713
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,020
You asked me out

714
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,900
not just to introduce a friend

715
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,900
to me, right?

716
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,820
I heard that your brother is awake.

717
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,180
He finally got his life back

718
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,420
from Lord Yan.

719
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,740
I guess you don't know

720
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,420
the truth about your brother's death, right?

721
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,900
But he knows.

722
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,660
He said that

723
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,860
he was killed by a man

724
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,180
who was in the same room as him.

725
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:40,820
Tell me.

726
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,860
Wake up.

727
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,780
Who did this?

728
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,900
It's Qin Yu.

729
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,180
You mean that judge?

730
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,420
It's his son.

731
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,180
He hit your brother.

732
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,140
My brother?

733
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,900
You killed Ma Shanbao

734
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,500
and used hot oil

735
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,100
to break my brother's chest.

736
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,180
How do you count it?

737
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,860
You burned my men.

738
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,380
You stole the guns.

739
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,420
And the explosives

740
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,700
that almost killed you.

741
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,420
I didn't want to fight.

742
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,900
Don't think that I didn't

743
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,700
have anything happen

744
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,140
if I sent this guy here.

745
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,180
But not today.

746
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,060
At least, I won't be used as a fool.

747
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,980
You've made it clear.

748
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,060
It has nothing to do with the Old City Gang.

749
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,500
We'll see

750
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,980
the rest later.

751
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,220
And

752
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,580
how are you going to deal with him?

753
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,580
Whatever.

754
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,780
Jin Chengrong.

755
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,980
Don't forget

756
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,060
that you swore to me

757
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,580
to keep my wife and my son safe.

758
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,900
If you don't keep your promise,

759
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,180
you'll be in trouble.

760
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,980
I had a bad feeling.

761
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,660
You lost every boy who dared to land in the sand.

762
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:45,580
Goodbye.

763
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,860
I have something to tell you.

764
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,620
You were the one I complained to.

765
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:02,780
I know that.

766
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,140
But you others

767
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,140
and you happened to see me after work.

768
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,140
What do you want to say?

769
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,140
I know Ma Shanbao is not the murderer.

770
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:19,140
You finally admit that you caught the wrong person.

771
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,140
Yes, we caught the wrong person.

772
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,140
But it's because the people around us have been deliberately misleading us.

773
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,140
What I said about us is about me and you.

774
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,140
If you want to give Ma Shanbao justice,

775
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,140
you should stand up and point this out.

776
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,140
Point out this person who made Ma Shanbao a scapegoat.

777
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,140
It seems that you already knew.

778
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,140
I don't know what you're talking about.

779
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,140
It doesn't matter.

780
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,140
What matters is that I have got the answer I want.

781
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,140
You just watch me how to give Ma Shanbao justice

782
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,140
with the real murderer.

783
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,140
Isn't this the thing you've always wanted the most?

784
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,140
The truth is that Ma Shanbao is not the murderer.

785
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,140
He is the murderer.

786
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,140
He is the murderer.

787
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,140
He is the murderer.

788
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,140
He is the murderer.

789
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,140
He is the murderer.

790
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,140
He is the murderer.

791
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,140
He is the murderer.

792
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,140
He is the murderer.

793
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,140
He is the murderer.

794
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,140
He is the murderer.

795
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,140
He is the murderer.

796
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,140
He is the murderer.

797
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,140
He is the murderer.

798
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,140
He is the murderer.

799
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,140
He is the murderer.

800
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,140
He is the murderer.

801
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,140
He is the murderer.

802
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,140
He is the murderer.

803
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,140
He is the murderer.

804
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,140
He is the murderer.

805
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,140
He is the murderer.

806
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,140
He is the murderer.

807
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,140
He is the murderer.

808
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,140
He is the murderer.

809
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,140
He is the murderer.

810
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,140
He is the murderer.

811
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,140
He is the murderer.

812
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,140
He is the murderer.

813
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,140
It's like drinking cold water, drinking milk tea.

814
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,140
Looking at the dashing people

815
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,140
But I don't understand

816
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:11,940
Theyocking around into their black privileged

817
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,140
Why stay silent центр

818
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,140
Demand that they should not take their life

819
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,140
To make it easier for them to anywhere

820
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,140
hauling farm runway

821
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,140
It's right to build a good life

822
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,140
But to forget the bitter throats of the heart
