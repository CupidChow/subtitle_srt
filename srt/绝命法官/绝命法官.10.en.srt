1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
The violence in the old city area is getting worse.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Not only has it affected Zhi An,

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:13,760
it also has a negative effect on our

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:13,840
I hereby appeal to the police to confirm this issue.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,040
We'll go to the ad first.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,040
I'll be the international news.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What's up, Judge Qin?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I want to ask how A Wei is doing now.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
She only has half a life left.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're the one who's worried about her now.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Did you get the bullet?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What did the doctor say?

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We're not in the hospital.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Where are you going?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I won't tell you.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Don't expect A Wei to work for you.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're the one who's worried about her.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I won't let A Wei work for you again.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The police are here.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The police are here.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The police are here.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The police are here.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The police are here.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The police are here.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The police are here.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The police are here.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The police are here.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The police are here.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The police are here.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The police are here.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The police are here.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The police are here.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
sure.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Did you record something?

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Looks like

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
she might not have a fever.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What's wrong?

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I definitely have a fever

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That doesn't show.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,500
When I

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
after the recovery shows

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I must take him to a flexib unreasonable

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I must poor me

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Tang faster

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yu Sí

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This is what I mean.

51
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,280
Taking care of patients is my duty.

52
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,000
You don't need to give me a gift.

53
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,840
This is not a wish-granting fee.

54
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,280
It's my heart.

55
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,400
My sister is a police officer.

56
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,240
What does this have to do with it?

57
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,640
We're not on the same side.

58
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,800
Young Master Ling,

59
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,200
there's a response from the government.

60
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
I just showed him the news

61
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,160
about the Longye's treason.

62
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,440
He responded.

63
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,200
asc以前

64
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,000
His Majesty

65
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,840
saw this message following antidote.

66
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,800
Now,

67
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,680
As I was hoping...

68
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,480
in the position of container,

69
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,760
I found one.

70
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,240
In my heart,

71
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,480
someone I lost

72
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,320
is near here.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,120
I saw similar videos

74
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,440
and again,

75
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,000
I saw this.

76
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,880
Dongdong smoothed out

77
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,760
Xiao Lie.

78
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,960
Big Brother.

79
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Xiao Lie.

80
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,280
It's good that you're awake.

81
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,000
How is Lao Bao?

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He's fine.

83
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,960
He's just worried about you.

84
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm worried about him too.

85
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,560
I heard from Dr. Lin

86
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,120
that I was hit by a car

87
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,000
and was in the hospital for half a month.

88
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
That's right.

89
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,440
The person who hit you

90
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
is him.

91
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,320
His name is Ma Shanbao.

92
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
But don't worry.

93
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,800
We've already avenged you.

94
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
I know him.

95
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,880
He doesn't look like that.

96
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
No.

97
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
Big Brother.

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,200
Have you seen the killer?

99
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Do you know who he is?

100
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
I don't know him.

101
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,080
But if I see him again,

102
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
I'll definitely recognize him.

103
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
No.

104
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
Take your time.

105
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,080
Robbing the military?

106
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,760
I have a big,

107
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,880
killer weapon here.

108
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
I need to rob it?

109
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Where's the evidence?

110
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
If you can't catch him,

111
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,880
you'll be wronged for this kind of good deed.

112
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,880
If there's no evidence,

113
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,480
I'll let you go.

114
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,280
Boss, I've found it.

115
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Qi Changrong

116
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
did have an evidence

117
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,880
when he was robbing the military.

118
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,480
Even if it wasn't him,

119
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,880
he must be the mastermind.

120
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,880
Otherwise, why did he

121
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,880
appear at the scene of the explosion?

122
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,880
He's going to fight Han Lie.

123
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,880
How do we deal with him?

124
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,480
They like to fight.

125
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,880
Let them fight first.

126
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,880
If they're really short of evidence,

127
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,880
we'll help them when the time is up.

128
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Yes, sir.

129
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,880
We robbed his 4-kilogram Hailuo Eagle.

130
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,880
And we killed two of his men.

131
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,880
His nest in the city

132
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,880
was also broken by us.

133
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
We also opened a massage house.

134
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
Go.

135
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,880
Who are you?

136
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,880
Get out.

137
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
Get out.

138
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Get out.

139
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
Get out.

140
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,880
In two weeks,

141
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,880
Qi Changrong will be in Haogang.

142
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
He won't have a place to stay.

143
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,880
He can only go back to the old city.

144
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
But the old man is shocked.

145
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,880
Enough.

146
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
All right.

147
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Qi Changrong used those guns and explosives

148
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
to deal with us.

149
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,880
Even the police have no evidence to arrest him.

150
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
Instead, you left the evidence.

151
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,880
I told you.

152
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,880
We're just standing by and watching the fun.

153
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,880
I don't want to be dragged by someone.

154
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,880
I should start first.

155
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,880
How's your brother?

156
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,880
The doctor said he'll go out of the window today

157
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,880
and continue the physical therapy.

158
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,880
Okay.

159
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,880
Old Man.

160
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
If these are all made by my brother,

161
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,880
don't you think it's okay?

162
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,880
When your brother recovers,

163
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,880
you'll know the answer

164
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,880
when you see what he'll do.

165
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
Brother Qi.

166
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
Brother Qi.

167
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
I'm sorry, Brother Qi.

168
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,880
They're a big group.

169
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,880
We didn't prepare to rush in.

170
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
Take it to the brothers and check the doctor.

171
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
After the treatment,

172
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,880
we'll go to find the one named Han

173
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
with our own efforts.

174
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
Take it back.

175
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
Okay.

176
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
Thank you, Brother Qi.

177
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
Brother Qi.

178
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
They took the old house in the Black-woods' house.

179
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
Old Gao and his brothers went to get the goods.

180
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
They haven't come back yet.

181
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Something might have happened.

182
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Remember.

183
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
This money

184
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,880
will be used to find the one named Han sooner or later.

185
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
Okay.

186
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
This money

187
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
will be used to find the one named Han sooner or later.

188
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
But now,

189
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,880
it's better to use the money of Cao.

190
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
Let's go.

191
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
Sha Sha.

192
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
It's me.

193
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
Brother Qi.

194
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,880
My father was followed.

195
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
So I went around a few times.

196
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
I'm sorry, Brother Peng.

197
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
I've troubled you.

198
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,880
But you really need to help me save A'Wei.

199
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
Your father told me to tell you.

200
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,880
He took your mother and two children

201
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
to a friend's house.

202
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
He told you not to worry.

203
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
Where is the wound?

204
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
Here.

205
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
The bullet is in there.

206
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
If you don't take it out,

207
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
you can kill him

208
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
with a high fever.

209
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Then help him

210
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
to take out the bullet.

211
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Do you know

212
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,880
that Qi Changrong's people

213
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
are looking for your husband everywhere?

214
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,880
How can you insult him?

215
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
A'Wei is doing this for us.

216
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Brother Peng, I have no choice.

217
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
I'm begging you.

218
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
Brother Peng, please hurry up.

219
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Please save my husband first.

220
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Your mother helped me before.

221
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
I'll return her a favor.

222
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
Okay.

223
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Find him!

224
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,880
He should be alive!

225
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
Brother Qi.

226
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
The hospital said the dog was dead

227
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
and he was not alive.

228
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,480
I know there's something wrong with the phone.

229
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,760
It wasn't him who sent the goods.

230
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,240
This is not an accident.

231
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,920
Cao Wei'er is a bastard.

232
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,680
He wants to kill me too.

233
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,320
We've searched everywhere.

234
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,360
There's no one.

235
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,320
They must have run away.

236
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,400
Brother Qi,

237
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,560
the news said

238
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,760
the robbers who robbed the transport car

239
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,560
were injured and escaped.

240
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,640
They can't run away.

241
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,280
The police are looking for him everywhere.

242
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,480
He's injured.

243
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,760
He doesn't dare to go to the hospital.

244
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,040
The police are looking for him everywhere.

245
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,280
Let go of the news.

246
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,640
If any black-skinned doctor

247
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,120
dares to help Cao Wei'er,

248
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,640
he'll die with him.

249
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Yes, sir.

250
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,560
Here,

251
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,600
hold the wound.

252
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,840
I'll seal it immediately.

253
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,080
Hurry up.

254
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,840
Do you want him to die of loss of blood?

255
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,220
I may fall.

256
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,020
Let go.

257
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,180
The dean of the interview

258
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,060
should choose red moreG wire influence.

259
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,280
He'll

260
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,720
The black one.

261
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,360
Do you like it?

262
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,400
Do you want me to pick another one for you?

263
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,280
He doesn't seem to be that thin.

264
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,760
He'll be fine after a few more days of rest.

265
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,040
Thank you, Brother Peng.

266
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,680
A'wen, can you hear me?

267
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,280
You'll be fine.

268
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,520
We'll be fine.

269
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,960
Brother Peng.

270
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,360
Here.

271
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,560
Who do you think I am?

272
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,680
Thank you, Brother Peng.

273
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,520
He's bleeding so much.

274
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,280
Buy some food to make him recover.

275
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,560
Then,

276
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
Brother Peng, please.

277
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,360
Can you take care of him?

278
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,960
I'll go out and buy some food for him.

279
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,960
And I'll go to see my two kids.

280
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,600
Thank you.

281
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,520
I can only stay a little longer.

282
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,760
There are patients waiting for me at the school lunch house.

283
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,040
Okay, I'll be there soon.

284
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,840
I'll be there soon.

285
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,400
As soon as possible.

286
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,760
Okay, thank you, Brother Peng.

287
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,040
Chief Qin.

288
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,480
I didn't see you just now.

289
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,280
I was so afraid that you would get hurt.

290
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,480
Thank you, Chief Qin.

291
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,600
I did very well in the interview.

292
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,680
I don't know why I have

293
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,880
a very good feeling about this.

294
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,680
I thought you'd figured it out.

295
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,640
You can sit back and relax.

296
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,480
You won't have to suffer anymore.

297
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Thank you, Chief Qin.

298
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
I'll be back soon.

299
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
I'll be back soon.

300
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
I'll be back soon.

301
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
I'll be back soon.

302
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
I'll be back soon.

303
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
I'll be back soon.

304
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
I'll be back soon.

305
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Thank you for your concern.

306
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Good luck to you.

307
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,280
From the first day I became a judge,

308
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,800
I asked myself

309
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,240
if the punishment was the only way to protect the law.

310
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,840
The information showed

311
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,280
that the judges who graduated from the procuratorate

312
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,040
have a higher rate of punishment.

313
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,440
This kind of punishment

314
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,320
is likely to be caused by their long-term control work.

315
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,600
Sometimes, even they themselves are involved.

316
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
I can't understand.

317
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
I've been working in the procuratorate

318
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
for half a year.

319
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,000
What you mean is

320
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,680
if you were the court president,

321
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,200
you might be more objective and fair

322
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,280
when you're reviewing the case.

323
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,880
That's your advantage, right?

324
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
I think what the court president is pursuing

325
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,480
shouldn't be the law of punishment,

326
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,880
but the justice of the law.

327
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,720
Do you remember

328
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,680
Ding Kaiyi's case a year ago?

329
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Yes.

330
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
That was a murder case.

331
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,680
You only went to court twice

332
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,680
and suddenly asked to change yourself.

333
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
Just because of that,

334
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,680
the case was to be reviewed again.

335
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,080
It took a court and wasted time.

336
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,680
Can you explain

337
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,280
why you did that?

338
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,480
Because the defendant

339
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,480
looked very similar to my wife.

340
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,880
Even the words and actions were the same.

341
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,480
I was afraid that I couldn't leave the prejudice

342
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,480
and make a judgment to the defendant.

343
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,680
Because at that moment,

344
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
my wife died less than a month ago.

345
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,680
I know my method is not perfect.

346
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:19,480
But...

347
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Don't you think

348
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,280
your method is perfect?

349
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
Ma Shanbao

350
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,680
and Hao Weiyou

351
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,280
did many wrong and unjust things.

352
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
Have you ever

353
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,480
felt guilty

354
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,480
and blamed yourself?

355
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,880
Can you sleep

356
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
when you sleep at night?

357
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:43,680
You...

358
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,880
What did you say?

359
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,280
I mean

360
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,080
I agree with your method.

361
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,280
There is no such thing as perfect in this world.

362
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,480
We are not machines.

363
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,480
I believe

364
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,680
that if I were you,

365
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,280
I would do the same.

366
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,280
I believe

367
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,680
that if I were you,

368
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,880
I would do the same.

369
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,680
I believe

370
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,880
that if I were you,

371
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,680
I would do the same.

372
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,480
I believe

373
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,480
that if I were you,

374
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,680
I would do the same.

375
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
I believe

376
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,880
that if I were you,

377
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,080
I would do the same.

378
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,880
I believe

379
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,080
that if I were you,

380
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,280
I would do the same

381
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,080
I believe

382
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,280
that if I were you.

383
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,080
That's it.

384
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,380
That's right.

385
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,680
Alright.

386
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,080
We may not be able to

387
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,280
see each other caned.

388
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,480
That's enough.

389
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,120
We are going to

390
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,680
meet in the Anya Res Huhou

391
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
Father!

392
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,260
Your phone may not on for the moment.

393
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,020
Go.

394
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,260
Because of you,

395
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,620
I've killed two brothers

396
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,980
who've followed me for more than ten years.

397
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,860
Actually, what you want most

398
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,780
is the life of me, Qi Changrong.

399
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,340
Right?

400
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,260
For the sake of this city,

401
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,260
but don't lose her.

402
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,380
Weiwei.

403
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,340
Weiwei.

404
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,680
Weiwei.

405
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,680
Weiwei, open the door.

406
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
It's your grandma.

407
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
Weiwei.

408
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,680
I want to talk to you.

409
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
You don't need to go to school, right?

410
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,680
Weiwei, I know.

411
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
I was too nervous before.

412
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,680
I just hope that our family

413
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,680
won't have any more bad things happen.

414
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
I often quarrel with your dad.

415
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,680
It also causes you trouble.

416
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
Then grandma promised you

417
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,680
that she would pay attention to this problem in the future.

418
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Weiwei, say a few words

419
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,680
to respond to grandma.

420
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
I have nothing to say.

421
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
Do you recognize this necklace?

422
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,680
Yes.

423
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
This necklace is a gift

424
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
that I gave to your mother

425
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,680
three years ago.

426
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,680
The circle represents Yuan Man.

427
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
After your mother passed away,

428
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,680
your father couldn't find it.

429
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,680
You gave it to Coach Yu.

430
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,680
Then he returned it to me.

431
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,680
Where did you find this necklace?

432
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,680
Why didn't you tell your father?

433
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Weiwei.

434
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
Weiwei.

435
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
Hey, coach.

436
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,680
What happened?

437
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
I don't know why

438
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
the coach suddenly did this.

439
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
What happened?

440
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,680
He was fine before.

441
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,680
He has a fever.

442
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,680
It's possible that he got hit by a chicken

443
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
and caused a sequela.

444
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,680
We are going to give him a shock

445
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,680
and let him calm down.

446
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,680
We will check the situation later.

447
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Say a few words.

448
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,680
If it's about your brother,

449
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
the doctor said that

450
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
his brain was injured

451
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
and he needed a long recovery.

452
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
It's not my brother.

453
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
It's your sister.

454
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
My sister?

455
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,680
What happened to my sister?

456
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
The police said she was on vacation

457
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,680
and she wouldn't answer my call.

458
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,680
She was forced to take a vacation because of you.

459
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,680
But because of you,

460
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
my sister is a policewoman.

461
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,680
She can't have anything to do with you.

462
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,680
I wanted to have something to do with her,

463
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,680
but it wasn't her.

464
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
If it's because of me,

465
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,680
your sister was forced to take a vacation,

466
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
I'm sorry.

467
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,680
But I have something to ask her.

468
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,680
My sister has nothing to say to you.

469
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,680
Yes or no?

470
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
I've said it.

471
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,680
What do you mean?

472
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,680
The police asked me to ask you something.

473
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
I guess it's about your sister.

474
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,680
My sister has nothing to do with you.

475
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
Yes or no?

476
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
It depends on what I say.

477
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
What do you want?

478
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,680
Tell her

479
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
that my brother is awake

480
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
and he saw the murderer.

481
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
He saw the murderer.

482
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,680
Tang Xuan was forced to take a vacation.

483
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,680
Is this what you want?

484
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Isn't this what you want?

485
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,680
He hid the evidence.

486
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,680
It's not fair to the parties.

487
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,680
You're always so arrogant

488
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,680
and talk about these false words.

489
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,680
If you come to me this time,

490
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,680
there's nothing else.

491
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,680
You used the people who trusted you

492
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,680
and dragged innocent people into this.

493
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,680
Do you really feel no guilt?

494
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,680
Wei.

495
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Wei.

496
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
Wei.

497
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
Wei.

498
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,680
I never thought things would turn out like this.

499
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,680
I don't want to talk about the past.

500
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
But since the first day,

501
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,680
I asked you to help Ma Shanbao.

502
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,680
I really hope you can help Ma Shanbao.

503
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,680
But now Ma Shanbao has sacrificed himself.

504
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,680
It's because of you.

505
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
It's not your fault.

506
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,680
Your only fault

507
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,680
is that you trusted me.

508
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,680
Put this down.

509
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,680
You can start over.

510
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
I'm sorry.

511
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
Hello?

512
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Are you off work?

513
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
Yes.

514
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,680
Han Lie.

515
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,680
Just say it.

516
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,680
My brother is awake.

517
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,680
The one I drew may be the murderer.

518
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
You'd better hurry up.

519
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
I'll wait for your good news.

520
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
Thank you.

521
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,680
My sister is a good police officer.

522
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
Keep a distance from Han Lie.

523
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
Don't get involved in this matter again.

524
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,680
He wanted to give me the watch.

525
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,680
He didn't mean to hurt you.

526
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,680
I know.

527
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
He didn't frame me.

528
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
Then...

529
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Keep a distance from him.

530
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Did you hear what I said?

531
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
Then...

532
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Whether it's voluntary or forced,

533
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,680
let's take a vacation.

534
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,680
How about I invite you to come with me?

535
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,680
I have something to do.

536
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
I'll send you back first.

537
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
I have to find Shisi.

538
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,680
You're busy with this.

539
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
You're so smart.

540
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,680
Tang Ducha.

541
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
How can you call this vacation?

542
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
You want to move the whole office

543
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
to my house, right?

544
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
I finally figured out

545
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,680
the whole case.

546
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
I hope you can listen to me

547
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
and say it again.

548
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,680
See if my theory is right.

549
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,680
Tang Ducha.

550
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,680
I just got off work.

551
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
I'm sorry.

552
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
I didn't mean to hurt you.

553
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
I'm sorry.

554
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
I'm sorry.

555
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,680
I'm sorry.

556
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
I'm sorry.

557
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,680
I'm sorry.

558
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,680
I'm sorry.

559
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,680
I'll go first.

560
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
No, no, no.

561
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,680
That's not necessary.

562
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,680
You wrote so many words.

563
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
Are you tired?

564
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
I'll help you.

565
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
It seems like a spider web.

566
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,680
What's the relationship between them?

567
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,680
It's so complicated.

568
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
What's going on?

569
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,680
Han Kuilong.

570
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,680
I know it's not a good person

571
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,680
just by hearing the name.

572
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,680
Han, Kuilong, and Long.

573
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
Hello.

574
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
Police.

575
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
I'm Louis.

576
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,680
I heard that you did well

577
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,680
in your interview.

578
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
Congratulations.

579
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
What's up?

580
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,680
I received a letter.

581
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,680
It's about half a year ago.

582
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,680
You were questioned by the police.

583
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,680
It was when your wife committed suicide.

584
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
The police thought you were suspicious

585
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
and started an investigation on you.

586
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
You tried so hard to find me.

587
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
I'm sorry.

588
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,680
I'm sorry.

589
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,680
I'm sorry.

590
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
I'm sorry.

591
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
I'm sorry.

592
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,680
You tried so hard to find me

593
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
to make me quit the election.

594
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,680
The police are just doing an investigation.

595
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,680
I've been cleared.

596
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,680
The point is not whether you're cleared or not.

597
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,680
The point is that you were suspected.

598
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,680
The candidate for the president

599
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,680
is the suspect of murder.

600
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,680
I won't quit because of your threat.

601
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,680
If so,

602
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,680
I'll give this letter to the police.

603
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,680
Okay.

604
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,680
Brother.

605
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Where's A'Vie?

606
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
Where's he?

607
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,680
I saved him.

608
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,680
I've tried my best, right?

609
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,680
You can find Qi Changlong for the rest.

610
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,680
You betrayed me.

611
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,680
You have a husband and a child.

612
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,680
I have a wife and a child.

613
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,680
I want to protect them.

614
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,680
You offended the bad guy.

615
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,680
You offended that bastard.

616
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
I'm sorry.

617
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,680
Qin Yu wanted to stop me

618
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,680
from taking his son back to the police station

619
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,680
and framed me for having a relationship with the dark community.

620
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,680
He was around my house that night.

621
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,680
He's the only one who could see me meeting Han Lie.

622
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,680
He used Zhou Luo Wen's suggestion

623
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,680
to make him complain to the police.

624
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
He lied to me

625
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,680
and used Zhou Luo Wen's justice

626
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,680
to keep his son safe.

627
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,680
That was the only purpose

628
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,440
Because he knew from the beginning

629
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,320
that his son was the murderer of Tao Yi

630
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,600
after he hit the man.

631
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,840
In a word,

632
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,600
hit the snake and hit the seven-inch.

633
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,320
You must remember it.

634
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,320
You must find Qin Yingwei

635
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,440
and find Tao Yi's identity

636
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,880
after the incident.

637
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,720
And Tang Xuan,

638
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,720
you

639
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,760
should protect yourself.

640
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,640
You don't have to hit yourself.

641
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,440
Let's truly

642
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,600
protect ourselves,

643
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,160
all of us.

644
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,640
This journalist heard that

645
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,200
the candidate for the local court議員

646
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,400
is לה圭 dieses,

647
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,520
who was suspected of the incident

648
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,720
about his wife's suicide

649
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,240
half a year ago.

650
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,640
It must be yours. Congratulations.

651
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,720
I have to wait for the official announcement.

652
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:31,960
No need.

653
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,840
Who else would it be?

654
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,400
You can say I'm fine.

655
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,360
But don't say my wife.

656
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,560
Also,

657
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,320
when the police checked my car,

658
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,680
you took that photo.

659
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,480
Right?

660
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,200
It was me.

661
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,680
I may not be a good person,

662
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,440
but you must be a bad person.

663
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,880
Yi Wei.

664
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,840
What's up, dad?

665
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Think carefully.

666
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,720
When you hit Han Gang,

667
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,240
did you get off the car?

668
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,680
I walked by his side

669
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,840
and saw blood all over his face.

670
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,440
I was scared to death

671
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,280
and threw up.

672
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
I was scared to death.

673
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
I was scared to death.

674
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,200
I threw up.

675
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,280
Then I went back to the car

676
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,400
to get the defibrillator.

677
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,200
Did you throw up?

678
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:32,920
Yes.

679
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,800
Why didn't you tell me?

680
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,120
I don't remember.

681
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,760
But it has something to do with it.

682
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,120
Because the police found a defibrillator

683
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,600
at the crime scene.

684
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,520
There's your DNA on it.

685
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,000
If they put the DNA of the defibrillator

686
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,240
to compare it with the defibrillator...

687
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,000
But

688
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,360
there's no name on it.

689
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,880
How could they know it was me?

690
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,280
Someone broke our trash can this morning.

691
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,800
There's the defibrillator you used in the trash.

692
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,200
There's your DNA on it.

693
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,480
If you compare the three things,

694
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,800
it can prove that

695
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,600
you've been to the crime scene.

696
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,440
Get off the car.

697
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,680
You're in danger.

698
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,440
I'm so sad.

699
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,680
Do you know why?

700
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,080
It's not because my brother was killed by you.

701
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,680
It's not because I was caught by the police

702
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,200
that I was killed.

703
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
It's not because I was killed by you.

704
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,320
It's not even because Han Lie

705
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,080
wanted to ruin my business.

706
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,720
I'm so sad because of you.

707
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,680
You used your child's life

708
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,200
to steal the defibrillator for me.

709
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,560
But you didn't keep your promise.

710
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,840
What kind of bastard are you?

711
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,720
I didn't lie to you.

712
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,600
I helped you steal the defibrillator.

713
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,640
Who's playing the bomb here

714
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,640
to kill me?

715
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,640
Who's playing the bomb here

716
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,240
to kill me?

717
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,880
You're not the one who helped you deliver the goods.

718
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,240
Who is it?

719
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,440
Should I find out the evidence

720
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,000
and settle it together?

721
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,360
Who are you waiting for?

722
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,360
Stop him.

723
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,160
Are you willing to tell me?

724
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,160
Do you want me to kill your other hand

725
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,080
before you tell me?

726
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,720
I'm willing to tell you.

727
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,760
I'm willing to tell you.

728
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
Ji Changrong,

729
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,080
I know you won't get back at me.

730
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,120
Why don't you just give up?

731
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,560
It's different to be a cop.

732
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,120
You're really tough.

733
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,720
But I don't know if your precious son,

734
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,480
Bones, is as tough as you.

735
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,960
Maybe you can give it a try.

736
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,720
I swear

737
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,560
I'll keep my wife and child safe.

738
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,440
Don't touch them.

739
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,720
Cao Wei'er,

740
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,520
you're the one who swore to kill the child.

741
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,640
Who do you think God will listen to?

742
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,480
Mr. Lian,

743
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,840
it's Qi Changrong.

744
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,160
He's left. He's out of weapons.

745
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,880
My brother wants to talk to you.

746
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,160
Han Lie,

747
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,160
I want to sit down and talk to you.

748
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,880
What's there to talk about?

749
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,360
You want to surrender?

750
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,240
You'll know when you're here.

751
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,000
You're still bold enough to do so.

752
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,720
You're not afraid of me,

753
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,920
but you're afraid of me.

754
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,920
You're afraid of me.

755
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,240
You're still too timid

756
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,440
to come to see me.

757
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,240
I'll tell you where to sit later.

758
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,800
Senior,

759
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,840
do you remember the DNA test

760
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,240
you did for me last time?

761
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,440
I do.

762
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,800
Do you remember any samples of burglary?

763
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,960
I suspect that

764
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,280
the same person did it.

765
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,720
I want you to do

766
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,000
a DNA comparison test for me.

767
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,560
You won't tell me

768
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,080
the source of these samples, will you?

769
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,720
You're so smart.

770
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,600
All right.

771
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,960
I'll do the test for you as soon as possible.

772
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,840
Thank you.

773
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,960
Let me know if you have any results.

774
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,440
Put the gun away.

775
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:35,880
Come down.

776
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,240
I have a big gift for you.

777
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,600
Come here.

778
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,000
You don't know this guy, do you?

779
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,080
Introduce yourself to Young Master Lie.

780
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,360
His name is Cao Wei Er.

781
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,760
He used to be a policeman.

782
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,320
He was fired

783
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,800
and he's now a private.

784
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,320
You asked me out

785
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,080
not just to introduce a friend

786
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,080
to me, right?

787
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,080
I heard that your brother is awake.

788
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,520
He finally got his life back

789
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,680
from Lord Yan.

790
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,280
I guess you don't know

791
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,080
the truth about your brother's death.

792
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,480
But he knows it.

793
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,320
Tell me.

794
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,360
Wake up.

795
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,280
Tell me who did it.

796
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,440
It's Qin Yu.

797
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,720
Do you think

798
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,000
his son

799
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,840
hurt your brother?

800
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,680
You killed Ma Shan Bao

801
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,320
and used hot oil

802
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,880
to break my brother, Da Xiong.

803
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:17,960
How do you count it?

804
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,640
You burned my men too.

805
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,120
You stole that gun

806
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,240
and the explosives

807
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,480
that almost killed you.

808
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,240
I didn't set up the war.

809
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,720
Don't think that I'll pretend

810
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,520
nothing happened

811
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,000
if I send this guy here.

812
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
But not today.

813
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,920
At least, I won't be used as a fool.

814
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,920
You've made it clear.

815
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,000
It has nothing to do with the Old City Gang.

816
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,920
We'll figure it out later.

817
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,160
And

818
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,560
how are you going to deal with him?

819
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,560
Whatever.

820
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,200
Jin Cheng Rong.

821
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,280
Don't forget

822
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,640
you swore to me

823
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,800
to keep my wife and my son safe

824
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,200
when you were in front of me.

825
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,520
If you don't keep your promise,

826
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,800
you'll be punished.

827
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,560
Psychologist

828
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,560
I'd like to have a word with you.

829
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,400
I've complained about you.

830
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,400
I know.

831
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,040
I can complain about you

832
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,200
to harass the witness.

833
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,400
I didn't come to you on purpose.

834
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,120
I was just waiting for someone.

835
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,040
And you happened to see me after work.

836
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,200
What do you want to say?

837
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,480
I know Ma Shanbao is not the murderer.

838
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,600
You finally admit

839
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,320
that you caught the wrong person.

840
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,280
Yes.

841
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,920
We did catch the wrong person.

842
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,400
But it's because

843
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,480
the people around us

844
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,080
have been deliberately misleading us.

845
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,000
The word we I'm talking about

846
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,000
is about me and you.

847
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,320
If you want to blame me,

848
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,800
if you want to give Ma Shanbao

849
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,640
justice,

850
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,920
you should stand up

851
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,720
and point this out

852
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,600
to make Ma Shanbao

853
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,800
a scapegoat.

854
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,320
It seems that you've known it long ago.

855
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,240
I don't know what you're talking about.

856
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,120
It doesn't matter.

857
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:53,920
What matters is

858
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,080
I've got the answer I want.

859
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,480
Just watch me

860
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,440
use the real murderer

861
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,040
to give Ma Shanbao justice.

862
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,600
Isn't this

863
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,040
what you've always wanted?
