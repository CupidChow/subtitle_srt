65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The changes are going to take place soon.

67
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,000
Police are trying to processes her orders above board.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Police are trying to processes her orders above board.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Police are trying to processes her orders above board.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Everything we've got to cover for a while right here.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We should always look ahead and follow those orders properly.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Tam��rire.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Why didn't you say those orders before setting off?

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Why did you leave without taking a walk?

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The car is parked in front of the house of Ma.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Two masked traitors

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
stopped the car and

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
went to the road.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Who told you to do this?

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We received a call last night.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is the location of the letter box.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Are you sure

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
you are the one who killed the man

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
who killed Qi Changrong?

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The man who died was from the God's help.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I did my best for my brother

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and helped Tie Tuo.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Who did it?

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I must take revenge

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
for my brother.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The police will definitely look for you.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So be it.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I've taken care of everything.

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What am I afraid of?

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Do you know how big a trouble you've caused?

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You killed this bastard.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Do you think you are very powerful?

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
If it were your brother,

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
he would have destroyed the entire Jiucheng Gang

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and left nothing behind.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What's most important to him

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
is that he hopes that your brother

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
can walk out of the hospital

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
in good health.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What's most important to you

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
is to save his life.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Do you understand?

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Answer me!

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I understand.

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I want to go back and pee!

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I want to go back and pee!

112
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Qin Yu,

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
come in.

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay.

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Did I do something wrong?

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I shouldn't have let him go out.

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I taught you

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
to get information

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
so that you can get out of the elevator.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can't go out.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You have to be quick.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's all a strategy.

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There are no rules

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
in the process, right?

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Besides,

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
even if it's not like this,

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Ma Shanbao will go out

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
by himself sooner or later.

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The person who wants to kill him

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
can kill him anyway.

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But the problem is that no one knows

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
that he was bailed out.

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The first day...

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Will everyone hear

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
me?

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I said I didn't touch anything.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I never thought the mole was so close to me.

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He was right in front of me

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
every time I took a step.

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're scared.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You are scared.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I just saw Qi Chengrong.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Han Kuilong committed a murder on his territory.

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He will definitely be reprimanded.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I will send someone to keep an eye on him for 24 hours.

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He's awake. What did he say to you?

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He only told me that you will take him abroad.

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I want to hear what you have to say.

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I will take him back first. We will talk about it later.

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't go up there.

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Go up there and explain why you told me not to let Weiwei go out last night.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Because she was not in a good mood last night.

153
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We had a fight.

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Weiwei is still young. Why did you take her away suddenly?

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I have my reasons.

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Then explain clearly what happened.

157
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Did you hide something from me?

158
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You are not hiding anything from me.

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yesterday, I went to the bank to save some money for Weiwei.

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I checked the balance.

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I was shocked.

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You took all the money inside.

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What happened?

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Can I drink some water?

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Thank you.

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Say it.

167
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Recently, I found Weiwei in Tanchi City.

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
She is a female coach of the school basketball team.

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
She is a few years older.

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
How could this happen?

171
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I am not a girl.

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I am a girl.

173
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I am a girl.

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
How could this happen?

175
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
They drank at the school.

176
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
They shocked the school.

177
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I used my parents' identity to attend their spiritual meeting.

178
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
With a female coach?

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Maybe after my wife died,

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
she missed her mother too much.

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
She wanted to find someone to talk to and to tell her story.

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I went to the school.

183
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I wanted to take Weiwei to the university for a semester.

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I took the money out.

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You really want to go with her?

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You quit your job and you don't even work as a judge?

187
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I will.

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
If you had thought like that before,

189
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I thought, how could my daughter kill herself?

190
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You still owe me an answer.

191
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't have an answer. I don't know why.

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I only know that after my wife died, I have to be nicer to Yiwei.

193
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What kind of coach is this?

194
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He's really a man of his word.

195
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm going to the school to complain to him.

196
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
No need. I've already dealt with it.

197
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Your deal is to let Weiwei leave her familiar environment and friends.

198
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay. Whether we go or not, we'll discuss it later.

199
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You discuss it with her. Don't irritate her anymore.

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Okay. I will.

201
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Go home.

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Where?

203
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Home.

204
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Let's go.

205
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Dad, can you tell me what happened?

206
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't know.

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I don't know.

208
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't know.

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't know.

210
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't know.

211
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Can you tell me what happened?

212
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Let's go home first.

213
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Okay.

214
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I understand.

215
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't worry. I will help you.

216
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Okay. Bye.

217
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Excuse me, how long do I have to wait for Tang Ducha to come?

218
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Madam is still busy.

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Do you need me to make an appointment?

220
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No need. I will continue to wait for her.

221
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We're home. Can you tell me now?

222
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Have you heard of the warning of confession?

223
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
When you're not just a witness or a suspect,

224
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and you're warned by the police,

225
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
what you say might become a success.

226
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm just afraid that I might say something wrong and get caught.

227
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Did they find out?

228
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I confirmed this morning.

229
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
They didn't find out anything.

230
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I was too nervous last night.

231
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I was in a mess.

232
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I was afraid that after I was arrested,

233
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
you would be left alone.

234
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
In the end,

235
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
you were caught too.

236
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I was afraid that I wouldn't dare to think about it again.

237
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So I wanted to escape.

238
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But now, I'm fine.

239
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Are you sure?

240
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yes. I'm sure.

241
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Sorry.

242
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You have a message.

243
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Please answer it.

244
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Judge Ji,

245
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
A'bao can't say anything.

246
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Don't worry. He's fine.

247
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Dad, let's order takeout this afternoon.

248
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Okay.

249
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You order.

250
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Tang Ducha.

251
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You go first.

252
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What's the matter, Ms. Zhou?

253
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Ma Shanbao was shot by the police.

254
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
There's a mole in the police.

255
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I strongly demand that the police

256
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
immediately make an explanation for Ma Shanbao's death.

257
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The case is under investigation.

258
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You're not going to tell me the truth?

259
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm not going to tell you the truth.

260
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm not going to tell you the truth.

261
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What's the matter, Ms. Zhou?

262
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You know he's not the real murderer.

263
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He has evidence.

264
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
He was pushed out and became a scapegoat.

265
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The police are going to catch him to get evidence.

266
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What about the gang?

267
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
They'd rather kill him than let him go.

268
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Qu Xiong was broken into. That's the best example.

269
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What do you want to say?

270
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I want to say that Ma Shanbao will be in danger

271
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
if he's exposed.

272
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
He will be involved in the gang's murder.

273
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Why do you have to expose him?

274
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Because I thought you could protect him.

275
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Besides me and the procurator who knew he would go home,

276
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
you also knew.

277
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
When you drove to the old city,

278
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
did you ever think about this?

279
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Providing information,

280
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
exchanging the treasure,

281
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
is there really information to exchange with me?

282
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Or are you playing with my legal means?

283
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
These legal means that only experts can play,

284
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
it's not something you, a newcomer, can think of.

285
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Who taught you that?

286
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
OK.

287
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I will.

288
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Wei, how long have we been together?

289
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The kids are asleep.

290
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Don't wake them up.

291
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't care if you are a cop or not.

292
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't care if you have a lot of money.

293
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
When we got married, I swore,

294
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
no matter what happens, I will be with you.

295
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
As long as the family is in good health.

296
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But what about you?

297
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,560
Have you forgotten what you said?

298
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,760
I don't know what happened.

299
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,680
What if something happened to us yesterday?

300
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,720
I didn't expect it to be like this.

301
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,360
From the night A Bao came to our house,

302
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,760
to the day he was caught,

303
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,440
it's been two weeks.

304
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,040
Two weeks.

305
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,400
If you think about it,

306
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,160
it means you don't care about our family's life.

307
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
A'Wei, I want to leave here.

308
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
I want to leave you.

309
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,880
Why?

310
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,000
I want to take my son away.

311
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,880
I...

312
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,920
I just want to live a peaceful life.

313
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,120
After A Bao's funeral,

314
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,520
I'll take my children to my parents' house.

315
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,800
Sha Sha.

316
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,840
Is it the judge?

317
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,360
Answer it.

318
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,000
Ask him if he knows

319
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,960
our family was ruined by him.

320
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,840
Sha Sha.

321
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
Don't do this.

322
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,000
Just because he helped you,

323
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,280
you should give up your family

324
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,560
and work for him.

325
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Phone ringing.

326
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,600
Hello.

327
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,200
My phone is out of battery.

328
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,440
I just heard your message.

329
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,440
Didn't you say you were fine?

330
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,160
How did this happen?

331
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,960
You ask me, I'll ask someone else.

332
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,080
I'm sorry.

333
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,880
How did this happen?

334
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,120
Is an apology useful?

335
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,520
Will A Bao come back to life?

336
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'll tell you what.

337
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,760
If A Bao's family needs anything,

338
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,560
tell me.

339
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,760
See if I can help.

340
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,240
How dare I bother you?

341
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,160
I'm afraid of killing people.

342
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,600
Don't call me again.

343
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Master.

344
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
What's wrong?

345
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I killed Ma Shan Bao, right?

346
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I shouldn't have listened to your advice.

347
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
I shouldn't have kept him out.

348
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,000
Then he wouldn't have died.

349
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,600
Did you forget I told you

350
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
you're a lawyer, not a bodyguard?

351
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,000
He's only 18 years old.

352
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,000
If he were your son,

353
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,000
would you still say that?

354
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
A lawyer

355
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
needs to keep a distance from his client

356
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
to be able to perform his professional skills.

357
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Now that he's dead,

358
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
this case is over.

359
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's not over.

360
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Ma Shan Bao

361
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
is not only my client,

362
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
he's also a living person.

363
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I want to prove him wrong.

364
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Come.

365
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm leaving.

366
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Get in the car.

367
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Xiao Jun.

368
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Listen to me.

369
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Take good care of your sister, okay?

370
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Be good.

371
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Xiao Jun.

372
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Xiao Jun.

373
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Let's go.

374
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Drive.

375
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Drive.

376
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
The shooting that happened today

377
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
may be a battle between two different gangs.

378
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
According to the chairman, Huang Xiao,

379
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
the violence between the old gang and the Korean gang

380
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
was getting more and more intense

381
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
after a escape case in the Zhao family two weeks ago.

382
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
According to the police,

383
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
the victim of the shooting came from the old city.

384
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The 18-year-old young man, Ma Shan Bao...

385
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Did we kill him?

386
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Didn't you hear that?

387
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
The gang was killed by an accident.

388
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Accident?

389
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
No one can stop it.

390
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
This case is over.

391
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Let's not discuss it anymore, okay?

392
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
The victim of the shooting was killed by a car accident.

393
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
The police have not selected the murderer yet.

394
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Let's have dinner together tonight.

395
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm a little bit jealous this week.

396
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It doesn't matter what you eat.

397
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Ying, get me a bowl of rice.

398
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Okay.

399
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Okay.

400
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Young Master Lin,

401
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
according to the rules of Long Yue,

402
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
we will light the candles to pray for the victim.

403
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Is this arrangement okay?

404
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
No wonder you came back to eat with me.

405
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I know that every year this month,

406
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
you will eat with your deceased family.

407
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
My father can't be with you this year.

408
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Then I'll be with you.

409
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
He may not be satisfied with doing other things.

410
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Okay, let's eat.

411
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Dad, mom, brother,

412
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I came to see you.

413
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm fine, don't worry.

414
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's been 20 years.

415
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
The fire took 104 people away.

416
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It burned 200 people.

417
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Those who survived,

418
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
have their own new life.

419
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Many people forget how wronged their loved ones died.

420
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I have only one family left.

421
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
How can I forget?

422
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Although the killer of the fire has died,

423
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
many people have changed their lives because of this.

424
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You too.

425
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I didn't expect that after the fire,

426
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
you would be with Han Kuilong.

427
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Only he was willing to take care of me.

428
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You're pretty good, too.

429
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You became a police officer.

430
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I haven't found the hooligan yet.

431
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
After his girlfriend died,

432
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
all the contacts were cut off.

433
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
We grew up together.

434
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I don't know what he's doing now.

435
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
My family is busy recently, I'll go first.

436
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Lin Qian,

437
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
after that incident with Han Gang,

438
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
it should be a bit chaotic outside.

439
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You should be careful when you go in and out.

440
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm just a little woman by Brother Long's side.

441
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I'll help him manage the Han family,

442
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
take care of his two sons,

443
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
and help you with the communication.

444
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I won't ask about anything else.

445
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Anyway, you should be careful.

446
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I know.

447
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Shisan.

448
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I thought you wouldn't come today.

449
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I said I was good at it before.

450
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
But this time,

451
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm really sorry.

452
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Did you find the case of Ma Shanbao?

453
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You keep saying that you're watching it.

454
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Is God really watching it?

455
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You have hundreds of lives,

456
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
but you haven't found the culprit.

457
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I just killed an innocent person.

458
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Don't talk about me.

459
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
We police officers

460
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
have met people and cases that we can't solve.

461
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I understand the truth.

462
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
But I'm really uncomfortable.

463
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I understand.

464
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It's all human nature.

465
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You're an ordinary person.

466
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
No matter how many times you've experienced it,

467
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
it's still uncomfortable.

468
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Fortunately, you still have me.

469
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm with you, right?

470
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I think I'm with you today.

471
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Whatever.

472
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Anyway, we're just two people together.

473
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So, are you going there again today?

474
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Of course.

475
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Then you should let go of me.

476
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Why?

477
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
There's no one here.

478
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
If I don't let go, it's going to be dark there.

479
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
You drive your car, I drive my car.

480
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
See you later.

481
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Four people in front of me.

482
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Three people in front of me.

483
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
They're all down there.

484
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Can the superficial prosperity really cover

485
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
the dirty things behind it?

486
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You and Lin Qian

487
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
became orphans because of this fire.

488
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You need her to help you

489
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
find the clues about this fire.

490
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But you don't want to tell her

491
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
what you're really investigating.

492
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Lin Qian is Han Kuilong's woman after all.

493
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Her identity is very sensitive.

494
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I dare not.

495
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Investigations are always about the police.

496
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
There's no need to involve her.

497
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Speaking of investigation,

498
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
you know my boss, Hu Sir,

499
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
has a lot of opinions about you, right?

500
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
He doesn't have a problem with me.

501
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
He has a problem with my boss, Da Jia Ma.

502
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
After all, they're in the police team at the same time.

503
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Now my boss, Da Jia Ma, is the chief police officer.

504
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And your Hu Sir is still a chief inspector.

505
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Hu Sir doesn't like Da Sir

506
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
for not taking the forceful means

507
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
to clean up the dark police.

508
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's not that he doesn't have it.

509
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
He doesn't dare.

510
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The interests behind it

511
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
are so complicated.

512
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You rarely speak good words for him.

513
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'm not speaking good words for him.

514
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I just want to tell you

515
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
that in our era,

516
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
being a police officer is not something you can be so naive about.

517
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
But if you can't even trust your colleagues,

518
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
then being a police officer

519
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
is very sad, right?

520
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
No need to be sad.

521
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You can always trust me.

522
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm sorry.

523
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Sit.

524
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
There's no way

525
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I can't accompany you today.

526
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Luo Qiang has already, as you said,

527
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
lit the candle.

528
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
As long as he's in the right mind.

529
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
When Xiao Gao gets better,

530
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
you can take care of him for me.

531
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Xiao Lian is also very good.

532
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Last night, he came to eat with me.

533
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
The biggest problem with Xiao Lian

534
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
is that he's not smart enough.

535
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
He doesn't care about the overall situation.

536
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
If it were Xiao Gao,

537
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I wouldn't have to worry so much.

538
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
How is it?

539
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
How is Xiao Gao's progress?

540
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The doctor said he's very stable.

541
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But whether there's any progress

542
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
depends on his own will.

543
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
My son Han Kuilong

544
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
will definitely be able to stand up again.

545
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I'll go.

546
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I have a friend who knows me.

547
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
He's asking for a discount.

548
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
How much?

549
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I think 50% is too expensive.

550
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It's not bad.

551
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Here.

552
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm going to work.

553
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
What is it?

554
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
My brother's discount

555
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
is almost over.

556
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
That fast?

557
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It should be half an hour before it's over.

558
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Then come over in half an hour.

559
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Okay.

560
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I'll be right back.

561
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Sorry.

562
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It's okay.

563
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
My brother is like this now.

564
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Will it hurt?

565
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's okay.

566
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I'll be right back.

567
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'll be right back.

568
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I'll be right back.

569
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I'll be right back.

570
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Will it hurt?

571
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Don't worry.

572
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I have my brother's care.

573
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
As his brother,

574
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
this pain can be tolerated.

575
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Thank you.

576
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Let's go.

577
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Excuse me.

578
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Is Coach Yu here?

579
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
The one in pink is here.

580
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Thank you.

581
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Coach Yu, right?

582
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Yes.

583
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I'm Shen Ning. I'm Qin Yiwei's grandmother.

584
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
What can I do for you?

585
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I heard about you and Weiwei.

586
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Are you two dating?

587
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Who told you?

588
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Coach Yu.

589
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Weiwei is only 19 years old.

590
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Although the coach is very young,

591
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
you are his teacher.

592
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Teacher and student dating.

593
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
This kind of behavior

594
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
seems very inappropriate.

595
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Wait a minute.

596
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
How did you know about this?

597
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Weiwei's father

598
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
said you drank with him at school.

599
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
The committee warned you.

600
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
He said it?

601
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
He knew what happened.

602
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Why did he say that?

603
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
You mean...

604
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Qin Yiwei

605
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
told me

606
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
his mother committed suicide.

607
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I saw her in pain.

608
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I couldn't think of anything.

609
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I don't know if it's because of this.

610
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
He put his love for his mother

611
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
on me.

612
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
In fact,

613
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
we all know this behavior

614
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
because we feel lonely.

615
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
He wants to find a friend

616
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and I'm the one who can listen to him.

617
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Is it wrong?

618
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I'm sorry.

619
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm more direct.

620
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm sorry

621
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
for bothering you.

622
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Wait.

623
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
There's one more thing.

624
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
This necklace was given to me by Qin Yiwei.

625
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I've already refused it.

626
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
But he insisted on giving it to me.

627
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I've never been in a relationship with Qin Yiwei.

628
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Even if I'm a judge,

629
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I shouldn't be innocent

630
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
and accuse him of anything.

631
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
We've interviewed Huang Xiao,

632
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
the official's assistant.

633
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Please give him your opinion on the incident.

634
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I want to call on everyone

635
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
to calm down.

636
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I also want to advise the police

637
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
to do more investigation.

638
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
The victim of this shooting

639
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
is 18-year-old young man Ma Shanbao.

640
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
He's from a single-parent family in Jiucheng District.

641
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
His father is also from Jiucheng.

642
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
He died in a black-banded murder many years ago.

643
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
The police

644
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
haven't found the murderer yet.

645
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
The investigation will be expanded.

646
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So far,

647
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
there are no three victims.

648
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
The police keep coming.

649
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
There's evidence to accuse Ma Shanbao of embezzlement.

650
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
What evidence is it?

651
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
The police won't just reveal our case.

652
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Ma Shanbao has no evidence.

653
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You can't get any evidence.

654
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You're a lawyer from the defense.

655
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Do you think we'll just

656
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
reveal our identity to you?

657
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
If it's evidence,

658
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
you can't hide it. You have to reveal it.

659
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
If we really have to

660
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
open the interrogation,

661
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
we'll do it according to the procedure.

662
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I know.

663
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
It's because the police can't find any evidence

664
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
that Ma Shanbao became a scapegoat.

665
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So the police have to explain it to me.

666
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Ms. Zhou, calm down.

667
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
What you're saying is a life.

668
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
You're not calm,

669
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
you're evil.

670
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
We've used our best

671
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
to investigate the murderer of Ma Shanbao.

672
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Calm down.

673
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Madam.

674
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
The judge is here.

675
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
He wants to see you.

676
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Send him out.

677
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Yes, madam.

678
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Ms. Zhou, you don't have to come here every day.

679
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Why don't you go to the class?

680
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Don't worry.

681
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I'll definitely go.

682
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Mr. Shen.

683
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Do you still remember me?

684
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
When I first graduated from the police academy,

685
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
there were a few cases that you had to investigate.

686
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Mr. Shen asked me to come here.

687
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Two weeks ago, my car was stolen.

688
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
My son-in-law reported the case.

689
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Qin Yu.

690
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I believe you know him.

691
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
You were hurt because you saved him.

692
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
You were hurt because you saved him.

693
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
You were hurt because you saved him.

694
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
You were hurt because you saved him.

695
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I was a police officer.

696
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I was responsible for that.

697
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But the car was found a few hours later.

698
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
But the car was found a few hours later.

699
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
But the car was found a few hours later.

700
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.

701
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
The case is still under investigation.

702
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I can't reveal any details.

703
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
If you don't tell me,

704
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
the news will be exposed.

705
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
the news will be exposed.

706
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Mr. Shen, you want me to break the law?

707
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Mr. Shen, you want me to break the law?

708
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
You should know better than me

709
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You should know better than me

710
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I used to be a judge.

711
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I used to be a judge.

712
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I know some colleagues,

713
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I know some colleagues,

714
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
even some judges, have been threatened.

715
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
even some judges, have been threatened.

716
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Qin Yu is so honest and selfless.

717
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Qin Yu is so honest and selfless.

718
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Maybe when we were chatting,

719
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
he was threatened.

720
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
There was a tragedy in our family.

721
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
There was a tragedy in our family.

722
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I believe

723
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
you should know my daughter.

724
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Mr. Shen, I...

725
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I mean

726
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I don't know the reason.

727
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I don't know the reason.

728
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
My daughter is a pharmacist.

729
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
She doesn't know how to apply drugs.

730
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
She is healthy.

731
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Her husband and son care about her so much.

732
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
She doesn't know how to use the shortcut.

733
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
She didn't even leave her will.

734
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
There is no reason.

735
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I don't know anything.

736
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Qin Yu is my intern.

737
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Qin Yu is my intern.

738
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So they knew each other.

739
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
When Lan Lan got married,

740
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
it was her 20th birthday.

741
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And Qin Yu was already 30 years old.

742
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And Qin Yu was already 30 years old.

743
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I didn't agree with it.

744
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But until Wei Wei was born,

745
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I knew

746
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
this was the most precious gift

747
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
my daughter gave me.

748
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Mr. Shen,

749
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
was Qin Yu threatened

750
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
or threatened?

751
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Was there any connection with this case?

752
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Mr. Shen, you said

753
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
he is a judge.

754
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
These things happen often.

755
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You are a police officer.

756
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
You should investigate.

757
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
How do you know I didn't?

758
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Do you know my Wei Wei?

759
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I saw her last week.

760
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
After the car theft.

761
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Mr. Shen, this is not a court.

762
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
If you are in court,

763
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I can order you to answer me.

764
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But now,

765
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I am asking you.

766
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I am not a high-ranking judge.

767
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I am just

768
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
a mother who lost her daughter.

769
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
A grandmother

770
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
who wants to help her grandson.

771
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
You can help me.

772
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Master.

773
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Luo Wen.

774
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Come in.

775
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I am here.

776
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I am here.

777
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I am here.

778
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I am here.

779
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I am here.

780
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
The police found

781
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
a sprayer for a boat.

782
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
The DNA on the sprayer

783
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
is not compatible with other findings.

784
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
What is not compatible?

785
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I don't know. It doesn't say.

786
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
But the important thing is

787
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
the sprayer and other findings

788
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
are not compatible with Ma Shanbao's DNA.

789
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
This car theft has nothing to do with Ma Shanbao.

790
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Tang Xuan knew about this

791
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
and Zhang Jian too.

792
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
But they didn't say anything.

793
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
How did you get

794
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
this confidential file?

795
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I noticed that

796
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
this file was with Tang Xuan

797
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
and then with Zhang Jian.

798
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So I think

799
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
this file must be related to Ma Shanbao.

800
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Later, when I went out to call the police,

801
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I took a picture of it.

802
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Why do you seem not surprised at all?

803
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
No.

804
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I didn't react at once.

805
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
The police haven't searched the murderer yet.

806
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
They will not eliminate him.

807
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
The murderer of this shooting case

808
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
is a young man, Ma Shanbao,

809
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
18 years old.

810
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
He is from a single-parent family in Jiucheng.

811
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
His father is also from Jiucheng.

812
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
He died in a black gang murder many years ago.

813
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
The police haven't found the murderer yet.

814
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
They will not eliminate him.

815
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
They will not eliminate him.

816
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
But so far, there is no relevant person.

817
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I killed him.

818
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
First, the witness of the crime

819
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
was requested by Ma Shanbao.

820
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
The condition you are talking about is

821
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
that he provided the information

822
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
and the控方 agreed

823
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
to send him abroad.

824
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
But now Ma Shanbao is dead.

825
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And he was killed

826
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
during your request to stay home.

827
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
The police can say that

828
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
you have no responsibility in this regard.

829
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Is it really my fault?

830
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
No, no, no.

831
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
You have already fought for your

832
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
most powerful conditions for your client.

833
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
But sometimes you have to talk about luck.

834
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
If the timing is not right,

835
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
you will not be able to do anything right.

836
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
It's not your fault.

837
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Ma Shanbao

838
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Ma Shanbao

839
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
The blood that was used to burn the tomb

840
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
has been crushed into his nerves.

841
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
It has caused him to have problems

842
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
with hearing and speech.

843
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
But we will do our best

844
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
to help him recover as soon as possible.

845
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
The room is occupied.

846
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Don't show your face in the hall.

847
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It's a hospital.

848
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Why do you smoke here?

849
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
If you want to smoke, you should go out.

850
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Ah, go out.

851
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
What are you doing?

852
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Be aware.

853
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It's good for your health.

854
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Where is it?

855
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Here, here, here.

856
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,500
One, two, three.

857
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,500
One, two, three.

858
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,000
One, two, three.

859
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,500
One, two, three.

860
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,000
One, two, three.

861
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,500
One, two, three.

862
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,000
One, two, three.

863
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,000
One, two, three.

864
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,500
One, two, three.

865
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,000
One, two, three.

866
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,500
One, two, three.

867
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,500
One, two, three.

868
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,500
Doctor.

869
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,000
What happened?

870
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,000
Brother Jing.

871
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,500
Xiao Gang.

872
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,500
Xiao Gang.

873
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,500
What's wrong?

874
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,000
Xiao Gang is awake.

875
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,500
One, two, three.

876
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,500
One, two, three.

877
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,000
One, two, three.

878
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,000
One, two, three.

879
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,000
One, two, three.

880
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,000
One, two, three.

881
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,000
One, two, three.

882
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,000
One, two, three.

883
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,000
One, two, three.

884
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,000
One, two, three.

885
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,000
One, two, three.

886
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,000
One, two, three.

887
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,000
One, two, three.

888
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,000
One, two, three.

889
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,000
One, two, three.

890
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,000
One, two, three.

891
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,000
One, two, three.

892
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,000
One, two, three.

893
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,000
One, two, three.

894
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,000
One, two, three.

895
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,000
One, two, three.

896
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,000
One, two, three.

897
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,000
One, two, three.

898
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,000
One, two, three.

899
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,000
One, two, three.

900
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,000
One, two, three.

901
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,000
One, two, three.

902
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,000
One, two, three.

903
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,000
One, two, three.

904
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,000
Do you like her?

905
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,000
Do you like her?

906
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,500
Why do you think I like you?

907
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,500
I like her most.

908
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,500
All my concerns and my feelings

909
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,500
are won't bedigged out.

910
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
What are they?

911
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,500
My appearance shows no end

912
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,200
to the power of love,

913
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,500
so I went to the police,

914
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,300
and police...
