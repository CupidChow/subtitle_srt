00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
Hu Gavin

2
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,740
Just before the poisons group

3
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,260
they found that someone was using the house Kwuk pesleep

4
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,780
In June 2nd, this year

5
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,780
According to the address on the email,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,260
in the defendant's house,

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,060
there was a bag with about a kilogram of cocaine.

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,500
So the suspect, Wang Yue, was arrested on the spot.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,980
That is, the defendant on the court.

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:47,180
The prosecution decided to sue the defendant for drug trafficking and drug trafficking.

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,500
Did you find the drugs in the defendant's house?

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,900
Yes, Your Honor.

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,260
The prosecution's report is very clear.

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,780
Defendant,

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,300
do you admit your crime?

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,820
Your Honor,

17
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,140
I admit my crime on behalf of my client.

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,060
No way! My son is very honest.

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,060
He won't touch drugs.

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,900
Your Honor,

21
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,660
my client committed a crime because he was greedy.

22
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,620
But since he was the first criminal and had a light-duty license,

23
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,820
he did this stupid thing.

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,020
I hope the court can forgive him.

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,220
Defendant,

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,300
are you sure you admit your crime?

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,220
Your Honor,

28
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,540
the defendant has signed the letter of confession.

29
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,900
Then I can't hear the defendant

30
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,820
answer this question in person?

31
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,340
Defendant,

32
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,340
do you know how much a kilogram of cocaine is worth?

33
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,540
Three... three thousand...

34
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,500
In terms of the price,

35
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,500
a kilogram of cocaine is worth eight hundred thousand.

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,740
Your Honor,

37
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,060
as I said,

38
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,980
the defendant has signed the letter of confession.

39
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,180
I want to ask the witness to answer a question.

40
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,660
Officer Huo Zhao,

41
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,460
did you find the drugs in the court

42
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,660
from the defendant's house?

43
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,620
Your Honor, that's right.

44
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,060
All the drugs were found from the defendant's house.

45
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,620
If these drugs

46
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,220
were found from the defendant's house,

47
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,060
why are these drugs

48
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,380
covered with mud and weeds?

49
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,180
Defendant,

50
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,980
I want to ask you some questions.

51
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,180
Answer me after you think it through.

52
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,980
Did you sign the package that day?

53
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,460
Did your address

54
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,980
get used by someone else?

55
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,700
When the police arrested you,

56
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,460
were you at your own home

57
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,260
or outside?

58
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,420
They told me...

59
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,660
It doesn't matter what they told you.

60
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,020
In court,

61
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,220
I only need to hear the truth.

62
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,020
Only the truth

63
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,420
can help you.

64
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,820
Yes, the truth.

65
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,940
I didn't accept it.

66
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,180
My cousin often sent some packages

67
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,860
to my house.

68
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,180
I was about to go to work.

69
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,780
They...

70
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,020
They came in and caught me.

71
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,140
I was at home.

72
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,900
Defendant, let me ask you again.

73
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,780
Are you sure you admitted your crime?

74
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,980
I didn't commit the crime.

75
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,220
I didn't commit the crime.

76
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,380
I didn't commit the crime.

77
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,340
I didn't commit the crime.

78
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,740
I didn't commit the crime.

79
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,180
I didn't commit the crime.

80
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,740
The case of the police

81
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,740
is still under investigation.

82
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,740
The police are still investigating.

83
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,740
The police are still investigating.

84
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,740
The police are still investigating.

85
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,740
The police are still investigating.

86
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,740
The police are still investigating.

87
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,740
The police are still investigating.

88
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,740
The police are still investigating.

89
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,740
The police are still investigating.

90
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,740
The police are still investigating.

91
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,740
The police are still investigating.

92
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,740
The police are still investigating.

93
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,740
The police are still investigating.

94
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,740
The police are still investigating.

95
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,740
The police are still investigating.

96
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,740
The police are still investigating.

97
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,740
The police are still investigating.

98
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,740
The police are still investigating.

99
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,740
The police are still investigating.

100
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,740
The police are still investigating.

101
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,740
The police are still investigating.

102
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,740
The police are still investigating.

103
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,740
The police are still investigating.

104
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,740
The police are still investigating.

105
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,740
The police are still investigating.

106
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,740
The police are still investigating.

107
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,740
The police are still investigating.

108
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,740
The Police

109
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,740
Episode 2

110
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,740
I believe

111
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,740
there are three major doubts in this case.

112
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,740
First,

113
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,740
the package was not personally

114
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,740
taken by the defendant.

115
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,740
Second,

116
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,740
the drugs were not found

117
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,740
in the defendant's house.

118
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,740
Otherwise, there would not be

119
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,740
so much weeds and mud on the package.

120
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,740
Third,

121
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,740
the defendant

122
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,740
did not know the value of the drugs.

123
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,740
And his bank account

124
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,740
did not find the money.

125
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,740
As for why the defendant

126
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,740
admitted some things he did not do,

127
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,740
as for why the defendant admitted some things he did not do,

128
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,740
it is obvious that

129
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,740
his intelligence and his education

130
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,740
are all under the control of the public.

131
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,740
But his most valuable

132
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,740
is honesty.

133
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,740
Your Honor,

134
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,740
I also filed a complaint

135
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,740
based on the evidence of the police

136
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,740
and the confession of the crime.

137
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,740
Your Honor,

138
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,740
when I first received this case,

139
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,740
I was just helping the defendant

140
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,740
to plead guilty and plead for mercy.

141
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,740
The content of the case

142
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,740
is not consistent with the facts.

143
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,740
And the reasonable doubts

144
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,740
and interests are also related to the defendant.

145
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,740
I hereby declare

146
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,740
that the defendant, Wang Yue, is not guilty.

147
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,740
The court is now in the court.

148
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,740
Thank you, thank you.

149
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,740
It's okay.

150
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,740
It's okay, it's okay.

151
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,740
It's okay, it's okay, son.

152
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,740
It's okay, it's okay.

153
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,740
Thank you, Your Honor.

154
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,740
Officer Huang.

155
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,740
What is it, Your Honor?

156
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,740
How long have you been a police?

157
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,740
Thirteen years.

158
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,740
I want you to go back and think about

159
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,740
what you did when you wore the uniform

160
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,740
and graduated that day.

161
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,740
Don't forget everything

162
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,740
because of time.

163
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,740
Officer Huang.

164
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,740
Yes.

165
00:07:49,740 --> 00:08:05,740
Xiaobai Ccwhd

166
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,740
I'm sorry.

167
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,740
How did you sign the confession?

168
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,740
What do you think?

169
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,740
It's not necessary.

170
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,740
It must be...

171
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,740
Remember your identity as a lawyer.

172
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,740
You must give evidence.

173
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
I'm sorry, Judge Qin.

174
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,740
You can't go back to your office for now.

175
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,740
What happened?

176
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,740
I found suspicious items in your office.

177
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,740
I suspect it's a bomb.

178
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,740
The bomb-dealing expert is handling it.

179
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,740
Thank you for your hard work.

180
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,740
You're not surprised at all.

181
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,740
I'm in the position of judge.

182
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,740
I've been waiting for so many people to go to jail.

183
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,740
I can't count how many people want me to die.

184
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,740
Madam, it's fake.

185
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,740
The one who dared to intimidate you

186
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,740
seems to be the only one.

187
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,740
And it's not the first time.

188
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,740
The serious businessman Han Kuilong

189
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,740
who is being followed by society

190
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,740
is about to be interrogated

191
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,740
for the murder case.

192
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,740
Han Kuilong is the founder of Han Group.

193
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,740
Twenty years ago,

194
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,740
he participated in the reconstruction of the Huyan Wooden Pond.

195
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Then he started a business

196
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,740
in the area of ​​management of real estate and gambling.

197
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,740
There was a rumor that

198
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,740
Han Kuilong was behind the scenes

199
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,740
of the murder of Han Kuilong.

200
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,740
He was involved in illegal interests

201
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,740
behind the legal gambling business

202
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
and participated in crimes

203
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,740
such as high-end,

204
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,740
illegal protection fees

205
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740
and drug trafficking.

206
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,740
Han Kuilong is suspected of

207
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,740
planning a large number of serious cases

208
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,740
of attacking government officials.

209
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,740
But in the end,

210
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,740
he was acquitted for various reasons.

211
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,740
Today,

212
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,740
he was prosecuted for

213
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,740
committing criminal crimes again.

214
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
The case was judged by

215
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,740
the judge, Qin Yu,

216
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,740
who claimed to be fair and impartial.

217
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,740
On the second day of Han Kuilong's arrest,

218
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,740
the external inspection officer

219
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,740
who was originally in charge of the case

220
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
was arrested.

221
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
The external inspection officer

222
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,740
who was originally in charge of the case

223
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,740
and his wife were attacked and injured by the killer.

224
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,740
So, since the judge Qin

225
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,740
began to investigate the case of Han Kuilong,

226
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,740
he has been under the strict protection of the police

227
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,740
until today's court hearing.

228
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,740
Kill him!

229
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,740
Kill him!

230
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
Report to the command center.

231
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,740
Qin Yu, get off the car safely at the side door.

232
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,740
Can Han Kuilong be charged

233
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,740
with the crime?

234
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,740
Can the law and order of Haokang

235
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,740
be defended?

236
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,740
We are looking forward to it.

237
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,740
Han Kuilong,

238
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,740
a serious businessman

239
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,740
and a criminal are being prosecuted

240
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,740
for attempted murder.

241
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,740
The prosecution is now in action.

242
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,740
Court is now in action.

243
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,740
Although there is no solid evidence,

244
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,740
I suspect that Han Kuilong did it.

245
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,740
Master Wei, think about it.

246
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,740
You have been in the dark for 12 years.

247
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,740
You are old.

248
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,740
He will definitely take revenge on you.

249
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,740
Don't mention Han Kuilong first.

250
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,740
He is clearly black and white.

251
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,740
You can see it at a glance.

252
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,740
There are some people

253
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,740
that you can't see at all.

254
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,740
You don't know if they are people or ghosts.

255
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,740
Either you are in the same boat with them,

256
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,740
or you are being used by them.

257
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,740
These are all things that you can't learn in class.

258
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,740
You still have time to regret it now.

259
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,740
Why should I regret it?

260
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,740
Is it the lawyer's duty to achieve social justice?

261
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,740
Drive carefully.

262
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
Yes.

263
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,740
Okay, thank you.

264
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,740
By the way, master,

265
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,740
I found out who competed with you

266
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,740
for the position of the court president.

267
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,740
Whatever.

268
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,740
Who cares?

269
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,740
It's that judge Lu.

270
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,740
But he is really cunning.

271
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Once I went to the hearing,

272
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,740
and saw him using the wrong judicial procedures,

273
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,740
I was forced to report it to the court.

274
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,740
I was so angry.

275
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,740
I was so angry.

276
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,740
I was so angry.

277
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,740
I was so angry.

278
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,740
I was so angry.

279
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,740
You were the first to go to the procuratorate,

280
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,740
and you even removed the charge against the defendant.

281
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,740
Actually, I was in the election

282
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,740
because I didn't want to compromise the culture,

283
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,740
and it affected the spirit of the law.

284
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,740
The position of the court president

285
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,740
has higher standards for quality.

286
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,740
I believe that no one can compare to

287
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,740
our most just and selfless judge Qin Yu.

288
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,740
Drive carefully.

289
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,740
Bye, master.

290
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,740
Bye.

291
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,740
I'm sorry.

292
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,740
Honey.

293
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,740
I found it.

294
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,740
I found it.

295
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,740
Yi Wei.

296
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,740
Didn't you say that there is a basketball game today?

297
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,740
Are you going to be a team?

298
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,740
I don't want to go.

299
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,740
Are you hungry?

300
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,740
I'm not hungry.

301
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
You're an adult.

302
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,740
Your clothes are all over the place.

303
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,740
Why is there blood on the sole?

304
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,740
Your hand is injured.

305
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,740
Where is it injured?

306
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,740
It's not my shoe.

307
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,740
Whose is that?

308
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,740
It's not my shoe.

309
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,740
Tell me.

310
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
What happened?

311
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,740
I want to see my mother.

312
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,740
So I drove your car out

313
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,740
when I saw you didn't drive to work in the morning.

314
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,740
You just took the driver's license.

315
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,740
You drove out.

316
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
Didn't we agree

317
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,740
that I would get familiar with you first?

318
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,740
Why did you...

319
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,740
Hey.

320
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,740
You hit someone.

321
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,740
The blood is from the injured.

322
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,740
I didn't see that motorcycle.

323
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,740
I was on the left-hand side of the slow car.

324
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,740
I paid attention to the right-hand side.

325
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,740
I didn't expect that motorcycle

326
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,740
to overtake the car on the left.

327
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,740
What happened when you hit the motorcycle?

328
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,740
I ran to see how it was.

329
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,740
What happened after that?

330
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,740
I was scared.

331
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,740
I was scared and I was scared.

332
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,740
I asked you how the injured was.

333
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,740
I don't know.

334
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,740
He stood up.

335
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,740
I don't know.

336
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,740
Did he die?

337
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,740
He could still move.

338
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,740
I don't know what happened after that.

339
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,740
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,740
It was an accident.

341
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,740
You hit the motorcycle while driving.

342
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,740
You didn't care about him

343
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,740
and threw him on the street.

344
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,740
You ran away.

345
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,740
You're and old man are like people.

346
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,740
Be patient.

347
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,740
I understand.

348
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,740
according to what you said,

349
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,740
you can be steely when impressed,

350
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,740
but you are ungrateful when tributes are served.

351
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,740
But in this life,

352
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,740
we bow down to death

353
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,740
and cry out farmers' Heaven.

354
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,740
How I'm afraid

355
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,740
of treated to flowers

356
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,580
I'm sorry.

357
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,180
Okay.

358
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,540
Listen to me.

359
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,980
If you turn yourself in now,

360
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,300
you're an intern.

361
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,340
You have a school boat.

362
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,340
Plus, what happened to your family...

363
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,780
You mean, mom's death?

364
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,700
That's a good reason.

365
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,140
Besides, you don't have a criminal record.

366
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,860
The judge may judge you.

367
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,020
If the police come to arrest you,

368
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,420
you won't even have a chance.

369
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,700
Am I going to jail?

370
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,740
It depends on whether you're alive or dead.

371
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,380
Don't ask me about this.

372
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,140
Just ask.

373
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,220
The judge is great.

374
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,060
Can he kill someone?

375
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,580
Now you're running away from the truth.

376
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,060
Let's turn ourselves in.

377
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,020
Okay.

378
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,700
Remember.

379
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,660
Don't talk too much.

380
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,380
But you have to tell the truth.

381
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,260
If they don't ask,

382
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,660
don't tell them.

383
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,620
Just tell them.

384
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,820
You were driving.

385
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,060
Suddenly, the boat started to move.

386
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,700
You were scared and nervous.

387
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,260
You couldn't breathe.

388
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,420
That's why you had this car accident.

389
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,140
I'll figure out the rest.

390
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,420
How long do I have to drive?

391
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,580
Don't say that for now, okay?

392
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,780
Don't be afraid, son.

393
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,020
Although you're wrong in the law,

394
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,740
you're allowed to go.

395
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,980
I'll go in and tell them.

396
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,660
Wait for me in the car.

397
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,700
Calm down.

398
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,580
Don't be afraid.

399
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,900
Judge Qi, you're here for Tang Du?

400
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,380
Yes.

401
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,020
He's on the second floor.

402
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,860
Wait a minute.

403
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,460
What's up?

404
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,860
The motor vehicle that was stolen at noon

405
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,380
has been identified as

406
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,220
Han Kuilong's eldest son, Han Gang.

407
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,060
He was forced to go to the hospital at noon.

408
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,140
I don't know if he can be rescued.

409
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,300
Close the news immediately.

410
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,140
Don't let the media know that the victim is Han Gang.

411
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,340
It won't be long.

412
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,100
And,

413
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,340
find someone to keep an eye on Han Kuilong.

414
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,180
Someone will report to him soon.

415
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,980
Yes, madam.

416
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,140
Hello?

417
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,300
Hello, you.

418
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,140
Drive away from the police station immediately.

419
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,180
Wait for me in the neighborhood.

420
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,380
Try not to be found.

421
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,860
Judge Qi.

422
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,300
Are you looking for me?

423
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,660
I'll call you later.

424
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,420
I...

425
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,180
It's Yiwei.

426
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,060
I was going to pick her up.

427
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,940
But when I came out of the house,

428
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,700
I found that

429
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,300
my car was missing.

430
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,020
Your car was missing?

431
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,940
It was stolen?

432
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,260
If you're busy,

433
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,180
it's not a big deal.

434
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,900
I'll call you tomorrow.

435
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,020
Something did happen.

436
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,900
But we're handling it.

437
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,460
But you...

438
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,460
A judge was stolen.

439
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,820
Did something happen?

440
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,380
I think it's just a normal theft case.

441
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,860
It's not that complicated.

442
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,500
As long as it's your ex-judge's case,

443
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,620
I'll take care of it myself,

444
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,740
no matter how big it is.

445
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,300
Go to my office.

446
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,580
Come on.

447
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,260
You can't park here.

448
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,900
It's the police station.

449
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,860
I just got the license.

450
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,060
Give me some time.

451
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,180
Sorry.

452
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,060
Why didn't you put on the internship badge?

453
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,460
You drove it yourself?

454
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,180
I'm sorry.

455
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,380
My dad drove it.

456
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,180
He's inside.

457
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,580
What happened today

458
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,500
that you found the car stolen?

459
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,900
I left the door at around 10 a.m.

460
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,500
and the car was still there.

461
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,900
But when I came back in the afternoon,

462
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,900
the car was gone.

463
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,980
Why didn't you drive to work today?

464
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,340
Because I found the car stolen.

465
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,020
So I didn't drive it.

466
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,500
Zhou Luo Wen sent me back

467
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,140
when I came back.

468
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,940
Zhou Luo Wen sent me back

469
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,940
when I came back.

470
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,540
The one who was with me

471
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,540
in the court today.

472
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,940
It was him.

473
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,940
Zhou Luo Wen sent me back

474
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,940
when I came back.

475
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,940
It was him.

476
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,660
He suspected of a bomb.

477
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,180
I was so confused

478
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,460
because of a few big cases today.

479
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,540
Really?

480
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,180
What's going on?

481
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,860
Don't wait for me.

482
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,460
Get off first. I'll help you move the car.

483
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,420
Remember to tell your dad

484
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,300
to put on the internship badge.

485
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,620
Otherwise, you can't drive alone.

486
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,300
Understand?

487
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,900
Yes.

488
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,300
There was an accident.

489
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,340
Zhao Shi ran away.

490
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,900
He didn't care about the accident and left.

491
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,180
Is it serious?

492
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,900
The one who got hurt by the car

493
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,820
was Han Kuilong's son, Han Gang.

494
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,860
Han Kuilong's son, Han Gang.

495
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,060
Since Han Kuilong got into jail,

496
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,420
the Qi Chang Rong of the Old City Gang

497
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,460
has been doing everything they can.

498
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,180
But he didn't realize

499
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,340
Han Kuilong's son, Han Gang, is even more ruthless than Han Kuilong.

500
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,620
So he didn't get any benefits.

501
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,220
This time, Han Gang is the one who got hit.

502
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,020
Whoever has the most motivation behind it,

503
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,020
everyone can see it.

504
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,980
If the two gangs really start a private killing,

505
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,980
I don't know how many people will die.

506
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,980
That injured person is in a serious condition now.

507
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,340
Judge Qin,

508
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,100
maybe this case will be handed over to you in the morning.

509
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,700
You'll know in the future.

510
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,100
Okay.

511
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,620
Han Kuilong

512
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,700
Didn't I tell you to leave the police station? Why are you still here?

513
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,060
The engine suddenly went off just now.

514
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,660
Then the police said I was blocking the car in front,

515
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,420
but the engine didn't react, so he stopped my car here.

516
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,400
And he said I didn't put on the

517
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
mark and then I stole the license plate.

518
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Who?

519
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
The person who passed by you just now.

520
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Zhou San, help me look at my car.

521
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
It's a bit abnormal.

522
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,380
Do you know what happened yesterday?

523
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,380
Do you remember?

524
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,380
I want to see it.

525
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,380
OK.

526
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,380
I'll open the door and check it.

527
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,380
Turn around.

528
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
OK.

529
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Aren't we going to turn ourselves in?

530
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
It's no use turning yourself in now.

531
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,400
The person who was hurt by you is Han Kuilong's eldest son, Han Gang.

532
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,400
Serious injury and attempted murder.

533
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
I've been betraying Han Kuilong for twelve years.

534
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,400
If he knows you hurt his son,

535
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,400
don't think about getting out after you go in.

536
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Or you'll torture me.

537
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,400
Brother Long.

538
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
What's up?

539
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
I have bad news.

540
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Tell me.

541
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,400
Your eldest son Han Gang was hit by a car and is being rescued in the hospital.

542
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Is he alive or dead?

543
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
The situation is critical.

544
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,400
We've found the best doctor.

545
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
I'm asking you, is he alive or dead?

546
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
We'll know after the surgery.

547
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Who did it?

548
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
We don't know for now.

549
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
The murderer ran away.

550
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
I want to see my son.

551
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Brother Long, I'm afraid it's a bit difficult.

552
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
You know you have to go.

553
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
I must see my son.

554
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
I must see my son.

555
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
He's alive or dead.

556
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
You can't be the master, can you?

557
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
You can't be the master.

558
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Go.

559
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,400
It's about ten o'clock this morning.

560
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
You usually go to school at eight o'clock.

561
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,400
But you suddenly found that you had a fever.

562
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,400
So you got off at the park station.

563
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
You didn't get any better after a break.

564
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,400
So you didn't go to school.

565
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
You went home.

566
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,400
When you got home, it was about twelve o'clock.

567
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,400
You found that the car was gone.

568
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,400
You thought I drove away, so you didn't care.

569
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,400
Actually, it's because the car didn't do the annual inspection.

570
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
I called the court's car to pick me up.

571
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Until I came back in the afternoon.

572
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,400
I found the car was gone.

573
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
I found it.

574
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Remember every word I said.

575
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
You must do it.

576
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Don't contact anyone after I go out.

577
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Do you understand?

578
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
The car is gone.

579
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
I'll go to the park.

580
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
I'll go to the park.

581
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
I'll go to the park.

582
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
I'll go to the park.

583
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,400
I'll go to the park.

584
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
I'll go to the park.

585
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
I'll go to the park.

586
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
I'll go to the park.

587
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
I'll go to the park.

588
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,400
I'll go to the park.

589
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
I'll go to the park.

590
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
I'll go to the park.

591
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
I'll go to the park.

592
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
I'll go to the park.

593
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
I'll go to the park.

594
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
I'll go to the park.

595
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
I'll go to the park.

596
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
I'll go to the park.

597
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
I'll go to the park.

598
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
I'll go to the park.

599
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
I'll go to the park.

600
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
I'll go to the park.

601
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
I'll go to the park.

602
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
I'll go to the park.

603
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
I'll go to the park.

604
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
I'll go to the park.

605
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
I'll go to the park.

606
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
I'll go to the park.

607
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,400
I'll go to the park.

608
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
I'll go to the park.

609
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
I'll go to the park.

610
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
I'll go to the park.

611
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
I'll go to the park.

612
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
I'll go to the park.

613
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
I'll go to the park.

614
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
I'll go to the park.

615
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
I'll go to the park.

616
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
I'll go to the park.

617
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
I'll go to the park.

618
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
I'll go to the park.

619
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
I'll go to the park.

620
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
I'll go to the park.

621
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
I'll go to the park.

622
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
I'll go to the park.

623
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
I'll go to the park.

624
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
I'll go to the park.

625
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
I'll go to the park.

626
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
I'll go to the park.

627
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
I'll go to the park.

628
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
I'll go to the park.

629
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,400
You're here to relax.

630
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
servants

631
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
Who is it?

632
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
I'll tell you.

633
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,000
Yes.

634
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,840
I didn't expect it was you.

635
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,080
Here's the thing.

636
00:31:49,800 --> 00:32:05,500
I sold a batch of silk

637
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,000
and I need you to help me get rid of it as soon as possible.

638
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,280
Get rid of it as soon as possible?

639
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,400
I understand.

640
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,360
Ever since we sentenced Han Guilong,

641
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,360
we've always been in trouble.

642
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,480
Whose car is it?

643
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,760
Because I can't show up for some things,

644
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,440
so I'm looking for your help.

645
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,400
Is that okay?

646
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,080
Okay.

647
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,840
I'll get you out of here.

648
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,400
Okay.

649
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,320
Hello.

650
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,200
Judge Qin wants to talk to me.

651
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:44,960
It's okay.

652
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,560
Come in.

653
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,960
Qi Changrong's people are everywhere.

654
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,200
They love to act.

655
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,760
Have you eaten?

656
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,880
Tell A'bao to come to me.

657
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,520
I need to ask him for help.

658
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,400
Wei often says

659
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,360
that he has a classmate who is a judge.

660
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,560
Back then,

661
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,600
he was framed by someone in the police force.

662
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,320
Luckily, Judge Qin helped him

663
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,200
to uphold justice

664
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,760
and clear his name.

665
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,520
So I'm really

666
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,400
grateful that you saved him.

667
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,400
Actually, the case back then

668
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,520
was because of lack of evidence.

669
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,280
I've said it before.

670
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,280
He didn't help me because we were classmates.

671
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,920
He just didn't want to

672
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,520
ruin the reputation of Judge Qin

673
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,000
for never betraying.

674
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,240
No one talks like that.

675
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,200
Although Wei was still

676
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,600
suspended by the police,

677
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,480
there were two black and white people outside

678
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,240
who were against him.

679
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,480
It's hard to say.

680
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,480
Anyway,

681
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,880
I'm grateful that our family

682
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,240
can be together.

683
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,800
It's not easy to be together

684
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,000
but it's very important.

685
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,360
Mom, I'm going to sleep.

686
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,640
Okay, okay.

687
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,600
Let's sleep.

688
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,160
Okay.

689
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,440
Take your time.

690
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,320
Come on.

691
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,480
Okay.

692
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,640
I'm going to sleep.

693
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,280
Go to bed early.

694
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,560
A'bao, you're here.

695
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:27,880
Take the key.

696
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,680
Okay.

697
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:34,960
Okay.

698
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,080
Uncle.

699
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,760
Did your mom scold you?

700
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,880
Is the money enough recently?

701
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,520
My second and third are paying tuition fees.

702
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,120
I have to buy milk powder.

703
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,160
The money is never enough.

704
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,680
Take it.

705
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:04,920
No need.

706
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,000
I can make money myself.

707
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,840
I've reminded you many times.

708
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,760
Don't follow Qi Changrong's men.

709
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,000
It doesn't matter who I follow.

710
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,080
I can make money.

711
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,240
One mistake can ruin your life.

712
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,040
If you want to make money, come to me.

713
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,680
At least I will take care of you.

714
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:22,800
What?

715
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,160
Help me take the car apart.

716
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,200
Just take it as making money.

717
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,240
That's it?

718
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,600
It's too simple.

719
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,800
Where's the car key?

720
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,600
If you want to take the car apart,

721
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,400
you don't want to cause trouble.

722
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,440
You don't want to let people know.

723
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,320
Okay.

724
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,120
I beg you.

725
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,440
Is it okay?

726
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,080
Yes.

727
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,960
Can you do it?

728
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,400
Start it.

729
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,920
You've been busy all day.

730
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,800
Eat something first.

731
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,960
Did father know?

732
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,520
Luo Qiang went to inform Long.

733
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,440
Eat something if you can't.

734
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,640
Father is in prison.

735
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,960
His brother is in charge of the family's business.

736
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,800
This happened.

737
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,960
Father must be in a headache.

738
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,960
If I were the one who was in trouble,

739
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,360
it would be easier.

740
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,160
What nonsense are you talking about?

741
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,120
You two are both Long's sons.

742
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,760
He wouldn't want anyone to be in trouble.

743
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,480
Doctor Ling.

744
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,760
Captain.

745
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,360
How's Jiang Shao?

746
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,000
He's under surgery.

747
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,800
But the situation is not optimistic.

748
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,200
What did my father say?

749
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,240
What did my father say?

750
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,280
Long said

751
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,040
he would find the guy

752
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,880
even if he had to turn the whole thing upside down.

753
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,160
So far,

754
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,800
the victim's identity has not been confirmed.

755
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,360
The police also refused to reveal more related information.

756
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,320
It only shows that the case is still under investigation.

757
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
If there's any latest news,

758
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,240
the evening news will continue to report.

759
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:01,920
Yi Wei.

760
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:04,760
Father.

761
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,920
I'll wait for you to come back.

762
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:08,920
Don't worry.

763
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,480
I've taken care of it.

764
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,440
Father.

765
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,680
I don't want to get you into trouble.

766
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,240
I... I'll take the consequences.

767
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,120
Go to sleep.

768
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,320
You'll be fine when you wake up tomorrow.

769
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,480
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

770
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,280
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

771
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,680
Please try again later.

772
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,120
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

773
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,120
This is it.

774
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,440
Excuse me.

775
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,640
Who are you?

776
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,600
Who are you?

777
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,520
I'm Yi Wei.

778
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,280
No one, even bo bastard

779
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,120
or broke into the house.

780
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,120
What are you doing?

781
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
What are you doing?

782
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,120
Hurry up!

783
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,120
What are you doing?

784
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,120
What are you doing?

785
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,120
What are you doing?

786
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,120
Wait.

787
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,120
Hello?

788
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,120
Good morning, Officer Qin.

789
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,120
Did I interrupt you?

790
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,120
It's okay. Please tell me.

791
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,120
Your time train has arrived.

792
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,120
Why is it the cause?

793
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,120
Just like the burning of the fire,

794
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,120
each one is possible.

795
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,120
Light

796
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,120
is like a force to chase.

797
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,120
Heart

798
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,120
is the heart of the heart.

799
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,120
The fire is burning,

800
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,120
the body is burning.

801
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,120
Why is it the cause?

802
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,120
Just like the burning of the fire,

803
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,120
each one is possible.

804
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,120
Light

805
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,120
is like the burning of the fire,

806
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,120
each one is possible.

807
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,120
The right and wrong at COPY

808
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,120
are doing in Willy value.

809
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,120
The flame in the eyes

810
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,220
is lighting up the Horizon of戰

811
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,220
and唤

812
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:21,760
robbing everyone's

813
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,160
heart.

814
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,100
only two lines request

815
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:24,120
you,

816
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,120
who who rob without justice

817
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,120
I regret that I was so ignorant

818
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,120
I asked myself, but I didn't answer

819
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,120
I look at the ordinary people

820
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,120
But I am rational

821
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,120
I push my feet to the side and stand on the edge of the cliff

822
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,120
Why can't I look back?

823
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,120
I can't kill the road back

824
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,120
I think you are more cruel

825
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:54,120
I have a good life on the road

826
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,120
But I look at the heart in the hole

827
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,120
I look at the ordinary people

828
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,120
But I am rational

829
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,120
I look at the ordinary people

830
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,120
But I am rational

831
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,120
I push my feet to the side and stand on the edge of the cliff

832
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,120
Why can't I look back?

833
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,120
I can't kill the road back

834
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,120
I think you are more cruel

835
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:25,120
I have a good life on the road

836
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:30,120
But I look at the heart in the hole
