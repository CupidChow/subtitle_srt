Episode 11

2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,220
I find something.

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,480
Madam, I found this bike on therie.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
YoYo English Channel YouTube

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,680
Yes.

6
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,080
Master.

7
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,960
This is my first time here.

8
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,640
This way?

9
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,800
I didn't expect you to come at this time.

10
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
I won't bother you.

11
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,560
No?

12
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,360
Sit wherever you want.

13
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,640
It's spacious here.

14
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,600
I asked you about it when I moved here.

15
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,800
You said this area is good.

16
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,440
I guess you've forgotten it.

17
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,000
I just passed by here

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,840
and came to see you.

19
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
I promised to help you.

20
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,040
How's the car theft case going?

21
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,160
Ma Shanbao's case?

22
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,000
My client's name is Ma Shanbao.

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,680
By the way,

24
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,640
who is Cao Wei'er?

25
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,440
How are you related to him?

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,440
He used to be a police officer.

27
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,880
So we cooperated.

28
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,040
I don't know if it's because of him.

29
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,480
I always feel that Ma Shanbao is not cooperating.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,880
He said he would hire a lawyer.

31
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,920
Why didn't he cooperate?

32
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,400
Maybe I'm too sensitive.

33
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,640
Did Ma Shanbao

34
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,000
tell you anything?

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,080
I told him that I'm his lawyer.

36
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,480
I'm here to help him.

37
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,080
But he refused to say anything.

38
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,200
Did he tell the police

39
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,520
anything?

40
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,920
The same as the police.

41
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,080
He refused to say anything.

42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,560
Maybe it's because he's from the old city.

43
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,560
People there don't like police.

44
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,720
It's common.

45
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,960
Who is his legal advisor?

46
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,920
The one who competed with you.

47
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,520
Lu Wei De?

48
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,040
Yes.

49
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,080
Luo Wen.

50
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,960
Actually, I haven't told you yet.

51
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,280
The police have officially informed me.

52
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,760
The car I was stolen

53
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,240
is the one Ma Shanbao stole.

54
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,040
It's yours?

55
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,800
You helped the suspect steal your car and find a lawyer.

56
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,960
Why did you do that?

57
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,680
Sorry.

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,960
I can only say this much.

59
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,440
You have to explain it to me later.

60
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,960
I only found out later

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,480
that the suspect was his nephew.

62
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,160
But I already called the police at that moment.

63
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,920
And I wanted to help that young man.

64
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,760
So I had to find you.

65
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,640
Luo Wen.

66
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,480
We have the same goal.

67
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,960
We all want to help that young man.

68
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,240
Ma Shanbao is really cruel.

69
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
I won't give up.

70
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,120
Okay.

71
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,720
I'll go to the police station.

72
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,360
Okay.

73
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,920
You're here.

74
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,440
Why don't you go in?

75
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,760
Weiwei didn't go to school today.

76
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,560
Do you know that?

77
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,320
She's grown up.

78
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Let her arrange her time.

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,920
I think she has a problem with her mood.

80
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,160
I want to teach her psychology.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,560
She just didn't go to school for a day.

82
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,480
It doesn't have to be so serious.

83
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,520
You just don't care about her.

84
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,040
You don't know what she needs.

85
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,640
I come back every night.

86
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,360
I have no problem communicating with her.

87
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
If there's anything I need,

88
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,200
she can tell me anytime.

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,120
That's your attitude.

90
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,640
You think it's okay if they don't tell you.

91
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,680
Lanlan is like this.

92
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,160
Weiwei is like this.

93
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,600
Is it because she's in trouble

94
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,920
and she's so confused

95
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
that she's in trouble?

96
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,560
Don't forget.

97
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,880
You haven't given me an answer

98
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,400
about Lanlan's death.

99
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,680
What answer do I have for you?

100
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,600
What answer do you want?

101
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,920
She's your daughter.

102
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,400
She's my wife.

103
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,480
I want to know more than you do

104
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,040
what happened.

105
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,720
Nine months.

106
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,480
I slowly accepted it.

107
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,560
I have no answer.

108
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,240
Whether you accept it or not.

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,520
Come on.

110
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,960
You bastard.

111
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,760
How are you?

112
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,560
I think I can take a picture for you.

113
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,560
The police found three guns and 300 bullets

114
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,560
when they were searching the defendant's house.

115
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,560
The police said that the weapons

116
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,560
were found in the warehouse next to the defendant's house

117
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
instead of in the house.

118
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,560
Because the warehouse didn't have a superior,

119
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,560
the控方 must prove that the weapons

120
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,560
were put in by the defendant, not by someone else.

121
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,560
And it's obvious that the weapon was put in by the defendant.

122
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,560
And it's obvious that the控方 didn't list

123
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
other possibilities as reasonable.

124
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,560
And they intended to mislead the police.

125
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,560
Now the police request that the控方 re-examine all evidence.

126
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,560
The prosecution must comply with the facts and be fair.

127
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,560
These are the two principles.

128
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Qin, we know each other.

129
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,560
But I have a question.

130
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,560
Can you explain why this thing appeared in your car?

131
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Is it from the police?

132
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
Yes.

133
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,560
But I don't know how to explain.

134
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
Is it from the police?

135
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Yes, it's from the government.

136
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,560
The witness department's colleagues found it in your car.

137
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,560
You should ask your colleagues first.

138
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,560
Did they leave it behind?

139
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,560
This piece of paper doesn't belong to the witness department.

140
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,560
It should be a copy of the police report.

141
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,560
The police department found it.

142
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,560
But the police didn't show up on the day of the search.

143
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,560
My car was missing for 24 hours.

144
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,560
During this time, who could have touched my car?

145
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,560
I think you should check your own people first.

146
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,560
What do you mean?

147
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Six months ago, a police chief was in a relationship with a police officer.

148
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,560
Six months ago, a police chief was in a relationship with a police officer.

149
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
I was afraid he would be in jail for three years.

150
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,560
He is not the only one who was convicted by me.

151
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
What do you want to say?

152
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Do you remember the explosion?

153
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Why did someone make a big fuss that day

154
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,560
and put a bomb-struck object in my office?

155
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,560
This is enough evidence.

156
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,560
There are some people who don't trust you.

157
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,560
Do you agree?

158
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
Let's go!

159
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Let's go!

160
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
Let's go.

161
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Don't you think you're a bit familiar?

162
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Isn't this my handwriting?

163
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
It's in my office journal.

164
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
It took me two whole days

165
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,560
to find you all those handwriting we know of.

166
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Can you explain it to me?

167
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,520
Where did you put it?

168
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,120
Don't you know that

169
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,200
any government official

170
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,240
will be reported?

171
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,720
Madam, where did you find it?

172
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,040
On a car.

173
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,320
It was a car that was hit by a car

174
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,640
and fled after it was hit by a man.

175
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,520
I need an explanation.

176
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,720
Why did this paper

177
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,160
appear on that car?

178
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,280
Why are you asking me?

179
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,560
Are you interrogating me?

180
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,840
Is it because I'm from the old city district?

181
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,520
You know Qi Changrong?

182
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,680
Does the people from the old city district

183
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,480
have anything to do with Qi Changrong?

184
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,840
Do you know Ma Shanbao?

185
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,280
He's a thief.

186
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,680
He's also from the old city district.

187
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,040
In your eyes,

188
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,560
the people from the old city district are thieves?

189
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,840
You haven't answered my question yet.

190
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,800
I don't know him.

191
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,560
I'll ask you again.

192
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,160
Madam, I'm a police officer,

193
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,600
not a thief.

194
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,960
Just a thief,

195
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,400
does it have anything to do with Qi Changrong?

196
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,360
Our consulates General Xie's dumpster

197
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,880
were killed

198
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,560
by Secret gezeigt by the No. 1 Martial Languages Company.

199
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,000
That means

200
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,680
Hu Baishuang

201
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,600
is the third round of the 두두입니다.

202
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,400
Miss Qi,

203
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,640
put a round in front of the newspaper.

204
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,880
reviews of Huge Support Station

205
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,280
and Miss local secretdarys

206
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,560
will be shown on the news.

207
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,840
Why is that on top of newspaper?

208
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,040
Please sign it.

209
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,640
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

210
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,040
Thank you.

211
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,040
Yi Wei.

212
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,040
We won't open that one.

213
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,040
Come here.

214
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,840
Come on.

215
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,840
Go out and have a look.

216
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,440
Come on.

217
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,040
The date written on it

218
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
is the day Zhuang Sen claimed

219
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,040
he had left Japan.

220
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
Then, Mr. Qin

221
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,240
reported the car accident.

222
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,040
Then,

223
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,240
Han Gang was hit by a car.

224
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,840
It was all the same day.

225
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,040
Don't forget.

226
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,240
We arrested

227
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
many Han Kuilong

228
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,840
and Qi Changrong's men that day.

229
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Ma Shanbao, too.

230
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,240
I think the strangest thing is

231
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
that it's not something valuable to leave Japan.

232
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
Who would take it?

233
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,240
There's one last possibility.

234
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,040
Although I still have some left,

235
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
we can't completely

236
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,040
rule out this possibility.

237
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,040
It's our own people

238
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
who framed Mr. Qin for revenge.

239
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,840
It seems to be too twisted.

240
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
It seems to have nothing to do with Mr. Qin

241
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,440
and there's no evidence.

242
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,840
Yeah.

243
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
If it's our own people,

244
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
why would they be so stupid?

245
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
If they're so stupid,

246
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
you mean Madam is stupid?

247
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Get back to work.

248
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,040
Shut up.

249
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,040
You don't want to drive anymore?

250
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,240
The police said

251
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,040
they just got a license plate with a time mark.

252
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,040
Let's go and buy a time mark now.

253
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,640
It will end.

254
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,040
You've grown up.

255
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,040
You should be stronger.

256
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,640
I want to be strong, too.

257
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
Actually,

258
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,240
things aren't as bad as you think.

259
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,640
We'll continue to live a normal life.

260
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,440
I'll continue to work.

261
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
You'll continue to study.

262
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,040
Madam.

263
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
My lawyer isn't here.

264
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
You can't interrogate me.

265
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
We're just chatting.

266
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,240
Don't be so nervous.

267
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,840
You're not going to admit your crime,

268
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,840
are you?

269
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,840
You have the right to deny it.

270
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,640
But you can't interrogate me.

271
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
I'm not going to do it.

272
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
The judge has the right to deny it.

273
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,440
What do you think he'll think?

274
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,440
On one hand,

275
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,440
he's a thief with a case.

276
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,040
He said he didn't steal.

277
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
On the other hand,

278
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
he's a high-ranking judge.

279
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,040
He said he saw the thief at the parking lot.

280
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,440
Which side do you think is more pitiful?

281
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,440
It's so hard to say that he stole.

282
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Don't play dumb.

283
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,040
Guanghua.

284
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Calm down.

285
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,640
Sorry, madam.

286
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,040
If you didn't steal,

287
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,640
why did you drive that car?

288
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,640
Go on.

289
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,040
Yes, madam.

290
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,640
I've applied for the procedure.

291
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
Give me a reason.

292
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,840
Why can't I see my client?

293
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,840
It's my right to see the lawyer.

294
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,640
I won't leave until I see him.

295
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,640
Please be quiet.

296
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,440
This is the police station.

297
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,240
What's your police number?

298
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
I'm going to sue you.

299
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
2795 Tang Xuan.

300
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,040
Use my police number.

301
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,240
Madam.

302
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
You didn't tell him

303
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,640
that our security system is being repaired.

304
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,840
Are you going to rearrange all the meetings?

305
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,840
I told him

306
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,640
that he had to leave here.

307
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,840
You can't question my client

308
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,040
without a lawyer.

309
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,840
What evidence do you have?

310
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,240
I'm questioning him.

311
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
255 Tang Xuan.

312
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,640
Why are you so patient?

313
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,440
Let me ask you again.

314
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,840
How did you get the scratch on the car?

315
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,840
How did you get the scratch on the car?

316
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,240
Say it.

317
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,840
You really have guts.

318
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,640
You're from the old city, right?

319
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,240
You hit Han Gang.

320
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,640
Han Gang?

321
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,040
He's Han Kuilong's son.

322
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,240
Aren't you afraid?

323
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,240
We'll let you go now.

324
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
You're dead.

325
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,240
Are you going to tell me?

326
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,440
I'm responsible for everything

327
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,640
that happens here.

328
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,040
I'll write it down now.

329
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,640
Ma Shanbao struggled

330
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,440
to break a water cup.

331
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,240
Then he accidentally

332
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,640
put the glass into his eyes.

333
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,440
Then you're done.

334
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,440
Are you going to tell me or not?

335
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,440
I don't have time today.

336
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,840
It won't be like this next time.

337
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,840
Did you hear me?

338
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
I'm sorry.

339
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,640
You can talk here.

340
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,040
They won't let me see Ma Shanbao.

341
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
You're a lawyer.

342
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,240
Shouldn't you be the one to solve it?

343
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,840
I'm here to tell you

344
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,640
that Ma Shanbao was beaten at the detention center.

345
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,040
And it wasn't the first time.

346
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,840
When he was in the court,

347
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,840
you saw the wound on his face.

348
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,840
You try to protect him.

349
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,240
He won't be beaten.

350
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,840
As his uncle,

351
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,040
if you really care about him,

352
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
you should call his mother

353
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,040
to stand up as a supervisor

354
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,440
and complain to the court

355
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,640
that the police used violence too much.

356
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,640
Who's the lawyer now?

357
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
I have to do everything myself.

358
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,440
Why should I hire you?

359
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,440
I've done my duty.

360
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,240
But Ma Shanbao refused to cooperate.

361
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,040
I want to know

362
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,640
who told him not to say anything.

363
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,240
If you know anything,

364
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
you must tell me.

365
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Ma Shanbao is only 18 years old.

366
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,040
He's still a young man.

367
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,240
He's so miserable inside.

368
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,240
Don't you feel bad for him as his family?

369
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,240
I beg you to help him as much as you can.

370
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,840
Wei.

371
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,640
Do you know that A'bao was beaten in the detention center?

372
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
You should know that

373
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
when you're a police,

374
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,440
these things happen often.

375
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Maybe A'bao

376
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,640
caused some trouble inside.

377
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,040
You also know that

378
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,240
the police are very sensitive to people in the old city.

379
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,440
The police don't like the old city.

380
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,840
Does the old city like the police very much?

381
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,240
Wei,

382
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
you must remind A'bao

383
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,840
not to say anything.

384
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,640
Everything must be done in a proper way.

385
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
Don't say anything.

386
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,040
Let the lawyer handle everything.

387
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,640
A'bao will never talk nonsense.

388
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,440
He dared to be a traitor in front of the police.

389
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,640
He will never see anyone again.

390
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,440
Why did you tear the car apart?

391
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,640
Can you stop asking me this question?

392
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
Why can't I ask you?

393
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,640
Although I was dismissed,

394
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,640
I still have the bottom line of being a person.

395
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,640
Are you hiding something from me?

396
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,840
Either you explain this matter to me

397
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,240
or you explain it to the police yourself.

398
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,040
Yes.

399
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,040
I was wrong this time.

400
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
I was really wrong.

401
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,640
Stop hiding it from me.

402
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,240
Yes.

403
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,240
You know

404
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
the most important thing is to tell the truth.

405
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,440
You know

406
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,240
the West King Road has been hit by a car recently.

407
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,640
I was careless

408
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,640
and overtook the speed.

409
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,240
The violation was caught.

410
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,040
If you overtook the speed, you would be deducted.

411
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,840
That's right.

412
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,640
But the speed limit was 80.

413
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,040
I drove 130.

414
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
The worst thing is

415
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,640
I was very busy that time.

416
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
I forgot to check the car

417
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,240
for the inspection period.

418
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,440
You also know that I am in the campaign.

419
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,640
I am the court president.

420
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
If the media

421
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,040
reveal this matter,

422
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,840
I can't be in the campaign

423
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,440
and my professional skills

424
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,640
will be questioned.

425
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,840
So

426
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,640
I asked you to disassemble the car.

427
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,240
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

428
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,240
I don't want to tell you

429
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,040
because I don't want things to be too complicated.

430
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,440
But now

431
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,040
it's still A'bao.

432
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
I feel guilty.

433
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,440
What do you think

434
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,640
should be handled now?

435
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,440
Your female apprentice

436
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,640
is the most painful now.

437
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,640
What about her?

438
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,640
She is very smart.

439
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,240
She guessed that someone wouldn't let A'bao talk.

440
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,640
She has started to doubt me.

441
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,040
I really don't know how long A'bao can last.

442
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
I'm worried that she will be killed

443
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,640
sooner or later in there.

444
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,640
Then

445
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
should we give her some money?

446
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
How much do you need?

447
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,040
Tell me.

448
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,840
She is dead.

449
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,640
What's the use of asking for money?

450
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,840
Your lawyer's apprentice

451
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,440
only knows how to pursue a problem

452
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,840
and doesn't know how to save people.

453
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,440
Things are getting more and more complicated

454
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
because of her.

455
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,840
How is it?

456
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,040
What do you order today?

457
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,040
We are all home.

458
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
Why do you still order take-out?

459
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,640
Didn't you see

460
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,640
that grandma's car is outside?

461
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,240
At home,

462
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,840
we should eat fresh and nutritious food.

463
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,840
Weiwei,

464
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
go up and do your homework.

465
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,240
You need to stew the milk for a while before you can eat it.

466
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,440
Weiwei is fine now.

467
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,040
She is fine.

468
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,040
I'm worried about you.

469
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,440
Look.

470
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,040
Your car was stolen for a while.

471
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,640
And you said you found it later.

472
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Now the police are searching for evidence.

473
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,640
You didn't tell me anything.

474
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,240
Weiwei even said that you changed a new car.

475
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,440
No.

476
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Because that old car needs to be checked.

477
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,440
After checking, it will cost a lot of money to repair.

478
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,640
So I bought a new car.

479
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,440
It's nothing.

480
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
This photo

481
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,040
was sent to the magazine anonymously.

482
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,640
My friend in the magazine

483
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,840
recognized this car as mine.

484
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,440
So it wasn't published.

485
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,040
I'm a judge.

486
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,440
I've been prepared

487
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
for these malicious attacks.

488
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,640
You are prepared.

489
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
But Weiwei isn't.

490
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,040
You are not only a judge,

491
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,440
but also Weiwei's father.

492
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,240
You know I'm her father.

493
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
Don't interfere

494
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,840
with our father-son relationship.

495
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,240
He is also my grandson.

496
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,240
If you do your duty as a father,

497
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,440
you should care about him,

498
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,240
take care of him,

499
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,240
and accompany him often.

500
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,640
Why should I be so worried?

501
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,840
I'm taking care of him.

502
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,240
I don't need to report to you.

503
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,640
What does he eat every day?

504
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,440
You don't care.

505
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840
You don't know he didn't go to school.

506
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,840
After his mother died,

507
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,840
he has lost so much weight.

508
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,040
You still can't tell.

509
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,040
Do you care about your son like this?

510
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
He is 19 years old.

511
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
He is a college student.

512
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,040
He is afraid of being taken care of by his son.

513
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
He goes to his school.

514
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,240
I go to my class.

515
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
It's normal.

516
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,840
You are a very talented judge.

517
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,840
That's why I married you.

518
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
But it doesn't mean

519
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,840
all your decisions are right.

520
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,640
For example, you want to be elected to the court.

521
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,040
Do you know that

522
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,240
if you are elected,

523
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,040
you won't have any private time?

524
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,240
You spend every day in the court.

525
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,240
When you get home,

526
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,040
you have to look at the file and write a sentence.

527
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
You won't even have time to eat takeout with your son.

528
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,840
I'm an old woman.

529
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,640
I don't want to be a judge.

530
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,040
I don't want to be a judge.

531
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,240
I'm an old woman.

532
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,240
No one knows better than me

533
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,040
that it's not easy to be a good judge and a good father.

534
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,040
You are no longer a judge.

535
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,240
This is not a court.

536
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,240
If you can't do it, it doesn't mean I can't do it.

537
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,040
Sorry.

538
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,040
You can call Weiwei to eat when you get home.

539
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,440
Okay.

540
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:48,800
You are useless to

541
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,440
have to jump to justice.

542
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:56,840
You look weird.

543
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
You look weird.

544
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,040
You look weird.

545
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,240
I'm getting a traffic accident.

546
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,440
You are a loser, give it to me.

547
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,040
Ignore me.

548
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,640
Nonsense.

549
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,840
He's thinking for us.

550
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,840
Your mom is gone.

551
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,000
He can solve everything.

552
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,760
Even if I want to get angry,

553
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,960
I can't.

554
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,560
Are you mad at your mom?

555
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,840
I'm a little angry.

556
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,680
I really don't understand

557
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,280
why she left us like this.

558
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,240
This family

559
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,720
is scattered like this.

560
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,800
Mom, she...

561
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,920
We'll go watch a movie later.

562
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,520
Buy a pair of new shoes.

563
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,280
Next time.

564
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,720
I'm going to school.

565
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Mr. Qin, what brings you here?

566
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,680
We didn't send any photos

567
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,480
that are related to this.

568
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,600
The police and I

569
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,680
have cooperated well.

570
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,560
I've said

571
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,520
that we didn't do it.

572
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,760
Moreover,

573
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,920
why would I do this?

574
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,280
Why would I

575
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,120
do this?

576
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,120
I'm not the one who did it.

577
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,800
I'm the one who did it.

578
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,840
I'm the one who did it.

579
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,320
Why would I offend

580
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,920
a judge who has cooperated with me for many years?

581
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,920
Who do you think is suspicious?

582
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,480
What's wrong with these two cars?

583
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,360
I'm sorry, Judge Lu.

584
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,320
I have nothing to report.

585
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,240
Are the cars

586
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,680
parked by the judge?

587
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,480
Please cooperate with our work.

588
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,720
Judge Lu Weide.

589
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,800
The one who competed with you

590
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,840
for the president of the court.

591
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,640
Why?

592
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,240
On the day of the search,

593
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,680
he passed by the scene.

594
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,360
He recognized your car

595
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,920
and wandered around

596
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,840
with his assistant

597
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
at the parking lot.

598
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,520
He really did it.

599
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,880
He appeared at the scene.

600
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,920
Plus, he had a motive.

601
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,720
Sorry.

602
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
It's normal to be suspicious

603
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,400
and look for the truth.

604
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,000
However,

605
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,840
I just told you

606
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,960
what I saw.

607
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,440
But if you tell others

608
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,760
that I told you,

609
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,760
I'm sorry.

610
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,760
I'll deny it.

611
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:35,920
Okay.

612
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,440
I can catch the mole of the police.

613
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,200
But the mouse of the court

614
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,960
has nothing to do with me.

615
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,080
Okay.

616
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,880
Jing Yiwei.

617
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,320
Will there be a competition after school today?

618
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,720
It's settled.

619
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,320
I'll wait for you.

620
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,400
Okay.

621
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,200
Do you know Cao Wei'er

622
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,040
dismissed me?

623
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,240
Really?

624
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,200
And I think he's guilty

625
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,120
to dismiss me.

626
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,520
Okay.

627
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,240
Let's talk inside.

628
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:55,360
Cao Wei'er

629
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,760
You don't need to care so much.

630
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,320
Because in the future,

631
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,200
you'll meet

632
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,280
other customers.

633
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,040
He's your friend.

634
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,960
Ma Shanbao is about the same age

635
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,000
as your son.

636
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,760
Think about it.

637
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,680
If your son was beaten up today,

638
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,440
what would you do?

639
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,200
As a lawyer,

640
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,080
the first rule

641
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,480
is not to be emotional

642
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,360
to your client.

643
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,080
I'm not your student anymore.

644
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,480
You don't need to

645
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,360
teach me like this.

646
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,040
Okay.

647
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,800
I'm telling the truth.

648
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,640
Your sympathy

649
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,360
is affecting your judgment.

650
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,440
Remember.

651
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,440
You're a lawyer,

652
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,320
not a social worker.

653
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,360
You can't sue him

654
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,800
for changing you because of a client.

655
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,520
You don't need to doubt Cao Wei'er

656
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,000
if he wants to save Ma Shanbao.

657
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,720
It's you who wants to save Ma Shanbao.

658
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,360
Or can you

659
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,720
save Ma Shanbao

660
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,800
as a lawyer?

661
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,800
I can't answer

662
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,720
anything else.

663
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,800
What else can I help you with?

664
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,880
Bye, coach.

665
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,280
Bye.

666
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,000
See you tomorrow.

667
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,160
Bye.

668
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,880
What are you doing?

669
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,640
Nothing. You can go.

670
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,120
Bye.

671
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,520
See you tomorrow.

672
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,000
Bye.

673
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,760
See you tomorrow. Bye.

674
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,480
Bye, coach.

675
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,200
Qin Yiwei.

676
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,880
You're drinking at school.

677
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,360
Give it to me.

678
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,840
Leave me alone.

679
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,320
You'll be expelled

680
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,040
if you're found out by the school.

681
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:52,880
Give it to me.

682
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,360
Leave me alone.

683
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,360
My mom is dead.

684
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,600
I know why she left us.

685
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,480
Don't pity me.

686
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,880
Stop drinking. Give it to me.

687
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,560
Don't do anything silly.

688
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:23,920
Did something happen

689
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,960
at home?

690
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,280
No.

691
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,440
Ask...

692
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,840
Nothing's going on.

693
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,360
Drinking is not a solution.

694
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,160
I know.

695
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,840
I know it can't be solved.

696
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,000
Relax and calm down.

697
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
Follow me to breathe.

698
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,720
You're back.

699
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,160
It's just the right time.

700
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,240
The night is just right.

701
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,000
I seriously suspect

702
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,880
that you installed a tracker in my phone.

703
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,600
How did you get up at this time?

704
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,960
I'm from the intelligence department.

705
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,840
I don't have the ability to detect like this.

706
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,560
You said Jiajia's scarf was left here.

707
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,200
Did she come back in two days?

708
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,680
You must have taken it to her.

709
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,560
She applied for a long time

710
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,440
and then transferred back to Dongqu Hospital.

711
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,320
She called me this morning.

712
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,880
She should be home by now.

713
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,480
So I can't keep this bowl of noodles

714
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,040
for you anymore, right?

715
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,640
I only have her sister.

716
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,880
I thought that Shisi only liked coffee.

717
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,600
I thought that Shisi only liked coffee.

718
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,640
I thought that Shisi only liked coffee.

719
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,360
I thought that Tang Ducha only liked work.

720
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,760
She even likes to dig up the bones of Shisi.

721
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,200
Okay.

722
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,880
I can't keep this bowl of noodles for you.

723
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,680
With this thing,

724
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,360
I should be able to keep you, right?

725
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,360
What is this?

726
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,960
I found it at the Han Gang car accident scene.

727
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,840
Who gave it to you?

728
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,080
There are some traces of blood on it.

729
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,280
I found it at the Han Gang car accident scene.

730
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
I found it at the Han Gang car accident scene.

731
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
I found it at the Han Gang car accident scene.

732
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,280
I found it at the Han Gang car accident scene.

733
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,280
There are some traces of blood on it.

734
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
You should investigate it.

735
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
You should have found it.

736
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,800
Who gave it to you?

737
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,560
Do you want to eat this bowl of noodles or not?

738
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,960
I cooked it very hard.

739
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,160
Don't waste it if you don't eat it.

740
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,720
Anyway,

741
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,520
the person who gave me this thing

742
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,640
is the same as your target.

743
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,880
They all want to find the real murderer.

744
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,480
There is no conspiracy at all.

745
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,120
There is no conflict of interest at all.

746
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,720
Okay?

747
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,120
Start the car.

748
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:52,840
Go ahead.

749
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,520
Jiajia.

750
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,480
I'm really sorry.

751
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,360
I have something

752
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,600
important to deal with tonight.

753
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,480
Let's meet later at home.

754
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:14,920
Yeah.

755
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,680
Get up now.

756
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,560
Now that you've arrived at the scene,

757
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,320
please get up now.

758
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,520
It has nothing to do with the coach.

759
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,960
I said I wanted to drink it.

760
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,000
Get in the car first.

761
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,600
Come on.

762
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,360
Be careful.

763
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,600
Judge Qin, you may have to pay attention.

764
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,840
He just had a miscarriage.

765
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,720
Okay, thank you.

766
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,760
You know you have a miscarriage.

767
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,160
Don't drink anymore.

768
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,360
It will stimulate the organs.

769
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:54,920
Yi Wei.

770
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,800
I'm listening.

771
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,800
After you drank,

772
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,920
did you say anything to the coach?

773
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,760
Say what?

774
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,160
You shouldn't say it.

775
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,000
I didn't tell him anything.

776
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,240
Nothing.

777
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,520
Didn't you bring the miscarriage sprayer?

778
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,480
Then I'mragon-Bo Dasan.

779
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,880
Judge Qin.

780
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,360
Someone found a new witness

781
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:07,840
at the scene of the car accident.

782
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,480
They sent him to make DHE and DNAim mistress�s smoke.

783
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,600
As the result,

784
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:10,960
we can contro long-term

785
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,520
the real suf�ener for the incident.

786
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:43,240
Lock him!

787
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,160
Eunuch Yi.

788
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,320
I know who hit Han Gang.

789
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:27,900
Nevertha

790
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,120
Why are you so angry?

791
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,620
Asmr

792
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:47,500
How fun fire might burn off

793
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:55,300
Tara plan humbly

794
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,180
The heart heart is too pressurized

795
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,080
Hmm Lamiz what else

796
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:06,100
Single but burning

797
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:10,960
Maybe it's not feel at home

798
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,240
Why do you keep looking?

799
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,080
Overlap an empty stare

800
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,380
Yu

801
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:55,980

Look at the light and full of tears

803
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,440
