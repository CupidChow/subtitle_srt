3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,560
What happened?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,880
I'm ok

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,960
Go inside

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,000
come

9
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hold it.

10
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'll help you up.

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Slowly.

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Be careful of your head.

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is anti-virus.

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is anti-virus.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Here.

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Eat some first.

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Are you okay?

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Wei, it seems that the bullets are still inside.

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
How did you get shot?

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Really?

21
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And what's the car outside?

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
A batch of weapons.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I helped Qi Changrong to grab it.

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But I haven't said how to give it to him.

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You really helped him to grab it?

26
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is too dangerous.

27
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You still have a wife and children in your family.

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I did it for my wife and children.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Now it's like this.

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't you think you have no responsibility?

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't think so.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If I were this kind of person, you wouldn't come to me.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
First, cut his wound.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Here.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Be careful.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yiwei, I have something to do today.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I can't send you to school.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Do you want me to call a taxi for you?

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No, I'll take the bus.

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Whose car is this?

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
My friend's.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll drive it away later.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm late.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Go back to school.

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Wei.

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Wei.

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh, no.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I really have a fever.

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Hello.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't care who you are.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Tell Cao Wei'er.

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's useless to hide.

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Wei.

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Wei.

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How is it?

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Can you hold it?

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Wei.

58
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You go to eat first.

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Grandma.

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Did something happen?

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Nothing.

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I just have something to ask you.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Come on, sit down first.

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Someone just called you.

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So be it.

66
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hello?

67
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,080
You got it.

68
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,960
I'll give it to you today.

69
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,480
Why didn't you give it to me yesterday?

70
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,240
This is a big deal.

71
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,640
You're still running around.

72
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,000
You're dying.

73
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,320
I swear on my son.

74
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,640
I have everything.

75
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,120
I'll give you two hours.

76
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,720
I'll send it to you right now.

77
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,680
Qi Changrong.

78
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,200
Shouldn't you tell me the truth?

79
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,960
Yes.

80
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,800
I'm now in front of God.

81
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,280
To ensure the safety of your wife and child.

82
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,080
I can do it.

83
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,160
Okay.

84
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,840
That's enough.

85
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,840
Wei,

86
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,600
how can you go like this?

87
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,320
He threatened me with my son.

88
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,960
I can't just leave.

89
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,560
But I installed a bomb at the bottom of the car.

90
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,360
He opened the back door.

91
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,960
I'll blow him up.

92
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,200
Don't say it.

93
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,240
I'll go.

94
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,240
I'll go.

95
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,360
I've been feeling a little weird lately.

96
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,360
I guess your father had some trouble.

97
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,520
I've never seen him like this.

98
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,040
I don't think I'm wrong.

99
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,320
He's in trouble.

100
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,800
You know,

101
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,400
my grandmother was a judge before.

102
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,040
I've never seen anything like this.

103
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,960
Your father must be threatened now.

104
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,080
Even a blackmail.

105
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,760
Wei,

106
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,800
Wei,

107
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,160
if you know anything,

108
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,560
you must tell your grandmother, okay?

109
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,040
I don't know.

110
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,880
My father never tells me anything like this.

111
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,560
Qi Changrong is suspicious.

112
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,120
We can't let him know

113
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,840
that we've changed our person.

114
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,880
Tell me when you arrive.

115
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,440
Or let me contact him.

116
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,680
Okay.

117
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
I'll send you to the hospital first.

118
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,560
Then we'll start the car.

119
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,680
I can't go to the hospital.

120
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,560
They can see that I'm shot.

121
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,240
I'll die if I use a bullet to compare.

122
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,960
But the bullet is still in your stomach.

123
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,400
You won't die if you don't go to the hospital.

124
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,240
I won't go.

125
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,480
You send the things first.

126
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,160
You owe me this.

127
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,200
You can't go back.

128
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,480
What should I do? Tell me.

129
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,360
Wei, what are you doing?

130
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,440
I didn't ask you to kill people.

131
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,600
You should protect yourself.

132
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,280
Have you met anything weird recently?

133
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,800
For example, have you received

134
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,600
some strange calls in the middle of the night?

135
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,720
Or have you found

136
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,400
that there are some strangers

137
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,200
around your house

138
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,120
who seem to be watching you?

139
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,000
No.

140
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,440
I didn't.

141
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,640
I didn't.

142
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,480
I didn't.

143
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,080
I didn't.

144
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,760
I didn't.

145
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,560
I didn't.

146
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,400
I didn't.

147
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,080
I didn't.

148
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,840
I didn't.

149
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,800
I didn't.

150
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,640
I didn't.

151
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,400
I didn't.

152
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,240
I didn't.

153
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,160
I didn't.

154
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,360
You didn't?

155
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,240
I didn't.

156
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,480
No.

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I still want you to stay in my house for a few days

158
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,640
to see what's going on.

159
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,040
No need.

160
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,640
It's not that serious.

161
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,480
I'm not discussing with you now.

162
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,200
Go home and pack your clothes

163
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,360
and move to my house.

164
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,200
But my dad...

165
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,080
I'll explain to him

166
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,360
where your dad is.

167
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,960
Mr. Qin.

168
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,160
Don't be afraid.

169
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm fine.

170
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,120
I'm not afraid.

171
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,400
Don't fall asleep.

172
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,440
Continue talking to me.

173
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,160
Talk?

174
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,360
What do you want to talk about?

175
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,400
I remember now.

176
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,560
We were classmates in primary school.

177
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,960
Actually, that day,

178
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,440
I was in the middle of the night.

179
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
I was in the middle of the night.

180
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
I was in the middle of the night.

181
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
I was in the middle of the night.

182
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,760
Actually, that day,

183
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,080
did you recognize me?

184
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Your Honor.

185
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,720
As a police officer,

186
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,760
I should know clearly

187
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,040
about his responsibility to society,

188
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,360
including protecting the lives of the citizens.

189
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,280
But the defendant broke the law

190
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,960
and even stole the money.

191
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,480
It really has the expectations of the citizens

192
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,840
and the public.

193
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,240
I hope Your Honor

194
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,480
can punish him severely.

195
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,120
I know I'm not a

196
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,440
criminal police who connects the public and the public.

197
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,840
But I never know

198
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,280
whether I'm a criminal or not.

199
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,280
It's because I don't do it.

200
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,400
I'm a financial person.

201
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,640
They framed me together

202
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,120
and said I stole the money on the spot.

203
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,160
The defendant was accused of

204
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,240
breaking the law during the law enforcement.

205
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,760
He stole the money.

206
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,640
The evidence in the court shows that

207
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,400
firstly,

208
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,640
there is no direct evidence

209
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,800
to prove that the defendant stole the money.

210
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,200
Secondly,

211
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,120
there is no direct evidence to prove that

212
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,880
the defendant put the money in his car.

213
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,240
The court's judgment

214
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,840
is not based on one or two words,

215
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,200
but on evidence.

216
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,120
Therefore,

217
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
I declare that

218
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
there is no enough evidence to confirm

219
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,480
that the defendant's charge

220
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,600
of theft is not true.

221
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,320
Your Honor.

222
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,800
Thank you for clearing my name.

223
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,080
It's not me.

224
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,080
The law and evidence helped you.

225
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,880
You don't think that

226
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,240
you can get another judge to judge you.

227
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,680
The result is the same as now.

228
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,280
I don't need to be imprisoned for the wrongdoing.

229
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,080
I should thank you.

230
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,040
Take care of yourself.

231
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,160
Thank you.

232
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,640
Actually, you...

233
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,920
You always keep a low profile.

234
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,480
Do you think I care about me?

235
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,200
Wei, are you alright?

236
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:06,960
Wei.

237
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,320
Wei.

238
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,600
I...

239
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,160
I'm okay.

240
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,720
Although they

241
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,800
actively particle me in the end,

242
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,320
I didn't get jailed because of someone's wrongdoing.

243
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
I still have to thank you.

244
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
I know that

245
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,920
the Black Gang harassed me later.

246
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
You secretly helped me out.

247
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,120
I'm happy

248
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,520
to return your favor.

249
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,520
We can still be friends.

250
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,120
I have a judge friend.

251
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
It's so honorable.

252
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,720
But your judge friend

253
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,520
has done many bad things recently.

254
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,520
For my son,

255
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,520
I have to do everything.

256
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Wei,

257
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
I'm sorry.

258
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
I didn't expect it to be like this.

259
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,520
To be honest,

260
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,320
if it wasn't for you,

261
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,320
I might still be in jail.

262
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,120
It's also because of you

263
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,320
that I ended up like this.

264
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,320
Should I turn around

265
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,720
or lose?

266
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,520
You can't hold it anymore.

267
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,720
I'll settle this debt with you

268
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,120
when I come back.

269
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,720
Don't sleep.

270
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,920
Your father is at home.

271
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,120
He said he had something to do today.

272
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
He probably didn't drive.

273
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,120
Go upstairs and pack up.

274
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,520
Grandma is waiting for you here.

275
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,320
Auntie,

276
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,040
so long,

277
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,720
have you seen me?

278
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,520
What are you doing?

279
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,120
Don't hang up.

280
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,420
Young people have their own fault.

281
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,620
It's been almost a month.

282
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,700
The complaint team asked me for help,

283
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,820
but there was no conclusion.

284
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,020
They asked if I could resume my job.

285
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,060
They should ask

286
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,620
if you can resume your job

287
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,260
and see for yourself.

288
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,780
Maideng, I've told you many times.

289
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,380
Although I'm from the old city district,

290
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,260
I'm a police officer.

291
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,700
Maideng,

292
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,460
I have a message from Qi Changrong.

293
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,540
They said Han Lie has the guts to kill people in the old city.

294
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,580
He's directly provoking the old city gang.

295
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,340
Can you say something I don't know?

296
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,940
Qi Changrong's men are making a batch of firearms.

297
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,460
He said he would soon be able to play a good show.

298
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,460
Is the news reliable?

299
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,220
You can check

300
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,860
which news was not released yesterday.

301
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
I'll report it tomorrow.

302
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,860
Yes, Maideng.

303
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,060
I'm here to report.

304
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,540
I'm here to report.

305
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,740
I'm here to report.

306
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,940
Yes, Maideng.

307
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,180
Thank you, Maideng.

308
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,380
I've asked.

309
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,380
There was a news that was not released yesterday.

310
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,300
Maybe it's because it's a bit sensitive.

311
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,100
It's not sensitive.

312
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,380
It's embarrassing.

313
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,860
Let's get to the point.

314
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,500
It's a batch of firearms that the officers rushed to attack.

315
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,460
They should have taken them to the warehouse after the case was over.

316
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,420
I didn't expect that they were robbed when they were transporting them to the warehouse.

317
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,540
The rush team rushed to the scene to stop them.

318
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,260
But the bandits threw a hand grenade

319
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,540
and let it run away.

320
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,380
Ordinary people don't know

321
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,740
how to deal with this.

322
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
There must be a mole.

323
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,940
Not only that.

324
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,260
They stole two boxes of gunpowder

325
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,220
and one box of yellow TNT explosives.

326
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,420
If these firearms were used to kill,

327
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
it would be really bad.

328
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,460
Is there an investigation team

329
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,980
following up on this case?

330
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,380
That's right.

331
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,740
If this case

332
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,340
is really related to Qi Chengrong,

333
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,300
that means he wanted to use Ma Shanbao's death

334
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,140
to declare war on Han Kuilong.

335
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,260
Are these two cases

336
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,660
related?

337
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,700
Tang Xian.

338
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,700
Tao.

339
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,380
You're here at the right time.

340
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,460
I have something to report to you.

341
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,420
You two go out first.

342
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:46,980
Yes, sir.

343
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,580
Yes, sir.

344
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,620
What's wrong?

345
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,900
The internal investigation team is here.

346
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,420
They want to see you.

347
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,420
I'll be the one to listen.

348
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,340
But I have no right to speak.

349
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,100
This is Tang Xuan, the senior inspector.

350
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,460
The internal investigation team is Gu Baisheng.

351
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,620
Mr. Gu.

352
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,660
Please sit.

353
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,700
We arranged this meeting

354
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,180
because we have some questions

355
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,420
and want Tang to help us confirm it.

356
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:22,940
Yes, sir.

357
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,420
Let's get this straight.

358
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,260
Are you in charge of Ma Shanbao's case?

359
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,220
Yes.

360
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,060
Is there any doubt?

361
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,580
What you mean is

362
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,100
that Ma Shanbao's death

363
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,580
is a part of the investigation team?

364
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,060
We're from the internal investigation team.

365
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,820
What do you think?

366
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
We suspect that there's a mole in your team.

367
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,500
Who do you suspect?

368
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,300
What's the reason?

369
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,740
These two photos

370
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,980
were taken after Ma Shanbao was detained.

371
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,660
Are you there?

372
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:05,940
No.

373
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,660
Why would he be injured?

374
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,940
According to the colleagues,

375
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,660
Liang Jie and Guo Hua's confession,

376
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,020
he was arrested,

377
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,980
emotional,

378
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,060
and attacked the police.

379
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,780
The scars were caused by the arrest.

380
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,140
As far as I know,

381
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,620
he knew what happened,

382
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,660
so he didn't make a complaint.

383
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,380
Yes.

384
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,220
He did make a complaint.

385
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
What do you suspect?

386
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,300
I've checked Guo Hua's background.

387
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,460
When he first joined the army,

388
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,340
he had a partner

389
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,100
who was promoted to the position

390
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,700
of gunner in the Jiucheng District.

391
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,860
Since then,

392
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,860
he's used more than once

393
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,740
to the Jiucheng Gang.

394
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,900
What does this have to do with the internal investigation team?

395
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,220
Ma Shanbao was attacked during the interrogation.

396
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,340
Let me repeat.

397
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,980
Ma Shanbao's death

398
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,740
was a part of the investigation team.

399
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,700
What do you think?

400
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,660
Let me say it again.

401
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,100
Ma Shanbao's injuries

402
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,940
were not caused by interrogation.

403
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,780
No, no, no.

404
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,940
You just need to answer me.

405
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,740
Did anyone attack Ma Shanbao

406
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,140
in the police station?

407
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,540
Yes.

408
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,380
Who?

409
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,060
Guo Hua.

410
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,700
But that doesn't mean he's the mole.

411
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,460
Who did he sell the information to?

412
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,340
The Black Gang of the Han Kuilong.

413
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,980
Do you have any evidence?

414
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,180
I've sent two men

415
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,260
to jail

416
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,220
because they want to collude with the Han family

417
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,660
to deal with the Jiucheng Gang.

418
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,660
It doesn't matter.

419
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,340
It's better to use the dark to block the dark.

420
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,900
It might be more convenient

421
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,300
than to catch those real black police.

422
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,540
Say more, Lai Tingting.

423
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,180
Liao Jun.

424
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,940
You don't need to record

425
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,140
what he said just now.

426
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,980
What are you doing?

427
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,900
What are you doing?

428
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,420
Are you there?

429
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,780
Almost there.

430
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,500
Leave as soon as you arrive.

431
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,460
I'll inform Qi Changrong.

432
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,380
Don't be nervous.

433
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,060
I'll wait for you to leave safely.

434
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,820
Okay.

435
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,980
Keep your phone on.

436
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:24,900
Hold on.

437
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,540
Got it?

438
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,980
Do you know that Guo Hua has seen Han Lie?

439
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,260
Or I'll ask you the opposite.

440
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,260
Have you approved of him

441
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,620
to contact Han Lie?

442
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,420
Even if they've seen him,

443
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,420
it might be because of the need to investigate.

444
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,140
Of course.

445
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,220
Because the criminals

446
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,740
usually collect information.

447
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,020
Am I right, Chief Tang?

448
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,460
Were you there

449
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,500
at the scene of the accident?

450
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,420
No.

451
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,900
Guo Hua was in charge of the scene.

452
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,180
So, the traffic accident report

453
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,100
and the witness report

454
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,100
were all handed over to you by him?

455
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,940
It should be Guo Hua and Liang Jie.

456
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,100
In your memory,

457
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,580
did the report mention

458
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,900
that you found a sprayer at the scene?

459
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:20,900
I have no memory.

460
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,100
Hold on.

461
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,500
You have no memory.

462
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,500
You have no memory

463
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,980
that the report mentioned the sprayer.

464
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,780
Or did the report mention

465
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,940
that you found the sprayer?

466
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,740
I knew I found a sprayer.

467
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,900
Then I handed it over to do a DNA test.

468
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,260
Then why didn't the report

469
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,180
mention you?

470
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,740
I don't know.

471
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,660
I was confused.

472
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,420
I was confused.

473
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,020
Did someone

474
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,540
hide such an important evidence

475
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,620
on purpose?

476
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,460
Why did they do that?

477
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,340
I don't know.

478
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,380
Maybe it's like what you said.

479
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,340
They were black and white.

480
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,420
They deliberately

481
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,580
sowed discord between the two sides

482
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,740
and took advantage of it.

483
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,580
Then they thought it was useless

484
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,660
and handed over the evidence.

485
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,660
These are all your speculations.

486
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,740
Do you have any evidence?

487
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,820
That's strange.

488
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,580
How did you get

489
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,460
the sprayer?

490
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,420
Nike factory told me

491
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,100
that the sprayer was not subject to

492
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,340
any aids

493
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,340
nor any trace 맛있어요

494
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:19,980
Right.

495
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,700
The sprayer's name was Zh cubes.

496
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,580
All right.

497
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,700
Just tell me.

498
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,560
Where is the sprayer?

499
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,740
I clearly spotted it.

500
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,740
In the Brown River restoring centre,

501
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,460
I could click here.

502
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,560
Can you tell me

503
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
His lawyer.

504
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,080
Then the decision to bail him out

505
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,680
was made before the DNA report was released

506
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,680
or after?

507
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,320
Can I understand it this way?

508
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,160
If the result is consistent in the end,

509
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,240
it should be a formal prosecution,

510
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
not bailing him out.

511
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,400
The investigation

512
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,880
is a process

513
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,800
of questioning the evidence.

514
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,320
We suspect that Ma Shanbao is related to the car crash case

515
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,600
because the car he drove

516
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,040
was the car that had an accident.

517
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,880
He bailed him out

518
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,120
because he wanted to provide some information

519
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120
to us to solve the case.

520
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,240
These are all our solutions.

521
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,720
You should know it, right?

522
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,120
Yes.

523
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,160
We often use these strategies.

524
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
But we didn't break the rules.

525
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,640
Who else knows about

526
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,400
the news of Ma Shanbao bailing him out?

527
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,160
I do.

528
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,280
The judge,

529
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,840
the prosecutor,

530
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,320
his lawyer,

531
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,560
and...

532
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,200
Guo Hua.

533
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,560
My whole team

534
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,920
and the car driver,

535
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,160
many people.

536
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,680
Ma Shanbao bailed him out

537
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,600
because he suspected that

538
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,720
it was Han Kuilong's gunman

539
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,200
who killed Tang Ducha.

540
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,560
So the key to the problem

541
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,160
is not whether the news was leaked,

542
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,800
but who leaked it.

543
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,160
You're just making a false assumption.

544
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,200
You can't just say that

545
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,000
it's Guo Hua.

546
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,720
Who says it's Guo Hua?

547
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,560
Chen Jianbin.

548
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,320
It must be Gu Defu.

549
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,480
I heard he passed out as a child...

550
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,000
That day,

551
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:35,500
around 3

552
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,560
o'clock,

553
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,320
Let's go.

554
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,520
Is it your birthday that day?

555
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,200
Are you there?

556
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,040
I'll notify you when I get there.

557
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Why is it so quiet over there?

558
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Wei, don't play tricks with me.

559
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,560
I'm in the toilet. There are three people.

560
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,560
I'll let you know when I get there.

561
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,560
If you watch the entire video,

562
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,560
you'll see that I rejected the gift.

563
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Why did Han Lie give you such an expensive gift?

564
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,560
That watch is worth more than ten thousand.

565
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
I don't know. What do you think?

566
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,560
Who targeted you? Tell me. Who framed you?

567
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,560
Maybe you should ask who suggested this video.

568
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,560
Maybe after you find this person,

569
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,560
you'll know who gave Ma Shanbao's information to the Han family.

570
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,560
The Han family?

571
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
You went to the prison to see Han Kuilong.

572
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560
Han Kuilong?

573
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,560
Han Kuilong?

574
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,560
He was in prison more than once, right?

575
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,560
Everyone knows

576
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,560
that even Han Kuilong was in prison,

577
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
all he had to say

578
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,560
was that he'd be in trouble.

579
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,560
I went to him to tell him.

580
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,560
I can let him see his son,

581
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560
but he can only give us time

582
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,560
to investigate the real culprit.

583
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,560
Don't meddle.

584
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,560
Don't use your private life and kill the innocent.

585
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,880
How do you explain it?

586
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,040
Ma Shanbao was killed.

587
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,160
It's not an interference.

588
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,480
It's not a private murder.

589
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,200
I want to ask

590
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,800
if it's a formal interrogation.

591
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,480
Who are you pointing at?

592
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,000
Do you have any evidence?

593
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,120
Tang Xue.

594
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,680
We received a lawyer's complaint.

595
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,120
He wants to report you.

596
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,320
Chou Lu.

597
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,400
The complaint says

598
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,040
Ma Shanbao once said

599
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,360
that when the accident happened,

600
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,720
he was stealing an old car

601
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,800
from another place.

602
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,440
He complained that you knew

603
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,600
such an important evidence was missing,

604
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,040
but you didn't go to investigate it immediately.

605
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,160
All criminals

606
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,120
want to make themselves responsible

607
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,280
for tens of thousands of reasons.

608
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,400
I have to think through and analyze

609
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,200
to make sure it's true.

610
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,120
You've been looking for these two cars

611
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,080
for three days.

612
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,440
Who set the fire and burned the car?

613
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,400
I want to know too.

614
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,440
Who leaked the news

615
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,440
to his accomplice, Xiaobei,

616
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,400
and made him disappear?

617
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
If there's no evidence,

618
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,600
I'll have to investigate it myself.

619
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,600
If you don't sit here

620
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
and waste my time,

621
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,520
I'm asking you these questions.

622
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,400
Answer me.

623
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,280
I don't know.

624
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,760
I didn't even hear my name.

625
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,480
I just want to know

626
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,600
how much longer you have to wait.

627
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,720
Wait until I'm satisfied.

628
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,840
Mr. Xcido.

629
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,320
You have arrived.

630
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,320
We just left the ruins of thedas Shek.

631
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,680
Turn left.

632
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,080
Before us and you will be there.

633
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,600
Wei,

634
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,600
is this pack of firearms required to be electrocuted again?

635
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,120
What else is there to do?

636
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,200
Why can't many people fall into Qi Changlong's hands?

637
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,400
We'll solve it together.

638
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,400
Only then can we solve the case of A'bao.

639
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,600
Only then will the wounded and the children be safe.

640
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,680
Qi Changlong, call me.

641
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,960
I'll call you later.

642
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Hello?

643
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Are you there?

644
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,600
Come back in ten minutes.

645
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,000
No need. I'll be there soon.

646
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Hello?

647
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,800
Hurry and leave.

648
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,200
Qi Changlong will be there soon.

649
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Yes.

650
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Qi Changlong

651
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
Qi Changlong

652
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
No problem.

653
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Qi Changlong

654
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,000
Tang Xuan's casino.

655
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,000
I'm officially resigning from your position.

656
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
You came prepared from the start.

657
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,000
The target is not Guo Hua.

658
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,200
It was me from the start.

659
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,000
You have an inappropriate contact with Han Lie and Han Kuilong.

660
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,200
You just said that there was no leak

661
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,400
before Ma Shanbao was killed.

662
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Or you can say that

663
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,800
during the entire investigation,

664
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
when the confidential information

665
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
kept leaking,

666
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,200
you didn't implement any plan

667
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
to explain this matter.

668
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,800
You need to answer this question.

669
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,200
Can I make a suggestion?

670
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Tang Xuan will be

671
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
on leave for a while.

672
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
During that time,

673
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,600
he can come back and answer your question anytime.

674
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,400
Xu Yan, what do you mean by that?

675
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Anyway, my request is

676
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,800
during my interrogation,

677
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,400
you can't contact Ma Shanbao again.

678
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Okay, okay.

679
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,000
I will personally supervise.

680
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Today,

681
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,000
it's like this.

682
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,000
Ma Shanbao, you...

683
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
You're here.

684
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
What are you doing?

685
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,600
How did you get hurt like this?

686
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,000
My grandma asked me to go to her house.

687
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm here to help her.

688
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,600
Grandma asked me to stay at her house for a few days.

689
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,800
Yes.

690
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,000
I think

691
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
the health care system isn't good recently.

692
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Why?

693
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,800
Your health care system isn't good.

694
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
The car was stolen for no reason.

695
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,000
I want to go to my house for a few days.

696
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Hey.

697
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,400
You're going to school

698
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,800
for three days.

699
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,200
You're taking her away now.

700
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,000
Can we discuss it

701
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,200
peacefully?

702
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
No need to discuss.

703
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
I'm worried about her.

704
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,000
No.

705
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,800
Stop arguing.

706
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,400
Grandma, go back first.

707
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,600
I'll find you.

708
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,200
No.

709
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,400
Go to my house for a few days.

710
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,000
Okay.

711
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,200
I'll go in two days, okay?

712
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,000
Okay.

713
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,800
Weiwei.

714
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
Weiwei.

715
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,800
Dad, what happened to you?

716
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,600
Are you okay?

717
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,000
Why is there blood in the bathroom towel?

718
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,200
Are you scared?

719
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
I...

720
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
Are you okay?

721
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
I'm fine.

722
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,800
Why is someone hiding here?

723
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,800
Call uncle.

724
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Kid.

725
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,000
You have to pay for your mistakes.

726
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,400
She's also involved in the car accident?

727
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,000
Everything is related to the car accident.

728
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,600
Hurry up and send her to the hospital.

729
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,800
Send her to the hospital.

730
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,000
The police will find out.

731
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
What should we do?

732
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,800
What are you doing?

733
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,600
Call my wife.

734
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
Mr. Hu.

735
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,800
I'm sorry.

736
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
I've caused you trouble.

737
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Who gave you

738
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,600
that spray gun?

739
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
I guessed it.

740
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,400
There's only one person.

741
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,800
Shi Zhiyang, right?

742
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,200
I know that because of Da Jia Ma,

743
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,600
you have some opinions about Zhiyang.

744
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,400
But in the matter of spray guns,

745
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
he just wanted to help me find the real murderer.

746
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,600
So his position is the same as that of Han Kuilong.

747
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,400
The same is reasonable.

748
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,600
As for his position,

749
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,600
it doesn't matter to me.

750
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,800
Because I believe

751
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,400
he won't harm his girlfriend.

752
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,600
As for that lawyer who wanted to complain about you

753
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,000
and want you to be responsible for Ma Shanbao's death,

754
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,600
it was just an emotional request.

755
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,400
There was no reason.

756
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,800
Because the news leaked,

757
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,600
and it led to the death of Ma Shanbao,

758
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,400
that's the truth.

759
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,400
It's normal for him to be angry with me.

760
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,640
The most important problem is to leak the news.

761
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,680
Who did it?

762
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,280
Why did they do it?

763
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,880
You must find the answer to this question.

764
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,680
Not for them,

765
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,160
but for yourself.

766
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,160
Anyway, you haven't had a holiday for a long time.

767
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,880
I'll take it as a relief.

768
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,000
Sometimes I think

769
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,760
it's better to be an outsider

770
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,560
to see things more clearly.

771
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,600
Wait.

772
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,480
What's up?

773
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,640
There was an explosion in the old city.

774
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,880
The evidence shows that it's related to the last military fire.

775
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,360
I'm the victim.

776
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,320
Why did you arrest me?

777
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,200
That bastard!

778
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:06,880
Wait!

779
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,160
You covered Han Lie

780
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,480
and came to the old city to fight.

781
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,560
You didn't arrest anyone.

782
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,840
You didn't care about the bomb.

783
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,960
What kind of police are you?

784
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,120
You're obviously a murderer.

785
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,680
If you say more, I'll accuse you of slander.

786
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,960
If you dare to touch me, I'll try.

787
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
The whole old city won't let you off.

788
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,920
Take him in.

789
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,320
Go.

790
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:20,880
Go in.

791
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,640
Go.

792
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,960
Madam, you'll be the judge.

793
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,880
You may start to take a leave.

794
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,480
I'll be in charge of this case.

795
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,760
What's up, Mrs. Shi?

796
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,880
You're really a intelligence officer.

797
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,080
You received the news so quickly.

798
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,760
It's rare that you can take a leave.

799
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,160
I'm so grateful for that investigation.

800
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,520
Can you take a leave?

801
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,280
I don't have a holiday.

802
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,720
But if you stay at home,

803
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,960
I'll be more at ease.

804
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,680
I'll be able to take care of myself.

805
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,160
I'll be able to take care of you.

806
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,520
I'll be able to take care of you.

807
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,920
I'll be able to take care of you.

808
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,520
I'll be able to take care of you.

809
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,960
I'll be able to take care of you.

810
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,320
I'll be able to take care of you.

811
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,960
I'll be more at ease.

812
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,360
You can comfort me.

813
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,160
It's troublesome for me to be here.

814
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,040
Is everything going well with Liu Mao?

815
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,160
Yes.

816
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,080
We've found him.

817
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,680
We only have half a life left.

818
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,280
I don't know if he can hold on to me.

819
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,640
I can't ask him anything.

820
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,400
Let's go.

821
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,920
Hurry up and leave this sad place.

822
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,640
You drive your car.

823
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,240
I'll drive mine.

824
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,440
It's an old place.

825
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
See you.

826
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,640
Wei!

827
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,880
He...

828
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,160
He's in the car.

829
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,000
Yes.

830
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,520
We have to send him to the hospital immediately.

831
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,040
Tell the police that the gunfire hurt him.

832
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,480
It happens a lot in the old city.

833
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,800
He's been unconscious for so long.

834
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,800
You're asking me to send him to the hospital now?

835
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,400
Does it have nothing to do with you?

836
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,200
It has nothing to do with me.

837
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,760
It's my fault.

838
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,040
You caused him to be like this, right?

839
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,960
Let's send him to the hospital first.

840
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,120
You don't have to worry about Wei.

841
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:24,720
Come on.

842
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,360
Come with me.

843
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,120
Let's go.

844
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,200
Let's go.

845
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,880
I don't need your help.

846
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,720
Come on.

847
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,480
Xiao Jing.

848
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,400
Let's go.

849
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,640
Xiao Jing.

850
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,040
Xiao Jing.

851
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Xiao Jing.

852
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,640
Okay.

853
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,520
Okay.

854
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,800
Thank you.

855
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,280
Come here as soon as possible.

856
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,640
How is it?

857
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,400
What did Peng say?

858
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,160
Will he come?

859
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,800
He can only come tomorrow.

860
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,280
He told me to use alcohol to help him quit.

861
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,600
Let's wait for tomorrow.

862
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,720
Wei.

863
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,200
You stay here for a while.

864
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,600
Peng will come tomorrow.

865
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,960
He'll be fine if he takes out the bullets for you.

866
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,240
I'll wait for you.

867
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,520
I'll wait for you.

868
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,560
You'll be fine.

869
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,640
You prepared so much food.

870
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,680
It seems that only we two are here.

871
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,040
You're the pig?

872
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,520
Strictly speaking, you are the pig.

873
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,200
I'm the cabbage that's specially used

874
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,840
to feed you.

875
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,520
Why are you the cabbage?

876
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,880
I'm the cabbage.

877
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,960
I'm the cabbage.

878
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,840
I'm the cabbage.

879
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,400
Because pigs love cabbage.

880
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,000
You're the pig.

881
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,040
That's right.

882
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,800
I'm a precious pig.

883
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,600
Xiao Jing.

884
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,760
I only feed my favorite pig.

885
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,640
Not everyone can eat it.

886
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,560
Thank you.

887
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,560
Forget it.

888
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,080
If you don't drink, your soul will come back.

889
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,000
But please.

890
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,080
Give me back your body.

891
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,600
What for?

892
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,760
To wash the dishes.

893
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,000
What do you want to do?

894
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,960
I can do it.

895
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:30,880
Sorry.

896
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,440
I really can't do it tonight.

897
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,400
Okay. I'll let you go.

898
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,440
Anyway,

899
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,920
you don't have to worry about the internal investigation team.

900
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,920
Your problem will definitely be solved.

901
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,640
But what I want to tell you is

902
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,720
sometimes walking in the gray area

903
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,040
is not a bad thing.

904
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,040
It depends on what your intention is.

905
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,320
Is it really that hard to distinguish black and white?

906
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,520
Now, it's not just that others say you're black.

907
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,600
But you say you're white.

908
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,880
Who can judge?

909
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,520
You're the one who's white.

910
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,960
You're the one who's white.

911
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,360
You're the one who's white.

912
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,480
Who can judge?

913
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,000
You're the judge.

914
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,360
Judge?

915
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,400
Hello, Tang Dusha.

916
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,360
I'm Qin Yu.

917
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,760
I want to talk to you.

918
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:17,960
Okay.

919
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,400
I'm near your house.

920
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,640
Can we meet now?

921
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,040
Actually, we've always been very subjective

922
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,160
and think the judge must be the most fair.

923
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,960
Everything he said is true.

924
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,320
But if from the beginning,

925
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,080
everything he said is false,

926
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,880
and all wrong guidance?

927
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,640
You know what you're talking about, right?

928
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,560
I know. Of course I know.

929
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,920
I mean, if the judge is Qin Yu,

930
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,040
he guided us wrongly from the beginning,

931
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,880
then all the doubts can be solved.

932
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,800
gracias, every one.

933
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,160
the titleline is rules, constitution's ban, flimsy

934
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,280
silent magic tricks on Guanyi

935
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,400
cupping songs after murder

936
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,580
creating smoke in the urine

937
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,720
the time gasps, lights lilting

938
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,180
Television's

939
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,520
There's no one willing

940
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,060
to ask the cruel truth

941
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:39,240
I cannot choose, but my heart is weights

942
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:43,340
Looking for flat surface fans, but you alone know why

943
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:48,380
Rid inwardly Leon
