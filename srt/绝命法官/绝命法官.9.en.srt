00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,180
Two days later

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,600
Wei

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,720
What's wrong?

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,480
Nothing

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,480
Get in

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The King's Avatar

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Episode 18

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hold it.

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'll help you up.

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Slowly.

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Be careful of your head.

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is anti-virus.

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is anti-virus.

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Here.

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Eat some first.

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Are you okay?

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Wei, it seems that the bullets are still inside.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
How did you get shot?

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Really?

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And what's the car outside?

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
A batch of weapons.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I helped Qi Changrong to grab it.

23
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But I haven't said how to give it to him.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You really helped him to grab it?

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is too dangerous.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You still have a wife and children in your family.

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I did it for my wife and children.

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Now it's like this.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't you think you have no responsibility?

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't think so.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If I were this kind of person, you wouldn't come to me.

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
First, cut his wound.

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Here.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Be careful.

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yiwei, I have something to do today.

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I can't send you to school.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Do you want me to call a taxi for you?

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No, I'll take the bus.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Whose car is this?

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
My friend's.

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll drive it away later.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm late.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Go back to school.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Wei.

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Wei.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh, no.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I really have a fever.

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Hello.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't care who you are.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Tell Cao Wei'er.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's useless to hide.

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Wei.

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Wei.

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How is it?

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Can you hold it?

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Wei.

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You go to eat first.

58
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Grandma.

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Did something happen?

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Nothing.

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I just have something to ask you.

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Come on, sit down first.

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Someone just called you.

64
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Hello.

66
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm Cao Wei'er.

67
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You got it.

68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll give it to you today.

69
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Why didn't you give it to me yesterday?

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This thing is big.

71
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You ran around and died.

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I swear on my son.

73
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Everything is in my hands.

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll give you two hours.

75
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Send it to me now.

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Qi Changrong.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Should you tell me the truth?

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm in front of Shen Ming now.

79
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I promise your wife and child will be safe for the rest of their lives.

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I can tell you the truth.

81
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay.

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's enough.

83
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Wei.

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
How can you go like this?

85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He threatened me with my son.

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I can't just leave.

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I can't.

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But I installed a bomb at the bottom of the car.

89
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
He opened the back door and blew him up.

90
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't say anything.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll go.

92
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll go.

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I've been feeling a little weird lately.

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I guess your father had some trouble.

95
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I've never seen him like this.

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't think I'm wrong.

97
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He's in trouble.

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You know, my grandmother was a judge before.

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I've never seen anything like this.

100
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Your father must be threatened and even locked up.

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Wei.

102
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
If you know anything, you have to tell your grandmother.

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Do you know?

104
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't know.

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
My father never told me that.

106
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Qi Changrong is very suspicious.

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We can't let him know that we changed a person.

108
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let me know when you arrive.

109
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Or let me contact him.

110
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay.

111
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll send you to the hospital first and then come back to drive.

112
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I can't go to the hospital.

113
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
They can see that I'm shot.

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll die if I use the bullet to compare.

115
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But the bullet is still in your stomach.

116
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You won't die if you don't go to the hospital.

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm not going.

118
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You send the things first.

119
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You owe me this.

120
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You can't go back.

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What should I do?

122
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Wei, what are you doing?

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I didn't ask you to kill people.

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You should protect yourself.

125
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Did you encounter anything strange recently?

126
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
For example, did you receive any strange calls in the middle of the night?

127
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Or did you find that there were some strangers around your house?

128
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It seems like they were watching you.

129
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No.

130
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
No?

131
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No.

132
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
No.

133
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I still want you to stay in my house for a few days.

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
See what's going on.

135
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
No need.

136
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's not that serious.

137
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm not discussing with you now.

138
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Go home and pack your things and move to my house.

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But my dad...

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll explain to him where your dad is.

141
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Chief Qin, don't be afraid.

142
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm fine.

143
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm not afraid.

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Don't fall asleep. Keep talking to me.

145
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Talk?

146
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What should I talk about?

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I remember now.

148
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We were classmates in primary school.

149
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Actually, did you recognize me that day?

150
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Your honor,

151
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
as a police officer,

152
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I should know clearly about his responsibility to society,

153
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
including protecting the lives of the citizens.

154
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But the defendant broke the law

155
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and stole the money.

156
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It really has the expectations of the citizens and the public.

157
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I hope you can punish him severely.

158
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I know I'm not a criminal police officer who connects the Fenggong.

159
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But I've never done anything that kills and burns people.

160
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's because I don't do it that the party gets the money.

161
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
They framed me together

162
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and said I stole the money on the spot.

163
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The defendant was accused of breaking the law during the law enforcement.

164
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He stole the money.

165
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The evidence shows that

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
firstly,

167
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
there is no direct evidence to prove that the defendant stole the money.

168
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Secondly,

169
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
there is no direct evidence to prove that the defendant put the money in his car.

170
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The court's judgment is not based on a few words,

171
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
but on evidence.

172
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Therefore,

173
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I declare that

174
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
there is insufficient evidence to confirm that the thief's act

175
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and the defendant's charge are not true.

176
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Judge,

178
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
thank you for clearing my name.

179
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's not me.

180
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The law and evidence helped you.

181
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You didn't think that you'd be interrogated by another judge.

182
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The result is the same as now.

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't need to be imprisoned by the wrongdoer.

184
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I should thank you.

185
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Take care of yourself.

186
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Thank you.

187
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Actually, you...

188
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You always keep a low profile.

189
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Wei, are you okay?

190
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Wei.

191
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Wei.

192
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I...

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm fine.

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Although they stopped me in the end,

195
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
because of you,

196
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I didn't get jailed because of someone's wrongdoer.

197
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I still have to thank you.

198
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I know that

199
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
the gang harassed me later.

200
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You helped me out secretly.

201
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'll treat it as a favor.

202
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm still happy.

203
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
We can still be friends.

204
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's so honorable

205
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
to have a judge friend.

206
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But your judge friend

207
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
has done many bad things recently.

208
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
For my son,

209
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I have to do everything.

210
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Wei.

211
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I didn't expect it to be like this.

213
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
To be honest,

214
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
if it wasn't for you,

215
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I might still be in jail.

216
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's also because of you

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
that I ended up in Jintan.

218
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Should I turn it around

219
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
or lose?

220
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Hold on.

221
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'll settle this debt

222
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
when I come back.

223
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Don't sleep.

224
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Your father is at home.

225
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
He said he had something to do today.

226
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He probably didn't drive.

227
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Go upstairs and pack up.

228
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Grandma is waiting for you here.

229
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Go upstairs.

230
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Madam.

231
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I've been suspended for a month.

232
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The complaint team asked me

233
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
to ask questions.

234
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But I didn't get any answers.

235
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
They asked me if I could resume my job.

236
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
They should ask

237
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
if you can resume your job

238
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
and see for yourself.

239
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Madam, I've told you many times.

240
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Although I'm from the old city district,

241
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm also a police officer.

242
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Madam,

243
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Wait.

246
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I have a message from Qi Changrong.

247
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
They said Han Lie had the guts

248
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
to kill people in the old city.

249
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
He was just provoking the old city gang.

250
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Can you say something I don't know?

251
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Qi Changrong's men

252
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
are making a batch of military fire.

253
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
He said he would soon

254
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
put on a good show.

255
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Is the news reliable?

256
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You can check

257
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
which news was not released yesterday.

258
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'll report to you tomorrow.

259
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yes, madam.

260
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Thank you, madam.

261
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I've asked them.

262
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
There was a news

263
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
that was not released yesterday.

264
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Maybe it's because

265
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
it's a bit sensitive.

266
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's not sensitive.

267
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's embarrassing.

268
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Let's get to the point.

269
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It was a batch of military fire

270
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
that the customs officers made.

271
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
They should have put it in the warehouse

272
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
after the case was over.

273
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Unexpectedly,

274
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
someone robbed it when they were transporting it to the warehouse.

275
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The charge team

276
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
rushed to the scene to stop it.

277
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But the bandits threw a grenade

278
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and let it run away.

279
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
When did the military fire enter the warehouse?

280
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Ordinary people don't know.

281
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
There must be a mole.

282
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Not only that,

283
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
there are two boxes of guns

284
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and one box of yellow TNT explosives.

285
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
If this batch of military fire

286
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
is used to kill,

287
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
it's really something.

288
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Is there an investigation team

289
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
following up on this case?

290
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That's right.

291
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
If this case

292
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
is really related to Qi Changrong,

293
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
it's because he wanted to use

294
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Ma Shanbao's death

295
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
to declare war on the Han Kuilong.

296
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Are these two cases

297
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
related?

298
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Tang Qian.

299
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Tao.

300
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You're here just in time.

301
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I have something to report to you.

302
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You two go out first.

303
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yes, sir.

304
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes, sir.

305
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What's wrong?

306
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The internal investigation team is here.

307
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
They want to see you.

308
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'll listen to them.

309
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But I have no right to speak.

310
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'll go to the room.

311
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Okay.

312
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Okay.

313
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
This is Tang Xuan, Senior Investigator.

314
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
He's the Gu Baisheng of the Inner Investigation Department.

315
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Mr. Gu.

316
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Please sit.

317
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We arranged this meeting

318
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
because we have some questions.

319
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
We want to ask you to help us confirm.

320
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yes, sir.

321
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Let's get this clear before we start.

322
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Are you in charge of Ma Shanbao's case?

323
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes.

324
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Do you have any doubts?

325
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What do you mean?

326
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
We're from the Inner Investigation Department.

327
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What do you think?

328
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
We suspect that there's a mole in your team.

329
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Who do you suspect?

330
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What's the reason?

331
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
These two photos

332
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
were taken after Ma Shanbao was detained.

333
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Are you there?

334
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm not.

335
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Why was he injured?

336
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
According to the testimony of Liang Jie and Guo Hua,

337
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
he was arrested,

338
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and he was emotional.

339
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
He attacked the police.

340
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
The scars were caused by the arrest.

341
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
As far as I know,

342
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
he knew what happened,

343
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
so he didn't complain.

344
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yes.

345
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
He did not complain.

346
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What do you suspect?

347
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I've checked Guo Hua's background.

348
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
When he first joined the army,

349
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
he had a partner

350
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
who was promoted to the position

351
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
of gunman in the old city area.

352
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Since then,

353
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
he has used violence against the people of the old city gang more than once.

354
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What does this have to do with the Inner State?

355
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Ma Shanbao was attacked during interrogation.

356
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Let me say it again.

357
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Ma Shanbao's injuries

358
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
are not caused by interrogation.

359
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
No, no, no.

360
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You just need to answer me.

361
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Did anyone attack Ma Shanbao

362
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
within the territory of the police station?

363
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yes.

364
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Who?

365
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Guo Hua.

366
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But this doesn't mean he's the mole.

367
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Who did he sell the information to?

368
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
The gang of the Black Gang of the Han Kuilong?

369
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Do you have any evidence?

370
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I've sent two men to jail

371
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
because they wanted to collude with the Han family

372
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
against the old city gang.

373
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It doesn't matter.

374
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's better to use black to black.

375
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Maybe it's more convenient

376
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
than to catch those real gangsters.

377
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Say more, Lai Tingting.

378
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Lai Tingting.

379
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You don't need to record what he said just now.

380
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What are you doing?

381
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
What are you doing?

382
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What are you doing?

383
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm here to tell you.

384
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Come here.

385
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I want to tell you something.

386
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I want to tell you.

387
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Take good care of yourself.

388
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What?

389
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What?

390
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What?

391
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What's wrong?

392
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What?

393
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What?

394
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What?

395
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
What?

396
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What?

397
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What?

398
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
What?

399
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What?

400
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What?

401
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
What?

402
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,840
I'm sorry.

403
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,360
Do you know that Guo Hua has seen Han Lie?

404
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,680
Or I'll ask you the opposite.

405
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,640
Have you approved him

406
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,040
to contact Han Lie?

407
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,760
Even if they have seen him,

408
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,840
it may be because they need to investigate.

409
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,400
Of course.

410
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,680
Because criminals

411
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,920
usually collect information.

412
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,320
Do you think it's right, Tang Ducha?

413
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,160
Han Lie.

414
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,040
Were you there

415
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,240
at the scene of Han Gang's car accident?

416
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,080
I wasn't.

417
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,320
The person in charge of the scene

418
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,440
was the police officer of Guo Hua.

419
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,520
So,

420
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,800
he gave you the traffic accident report

421
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,680
and the witness report?

422
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,560
It should be Guo Hua and Liang Jie.

423
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,640
In your memory,

424
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,800
did the report mention

425
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,280
that a filth basin was found at the scene?

426
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,520
I have no memory.

427
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,840
Wait.

428
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,200
You have no memory?

429
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,280
You have no memory

430
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,680
that the report mentioned that filth basin?

431
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,360
Or

432
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,520
the report didn't mention that

433
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,560
the filth basin was found?

434
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,680
I know that a filth basin was found.

435
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,640
Then I handed it in for DNA testing.

436
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,000
Then why didn't the report

437
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,840
mention that?

438
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,360
I don't know.

439
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,320
I was careless.

440
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,160
Cancellous?

441
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,320
Or someone

442
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,640
deliberately hid

443
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,360
such an important evidence?

444
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,160
Why did you do that?

445
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,160
I don't know.

446
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,240
Maybe it's like what you said.

447
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
It's all black and white.

448
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,080
You deliberately

449
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,320
provoked the conflicts between the two gangs

450
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,560
and then took advantage of it.

451
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,280
Then you thought it was useless

452
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,400
and handed over the evidence.

453
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,560
These are all your speculations.

454
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,560
Do you have any evidence?

455
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
That's weird.

456
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,160
How did you get

457
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
that filth basin?

458
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,520
Anyway, he finally appeared

459
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,920
in the investigation result.

460
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,240
Anyway, he...

461
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,600
Who decided to transfer

462
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,560
Ma Shanbao to be a false witness?

463
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
His representative lawyer.

464
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
Yes.

465
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,400
He's the one who did it.

466
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
He's the one who did it.

467
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
He's the one who did it.

468
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
He's the one who did it.

469
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
He's the one who did it.

470
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
He's the one who did it.

471
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
So while everywhere

472
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,720
has a rule for people to follow,

473
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,340
taking advantage of this

474
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
will have more��고.

475
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
I don't think

476
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,160
Ma Shanbao and Huo Zhen now

477
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,280
are nanoscale evidence travelers.

478
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
You understand?

479
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,000
Of all this

480
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,080
they're the same proof?

481
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Cut it out.

482
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
There are so many himes.

483
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,160
This arrangement

484
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,080
to get out of the city

485
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,280
because he hopes that he can provide some information

486
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,400
and let us solve the case.

487
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,400
These are all our strategies to solve the case.

488
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,000
You should know that, right?

489
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,280
Yes.

490
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,360
We often use these strategies.

491
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
But we didn't break the rules.

492
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,720
Who else knows about

493
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,600
Ma Shanbao's outing from the city?

494
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,440
I, the judge,

495
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,080
the control officer,

496
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,520
his agent, the lawyer,

497
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,520
and...

498
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,160
Guo Hua.

499
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,480
My whole team

500
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,880
and my colleagues in charge of driving.

501
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,960
Many people.

502
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,640
Ma Shanbao's outing from the city

503
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,920
was suspected by

504
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,080
the gunman of the Han Kuilong

505
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,680
for less than half a day.

506
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,160
He killed the chief of the Tang Ducha.

507
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
So the key to the problem

508
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,920
is not whether the news was leaked.

509
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,640
Who leaked the news?

510
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,760
You're just making a biased guess.

511
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,200
You can't just make a guess

512
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,000
and say that Guo Hua is the mole.

513
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,640
Who says that?

514
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,160
Tao�ędzie?

515
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,560
That day,

516
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,600
about after 3 in the morning,

517
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,000
I made an order

518
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
to check the footage.

519
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,280
I always thought it was Guo Hua

520
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,920
before watching it.

521
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,880
It didn't.

522
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:57,220
Or that Ye Wei allied with the

523
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:04,040
pour

524
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,460
Enter the

525
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,620
I want to

526
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,620
Why is it so quiet over there?

527
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,900
Wei, don't play tricks on me.

528
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,700
I'm in the toilet.

529
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,420
There are three people.

530
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,740
I'll let you know when I get there.

531
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,740
If you have watched the entire video,

532
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,380
you should have seen it by now.

533
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,060
I refused that gift.

534
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,060
Why did Han Lie

535
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,500
give you such an expensive gift?

536
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,700
That watch is worth more than ten thousand.

537
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,300
I don't know.

538
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,460
What do you think?

539
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,380
Who targeted you?

540
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,740
Tell me. Who framed you?

541
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,140
Maybe you should ask

542
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,860
who suggested

543
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,340
the surveillance video?

544
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,420
Maybe after you find this person,

545
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,860
you'll know who gave the information

546
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,020
to the Han family.

547
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,900
The Han family?

548
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,660
You went to the prison to see Han Kuilong.

549
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,300
And it was more than once, right?

550
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,700
Everyone knows

551
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,820
that even if Han Kuilong is in prison,

552
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,220
as long as he says a word,

553
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,100
everything will be in chaos.

554
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,980
I went to him to tell him

555
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,820
that I can let him see his son.

556
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,220
But the condition is

557
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,460
that he has to give us time

558
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,940
to investigate the real murderer of the car accident.

559
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,940
Don't interfere again.

560
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,940
Don't use your private life

561
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,340
to kill innocent people.

562
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,100
How can we explain the incident

563
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,900
when Xu Xiong was hit by a car

564
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,540
in the old city gang?

565
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,540
Ma Shanbao was killed.

566
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,620
That's not a crime.

567
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,980
Ma Shanbao was killed.

568
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,140
That's not an interference.

569
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,260
That's not an innocent

570
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,460
by using his private life.

571
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,140
I want to ask

572
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,740
if it's an official interrogation now.

573
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,460
Who are you going to testify for?

574
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,940
Do you have any evidence?

575
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,060
Tang Xue.

576
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,620
We received a lawyer's complaint.

577
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,100
He wants to report you.

578
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,260
Chou Lu.

579
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,380
The complainant claimed

580
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,860
that Ma Shanbao once said

581
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,060
that he was stealing a car

582
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,060
in another place

583
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,260
when the accident happened.

584
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,900
He claimed that you knew

585
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,180
that there was such an important evidence

586
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,540
but you didn't go to investigate it immediately.

587
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,820
All criminals will think of

588
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,620
thousands of reasons

589
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,860
to commit suicide in order to make themselves atonement.

590
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,180
I have to think about it

591
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,180
and find out who is the real murderer.

592
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,580
You've been looking for three days.

593
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,180
Who set the fire and burned the car?

594
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,100
I want to know that too.

595
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,100
Who leaked the news

596
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,940
to his accomplice Xiaobei

597
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,940
and made him disappear?

598
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,740
If I didn't sit here

599
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,740
and waste my time,

600
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,420
I'm not sure

601
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,380
if I'm the one who did it.

602
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,420
I don't know.

603
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,940
I didn't even hear my name.

604
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,580
I just want to know

605
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,580
how long you can keep asking.

606
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,780
I'll wait until I'm satisfied.

607
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,540
Did you arrive?

608
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,180
I just entered

609
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,340
the deserted street.

610
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,100
Turn left and you'll see it up ahead.

611
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,300
Wei.

612
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,580
Can we blow up

613
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,460
the army?

614
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,420
Or what should we do?

615
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,020
You know that

616
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,860
this army

617
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,940
will kill many of them, right?

618
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,020
We definitely

619
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,420
have to take care of such a doctor.

620
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,860
We'll him together as well.

621
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,780
Then...

622
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,740
Then what about this woman?

623
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,180
How should we take her to called the house estos forcing area?

624
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,460
We must get rid of him.

625
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,940
Only then can we

626
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,820
completely

627
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,300
solve the case of A'bao.

628
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,460
Only then will the kids and Shao Sha be safe.

629
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,580
Ji Changrong, call me.

630
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,820
I'll call you later.

631
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,420
Hello?

632
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,580
Are you there?

633
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,020
Come over in ten minutes.

634
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,140
No need.

635
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,420
I'll be there soon.

636
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,300
Hello?

637
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,380
Hurry and leave.

638
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,740
Ji Changrong will be there soon.

639
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,900
Don't move, don't run!

640
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,540
It doesn't matter.

641
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,460
Why do you let him destroy your house?

642
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,300
He didn't take me Makes no difference

643
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,660
Now I'll backleg

644
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,660
Don't Asia

645
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,780
This is not my home

646
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,860
Where to go

647
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,220
destroy

648
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,060
You came prepared from the beginning.

649
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,020
The target is not Guo Hua.

650
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,180
It's me from the beginning.

651
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,580
You have an inappropriate connection

652
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,940
with Han Lie and Han Kuilong.

653
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,860
You just said that

654
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,140
there was no leak

655
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,260
before Ma Shanbao was killed.

656
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,380
Or you can say that

657
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,780
during the investigation,

658
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,860
when the confidential information

659
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,820
kept leaking,

660
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,180
you didn't implement any plan

661
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,260
to explain this matter.

662
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,700
You need to answer this question.

663
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,380
Mr. Tang.

664
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,980
Can I make a suggestion?

665
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,100
Tang Xuan

666
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,980
will take a vacation

667
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,300
to replace his temporary job.

668
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,340
During that period,

669
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,300
he can come back

670
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,180
to take your case at any time.

671
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:07,940
Xu Yan, how can you say that

672
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,860
it's your business?

673
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,700
Anyway, my request is

674
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,180
during my interrogation,

675
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:12,860
you can't

676
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,620
take Ma Shanbao's case again.

677
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,620
Okay. Okay.

678
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,100
I will supervise it myself.

679
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,100
Today,

680
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,900
it's like this.

681
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,740
I'll leave you to home.

682
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,580
ledger.

683
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,620
Qiutong.

684
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,020
Why are you here?

685
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,340
Grandma wants me to go to her house

686
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,940
The security is not good.

687
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,660
The car was stolen for no reason.

688
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,940
I want Weiwei to live in my house for a few days.

689
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,100
You went to the school to find her

690
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,580
three days ago.

691
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,260
Now you want to take her away.

692
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Can we discuss it

693
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
peacefully?

694
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,260
No need to discuss.

695
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,500
I'm worried about her.

696
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,180
No.

697
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,100
Stop arguing.

698
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,500
Grandma, go back first.

699
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,460
I'll find you.

700
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,260
No.

701
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,540
You can live in my house for a few days.

702
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,100
Okay.

703
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,300
I'll go in two days, okay?

704
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:26,820
Weiwei.

705
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,540
Weiwei.

706
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,420
Dad, what happened to you?

707
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,460
Are you okay?

708
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,780
Why is there blood in the bathroom?

709
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,620
Are you afraid?

710
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,580
I...

711
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,780
Are you okay?

712
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,900
I'm fine.

713
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,500
Why is someone hiding here?

714
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,340
Call uncle.

715
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,980
Kid.

716
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,100
You have to pay for your mistakes.

717
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,460
She is also involved in the car accident?

718
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,100
Everything is related to the car accident.

719
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,340
Send her to the hospital.

720
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,580
Send her to the hospital.

721
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,100
The police will find out.

722
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,580
What should we do?

723
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,700
What are you doing?

724
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,700
Call your wife.

725
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:23,940
Mr. Hu.

726
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,300
I'm sorry.

727
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,380
Sorry to trouble you.

728
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,060
Who gave you that spray gun?

729
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,220
I guessed it.

730
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,900
There is only one person.

731
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,220
Shi Zhiyang, right?

732
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,780
I know because of the fight.

733
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,140
You have some opinions about Zhiyang.

734
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,020
But in the spray gun case,

735
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,420
he just wanted to help me find the real murderer.

736
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,180
So the position is the same as that of Han Kuilong.

737
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,020
It's reasonable.

738
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,140
It doesn't matter how I see him.

739
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,580
Because I believe

740
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,260
he won't hurt his girlfriend.

741
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,420
As for the lawyer,

742
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,660
he wants you to be responsible for Ma Shanbao's death.

743
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,180
Even if he just wants it,

744
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,180
there is no reason.

745
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,300
Because of the leaked news,

746
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,340
Ma Shanbao died.

747
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,140
This is the fact.

748
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,460
It's normal for him to be angry with me.

749
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,660
The leaked news is the most important problem.

750
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,660
Who did it?

751
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,260
Why?

752
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,860
You must find the answer.

753
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,660
Not for them,

754
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,140
but for yourself.

755
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,100
Anyway, you haven't had a holiday for a long time.

756
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,540
Just relax.

757
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,780
Sometimes I think

758
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,500
you can be an outsider.

759
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,300
You can see things more clearly.

760
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,180
Wait.

761
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,220
What's up?

762
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,540
There was an explosion in the old city.

763
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,420
The evidence shows

764
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,780
it's related to the last military fire.

765
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,260
I'm the victim.

766
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,180
Why do you arrest me?

767
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,980
You bastard!

768
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,740
Wait.

769
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,020
You covered Han Lie

770
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,340
and came to the old city to fight.

771
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,420
You didn't arrest him

772
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,740
and didn't care about the bomb.

773
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,820
What kind of police are you?

774
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,940
You're a murderer.

775
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,500
If you say more, I'll accuse you of slander.

776
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,940
You dare to touch me?

777
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,220
The whole old city won't let you go.

778
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,020
Take him in.

779
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,700
Go.

780
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,500
Go.

781
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,100
Madam, you'll be the judge.

782
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,940
You and your sister will be released from now on.

783
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,540
I'll be in charge of this case.

784
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,300
What's up, Mrs. Shi?

785
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,540
You're a intelligence officer.

786
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,740
You received the news so quickly.

787
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,540
It's rare for you to take a vacation.

788
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,980
I'm so grateful to the internal investigation department.

789
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,180
Can you take a vacation?

790
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,940
I don't have a holiday.

791
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,300
But if you stay at home,

792
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,580
I'll be more at ease.

793
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,020
You can comfort me.

794
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,740
My case is also very troublesome.

795
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,380
Is Liu Mao's case going well?

796
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,260
Yes.

797
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,340
We found the person.

798
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,980
We only have half a life left.

799
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,500
I don't know if we can hold on.

800
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,780
I can't ask anything.

801
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,540
Let's go.

802
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,140
Leave this sad place quickly.

803
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,020
You drive your car.

804
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,500
I drive my car.

805
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,820
Old place.

806
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,700
See you.

807
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,220
Wei.

808
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,380
Wei.

809
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,100
He's having a fever.

810
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,020
Yes.

811
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,580
We need to send him to the hospital right away.

812
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,420
Tell the police that

813
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,900
he was shot by a gun.

814
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,540
It often happens in old city districts.

815
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,940
He's been unconscious for so long here.

816
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,900
You're asking me to send him to the hospital now.

817
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,740
Does it have nothing to do with you?

818
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,180
It has nothing to do with me.

819
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,820
It's my fault.

820
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,060
You made him like this, right?

821
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,940
Let's send him to the hospital first, okay?

822
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,900
Let's send him to the hospital first, okay?

823
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:22,940
Wei's business.

824
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,140
It's none of your business.

825
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,580
Come on.

826
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,300
Come with me.

827
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,060
Let's go.

828
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,060
Let's go.

829
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,700
I don't need your help.

830
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,500
Come on.

831
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,420
Xiao Qing.

832
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,180
Let's go.

833
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,420
Xiao Qing.

834
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,820
Xiao Qing.

835
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,660
Yes.

836
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,300
Good.

837
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,340
Good.

838
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,340
Thank you.

839
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,780
Come here as soon as possible.

840
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,340
How is it?

841
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,100
What did Peng say?

842
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,820
Will he come?

843
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,180
He can only come tomorrow.

844
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,620
He asked me to

845
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,700
use alcohol to help him.

846
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,020
Then wait for tomorrow.

847
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,300
Wei,

848
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,820
wait a little longer.

849
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,180
Peng will come tomorrow.

850
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,100
He will help you

851
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,260
to take out the bullets.

852
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,860
You will be fine.

853
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,220
Come on.

854
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,580
You prepared so much food.

855
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,500
It seems that only two of us

856
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,860
are fed with pig.

857
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,500
Strictly speaking, you are the pig.

858
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,940
I am specially used to feed

859
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,500
you, the pig, with Chinese cabbage.

860
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,420
Why are you Chinese cabbage?

861
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,940
Because pigs love Chinese cabbage.

862
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,580
You are the pig.

863
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,540
That's right.

864
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,420
I am a precious pig.

865
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,180
Miss,

866
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,100
I only feed my favorite pig.

867
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,180
Not everyone can eat it.

868
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,020
Thank you.

869
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,100
Forget it.

870
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,060
I won't drink.

871
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,740
Your soul will come back.

872
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,580
But please.

873
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,700
Give me back your body.

874
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,100
What for?

875
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,380
To wash the dishes.

876
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,540
What do you want to do?

877
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,660
I can do it.

878
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,460
Sorry.

879
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,020
I really can't do it tonight.

880
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,940
Okay, I'll let you go.

881
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,780
Anyway,

882
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,020
you don't have to worry about

883
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,180
the internal investigation department.

884
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,300
Your problem can be solved.

885
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,020
But I want to tell you that

886
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,140
sometimes it's not a bad thing

887
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,340
to go to some gray areas.

888
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,380
It depends on what your intention is.

889
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,660
Is it really that hard to distinguish black and white?

890
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,100
Now, it's not just that

891
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,100
others say you are black.

892
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,060
But you say you are white.

893
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,300
Who can judge?

894
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,620
You ask the judge to judge.

895
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,100
Judge?

896
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,220
Hello, Tang Dusha.

897
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,140
I am Qin Yu.

898
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,540
I want to talk to you again.

899
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:17,860
Okay.

900
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,300
I'm right near your house.

901
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,460
Can we meet now?

902
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,740
Actually, we've always been

903
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,060
very subjective.

904
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,940
The judge must be the most fair.

905
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,740
Everything he said is true.

906
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,980
But if from the beginning,

907
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,100
everything he said is all false,

908
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,620
all wrong guidance?

909
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,660
You know what you're talking about, right?

910
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,340
I know. Of course I know.

911
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,700
I mean,

912
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,860
if the judge is Qin Yu,

913
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,980
he guided us wrongly from the beginning.

914
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,500
Then all the doubts can be settled.

915
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,980
The time

916
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,940
is like a fire burning,

917
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,740
every moment is like

918
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,100
a fire

919
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,340
burning,

920
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,580
the heart

921
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,500
is like a fire burning,

922
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,380
the heart is like a fire burning,

923
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,060
the heart is like a fire burning,

924
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,300
the heart is like a fire burning,

925
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,300
the heart is like a fire burning,

926
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,060
the heart is like a fire burning,

927
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:47,300
then the heart is like a fire burning.

928
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,220
then the heart is like a fire burning,

929
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,180
the heart is like a fire burning,

930
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,220
the heart is like a fire burning,

931
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,580
the heart is like a fire burning,

932
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,900
the heart is like a fire burning,

933
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,300
the heart is like a fire burning,

934
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,260
then the heart is like a fire burning,

935
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,940
the heart is like a fire burning.

936
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,860
We are listening for authorities,

937
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,860
I'm so tired of pushing my feet to the side

938
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,860
Why can't I look back?

939
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,860
I can't stop looking back

940
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,860
I think you're more miserable

941
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:29,860
The road is long, good days are short

942
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:33,860
But I hope my heart is in peace

943
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:34,860
I don't know if I can be a good man

944
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,860
I don't know if I can be a good man

945
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,860
Looking at the peaceful people

946
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:45,860
But I'm so tired of pushing my feet to the side

947
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,860
Why can't I look back?

948
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,860
I can't stop looking back

949
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,860
I think you're more miserable

950
00:46:54,860 --> 00:47:00,860
The road is long, good days are short

951
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:04,860
But I hope my heart is in peace

952
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:15,860
Thanks for watching!
