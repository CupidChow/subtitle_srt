1
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,800
Brother, you know,

2
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,600
that woman is an outsider.

3
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,920
She has no idea how things work.

4
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,920
Or she wouldn't dare steal my contract.

5
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,120
I told her

6
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,680
our whole family

7
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,600
has been in the garment business

8
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,280
for decades.

9
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,280
Think about our dad,

10
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,520
and you, my brothers.

11
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,120
I told her to ask around.

12
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,880
here in Lucheng City,

13
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,039
anyone in this business

14
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,440
knows our family.

15
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,160
How dare she steal my contract!

16
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,920
Getting that contract

17
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,560
would be a piece of cake for you.

18
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,280
Yeah.

19
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,919
This is our signature dish, the

20
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,280
world-famous Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

21
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,000
Shall I serve it for you?

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,640
Please do.

23
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,320
Okay.

24
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,320
Brother,

25
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,800
this is authentic,

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,520
sells for 2,999 yuan.

27
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,720
Usually, I would never

28
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,240
order this.

29
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,440
But today,

30
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,680
we're all getting to enjoy this thanks to you.

31
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,560
Sis, say thank you to your third brother.

32
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,400
Thank you.

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,680
Actually, if we're talking about thanks,

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,200
we should thank Kaiyang.

35
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,640
Right?

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,280
Yes, thanks to Kaiyang.

37
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,280
Today's dinner is for

38
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,600
welcoming Kaiyang home.

39
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,320
Serve it first to

40
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,120
the young man back from abroad.

41
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,880
How's Grandma been lately?

42
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,480
She's fine.

43
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,200
Kaiyang,

44
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,960
you're living with Grandma now.

45
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,920
Make sure you

46
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,160
remind her often

47
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,360
to keep her diabetes

48
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
under control.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,480
Your grandma can be difficult.

50
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,040
You'll have to look after her.

51
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,840
Grandma's had diabetes

52
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,520
for over ten years.

53
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,520
I remember it clearly.

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,600
That year,

55
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,280
she moved to Lucheng City with you.

56
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,600
I had

57
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,960
just given birth to your cousin.

58
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,720
I asked your grandma

59
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,360
if she could

60
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,520
help me look after the baby.

61
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,800
And you know what she said?

62
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,520
"No. I'm diabetic."

63
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,360
So, Kaiyang,

64
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,800
among all the kids

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,840
in our family,

66
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,800
you're the luckiest.

67
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:30,560
Only you

68
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,840
were raised by Grandma.

69
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
The other kids,

70
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,800
she didn't take care of any.

71
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,600
I was a handful as a kid.

72
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,320
She was busy with me,

73
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,440
so she couldn't handle my siblings.

74
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,920
Guess that's on me.

75
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,440
Excuse me,

76
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,079
all dishes have been served.

77
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,640
Enjoy your meal.

78
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,120
Great, thanks.

79
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,720
Brother,

80
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,800
no outsider's around now.

81
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's talk about what's really going on.

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
All dishes are here.

83
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,640
Let's eat.

84
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,120
Go ahead.

85
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,240
Dig in.

86
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,800
Go ahead.

87
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,320
Don't be shy.

88
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,760
Try the crispy duck.

89
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,120
Eat.

90
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,200
So, how did it go

91
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,560
with the lawyer this morning?

92
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,160
I was just about to bring that up.

93
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
The lawyer said my dad should

94
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,400
return the illegal gains as soon as possible

95
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,640
in exchange for a lighter sentence.

96
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,120
He's pretty experienced

97
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,080
with cases like this.

98
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,720
As for the lawyer's fee,

99
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,120
I can pay it myself.

100
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
But for the

101
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,960
bail money...

102
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,720
Kaiyang,

103
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,760
the reason I,

104
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,680
your second uncle, and aunt

105
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,320
asked you out today is

106
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,120
to make things clear

107
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,360
to avoid

108
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,520
any misunderstandings.

109
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,640
Okay?

110
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,320
I recall you didn't finish

111
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,880
college, right?

112
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,840
Now

113
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,480
you're back in China,

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and as your elders,

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,320
we can't just not help.

116
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,240
Yeah.

117
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,680
If you want a factory job,

118
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,400
just say the word,

119
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,840
we'll get you

120
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
a decent position.

121
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,880
Absolutely.

122
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,840
The pay isn't great,

123
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,160
but it's enough to live on.

124
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,760
No, I mean, I...

125
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,920
For the money

126
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,000
for my parents...

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,320
I hope you all can...

128
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,920
[Okay, okay.]

129
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
[Let me put it straight,]

130
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,360
[he is too soft-spoken]

131
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:22,800
[and too embarrassed]

132
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,680
[to turn you down.]

133
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,040
[About your dad,]

134
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,360
[us siblings]

135
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,480
[don't not]

136
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,000
[want to help,]

137
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,720
but we can't.

138
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,760
Kaiyang, let me be frank.

139
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,680
I have zero

140
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,000
cash flow.

141
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,600
My zipper factory

142
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,440
has been struggling these past few years.

143
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,159
Last year, I had to bite the bullet

144
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:42,960
and upgrade

145
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,800
the machinery.

146
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,880
And now I'm

147
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,840
in debt up to my ears.

148
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,600
Last quarter,

149
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,080
I supplied a batch to

150
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,280
your dad's company.

151
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,280
Still haven't been paid.

152
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,159
Looks like that money's...

153
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,480
Well, we're family.

154
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,440
Let's not get into it.

155
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,120
Payments were always settled on delivery.

156
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,720
And for the machinery upgrade,

157
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,080
didn't my dad front you the money?

158
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,440
I need money to run my factory.

159
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,760
That money from your dad

160
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,840
wasn't even that much.

161
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,360
Kaiyang,

162
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,680
you've been abroad for years.

163
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,040
You don't get

164
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,720
how things are done here.

165
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,640
Your father and us,

166
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,680
we're done with business.

167
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,200
Yeah.

168
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,080
If there's any

169
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,240
dealings at all,

170
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,040
they have nothing to do

171
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,200
with our family ties.

172
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,520
Business stuff

173
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,320
is handled by the staff.

174
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,200
Your dad drifting apart

175
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,080
from the three of us,

176
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,520
there was a reason for that.

177
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,120
You're still young.

178
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,800
There are things you don't know.

179
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,920
Back then,

180
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,560
your grandpa

181
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,320
left his entire inheritance

182
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,400
to your dad alone.

183
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,520
The three of us?

184
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,040
We had to build everything from the ground up.

185
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,400
I shouldn't really

186
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,960
tell you this, but

187
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,800
your dad,

188
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,560
he's just

189
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,520
a real piece of work.

190
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,720
He never treated us like his own flesh and blood.

191
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,120
Other older brothers

192
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,080
would do anything

193
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,000
to help their younger brothers and sisters

194
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,240
get ahead.

195
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,080
But your dad?

196
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,960
Even at his peak,

197
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,120
we never saw

198
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,920
any of the benefits.

199
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,360
But my dad lent you money.

200
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,040
When you first

201
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,720
went into raw materials,

202
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,080
your shipment was lost.

203
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,040
You were about to mortgage your house.

204
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,280
My dad bailed you out, didn't he?

205
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,280
Yeah.

206
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,560
Yeah, he did.

207
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,720
But he charged me

208
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,720
2% monthly interest.

209
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,000
Even higher than

210
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,320
a bank mortgage!

211
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,480
And I should thank him for

212
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
not letting me

213
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,560
mortgage the house?

214
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,960
But if I had

215
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,960
mortgaged the house,

216
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,360
don't you think

217
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,000
I would've pulled through?

218
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,440
Besides,

219
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,320
I repaid the principal

220
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,560
and interest

221
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,920
in less than a year.

222
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,120
How can you hold a grudge

223
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,600
over something so small for 20 years?

224
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,360
Why can't you just get over it?

225
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,520
20 years!

226
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,720
And we're supposed to be brothers!

227
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,600
Hey.

228
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,680
Alright, calm down.

229
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,400
You always lose it whenever money is brought up.

230
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,520
Have some water.

231
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,400
We're family. We should be getting along.

232
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,120
Kaiyang.

233
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
I don't want to bad-mouth your dad,

234
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,680
but what he did,

235
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,560
it just wasn't right.

236
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,920
Guys, calm down.

237
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,480
Let's eat.

238
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,200
Let's eat. Hey,

239
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,240
brother, you haven't

240
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,400
touched these dishes.

241
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,799
I'll ask them to reheat it.

242
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't bother.

243
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,039
Kaiyang,

244
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,800
sorry for

245
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,840
losing my temper.

246
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,560
To put it plainly,

247
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,200
you know what

248
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,240
business families are like.

249
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,520
It's all for show.

250
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,640
What your dad did this time,

251
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,920
it's just too big.

252
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,480
Blame us if you want.

253
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,720
We honestly can't help.

254
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,240
Please don't hate us for it.

255
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,600
Okay, okay.

256
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,720
Family's family, let's drop it.

257
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,880
On behalf

258
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,880
of my father,

259
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,240
I apologize to

260
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,880
you all,

261
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,160
sorry, I'll drink this as an apology.

262
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,760
You don't have to down it like that.

263
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,600
You don't have to do this.

264
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,240
Kaiyang.

265
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,440
Where are you going?

266
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,240
Wait, don't go.

267
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,120
Come on, sit down.

268
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,880
Don't go.

269
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,920
Kaiyang.

270
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,400
Sir, have you finished your meal?

271
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,280
Yes.

272
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,160
Could you please

273
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,280
give me your license plate number?

274
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,760
I'll have someone

275
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,840
bring your car around.

276
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,880
Did you see me drive here?

277
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,920
My apologies.

278
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,760
Shall I call you

279
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,640
a ride instead?

280
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,320
No need.

281
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,000
Kaiyang.

282
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,160
wait!

283
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,760
Come here.

284
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,160
Come.

285
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,640
Come on.

286
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,240
Here, take this.

287
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
Take it.

288
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,840
Put it away.

289
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,000
Listen,

290
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,280
Grandma doesn't have a pension.

291
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,520
She lives on

292
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,840
the money Grandpa left her.

293
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,560
Not much.

294
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,680
Be sensible.

295
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,160
Don't just live off

296
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
Grandma's money,

297
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,080
okay?

298
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,080
Don't be a fool.

299
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,640
I have my pride, you know.

300
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,560
Keep it. I'm leaving.

301
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,920
Come here, Happy.

302
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,000
You've got diabetes,

303
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,600
shouldn't eat this.

304
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,320
Have you seen a doctor?

305
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,680
Got checked up?

306
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,840
Since when do you talk so much?

307
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,360
Got any more of that batter?

308
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,120
Weren't you having

309
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,240
a fancy dinner with them?

310
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,320
Just pretend I'm going through a growth spurt

311
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,160
and I'm starving, okay?

312
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,280
It's in the pot, serve yourself.

313
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,840
Did you

314
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,920
pull the plug on the landline?

315
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,640
I didn't.

316
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,400
Aunt said she wanted to visit

317
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,520
but couldn't get through.

318
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,000
So she couldn't come.

319
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,640
If she really wanted to visit,

320
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,280
she could come even without a call.

321
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,480
I've got enough on my plate.

322
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,200
I don't have time for their act.

323
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,360
What are you so busy with?

324
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,400
I've got a flock of pigeons to look after,

325
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,880
and now you on top of that.

326
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,200
So you tell me.

327
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,880
Whatever you say.

328
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,920
I checked with the bank this morning.

329
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,040
Your Canada transfer's arrived.

330
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
The guy there said

331
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,000
withdrawals require an appointment.

332
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,520
Made one for tomorrow morning.

333
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,520
Since you're so busy,

334
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,560
I'll go myself tomorrow.

335
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Is it enough for the lawyer fees?

336
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,480
Yes.

337
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,240
If not, I've got

338
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
no extra money for you.

339
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,480
I said yes.

340
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,360
I'll transfer the leftover to you.

341
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,280
Use it for living expenses.

342
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,440
Aunt asked me to give this to you.

343
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,800
Putting on a front.

344
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,080
No sign of him.

345
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,880
It's so hot.

346
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,680
Maybe he's not working today?

347
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,840
Tell the client

348
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,200
I'm running late.

349
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,520
I left some documents at the office.

350
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,200
Kuang Dazhi!

351
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
What are you doing?

352
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,920
What do you mean?

353
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,840
Don't recognize me?

354
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Don't play dumb!

355
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,880
Let go of me!

356
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,840
I'll call the police!

357
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,880
Stop shouting.

358
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,960
Give me back my lawyer's fee!

359
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,880
What now?

360
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,600
Where are you going?

361
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,240
Can't help you.

362
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,520
I'm not taking on any Canadian clients.

363
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,240
What?

364
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,920
Don't push me.

365
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,440
Let go! Let go!

366
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,920
I said don't push me.

367
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,680
Don't make me

368
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,160
cause a scene in front of all these people.

369
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,400
Let go, will you?

370
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,160
Don't push me!

371
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,000
Wait...

372
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,840
You bastard!

373
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,960
I'm gone for a few days on a business trip

374
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,120
and you're already with someone else?

375
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,520
You broke up with me!

376
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,680
What are you doing? Stop it!

377
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,320
What's wrong?

378
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,560
Aren't you ashamed?

379
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,760
Give me back the fee.

380
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,600
Will you or not?

381
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,800
Everyone, look at this guy!

382
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,960
What a scumbag!

383
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,840
Show your face.

384
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,720
He even hit me!

385
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,600
This is domestic abuse!

386
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,720
Post this online!

387
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,560
What are you doing?

388
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,160
Calling the police.

389
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,320
Fine! Let's settle this

390
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,640
at the station.

391
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,080
You're unbelievable.

392
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,200
Scumbag!

393
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,880
Look at this jerk!

394
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,600
Fine, let's go.

395
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:45,920
Yeah.

396
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,880
Bye, we're leaving.

397
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,360
Just a reminder.

398
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,200
Yes, officer?

399
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,920
As overseas Chinese, you should

400
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,800
respect and abide by our laws.

401
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,680
Yes, yes.

402
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,960
And a man must take responsibility.

403
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,000
Debts must be repaid.

404
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,960
That's only right, isn't it?

405
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,200
Causing a scene at the police station,

406
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,680
how embarrassing.

407
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,360
Absolutely right.

408
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,920
Officer, your advice is spot-on.

409
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,359
I've been on the straight

410
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,200
and narrow all my life,

411
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,400
never thought I'd mess up

412
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,359
over such a trifle.

413
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,599
Total mistake.

414
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,280
I'll definitely refund the fee.

415
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,560
Definitely.

416
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,079
Now's the time.

417
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes, now. Here.

418
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,720
Scan me.

419
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:26,960
Got it?

420
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,440
Yeah.

421
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:27,960
Good.

422
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Thank you, officer.

423
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,200
Learn from your mistakes.

424
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,440
Stay away from jerks.

425
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,320
Don't fall for it again.

426
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,800
Will do, thanks for your time.

427
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,120
Hear that?

428
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,760
What the officer said

429
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,640
was so on point.

430
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,680
Learn from your mistakes.

431
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,120
If not for this incident,

432
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,000
Stop babbling.

433
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,760
how could you improve?

434
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,400
Wait.

435
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,280
What now?

436
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,280
You have to help me

437
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,720
explain to the Canadian side

438
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,800
that I was wrongfully accused

439
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,680
so I can go back to Canada.

440
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,760
Miss, you're too naive.

441
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,640
You broke the law.

442
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,240
You definitely can't go back.

443
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,600
I lied to you before.

444
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,200
But in this situation,

445
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,560
I have no reason to lie anymore.

446
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,360
Fine, Mr. Kuang.

447
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,360
Not going to help?

448
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,840
One report from me,

449
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,000
and your Canadian

450
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,120
law license is gone.

451
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,920
Let's just talk rationally.

452
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,960
Stop threatening me,

453
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,680
alright?

454
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,400
Didn't I refund

455
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,600
your lawyer fees?

456
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,920
Put that phone away.

457
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,560
Stop.

458
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
Don't touch me!

459
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,080
Get off.

460
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:31,880
Okay, okay!

461
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,560
Let's talk this through, okay?

462
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,080
You really can't go back.

463
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,280
How about this.

464
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,920
I'll try to

465
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,560
refund your guarantee fee.

466
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
Will you believe me then?

467
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,280
Don't you

468
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,480
get that

469
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,880
this is shady?

470
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,640
Getting your money back

471
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,040
is cutting your losses.

472
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,840
Miss Lu,

473
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,360
you should

474
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
make plans here in China.

475
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,480
What do you think?

476
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:00,880
Send it.

477
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,760
Bad luck.

478
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,560
Ran into a nutcase.

479
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,480
Gotta pay her some emotional damages.

480
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,600
Watch your mouth.

481
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,600
Listen,

482
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,960
my life is a mess right now

483
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,400
all because of you.

484
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,240
I can't even go back to Canada.

485
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,200
You seem quite good.

486
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,360
What's your problem?

487
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
No offense.

488
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,640
Take care.

489
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,800
See you.

490
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,640
What now?

491
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,440
Is Ge Kaiyang

492
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,760
on it with you?

493
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,520
Ge Kaiyang.

494
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,760
Who's that?

495
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,600
Never mind, you can go.

496
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,000
Bye.

497
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,880
So this is the rich kid

498
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,040
who scammed you?

499
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,760
I think he's just

500
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,040
posing as a rich kid

501
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,120
to scam people.

502
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,680
Also,

503
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,160
he's not very bright.

504
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,000
He was definitely used

505
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,720
by that lawyer.

506
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,040
He said he's from Lucheng City.

507
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,200
Keep an eye out for him.

508
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,560
If you see him,

509
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,840
tackle him right away.

510
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,880
Contact me immediately.

511
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,600
How could you trust a scammer like that?

512
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,960
He's definitely not from Lucheng City.

513
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,160
And why are you still keeping his photo?

514
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,200
Just delete it.

515
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,960
I can't delete it. No way.

516
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,560
You can't let go of him, is that it?

517
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,400
What are you talking about?

518
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,360
It's evidence, okay?

519
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,040
[I'm keeping it to settle the score]

520
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,200
[and show the police.]

521
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,840
Oh, evidence, huh?

522
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,280
Don't listen, don't look.

523
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,320
You're ridiculous.

524
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,360
Hey, are you sure

525
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,520
you want to stay here tonight?

526
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,000
Come crash at my place.

527
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,880
That is just too much.

528
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,320
You'll never sleep.

529
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,760
If I go to your place,

530
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,120
your mom will call my mom

531
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,880
800 times a day.

532
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,160
What if she slips up?

533
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,560
I'll just

534
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,160
tell her.

535
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,280
Give her a heads-up.

536
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,560
Don't laugh.

537
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,360
Hurry, hurry,

538
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,640
my mom's video-calling.

539
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,280
Come on.

540
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:32,920
Where am I supposed to go?

541
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,000
Go over there and stay put.

542
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,120
Mom.

543
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,360
Xinying,

544
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,880
why didn't you pick up?

545
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,360
My phone

546
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,920
was on silent.

547
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
I didn't hear it.

548
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,320
So here's the thing.

549
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
I met someone

550
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,960
in the Chinese community

551
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,240
in Canada.

552
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,320
This woman

553
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,960
is loaded.

554
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,480
[Their situation]

555
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
[is like this:]

556
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,520
[she travels all the time on business,]

557
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,440
[and]

558
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,720
[they've got a big dog at home.]

559
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,880
A golden retriever,

560
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
super sweet,

561
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,040
very gentle.

562
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,240
And I was thinking,

563
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,040
maybe you could

564
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,560
help her walk the dog sometimes,

565
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,960
feed it and all that.

566
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,600
You know, over time,

567
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,120
you build a relationship.

568
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,920
[You get what I mean?]

569
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,600
Mom,

570
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,840
I'm already exhausted from work.

571
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,080
You're trying to burn me out

572
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,400
walking somebody else's dog?

573
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,640
Just treat it like exercise.

574
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,040
Get up a bit earlier.

575
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
Listen, Xinying,

576
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,320
you need to spend time with people

577
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,760
who are better off than you.

578
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,000
That's how you

579
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,680
improve yourself.

580
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,960
But

581
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,040
think about it:

582
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,480
if I

583
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,960
take her dog out

584
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,600
and nothing happens, fine.

585
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,200
But if it gets bumped

586
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,000
or hurt somehow,

587
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,960
then that connection is gone,

588
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,560
right? Forget it.

589
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,120
Well...

590
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,000
that's not totally wrong.

591
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,400
But it's not that dramatic either.

592
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,840
[It's just walking a dog.]

593
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,080
[It'll be fine.]

594
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,560
[I'm telling you,]

595
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,600
[this woman]

596
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,720
[has wide connections in Canada.]

597
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,480
Sometimes

598
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,600
I regret not taking you

599
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,440
to Canada earlier.

600
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,480
Then we wouldn't be

601
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,920
so short on contacts now.

602
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,880
Your network

603
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,360
is your lifetime wealth.

604
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,800
Mom,

605
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,520
what kind of network

606
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,120
are you getting from walking her dog?

607
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,000
[You never know.]

608
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,040
You really can't predict it.

609
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,520
One day you might need that connection.

610
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,800
And she's definitely better than

611
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,240
[that Li Manfei, right?]

612
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,440
[Think about it,]

613
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,360
[what can she do for you?]

614
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:46,880
Mom.

615
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,560
[At most you buy her]

616
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,080
Mom.

617
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,120
[a Canada Goose coat.]

618
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,200
[She and her mom are exactly the same.]

619
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,280
[You can see]

620
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,960
[their whole life at a glance.]

621
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,040
I'm...

622
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,720
I'm hanging up now, okay?

623
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,600
Talk later.

624
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,080
Manfei, Manfei.

625
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,040
I'm so sorry,

626
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,280
my mom's out of her mind.

627
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,080
She really doesn't know how to talk.

628
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,160
Please don't be mad.

629
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,800
It's fine,

630
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,960
I'm not mad.

631
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,040
She's not wrong, either.

632
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,280
I'm just worried about you.

633
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,680
If you keep making things up like this,

634
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,520
one day you won't be able to keep it up.

635
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,560
What else can I do?

636
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,120
I'll drag it out one day at a time.

637
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,080
What about your life, though?

638
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,960
You can't

639
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,920
stay here forever.

640
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,120
Maybe

641
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,160
start by finding a job?

642
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,480
Just help me keep this secret for now.

643
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,280
[I'll look for work.]

644
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,600
Your resume looks great,

645
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,000
[but with expectations]

646
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,040
like yours,

647
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,360
I'm afraid we can't meet your demands.

648
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,000
[You know how the job market]

649
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,160
[and the economy are right now.]

650
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,240
[Landing a position]

651
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,320
[at a company of our size]

652
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
[is already pretty good.]

653
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,240
I know.

654
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,600
That's why your company

655
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,720
is my first choice.

656
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,000
And I get

657
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,280
that overseas degrees

658
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,520
aren't that special anymore.

659
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,080
That's why I kept my salary expectations

660
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,640
pretty reasonable,

661
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,280
right?

662
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,560
Living costs

663
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,160
are high.

664
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,400
I still have to rent a place,

665
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,280
right?

666
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,960
I feel like what I'm asking

667
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,440
is just average.

668
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,760
Aren't you a local here?

669
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,360
Why would you need to rent?

670
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,240
Shouldn't

671
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
my salary

672
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,480
be based on

673
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,880
my skills?

674
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,080
What does being local or

675
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,640
owning an apartment have to do with it?

676
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,240
[Don't come out.]

677
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,280
[It's pouring out here.]

678
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,360
[All right, I've got something to do,]

679
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,280
[I'll talk to you later. Bye.]

680
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,840
[Sorry about that.]

681
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,440
[I had to grab that call.]

682
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,080
Last four

683
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,040
digits 5151, right?

684
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,920
Please fasten your seat belt.

685
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,760
We're heading out.

686
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,240
This rain is insane.

687
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,600
[There are tissues in the back.]

688
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,040
[I'm counting.]

689
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,000
[Ten,]

690
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,960
[nine,]

691
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,920
[eight,]

692
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,160
[seven,]

693
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,720
six,

694
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,920
five, four, three, two, one.

695
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,200
Ready or not?

696
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,560
Getting smarter this time, huh?

697
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,800
Not answering me.

698
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,200
Even if you don't answer,

699
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,360
I still know where you're hiding.

700
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,920
Lu Xinying?

701
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,200
This time you hid too well.

702
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,480
I really can't find you.

703
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,400
Who's this?

704
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,680
Where could she be?

705
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,520
This one?

706
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,920
Even Dad can't find you,

707
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,800
so I guess I have to give up.

708
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,440
Where did you go, huh?

709
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,920
Xinying?

710
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,640
Daddy,

711
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,240
I caught you!

712
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,160
You caught me.

713
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,600
You're amazing.

714
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,960
You even know how to set a trap now,

715
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,800
huh?

716
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,240
You're so clever.

717
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,160
Okay, next round.

718
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,400
What do we play?

719
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,680
Let's play again.

720
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,960
Again?

721
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,560
Need to switch turns?

722
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,960
You've reached your destination.

723
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,680
Please remember to...

724
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,840
[What is it, sweetheart?]

725
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,080
[Texting this early?]

726
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,840
[You get up early.]

727
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:22,960
[Got it,]

728
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,560
Dad knows what you're hinting at.

729
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,800
About renting the car

730
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,720
like you mentioned last time,

731
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,280
no problem.

732
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,720
[Next month]

733
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,560
[I'll transfer you]

734
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,200
[a bit extra.]

735
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,360
[But]

736
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,520
[we can't tell your mom]

737
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,480
[about this yet, okay?]

738
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,600
What's this thing?

739
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,120
[Hello?]

740
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,040
Dad.

741
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,840
[Where are you?]

742
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,200
I

743
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,640
just woke up.

744
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,840
I'm about to head out.

745
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,400
[I just picked up a resume.]

746
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,400
[This girl,]

747
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,480
[her age, name, education,]

748
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
[all exactly the same as yours.]

749
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,840
[Even the work experience]

750
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,600
[in Canada is identical.]

751
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,320
[Isn't that something?]

752
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,120
[Let's video call.]

753
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,920
[Tell me where you are, I'll come.]

754
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,400
I'll send you my location.

755
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:20,800
Dad.

756
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,560
I thought the next time we saw each other

757
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,760
would be in Toronto.

758
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,520
Are you going to let me in?

759
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,520
This is your Toronto?

760
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,800
Tell me.

761
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,000
How long have you been back?

762
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,680
Already out job hunting.

763
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,320
Be honest with me.

764
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,280
What's really going on?

765
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,440
I promise I won't lose my temper.

766
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,920
Come on, tell me...

767
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,720
Dad, what are you doing?

768
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:39,720
Dad!

769
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,520
Open the door!

770
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,720
Open up!

771
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,840
- Dad!
- Open up!

772
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,800
What are you doing?

773
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,840
Who are you,

774
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,240
old man?

775
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:51,920
Why are you pounding on my door?

776
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,680
You crazy or what?

777
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,440
Watch your mouth.

778
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,360
Dad!

779
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,080
He hit me!

780
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,080
Does it hurt?

781
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:11,960
I'm fine.

782
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,440
Look at you,

783
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,760
actually getting into a fight.

784
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,280
Good thing they were willing

785
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,600
to settle at the station.

786
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,760
I haven't even started on you yet

787
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,320
and you're already lecturing me.

788
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,480
No, not this one.

789
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,239
Too flashy. That's for kids.

790
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,520
No.

791
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,280
Let it breathe, it'll heal faster.

792
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,199
It's pouring outside.

793
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,320
If it gets wet, it'll get infected.

794
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
Come on, stick it on.

795
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,320
Stick it on.

796
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,280
Just one.

797
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,000
There.

798
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,000
This is for little kids.

799
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,120
The year when you went to Canada,

800
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,160
you were about this tall.

801
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,080
[I took you]

802
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,720
and your mom to the airport.

803
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,760
After baggage check-in,

804
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,320
you still

805
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,120
had that huge backpack on,

806
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,720
bigger than you were.

807
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,120
Big suitcase in your left hand,

808
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,520
another bag in your right,

809
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,040
swaying along.

810
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,400
We said goodbye three, four times

811
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:24,920
and you still wouldn't leave.

812
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,320
I told your mom,

813
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,880
"You have to go through security."

814
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,760
I watched you two walk in.

815
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
Two steps,

816
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,800
then you turned and looked back at me.

817
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,800
Two more steps,

818
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,080
look back again.

819
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,400
That scene,

820
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,040
it's still

821
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,640
right here in front of my eyes.

822
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,800
You lied to me.

823
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,760
You said

824
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,920
you'd come to Canada

825
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,720
every Chinese New Year.

826
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,560
But you missed my high school graduation,

827
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,800
and my college graduation too.

828
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,480
Do you know how expensive

829
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,160
those round-trip tickets are?

830
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,880
There are better ways to use that money.

831
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,720
Besides, you and your mom

832
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,440
were in Canada,

833
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,760
you got expenses to cover.

834
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,120
Dad, that day,

835
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,600
[when I saw you,]

836
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,360
I almost didn't recognize you.

837
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,280
You had so much white hair.

838
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,560
Every time we video call,

839
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,080
you switch it to voice

840
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,960
and won't turn the camera on.

841
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,200
I barely recognized your face anymore.

842
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,560
Don't cry, Dad.

843
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:05,960
Why

844
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,600
are you driving ride-hail now?

845
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,760
Want something to eat?

846
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,560
I'll grab us a snack.

847
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,080
Come on,

848
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,520
just grab something.

849
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,920
I never would've guessed

850
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,360
that after more than ten years,

851
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,560
our first reunion would be

852
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,160
over convenience-store oden.

853
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,320
Dad,

854
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,200
I

855
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,040
lost that bank job

856
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,160
in Canada.

857
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,600
It's okay.

858
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,680
I lost my job too, didn't I?

859
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,040
But you came back

860
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,320
without a word,

861
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,680
stayed in some budget hotel.

862
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,640
Why sneak back like that?

863
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,320
I didn't love that place.

864
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,520
Do you have any idea

865
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,280
how hard your mom and I worked

866
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,440
to send you there to study?

867
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,120
We practically worked ourselves to death.

868
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,120
Dad...

869
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,520
And

870
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:35,840
you were there

871
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,560
all those years.

872
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,800
You even bought a place.

873
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,240
Then you just say "I don't like it"

874
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,240
and run back?

875
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,840
Don't you think that's a bit rash?

876
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,800
[It's not rash.]

877
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,880
[Staying in Canada]

878
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,440
[comes down to a lottery. Pure luck,]

879
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,640
[not effort.]

880
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,320
[I want a life where]

881
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,360
[hard work actually leads to something.]

882
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,680
Dad, you say you understand me,

883
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,440
but you've never

884
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,640
really let me make a decision.

885
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,240
Just this once,

886
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,640
can you?

887
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,720
Let me stay here in China,

888
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,440
and you go convince Mom.

889
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,600
Please?

890
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,080
I get it. I really do.

891
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,520
[But]

892
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,480
talking to your mom about this...

893
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,400
That's going to be tough.

894
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,160
[You see,]

895
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,440
[it's]

896
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,960
[not that simple.]

897
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,280
Once you let

898
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,280
the arrow fly,

899
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,440
there's no taking it back.

900
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,120
I don't want to be the arrow anymore.

901
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,960
Why can't I be the one

902
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,280
holding the bow?

903
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:39,920
[What if,]

904
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,080
[after a while,]

905
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,800
you just

906
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,840
get used to it there?

907
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,920
Dad, it's been ten years.

908
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,840
If I could adapt, I would've by now.

909
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,240
Okay, I hear you.

910
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,000
What about

911
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,480
your work visa renewal?

912
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,480
I hired a lawyer.

913
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,520
A third party is handling it now.

914
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,560
All right.

915
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,040
How long

916
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,920
have you been driving?

917
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,560
Not long.

918
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,400
Half a year...

919
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,040
A bit more.

920
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,400
[It's fine.]

921
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,280
Dad,

922
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,960
you've had a hard time too.

923
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,000
Hard?

924
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:54,880
We understand each other.

925
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,280
That's what matters.

926
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,200
But this stays

927
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,240
between us.

928
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,600
Your mom can't know yet.

929
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,240
[I'll think about]

930
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,560
[how to slowly]

931
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,520
[get it across to her,]

932
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,120
[ease her into it.]

933
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,600
[In that moment,]

934
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,760
[I wanted to tell him everything.]

935
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,160
[But looking into his eyes,]

936
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,520
[the words just wouldn't come out.]

937
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,360
[So]

938
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,920
[I put all the refunded lawyer fees]

939
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,600
[and guarantor money]

940
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,640
[onto a separate bank card,]

941
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,520
[and no matter how hard things get,]

942
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,800
[I won't touch a cent of it.]

943
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,880
[I decided from now on]

944
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,440
[I'm going to be the one holding the bow.]

945
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,320
[Earn my own living,]

946
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,760
[carry my own weight,]

947
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,520
[stop being a burden to my parents,]

948
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,400
[find a job,]

949
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,160
[and take charge of my own future.]

950
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,280
[Zhaocai, why didn't you]

951
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,840
[go out and fly again today?]

952
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,960
[You can't just sit at home like this,]

953
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,880
[you'll be useless before long.]

954
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,560
[Look

955
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,080
look how fat you've gotten.]

956
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,560
All right, all right.

957
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,760
Even a bird

958
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,280
knows it has to go out

959
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,040
and find its own food.

960
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,560
Some people

961
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,200
aren't even as good as a bird.

962
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,760
You're too old to be cursing.

963
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,880
So you're not asleep.

964
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,680
I'll pay you for my living expenses.

965
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,680
[It's not about money.]

966
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,000
[You need to get out and work.]

967
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:31,960
[I dropped out halfway,]

968
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,160
I don't even have a degree.

969
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,040
Who's going to hire me?

970
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,560
Plenty of people never graduated.

971
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,400
Are they all just lying at home

972
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,240
waiting to be fed?

973
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,720
Why are you so mean?

974
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,960
Did my dad pick that up from you?

975
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,760
If you're alive, you should work.

976
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,200
My pigeons

977
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,360
have food and water,

978
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,520
but they still have to go out and fly.

979
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,040
Eating, drinking, pooping and loafing,

980
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,880
is that even living?

981
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:14,920
[Alive,]

982
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,200
[sitting up here on the rooftop,]

983
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:18,920
[surrounded by pigeons]

984
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,600
[that work harder than I do.]

985
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,600
[What a joke.]

986
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,120
[I never wanted to admit it,]

987
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,520
[but I probably can't get rid of]

988
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,880
[the "rich second gen" label.]

989
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,400
[Living off my parents' money,]

990
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,680
[never thinking about]

991
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,840
[taking responsibility for myself.]

992
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,240
[And now]

993
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,280
[I realize I have nothing of my own.]

994
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,240
[Yeah,]

995
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,360
[I lie around every day.]

996
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,400
[Does that count as living?]

997
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,960
[I've been running away,]

998
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,800
[from responsibility,]

999
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,520
[from the future.]

1000
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,040
[It's time to wake up]

1001
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,320
[and face it.]

1002
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,360
I'm almost there.

1003
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,240
[Falling from the heights]

1004
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,000
[showed me what real life looks like.]

1005
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,880
One second, please.

1006
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,120
[All the fake halo is gone.]

1007
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,960
Sorry about that.

1008
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,720
[I'm starting to see]

1009
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,320
[that only I]

1010
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,840
[can give my life meaning.]

1011
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,400
[Maybe]

1012
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,400
[it's time to stand up]

1013
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,880
[and face the world.]

1014
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,160
[When I do stage plays,]

1015
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:16,720
[I can never write]

1016
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,760
[dialogue this good.]

1017
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,440
Hello, Ms. Zhou?

1018
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,200
Give me ten minutes.

1019
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:57,920
Okay.
