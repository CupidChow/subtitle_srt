1
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,800
Today, I'm thrilled

2
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,520
to introduce my dog Naonao to you!

3
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,120
He's a good boy.

4
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,640
Come on. Handshake.

5
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,360
Give me your hand.

6
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,720
Handshake.

7
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,640
Come on. Handshake.

8
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,400
Handshake, Naonao.

9
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,920
Another cute thing

10
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,520
about Naonao is...

11
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,320
Thanks to your Naonao.

12
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,920
He's very smart.

13
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,760
Ran told me he's very cooperative.

14
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,160
Sit.

15
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,639
Come here.

16
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,680
Sit.

17
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Be quiet. Sit.

18
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,600
Naonao, sit.

19
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,600
Didn't she work

20
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,640
as a TV host?

21
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,079
Why did she start live-streaming?

22
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,960
We don't understand

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,880
young people these days.

24
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,600
Guys,

25
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,480
mark my words.

26
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,720
Choice matters more than effort.

27
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,560
Do you think the winners

28
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,800
are all-around geniuses?

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,160
No!

30
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,640
Most of them are people

31
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,880
who dare to take a chance.

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,000
I have a friend named Yuan,

33
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,960
who was

34
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,079
a nobody

35
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,680
in the workplace.

36
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,280
No, that's not the line.

37
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:45,880
But,

38
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,320
she strove

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,360
to be

40
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,280
the best...

41
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,120
[Handshake.]

42
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,040
[Sit.]

43
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,480
Naonao, sit.

44
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,760
Naonao, sit.

45
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,400
Naonao, sit.

46
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,760
Stop.

47
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:06,800
Sit.

48
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,360
Handshake.

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,720
Handshake.

50
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,040
Handshake.

51
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,880
Handshake.

52
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,920
Good boy.

53
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,120
You can do it.

54
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,360
You can do it.

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,960
But it's useless.

56
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,520
Nobody wants to watch you do this.

57
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,000
They want to see the dog.

58
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,440
So she went from rags to riches.

59
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,040
The conclusion

60
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,640
is

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,079
the course of one's life

62
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,680
has little to do with

63
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,960
his personal ability.

64
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,560
Go to sleep already.

65
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,760
What?

66
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,160
What animal do they

67
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,360
want you to show now?

68
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,440
Handshake.

69
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,240
Sit.

70
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,640
Good boy.

71
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,960
[Can't you just be human?]

72
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,640
Stand. Sit. Up.

73
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,680
You're acting weird.

74
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,880
Yudong, I'm screwed.

75
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,920
The video views just won't increase.

76
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,680
How about this?

77
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,600
You raise a pig

78
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,399
and teach it to sit.

79
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,760
Sit.

80
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,200
It learns.

81
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,120
Handshake.

82
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,960
It learns.

83
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,160
- Then you're the master.
- Good boy.

84
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,680
Time out.

85
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,480
I quit.

86
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,600
Sleep time.

87
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,920
Yeah.

88
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,080
Let me tell you,

89
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,960
the ginkgo in Canada

90
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,400
is particularly pure.

91
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,159
It's good for your brain,

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,880
said Xinying.

93
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,080
Eat as soon as possible,

94
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,840
and it will benefit

95
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,080
your health in the future.

96
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,000
Have you had it yet?

97
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,560
It's still a bit early for me.

98
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,400
You're so confident.

99
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,680
Aiying,

100
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,040
check this out.

101
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,680
I can check it when we get home.

102
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,600
It's time to cook.

103
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,320
Just have a look at it.

104
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,200
Isn't it embarrassing?

105
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,000
Morning.

106
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,760
Ran has

107
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,400
received a higher education.

108
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,200
She used to work

109
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,159
as a TV host.

110
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,120
What on earth is she doing now?

111
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,040
She must have

112
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,480
her reasons for doing it.

113
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,200
What kind of reason is that?

114
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,680
Do you remember

115
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,120
what she told us before?

116
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,360
She said

117
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,040
she was enjoying the life in Canada.

118
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,320
But actually, she worked as a personal shopper.

119
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,920
Well, there's

120
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,320
no shame in returning home

121
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,520
if she's not doing well abroad.

122
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,640
She can find a steady job here,

123
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,440
right?

124
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,480
At least it'd be decent.

125
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,200
Lu Ming has

126
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,720
connections.

127
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,160
If she asks,

128
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,280
her uncle-in-law will definitely help.

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,360
What is she doing now?

130
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,920
Playing dumb?

131
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,920
You're going too far.

132
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,760
How can you say she's playing dumb?

133
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,920
You think it's easy

134
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,200
that everyone can do that?

135
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,480
At least the advertisers buy it.

136
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,240
Seriously!

137
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,080
She earns her living through honest labor.

138
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,120
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

139
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,480
You are being unfair.

140
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,200
Don't

141
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,400
judge her

142
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,080
with your

143
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,960
bourgeois mindset!

144
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,960
Unbelievable!

145
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,120
I just don't care for your nonsense.

146
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,680
You're going too far.

147
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,000
Don't just leave!

148
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,760
My phone!

149
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,000
What's the big deal?

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,800
Just leave.

151
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,640
Take this away.

152
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,120
I don't want it.

153
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,840
Your brain needs it

154
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,720
more than mine.

155
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,360
What do you mean?

156
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,080
Every time I go to the market,

157
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,480
I have to avoid Daddy Liu. As soon as he

158
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,680
spots me from afar, he calls out

159
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,360
to me, wanting to give me gifts.

160
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,400
I feel so embarrassed.

161
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,440
It's just that

162
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,080
their kid Liu Bo works for Ran.

163
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,960
No need to thank me.

164
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,720
Okay.

165
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,400
Is Liu Bo doing well?

166
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,720
Yeah.

167
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,320
This soup

168
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,080
looks

169
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,560
very well-made.

170
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,560
Ran, I'll get you some.

171
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,640
I saw it.

172
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
I'm working on it.

173
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,760
Don't give me soup. I'll skip it.

174
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,400
Honey, check this.

175
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,080
Look.

176
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,360
I followed him,

177
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,240
and he followed back.

178
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,680
But why aren't we mutuals?

179
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,080
Did he unfollow you?

180
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,920
Why did he unfollow me?

181
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,080
He's just followed me!

182
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,600
Why?

183
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,040
He only followed me for a second!

184
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,200
Don't check your phone while eating.

185
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,320
Bo.

186
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,640
How did the Commerce reply?

187
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,680
Will he assign work to us?

188
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,480
What did he say?

189
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,520
[Ran, Mr. Liu from Commerce]

190
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,000
[said the ROAS of your]

191
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,480
[latest ads weren't so good.]

192
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,960
[The clients weren't happy about them.]

193
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,200
How could he say that?

194
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,360
Did you show him our data?

195
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
Did he see it clearly?

196
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,280
Zhang Ran,

197
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,200
I'm talking to you.

198
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,760
Don't check your phone while eating.

199
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,560
Mom, I'm working.

200
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,320
So what?

201
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,400
I've worked for 40 years

202
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,600
and never acted like this.

203
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,120
You think you're so great?

204
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,000
I brought you

205
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,840
into this world.

206
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,280
Not this again, will you?

207
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,160
Yeah, you brought this

208
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,480
eight-pound infant here, but it doesn't

209
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,080
mean you can

210
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,960
control her forever.

211
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,920
I've made it perfectly clear.

212
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,880
I'm not playing. I'm working.

213
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,440
Please be more understanding.

214
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
Eight pounds at birth?

215
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,360
You were so heavy.

216
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,240
Thank you, mom.

217
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,000
I can't understand.

218
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,920
Are you the President?

219
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,880
Does the world come to a standstill

220
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,800
during a twenty-minute

221
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,360
lunch break without your phone?

222
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,320
Am I wrong to tell you

223
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,400
to focus on eating?

224
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,480
Being right doesn't mean you have to do it.

225
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,400
What?

226
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,080
Who am I?

227
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,000
What am I to you?

228
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,720
Your nanny or your assistant?

229
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,600
I put so much effort into preparing this meal.

230
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,000
For such a long time,

231
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,280
I've provided you with room and board.

232
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,520
Now you're blaming me?

233
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,720
Alright, it's all my fault.

234
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,000
Out of sight, out of mind.

235
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,400
I'm going out to work.

236
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
You just can't stop

237
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,600
complaining about

238
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,160
my things.

239
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,920
Mom, don't get mad.

240
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,440
I'll talk to her.

241
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,800
How could you talk to mom like that?

242
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,240
She's my mom!

243
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,800
She uses her phone to work.

244
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
What's your reason

245
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,520
staring at your phone while eating?

246
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,040
That's enough.

247
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,760
You're going too far.

248
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
No one listens

249
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,520
to me anyway,

250
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,680
including you.

251
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,120
No one!

252
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,720
We should now rent a place

253
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,240
and move out.

254
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,760
I can't stand it.

255
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,480
I did the math.

256
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,720
If we withdraw the money from the bank

257
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,000
in Canada and exchange it for RMB,

258
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,760
it should be enough to keep us going for a while.

259
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,880
I'm fine with it.

260
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,840
It's just that a short-term lease

261
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,640
for only a few months

262
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,720
can be hard to come by.

263
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,960
Anyway, we

264
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,200
agreed to give it a try

265
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,960
for a year back here.

266
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,360
We can still head back to Canada.

267
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,120
We can just talk it over

268
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,480
with the landlord

269
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,360
about the lease.

270
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,480
I don't see the problem.

271
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,000
Do you remember?

272
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,680
I said you're different from before.

273
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
I don't know whether

274
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:57,840
it was

275
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,000
after you met Yuan Yuan

276
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,080
or after you returned China.

277
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,040
Now, you're like

278
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,720
a fish that's taken the bait.

279
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
You won't let go

280
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,360
for just a little bait.

281
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,200
I know you signed

282
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,880
a three-year contract.

283
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,600
I saw it.

284
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,720
When did you see it?

285
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,160
Why didn't you tell me?

286
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,120
No wonder

287
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,280
you've been

288
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,520
sarcastic with me lately.

289
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,040
I never wanted a long contract.

290
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,840
I only found out

291
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,440
after I returned that I had to sign it.

292
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,360
It is a three-year

293
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,000
development

294
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,080
program.

295
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,640
I'm under so much pressure.

296
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,640
I've swallowed my pride,

297
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,520
but the results

298
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,200
are still terrible.

299
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,920
Everyone is pressuring me,

300
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:39,960
and you're

301
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,160
no better than them.

302
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,360
I know how much

303
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,120
you value this job.

304
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,240
You don't. You know nothing.

305
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,520
I never meant to pressure you

306
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,560
to go back to Canada, okay?

307
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,480
Then what do you mean?

308
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,080
I just think that

309
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,520
no matter what you're thinking,

310
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,560
you can discuss it with me.

311
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,520
If you ask,

312
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
I'll give it all

313
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
just for you.

314
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,480
I'm always here.

315
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,600
But you must believe me.

316
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,760
You can't keep

317
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,840
hiding things from me.

318
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,160
Then you should ask me

319
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,120
to tell you everything.

320
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,840
You can't just

321
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,080
beat about the bush.

322
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:08,920
I thought

323
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,040
you'd refuse to tell me.

324
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,880
I just don't know how to tell you.

325
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,160
Anyway,

326
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
I stop agonizing over it.

327
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,440
If you decide

328
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,360
to strive for your career,

329
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,080
I will definitely support you

330
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,320
wholeheartedly.

331
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,160
That's true.

332
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,400
From the day

333
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,720
I decided to return China with you,

334
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,360
I made up my mind.

335
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,840
As long as I can be with you,

336
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,840
whether you want to be

337
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,520
an internet

338
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
celebrity in China

339
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,280
or on Mars,

340
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,080
I'll be right there.

341
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,680
Do you really think so?

342
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,200
Yes.

343
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,960
You should have said that earlier.

344
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,880
I was acting like a mad dog.

345
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,880
Did you just want to see me like that?

346
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,160
You just wanted to see it.

347
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,120
I'm sorry.

348
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,640
It's my fault.

349
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,120
How could you be wrong?

350
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,480
Aren't you the best person?

351
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,280
What?

352
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
What are you spacing out for?

353
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,800
Are we still

354
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,560
renting a place?

355
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,280
You're the boss.

356
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,440
Don't be so clingy like

357
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,280
a piece of gum.

358
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,600
What?

359
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,160
You're a piece of soft tofu.

360
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,800
I'm warm as soy milk.

361
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,480
You're soy pulp.

362
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,800
So annoying.

363
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,640
You didn't tell me

364
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,280
if you are happy

365
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,840
after you came back.

366
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,840
As long as you're happy.

367
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,040
Isn't my

368
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,240
own clothing just fine?

369
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,960
Why do I have to dress like this?

370
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,080
Alright. It fits you pretty well.

371
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,400
We're going to meet with the investor.

372
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,480
Your clothes

373
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,000
are only fine for flea markets.

374
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,480
Do you know who Xing Kai is?

375
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,080
Never heard of him.

376
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,000
He invests in the Spring of Green

377
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,040
and the Highlight.

378
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,480
Did

379
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,200
you even read the files I gave you?

380
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:25,960
Is that

381
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,600
"Three-Year IPO"

382
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,160
and "The Miracle of Domestic Brands"?

383
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,880
Take it.

384
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,680
What is it?

385
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,520
I prepared it for you.

386
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,520
Let's go.

387
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,800
Where did you get that photo?

388
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,760
It's so ugly!

389
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,720
I edited it.

390
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,760
Yudong, do you have gum?

391
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,160
No,

392
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,120
I don't have bad breath.

393
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
Why? Did you fart?

394
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,920
Cheng Man

395
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,000
put some imported cheese

396
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,720
she

397
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,760
bought a couple

398
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,120
days ago into my lunch

399
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,840
salad.

400
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,720
My mouth smells

401
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,760
like stinky socks now.

402
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,760
Come smell it.

403
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,480
Can you smell it?

404
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,520
No.

405
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,120
Really?

406
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,520
Really.

407
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,040
Then don't avoid.

408
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,160
It's fine?

409
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,320
You have salad for lunch?

410
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
Cheng Man told me

411
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,800
that Carbohydrates can trigger

412
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,520
inflammation.

413
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,560
See?

414
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,720
This is called

415
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,920
scientific feeding.

416
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,840
Good. You had too much meat.

417
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,320
Occasional salad is good for you.

418
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,720
Only when it's occasional.

419
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,120
I now need to eat salad

420
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,040
for lunch every day,

421
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,400
which adds up to 3650 meals a decade.

422
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,520
That's not occasional.

423
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,320
A decade.

424
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,040
As if you eat

425
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,200
at home every single day.

426
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,440
It's still over 2000

427
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,840
even after subtracting.

428
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,080
Do you know what kind

429
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,520
of sound I make when I snore?

430
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,640
Talk less.

431
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,599
What?

432
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,800
Why do you keep fanning?

433
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,800
It's hot here.

434
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,119
Does it really stink?

435
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,119
No.

436
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,680
Really?

437
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,359
Really.

438
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,160
Really?

439
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
I don't lie to you.

440
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Let's leave.

441
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,200
Don't rush.

442
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,440
I feel like Xing Kai

443
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,080
is about to meet with us.

444
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
You said that

445
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,160
three hours ago.

446
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,880
This is a kind of contest.

447
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
He is testing our patience.

448
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,640
Just a moment more.

449
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,360
I can feel it.

450
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,000
Almost there.

451
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,160
He's about to give in.

452
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,280
You're like an old turtle.

453
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,880
I've turned it

454
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
countless times.

455
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,680
We'll wait for one

456
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,160
last round. If he doesn't come,

457
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
the fool will stay.

458
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
You said the same thing

459
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,720
when you turned it last time.

460
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,440
No.

461
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,280
I said, a fool

462
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,600
like you will stay.

463
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,920
Where are his manners?

464
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,480
How could he

465
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,680
keep people waiting so long?

466
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,360
Dr. Fu.

467
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,160
You got

468
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,040
your doctoral diploma

469
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,400
in 2013.

470
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,560
Graduated at twenty-eight?

471
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,840
You're amazing!

472
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,320
I was in a combined master's

473
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,880
and doctoral program, so I finished faster.

474
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,640
You're something else!

475
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,880
So, for past ten years since graduation,

476
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,120
have you been pursuing scholarship?

477
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,840
You don't have

478
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,920
any work experiences

479
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,800
after graduation?

480
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,880
It's complicated...

481
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,840
For the past ten years,

482
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,240
I've been taking care

483
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,280
of my family.

484
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,320
I wasn't working.

485
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,160
Taking care of the family?

486
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,760
What a model for men in the new era!

487
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,040
You're a great man!

488
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,400
My wife used to be

489
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,920
a TV host.

490
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,520
She has hosted

491
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
the financial program,

492
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,080
Today's Financial Interview.

493
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,920
Do you know it?

494
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,040
Of course.

495
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,600
I was even on that show.

496
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,640
I know the host.

497
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,400
It's Yuan Yuan, right?

498
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,800
Is she your wife?

499
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,240
I thought she married to a venture capitalist.

500
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,040
No.

501
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,240
It's the previous host.

502
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,520
Lin Fei?

503
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,600
It's Zhang Ran.

504
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,800
The Ran for rising sun.

505
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,400
What a beautiful view you have here!

506
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,240
Yeah.

507
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,920
Dr. Fu is in charge

508
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,680
of the technology for our project,

509
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,880
so you have

510
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,000
absolutely

511
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,880
nothing to worry about.

512
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,280
Alright.

513
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,920
Well, I'll

514
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,480
speak plainly then.

515
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,480
Please.

516
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,040
To be honest,

517
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,840
my interest lies

518
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,080
not in this project

519
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,360
but

520
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,320
in Dr. Fu himself.

521
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,560
Dr. Fu,

522
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,760
if you're interested,

523
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,720
you're welcome to join our company.

524
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,000
Zhang Ran.

525
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,640
The company

526
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,800
will suspend

527
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
all your business activities.

528
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,320
Your last ad

529
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,200
barely got 100 likes.

530
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,160
We can't accept it.

531
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,400
I see.

532
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,320
Zhang Ran.

533
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,480
People's interest

534
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,880
in your image as a Desperate Personal Shopper

535
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,800
has gradually waned.

536
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,320
I think you need to

537
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,120
find a new way forward.

538
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,920
Right?

539
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,200
I believe you can do it.

540
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,680
You need to work harder to

541
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,320
find a breakthrough point.

542
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,360
Content is king

543
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,640
in our industry.

544
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,520
If you still can't find a new way out,

545
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,440
the company

546
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,480
won't provide you

547
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,440
with any more resources.

548
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,600
Okay.

549
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,600
Zhang Ran.

550
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,080
I've seen so many streamers.

551
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,480
I really

552
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,920
care about you.

553
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,280
I went through all that trouble,

554
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,320
messaging

555
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,280
and calling you constantly,

556
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,440
getting you here

557
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,080
from Canada.

558
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,840
I truly believed in you.

559
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,280
But the moment I saw you,

560
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,120
I knew.

561
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,240
You think little

562
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,480
of this line of work.

563
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,080
Ms. Qian, to be honest,

564
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,080
it's not that I look down on it.

565
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,560
I just don't know much about it,

566
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,040
and I don't really get it.

567
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,480
To this day, I still don't.

568
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,360
I'm still grateful

569
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,360
you kept reaching out,

570
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,720
calling and texting

571
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,880
to bring me in.

572
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,440
If I had

573
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,640
delivered some good results by now,

574
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,160
I bet this whole conversation

575
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,200
would feel different.

576
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,800
It's just because...

577
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,120
Then you have to put in the effort.

578
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,160
I've tried everything.

579
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,680
I even stuffed my face

580
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,640
on camera.

581
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,200
I played with puppies,

582
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,120
tried being a pet blogger.

583
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,480
I tried it all.

584
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,920
It's just a mystery.

585
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,040
I just can't wrap my head

586
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,680
around how traffic works.

587
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,000
Zhang Ran, it's not a mystery.

588
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,960
We can help you with many things.

589
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,640
But for the rest,

590
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,320
you've gotta figure it out yourself.

591
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,680
I understand.

592
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,840
Really.

593
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,160
I understand your position too.

594
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,840
The company

595
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,600
has so many creators

596
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,240
here.

597
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,040
It's like casting a wide net.

598
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,160
Naturally, you'd focus

599
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,280
on cultivating the ones

600
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,080
who are lively and active, right?

601
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,440
The rest sink to the bottom.

602
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,160
That's perfectly normal.

603
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,440
That's just how the world is.

604
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,720
That's the pattern.

605
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,480
I got it.

606
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,320
I understand.

607
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,920
My husband once told me,

608
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,720
"Quit and problem solved."

609
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,920
Maybe it's just not in me.

610
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,240
Maybe I should just quit.

611
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,960
Fu Yudong.

612
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,480
Should we get

613
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,000
blackout curtains?

614
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,360
Whatever you say.

615
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,960
[Ran,]

616
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,920
[mom's calling you for dinner.]

617
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,320
You guys go ahead.

618
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,080
I'm not hungry. I'm working.

619
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,760
[Alright, alright.]

620
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,600
Hey, Bo.

621
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,800
Hey, Ran.

622
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,400
Three days down

623
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,560
of a great week.

624
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,320
Let's post something.

625
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,000
More posts, fewer followers.

626
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,400
Better stay home and play dead.

627
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,480
[Don't worry.]

628
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,040
The company

629
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,840
has a promotional event

630
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,920
with an amusement park this week.

631
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,280
Not much needed to sign up.

632
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,800
[Anyone from mid-tier and below]

633
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,120
[can participate.]

634
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,520
[Accounts with 10k followers]

635
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,640
[or 100k quick views qualify.]

636
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,840
Isn't that my level exactly?

637
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,280
Never done live sales. I don't know how.

638
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,440
Ran,

639
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,320
we're not selling tickets.

640
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,120
We're just creating buzz.

641
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,160
Okay?

642
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,160
[Go with the holiday theme]

643
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,120
[and do some]

644
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,960
[cosplay.]

645
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,320
I don't want to go.

646
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,200
Please,

647
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,120
do it for me.

648
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,320
[And for my year-end bonus.]

649
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,000
Wait, I thought it was voluntary?

650
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,760
[I already signed you up.]

651
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,680
You...

652
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,400
The company

653
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,840
will be monitoring

654
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,080
the traffic in the live rooms.

655
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,600
If you can make it into the top five,

656
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,160
[all the promotional deals]

657
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,200
[and brand endorsements]

658
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,480
[will come your way.]

659
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,880
[Come on.]

660
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,160
[An amusement park. Think of it as fun.]

661
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,320
[All the other streamers]

662
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,840
[are raring to go and ready]

663
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,200
[to seize this opportunity.]

664
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,760
[I checked.]

665
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,720
[Most of them]

666
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,400
[are doing cosplay.]

667
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,040
[Pick a character to cosplay as.]

668
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
[You might get famous!]

669
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,440
[Ms. Qian made me]

670
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,280
[stay at the office,]

671
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,680
[or else I'd go with you.]

672
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,280
[I heard from Ms. Dai]

673
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,160
[in Planning]

674
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,160
[that the company]

675
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,440
[holds events like this every year.]

676
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,040
[The company will]

677
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,880
[see who's]

678
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,720
[doing great,]

679
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,000
[and then focus on developing them.]

680
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,360
[So,]

681
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,520
[Ran,]

682
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,440
[when]

683
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,360
[opportunity comes,]

684
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,800
[you have to grab it.]

685
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,440
[A better tomorrow is calling you.]

686
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,680
[Ran,]

687
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,960
[you always say]

688
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,120
[choice trumps effort.]

689
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,760
[But what choice]

690
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,040
[do you have without it?]

691
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,800
[I remember]

692
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,560
[our top creator, Lin Anran,]

693
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,960
[blew up from an event]

694
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,000
[just like this.]

695
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,640
[The opportunity is here!]

696
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,280
[Be sure to go, alright?]

697
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,360
[No hesitation.]

698
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,400
[You have to go.]

699
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,520
[Fine.]

700
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,040
[Bye.]

701
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,360
About the

702
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,320
Journey to the West cosplays,

703
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,680
Monk Sha can't just be Monk Sha.

704
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,680
Thanks, sir!

705
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,360
Sorry.

706
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,840
I'll follow you, alright?

707
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,800
[Nezha's not bad.]

708
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,680
[She knows how to pick her spot.]

709
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,960
The whole scene

710
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,120
looks great!

711
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,440
Ms. Qian, the live viewer count

712
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,720
is holding steady at 320.

713
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,200
About

714
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,120
what we expected.

715
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,720
Let me check.

716
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,760
This is it.

717
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,320
This is Zhang Ran.

718
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,960
[So the carousel]

719
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,800
[is moving now.]

720
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,640
[The ride I'm on]

721
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,120
[is the classic]

722
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,000
[merry-go-round.]

723
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,320
The rule is

724
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,800
you have to

725
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,120
be 1.2 meters tall

726
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,440
to ride.

727
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,080
Yep, 1.2 meters.

728
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,920
Look at all the kids around me...

729
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,480
Hey, are you 1.2 meters tall?

730
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,280
None of your business.

731
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,680
Me?

732
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,040
I'm the "Desperate Personal Shopper".

733
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,840
Why isn't she replying

734
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,560
to that comment?

735
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,400
How is she going to boost traffic?

736
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,080
If the traffic doesn't pick up,

737
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,200
she'll have to take responsibility.

738
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,360
Ms. Qian, it's on.

739
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,480
Ms. Qian,

740
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,200
Ms. Liao's stream is doing well.

741
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,120
The numbers are climbing fast.

742
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,120
Switch it over.

743
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,680
Here it is.

744
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,400
The surprise is coming soon.

745
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,640
Everyone, please like

746
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,520
and share the livestream.

747
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,480
Hit that like button.

748
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,600
Almost at 100K views!

749
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,000
Things look good.

750
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,120
Liu Bo,

751
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,600
are you done?

752
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,200
Yes.

753
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,200
Tell everyone to put in some effort.

754
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,520
They should learn from this.

755
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,080
Let's try

756
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,280
this park's

757
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,040
ice cream.

758
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,960
Well...

759
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,120
For the price, the taste

760
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
is actually decent.

761
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,760
It's okay.

762
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,960
Only twelve people left now.

763
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,760
Hey,

764
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,720
you're one of us now.

765
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,880
Let me check a message.

766
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,000
Says there's an internet celebrity

767
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,800
doing the turkey dance nearby,

768
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,360
and I should go check it out.

769
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,680
Forget it, I won't go.

770
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,840
I'll just find

771
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,560
a quiet spot up ahead

772
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,800
and chat with you guys.

773
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,480
Guys, I finished my ice cream.

774
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,920
It was pretty good.

775
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,160
Overall, the taste was alright.

776
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,160
Now I've found

777
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,040
a quiet spot.

778
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,280
Let's chat for a bit.

779
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,040
Everyone, type out any topics

780
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,520
you want to chat about.

781
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,680
My right eyelid

782
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,600
keeps twitching.

783
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,280
A voice chat?

784
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,560
Sure, I can do that.

785
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,640
But I've never done it before.

786
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,440
How does it work? Should I call you?

787
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,720
Oh, I see.

788
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,040
Is this you now?

789
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,480
Qingwu Feiyang, hello.

790
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,160
[Hello, Desperate Personal Shopper.]

791
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,880
[I use your memes all the time.]

792
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,960
Okay. Thank you.

793
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,960
How come your voice...

794
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,480
What's going on?

795
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,960
You're using a voice changer, right?

796
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
[For privacy?]

797
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,920
Yeah.

798
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,880
I've known about you for a long time.

799
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,360
You used to be a host

800
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,520
on a TV finance show, right?

801
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,680
Yes.

802
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,240
I was at Lucheng City TV Station.

803
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,120
There was a finance channel.

804
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,480
A show called

805
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,760
Today's Financial Interview.

806
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,440
I was the host

807
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,760
of that show.

808
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,360
[That was]

809
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,280
[over ten years ago.]

810
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,600
[Thank you for following me.]

811
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,280
[And thank you for remembering me.]

812
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,320
Sure.

813
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,320
When you left the station,

814
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,920
how come you suddenly went abroad?

815
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,800
I heard you married a foreigner.

816
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,800
Did you go to be a housewife?

817
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,560
So how did you end up

818
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,520
as the "Desperate Personal Shopper"?

819
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,160
Hey,

820
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,640
Qingwu Feiyang,

821
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,320
you're surprisingly well-informed.

822
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
Well,

823
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,600
I wouldn't call it "ending up".

824
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,960
Life is like that.

825
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,440
Ups and downs are normal.

826
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,400
So what was the opportunity?

827
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,720
I'm quite curious.

828
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,120
Tell us about it.

829
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,400
If you want to hear it,

830
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,040
type "1".

831
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,120
See, everyone wants to hear it.

832
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,320
Everyone wants to know

833
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,960
how a former finance host

834
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,560
became the person behind

835
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,000
the "Desperate Personal Shopper" meme.

836
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,600
There must be

837
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
quite a story there.

838
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,560
Don't be stingy.

839
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,560
Share it with us.

840
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,480
Alright. Since everyone wants to know,

841
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,480
I'll talk about it.

842
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,600
When I met my ex-husband,

843
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,000
I was indeed a host

844
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,840
on a show called

845
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,960
Today's Financial Interview.

846
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,600
[That show]

847
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,800
[is still on.]

848
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,240
[Back when I was a host,]

849
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,160
[the standards]

850
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,320
[for hosts]

851
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,680
[were extremely high.]

852
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,280
[You had to speak foreign languages.]

853
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,680
I could interview

854
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,760
foreign entrepreneurs

855
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,960
entirely in English.

856
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,760
The current host?

857
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,000
[I really...]

858
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,360
[I can't say she's impressive.]

859
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,480
[She even needs a translator.]

860
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,760
[Might as well let the translator]

861
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,480
[do the interview.]

862
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,600
Hold on.

863
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,120
We want to hear

864
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,960
about you getting married abroad.

865
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:38,960
So what happened

866
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,000
after you went abroad?

867
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,080
Bad choice in a partner?

868
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,280
Bad choice in a partner?

869
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:43,840
How do you know

870
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,840
I made a bad choice?

871
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,240
[You seem]

872
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,680
[really concerned about me.]

873
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,720
[Thank you.]

874
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,960
You guessed right.

875
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,880
I did make a bad choice.

876
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,840
I met my ex-husband

877
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,120
because of that show.

878
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,440
He came

879
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,240
with a North American delegation.

880
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,200
And then we met.

881
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,560
He asked

882
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,880
if I'd go abroad with him,

883
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,760
saying there'd be more room

884
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,600
for my career there.

885
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,440
So I believed him

886
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,679
and went with him.

887
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,280
Well, I was young back then.

888
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,639
Young people

889
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,239
are easily fooled.

890
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,080
That's just how it is.

891
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,840
Not just because you were young, right?

892
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,000
Weren't there

893
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,719
some vanity involved?

894
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,400
If you put it that way,

895
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,440
then I have to honestly

896
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,600
admit it.

897
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,960
I was vain back then.

898
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,400
But I

899
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,040
paid the price for it.

900
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,760
[Not long after I went to Canada]

901
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,159
[with him,]

902
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,920
[I realized I'd been deceived.]

903
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,040
And the moment

904
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,560
I realized it,

905
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,520
I decided to

906
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,840
divorce him.

907
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,320
Ms. Qian, Ran's numbers are climbing!

908
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,480
But even to this day,

909
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,560
I don't regret it.

910
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,400
Because

911
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,960
I've always been honest

912
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,680
with myself.

913
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,760
[I didn't want to]

914
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,320
[cling to a bad marriage]

915
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,240
[for the sake of face,]

916
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,120
so I ended it.

917
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,280
Are you satisfied

918
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,080
with my answer, Qingwu Feiyang?

919
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,520
Hello?

920
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,680
You left?

921
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,160
[At least say goodbye.]

922
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,600
[I'm pouring my heart out here.]

923
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,240
I'm here. Don't hang up.

924
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,520
Wait a moment.

925
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,040
Zhang Ran's impressive.

926
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:50,960
The numbers are climbing fast.

927
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,400
Ms. Qian,

928
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,760
Zhang Ran's stream is doing well now.

929
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,040
Should we push a traffic package?

930
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:54,880
Do it.

931
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,400
So you've been single all these years

932
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,000
since the divorce?

933
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
You never remarried?

934
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,040
I did.

935
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,480
My current marriage is great.

936
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,920
My husband treats me well.

937
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,200
Your husband is so good to you?

938
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:10,600
Then

939
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,240
how come he let you

940
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,200
do this personal shopping?

941
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,240
What does he do?

942
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,120
He

943
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,240
works with his hands,

944
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,440
making a living on his own.

945
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,960
He does renovations

946
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,560
in Canada.

947
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,240
Doesn't sound like

948
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,600
a respectable job.

949
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,200
Worldly respectability

950
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,400
isn't important.

951
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,120
What matters is the person.

952
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,680
[After]

953
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,840
[a failed marriage,]

954
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,920
[actually,]

955
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,560
I realized

956
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,240
that external,

957
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,200
worldly success

958
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,240
and possessions

959
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,120
are not

960
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,480
that important.

961
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,360
What matters most is sincerity.

962
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,160
If a man

963
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,360
has no money or status,

964
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,240
isn't he just all talk?

965
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,760
Saying nice things

966
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,920
makes him sincere?

967
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,880
You can't be that naive.

968
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,320
There must be something we don't know.

969
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,120
Is it something you can't talk about?

970
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,440
So that's what you think?

971
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,800
I don't need to explain

972
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,200
what my own husband is like to you.

973
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,120
Marriage is like a private journey.

974
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,840
Only the couple

975
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,040
knows if it's rewarding.

976
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,400
Your time is about up, right?

977
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,960
Should we switch to another guy?

978
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,960
Don't hang up.

979
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,640
Are you getting upset all of a sudden?

980
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,520
So sensitive.

981
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,080
Seriously?

982
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,720
That's not streamer material.

983
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,800
Alright. Since everyone wants to know,

984
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
I'll talk about it.

985
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,320
I met my husband

986
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,920
during

987
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,960
the darkest time of my life.

988
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,520
[I was living in the cheapest]

989
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,560
[motel.]

990
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,840
[All sorts of people lived next door.]

991
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,120
[It felt like my life had hit a dead end.]

992
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,160
[My husband is a repairman.]

993
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,920
The day I met him,

994
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,840
I was going through

995
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,960
something really rough.

996
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,360
And it was my birthday.

997

♪Happy birthday, Zhang Ran.♪

1004
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,320
Go on, blow the candle.

1005
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,200
It was that day.

1006
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,960
Happy birthday.

1007
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,760
He made me a cake

1008
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,400
out of rice.

1009
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,560
Because

1010
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,080
the bakery was already closed.

1011
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,360
And he drew a candle,

1012
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,680
stuck it in the cake,

1013
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,320
and told me to make a wish.

1014
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,120
Make a wish.

1015
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,040
Let me make a wish first.

1016
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,720
Okay.

1017
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,640
It's just for show.

1018
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,640
Don't actually eat it.

1019
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,600
Isn't this rice?

1020
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,440
It's edible, isn't it?

1021
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,520
I haven't had

1022
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
a proper meal in a month.

1023
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,960
Back then,

1024
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,920
when I was really down,

1025
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,480
that cake

1026
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,400
really touched me.

1027
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,640
And that's how we met

1028
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,040
and got started.

1029
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,600
That's it.

1030
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,240
Does your room have everything?

1031
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,600
Yes.

1032
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,480
I've been living here for two years.

1033
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,520
Do you live alone?

1034
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,440
Let's give it a try.

1035
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,200
A bowl of rice

1036
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,320
won you over?

1037
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,960
So this Rice Guy

1038
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,200
sounds a bit unreliable.

1039
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
Like a scammer.

1040
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,320
Yes.

1041
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,760
I was fooled

1042
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,040
by Rice Guy's one bowl of rice.

1043
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,480
Back then,

1044
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,880
we weren't doing well.

1045
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,880
So I started doing personal shopping.

1046
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,200
To be honest,

1047
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,000
I was still pretty vain back then.

1048
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,720
[I kept posting selfies,]

1049
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,480
[lying to family and friends back home,]

1050
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,520
[saying I lived in a villa]

1051
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,680
[and bought luxury brands,]

1052
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,080
just to show off how well I was doing.

1053
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
That's how I was

1054
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,080
during that time.

1055
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,280
[So]

1056
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,240
[are you satisfied with my answer,]

1057
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,040
Qingwu Feiyang?

1058
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,840
Look, you're getting worked up again.

1059
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,360
Alright. I'll stop.

1060
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm not worked up.

1061
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm an internet celebrity.

1062
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,960
I'm already a joke

1063
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,680
online.

1064
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,080
I won't get worked up.

1065
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,520
At least my husband

1066
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,840
gave me a bowl of rice.

1067
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,440
What about you? Are you doing well now?

1068
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,400
[Qingwu Feiyang,]

1069
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,840
I've figured out who you are.

1070
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,360
Your username

1071
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,440
sounds like it's from way back.

1072
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,440
I was thinking

1073
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,280
about it just now.

1074
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,560
Your QQ username was the same.

1075
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,040
I'm already a joke

1076
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,800
online anyway.

1077
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,760
I don't care.

1078
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,840
Should I say who you are?

1079
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,120
Can I say it?

1080
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,320
Alright. Since you've already left,

1081
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,720
I won't keep pushing it.

1082
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,040
Though you've left,

1083
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,760
I know you're still watching.

1084
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,720
And among all the other people

1085
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
in this live stream,

1086
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,360
there must be my old friends

1087
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,280
and former colleagues.

1088
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,120
I want to tell you all here

1089
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,080
that I may

1090
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,200
look like a joke now,

1091
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,480
but

1092
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,920
I don't regret

1093
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,480
leaving the TV station at all.

1094
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,680
I don't regret

1095
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,960
any choice I've made.

1096
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,600
Because every single one

1097
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,280
came from

1098
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,480
what I truly felt inside.

1099
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,960
I've been completely honest with myself.

1100
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,680
Let me introduce myself again.
