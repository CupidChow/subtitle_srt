1
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,920
When I was abroad,

2
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,800
I used to hit luxury stores

3
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,560
and check...

4
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,200
Is she talking

5
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,440
to herself?

6
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,680
There's a

7
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,320
ring light in front of her.

8
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,720
She's livestreaming?

9
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,759
You watch every day and you don't know?

10
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,560
In real life,

11
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,800
people chasing luxury

12
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,000
don't actually

13
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,280
buy bags.

14
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,320
Most people,

15
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,680
other than resellers like me...

16
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,200
Can you see what she's streaming

17
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,479
on your phone?

18
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,360
I left my phone in the bathroom.

19
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,680
Buying this bag

20
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,440
is like buying a canvas tote.

21
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,920
One of my clients

22
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,000
once told me

23
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,320
she never buys

24
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,800
super expensive bags

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,880
because she thinks no bag

26
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,920
is worthy of her.

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,520
She said it

28
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,560
so casually,

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,160
but I thought

30
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,000
it was

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,160
really cool.

32
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,440
Of course, luxury

33
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,360
means different things

34
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,520
to different people.

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,480
Hold on, the background

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,960
doesn't look great.

37
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,920
Let me find another spot.

38
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,600
In my last video, I talked about

39
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,040
how important the brush is.

40
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,880
The hardness of the bristles

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,079
determines whether your bag

42
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,560
gets damaged.

43
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,560
If you use a hard brush

44
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,120
on leather,

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,400
you won't see scratches,

46
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,880
but it's ruining

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,520
your bag.

48
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,760
So what kind of brush

49
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,600
counts as the right tool?

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,240
When...

51
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,320
Are you a spy or something?

52
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,920
Which rival sent you?

53
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,840
If you did,

55
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,480
I'd kick you out right now.

56
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,960
Go ahead.

57
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,720
I've recorded this 18 times.

58
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,440
It'd be the 19th take.

59
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,480
My voice is hoarse.

60
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,600
I nearly scrubbed a hole in the bag.

61
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,880
Why not

62
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,960
do something you're good at?

63
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,560
Something familiar?

64
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,120
This is so tiring.

65
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,160
Hosting is my strength,

66
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,400
but nobody watches.

67
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,600
What about

68
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,960
being a nun?

69
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,200
What?

70
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,160
Shave your head,

71
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,079
hold a wooden fish,

72
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,320
and strike it.

73
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,240
I've seen those streams.

74
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,400
Really boring.

75
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,560
Like writing

76
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,560
or just sitting there.

77
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,400
Tons of viewers.

78
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,600
With gifts too, seriously.

79
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,920
Yudong, how many times

80
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,040
have I told you not to sit on the bed

81
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,920
wearing outer clothes?

82
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,200
Go wash your hands

83
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,960
and change, now.

84
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,600
I'm exhausted.

85
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,960
Hurry up. I'm tired too. Go now.

86
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,160
How about I record it for you?

87
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,880
What's this thing?

88
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,640
It connects to my mic.

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,800
Fancy.

90
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,920
Go ahead.

91
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,120
In last video

92
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,600
we talked about brush usage.

93
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,640
The hardness of the bristles...

94
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,560
Wait, wait, wait,

95
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,160
I haven't started recording yet.

96
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,959
One more time.

97
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,960
Mom's outside.

98
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,520
Fu Yudong.

99
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,200
I can't sit with the outer clothes.

100
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
Can't sit on the bed.

101
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,360
Give it to me.

102
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,800
I'm recording all this

103
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,280
as evidence.

104
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,960
Give it.

105
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,120
- Hurry up.
- You hit me.

106
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,920
Mom, Dad, don't wait for Ran.

107
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,480
Here.

108
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,960
I made you sweet fermented

109
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,000
rice with egg.

110
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,600
I can't make

111
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,200
the candied egg here,

112
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,720
so I poached it.

113
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,320
Try it.

114
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,960
Alright, alright. Go eat breakfast.

115
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,320
Eat first and edit later.

116
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,920
Okay.

117
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,440
Has she eaten?

118
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,600
She's editing.

119
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,080
After breakfast, I'll

120
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,960
do the dishes.

121
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,520
You two can go for your walk

122
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,640
or get groceries.

123
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,240
No, I'll wash.

124
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,960
Um, Ran and I won't

125
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,920
be home for lunch.

126
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,320
We need to go out and shoot videos.

127
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Out again?

128
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,120
Out...

129
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,280
Then what's the point of coming

130
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,160
back from Canada?

131
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,960
You're out all the time.

132
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,760
She wasn't this busy

133
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,960
at the TV station.

134
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,680
If she got

135
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,080
a proper job, fine.

136
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,920
Now her schedule's a mess.

137
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,680
She's just starting out. It's hard.

138
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,520
Well...

139
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,000
A PhD is really different.

140
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,760
You peeled the egg so easily.

141
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,159
Look at that.

142
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,560
Unlike me, it takes me forever.

143
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,800
You? Forget it.

144
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,080
Isn't that how everyone does it?

145
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,720
No, I...

146
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,159
I peel bit by bit.

147
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,320
Really?

148
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,280
Yudong, so...

149
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,280
How's the job hunt going?

150
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,040
You like helping people out,

151
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,480
but don't spend all your time

152
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,080
fixing pipes and windows

153
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,760
for neighbors.

154
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,080
Helping neighbors is fine,

155
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,080
but it's not your field.

156
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,360
You're wasting your talent,

157
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,320
you know?

158
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,080
I'm just saying what

159
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,680
your dad wants to say.

160
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,840
He asked me to talk to you.

161
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,480
It's okay, you...

162
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,880
Yeah.

163
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,400
Thanks, Dad.

164
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,960
Leave the egg there

165
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,880
and save it for Ran.

166
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,040
Okay.

167
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,240
Hey, Li, Li?

168
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,160
Have you seen it?

169
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,080
Seen what?

170
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,200
Qiang, what's going on?

171
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,960
No idea.

172
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,400
They said everything was fine, right?

173
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,640
Yeah, the notice just

174
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,320
came through.

175
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,159
Did you ask?

176
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,960
Did you?

177
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,760
No.

178
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,560
What? I'm getting water.

179
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,600
Why is he acting like nothing happened?

180
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,960
Let's get water together.

181
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,880
Follow him, quick.

182
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,040
I heard HR has

183
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,120
a layoff list

184
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,160
ready.

185
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,480
Headquarters have sent

186
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,200
people over to do evaluations.

187
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,080
Not a word in our department.

188
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,280
Director Wang looks totally normal.

189
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,520
Listen,

190
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,360
this didn't come out of nowhere.

191
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,200
We're usually

192
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,480
slammed this time of year.

193
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,600
Now? Everyone's just sitting around.

194
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,480
Come on, Li,

195
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,520
no insider info

196
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,440
at all?

197
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,320
Yeah, give us a heads-up,

198
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,520
so we can be prepared.

199
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,760
If I knew something,

200
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,120
why would I hide it from you?

201
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,679
Stop spreading rumors.

202
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,799
Even if they're

203
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,520
laying off half the company,

204
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,440
they wouldn't touch our team.

205
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,160
We made the company

206
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,360
a fortune the past two years.

207
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,160
How can they forget?

208
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,480
Are they stupid?

209
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,560
The company has its own plan.

210
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,000
No need to worry.

211
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,280
Get back to work soon.

212
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,680
I'm getting some water.

213
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,200
Okay.

214
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,560
Yudong said

215
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,360
it will just takes a moment,

216
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,760
and before he leaves,

217
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,920
he'll definitely clean our place

218
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,400
top to bottom,

219
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,480
like they're

220
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,880
never here.

221
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,680
Qi,

222
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,360
isn't this helping them fake things?

223
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,520
It's not faking.

224
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,040
They're just shooting a video.

225
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,960
Yudong told me Ran's

226
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,720
tried everything she can

227
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,120
to make these videos.

228
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,200
Now she wants to

229
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,600
do some kind

230
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,600
of room tour,

231
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,640
but they couldn't find

232
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,520
a suitable place.

233
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
So they

234
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,480
wanted to ask

235
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,600
if you could

236
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,840
lend them the place for a bit.

237
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,400
Silence means

238
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,000
yes, right?

239
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,880
Don't worry.

240
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,120
I'll watch them the whole time.

241
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,800
I won't let them make a mess.

242
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,840
Watch them?

243
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,000
Don't you have work?

244
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,960
I took leave.

245
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,320
Taking leave at a time like this?

246
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,600
What time like this?

247
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,480
Don't be dramatic.

248
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,960
It's just gossip.

249
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,640
Just the other day,

250
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,600
someone from legal

251
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,680
told me our marketing campaign's

252
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,440
going great.

253
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Don't worry.

254
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,720
Nobody can shake

255
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,400
my position in the company.

256
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,640
But I am

257
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,040
really lucky.

258
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,360
I have such

259
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,640
an understanding wife like you.

260
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,480
What did I do

261
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,560
to deserve you?

262
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,560
Why am I so...

263
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,120
Just help me now.

264
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,560
I'll help, I'll help.

265
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,160
But I honestly have

266
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,320
no clue how to do this puzzle.

267
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,040
Every piece looks the same.

268
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,440
Where do I even start?

269
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,760
I've asked Daoqi to

270
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,680
lend us their place for a day.

271
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,240
His place or Cheng Man's?

272
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,040
Same thing.

273
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,160
How is it the same?

274
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,480
Last time I fought with her.

275
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,920
Won't she hate me showing up?

276
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,680
Don't worry, I've arranged everything.

277
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,760
Nobody's going to bother you.

278
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,000
Honey, carrying all this stuff,

279
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,160
you kinda look like Nezha.

280
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,600
Stop cleaning. I'll take care of it later.

281
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,320
If Cheng Man's home

282
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,720
and sees the place all messy,

283
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,280
what's she going to think of me?

284
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,520
Does she know we're here today?

285
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,360
Yes.

286
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,480
Hey, do you know

287
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,000
what your biggest strength is?

288
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,000
My biggest strength

289
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,920
is having no strengths.

290
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,280
Your best quality is being domestic.

291
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,640
Hello everyone,

292
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,800
I'm Zhang Ran.

293
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,360
In this video, I'll

294
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,080
show you the new house

295
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,120
I rented after

296
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,520
coming back.

297
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,360
This place is

298
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,680
just temporary, though.

299
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,400
I heard from my mom that

300
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,440
you went home the other day?

301
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,520
That's great.

302
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,120
It's good to visit your parents often.

303
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,240
Today I want to share

304
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,960
with you

305
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,360
kitchen items.

306
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,720
The thing is,

307
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,800
in a household,

308
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,200
the kitchen...

309
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,760
Close!

310
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,240
Hello?

311
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,040
Hello everyone,

312
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,160
I'm Zhang Ran.

313
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,960
Today I'm sharing some

314
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,040
great kitchen products.

315
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,840
I haven't been back long,

316
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,760
so this house

317
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,480
I rented is

318
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,640
just temporary.

319
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,160
Hope we can share ideas

320
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,840
and tips.

321
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,720
Because a stove

322
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,840
means so much...

323
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,200
I didn't do anything.

324
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,080
Smarty?

325
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,040
Smarty?

326
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,040
Retract.

327
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,600
Smarty?

328
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,360
What's wrong?

329
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,040
Nothing.

330
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,120
You got this.

331
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,640
Hi everyone, I'm Zhang Ran.

332
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,280
Today I'm recommending

333
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,400
some kitchen essentials.

334
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,960
In kitchens...

335
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,200
What kind of smart home is this?

336
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,640
Smarty?

337
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,240
Smarty?

338
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,560
Smarty?

339
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,960
Smarty? Retract.

340
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,160
Now let's look at this jar

341
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,000
of Lao Gan Ma.

342
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,640
It's the most

343
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,320
beloved chili sauce

344
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,760
among

345
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,560
overseas Chinese.

346
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,280
It can be used

347
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,240
as a hotpot base

348
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,520
and for making sauces.

349
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,720
What chat group did you add me to?

350
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,880
Schoolmate.

351
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,800
Don't feel awkward.

352
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,240
Reconnect with them.

353
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,400
They can always help.

354
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,640
What happened?

355
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,560
I'm sorry,

356
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,320
I didn't mean to.

357
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,960
Are you hurt?

358
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,360
I don't know how to use these

359
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,080
smart appliances.

360
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,200
I was fumbling around

361
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,640
and...

362
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,680
Let me get you a band-aid.

363
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,360
No, no really.

364
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,440
I'm fine, I'm fine.

365
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,840
Don't move. I'll handle it.

366
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,280
I...

367
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,280
No, don't.

368
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:10,720
Leave the shards there.

369
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,680
I'll sweep them up later.

370
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,920
Where did you get this?

371
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
I'll buy you a new one.

372
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,320
This smart-home stuff

373
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,040
is too complicated.

374
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,960
I wasn't paying attention

375
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,000
and messed up.

376
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,600
Smart home?

377
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,280
Dumb home.

378
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,080
I can't figure it out either.

379
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,520
Let me put it on.

380
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,400
Here, here, here.

381
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,160
As long as your hand's okay.

382
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,080
I'm fine, really.

383
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,160
Okay.

384
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,080
All good.

385
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,520
I broke one the other day too.

386
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,480
I should've put it away.

387
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,680
No big deal.

388
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,880
I'm really sorry.

389
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,040
It's nothing.

390
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,160
As long as you're okay.

391
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,200
Be careful.

392
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,560
Just leave the shards there.

393
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,720
I'll clean them up later.

394
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,480
- It's okay.
- It's fine.

395
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,600
Yudong will take care of it.

396
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,120
Don't worry. Leave this to me.

397
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,320
Just keep recording.

398
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,640
It's done.

399
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,680
I'll just stop here.

400
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,200
It's fine. Keep going.

401
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,080
It's finished anyway.

402
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,560
I'm done recording.

403
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,200
No, keep shooting.

404
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,320
We'll continue our chat outside.

405
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,680
I might be able

406
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,000
to fix this.

407
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,360
I glued a cup like

408
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
this before.

409
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,360
Stop.

410
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:58,920
Look what I've done.

411
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,560
Don't touch them.

412
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,360
That one's thicker.

413
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,120
Put the pieces down.

414
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,240
You can cut your hands too.

415
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,000
Check this out.

416
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Don't move. Don't, don't.

417
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,920
Don't talk.

418
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,320
Somehow this laptop

419
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,560
froze again.

420
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,560
Doesn't this cup

421
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,880
look like the one

422
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,560
at Cheng Man's?

423
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,600
You don't need to whisper.

424
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,560
The laptop can't hear you.

425
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,600
Her cup cost 8,800 yuan.

426
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,120
You can't replace that

427
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,640
with a 200-yuan one.

428
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,080
8,800 yuan?

429
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,440
That expensive?

430
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,080
I told you I didn't want to go,

431
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,080
but you insisted.

432
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,680
This isn't about the cup.

433
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,080
It's about us losing face.

434
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,600
My fault.

435
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,160
I just wanted to help.

436
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,600
You said you wanted to film a room tour,

437
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,280
so I figured we'd go to their place

438
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,640
and shoot the video.

439
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,640
Who knew...

440
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,800
I'm not blaming you.

441
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,160
I'm just frustrated

442
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,760
my video isn't even edited yet.

443
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,880
Not sure how much money

444
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,600
this video will make,

445
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,000
but I need to spend 8,800 yuan.

446
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,200
What a great loss.

447
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,600
Don't worry about that.

448
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,720
I forced you

449
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,400
to go film

450
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,960
at their place.

451
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,480
I'll pay for the cup.

452
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
With what?

453
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
You're hiding cash?

454
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,640
All our money's

455
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,120
in our Canadian bank account.

456
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,120
I can start working now.

457
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,160
I can make money.

458
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,560
I got a bunch of certifications.

459
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,200
I can finally take jobs.

460
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,640
Look, tomorrow I've got two gigs.

461
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,200
Everyone

462
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,720
in this neighborhood is loaded.

463
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,520
You've been taking exams these days?

464
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,160
I was free anyway.

465
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,360
Alright, Dr. Fu is

466
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,720
starting to earn money.

467
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,360
Is this the 8,800-yuan

468
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,840
cup?

469
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,680
Forget about the cup.

470
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,480
I'll find something with good quality

471
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,360
at a lower price.

472
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,240
We appreciate your work here.

473
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,319
Best wishes for the future.

474
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,520
- Li.
- Li.

475
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,680
I signed it just now.

476
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,120
The compensation package is pretty good.

477
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,680
Hit the jackpot.

478
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,440
Li...

479
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,120
Save it.

480
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,320
You two, listen up.

481
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
Without me here,

482
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
nobody's got your back anymore.

483
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,080
In the new team, don't be late

484
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,160
or leave early in first three months.

485
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,840
Got it?

486
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,240
Yes.

487
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,680
Behave yourselves.

488
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,520
In those corporate dramas,

489
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
don't people who resign

490
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,600
or get fired always leave

491
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,240
carrying a cardboard

492
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,480
box?

493
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,160
Li, wait, hold on.

494
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,800
Li,

495
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,600
I got this from the cleaner.

496
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,680
Take it. It's new.

497
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,360
Nice.

498
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,800
Thanks.

499
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,120
Superman's home!

500
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,960
You're back?

501
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,200
Zhang Ran's quite thoughtful.

502
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,720
She bought me a cup to replace

503
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
the one she broke.

504
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,000
She got it from the official store.

505
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,480
Well,

506
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,400
I didn't even have the nerve

507
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,440
to tell you about the cup.

508
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,400
Now she gave you a new one,

509
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,520
and you found out anyway.

510
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,160
You really think I didn't know?

511
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,920
Right, right.

512
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,680
Nothing gets past you.

513
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,480
You drank?

514
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,240
Had a couple with Yudong.

515
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,200
Celebrating.

516
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,440
Your merger project

517
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,480
moved forward?

518
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,560
Completely dead.

519
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,080
You're transferred to Director Wang's team?

520
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,240
I got laid off.

521
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,240
What?

522
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,160
Calm down.

523
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,760
Sit, sit.

524
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,640
Let me explain.

525
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,920
Really, this is

526
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,440
a good thing.

527
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,240
I thought it through.

528
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,480
I'm

529
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,960
not suited for working

530
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,400
at these big foreign companies.

531
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,400
Honestly,

532
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,800
at places like that, those

533
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,360
who get promoted

534
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,760
are a bunch of boot-lickers.

535
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,960
I'm better suited for

536
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,960
younger

537
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,320
start-ups

538
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,200
that value real ability

539
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,240
and performance.

540
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,440
Somewhere I can

541
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,280
actually create value, right?

542
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,160
My college class monitor invited me

543
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,280
to his company last time.

544
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,600
Maybe this is

545
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,280
a turning point in my life.

546
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,440
I signed the agreement

547
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
on spot.

548
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,760
The compensation was N+1.

549
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,800
It's a good deal.

550
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,200
Yeah, totally.

551
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,000
I think you're absolutely right.

552
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,600
Not bad, right?

553
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,760
This is a good thing.

554
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,760
And you know what?

555
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,640
The only reason I never quit

556
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,480
wasn't because

557
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,040
I couldn't get into a better company.

558
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,080
I just valued loyalty.

559
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,960
Now that they fired me,

560
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,960
when they realize

561
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,840
what they've lost, they'll regret it.

562
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,160
Yeah, exactly.

563
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,120
Daoqi.

564
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,040
Actually, there's no rush

565
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,600
to find a job.

566
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,320
I'm not in a hurry.

567
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,720
You've been working

568
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,840
for so long.

569
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,920
Now you finally get to rest at home.

570
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,760
That's a good thing.

571
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,400
Yes.

572
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,520
We should take our time.

573
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,160
To be honest,

574
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,240
it's fine

575
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,520
even if you don't work. No problem.

576
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
Let me show you something.

577
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,960
How so?

578
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,360
Look.

579
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,440
This is the loan we need to pay off.

580
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,840
The mortgage.

581
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,600
I know.

582
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,600
This is our cash account.

583
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,960
We're loaded!

584
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,240
Listen,

585
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,720
once the mortgage

586
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,520
is paid off,

587
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,880
we won't have

588
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
any major expenses.

589
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,840
Yeah.

590
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,240
For cash flow,

591
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,480
we have insurance

592
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,680
and some fixed income

593
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,800
from investments.

594
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,880
Plus the monthly commissions

595
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,120
from my insurance team.

596
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,440
These passive incomes

597
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,880
are definitely enough to cover

598
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,480
our monthly expenses.

599
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,960
-I see.
-So,

600
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,600
don't feel pressured.

601
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,480
No pressure at all.

602
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,880
It's okay if you don't work.

603
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,640
I have no pressure at all.

604
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,040
Alright?

605
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,360
I'm completely stress-free now.

606
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,040
It's okay. It's alright.

607
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,320
I'm happy.

608
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:44,920
Happy.

609
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,200
We can just kick back and relax.

610
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,640
Happy.

611
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,400
It's fine. I'm here.

612
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,120
Impressive.

613
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,480
It's okay.

614
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,360
It's fine.

615
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,360
Great.

616
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,920
Take your time.

617
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,120
Fu Yudong,

618
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,600
get the cake vouchers

619
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,360
Ms. Zhao gave us.

620
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,640
They're in the left drawer.

621
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,760
Why do you need those to see Qian Dan?

622
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,680
I'm giving them to the reception girl,

623
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
cleaners, and security man.

624
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,480
They're the hidden masters.

625
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,000
The invisible network hub.

626
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,560
The gossip relay station.

627
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,920
I've already

628
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,160
won over the reception girl.

629
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,360
Today I'll just reinforce it.

630
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:26,760
Give them to me.

631
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,160
Where did you learn all this?

632
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,360
This is what I've learned

633
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,560
from my time at the TV station.

634
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,720
Why are you keeping two?

635
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,640
So stingy.

636
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,480
Give them all to me.

637
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,680
I'm off.

638
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,560
If you don't use them all,

639
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,000
bring a couple back.

640
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,320
I will if I don't need them.

641
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,120
Okay.

642
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,800
Bye.

643
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,080
Take care.

644
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,760
Liu.

645
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,640
Hello.

646
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,760
Where's Liu?

647
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,800
She quit.

648
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,160
I just started two days ago.

649
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,760
Did you need something from Liu?

650
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,920
I'm here to...

651
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,440
I... I work here.

652
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,880
Ms. Qian scheduled a meeting with me.

653
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,640
Could you please sign in?

654
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,560
I haven't seen you before. Thank you.

655
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,520
Let me confirm.

656
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,800
Hello, Ms. Qian.

657
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,840
There's a lady at the reception

658
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,080
[who says she has an appointment with you.]

659
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,280
Her name is...

660
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,360
Zhang Ran.

661
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,520
Zhang Ran.

662
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,000
Okay.

663
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,920
[Ms. Qian's waiting for you in the room.]

664
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,600
Okay.

665
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,320
I've been surfing lately,

666
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,840
and I've roughly got the hang

667
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,960
of how the platform traffic works.

668
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,840
It works like this...

669
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,120
Right. The platforms

670
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,520
do have patterns.

671
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,560
[So you should trust]

672
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,920
[us professionals.]

673
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,840
Here, take a look.

674
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,600
This is our suggested account

675
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,720
for to use.

676
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,520
[No content posted yet.]

677
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,920
[Look closely at the follower count.]

678
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,080
That's a lot.

679
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,440
All active users.

680
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,360
We haven't spent

681
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,400
a single cent.

682
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,880
Now look at your

683
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,360
current account's follower count.

684
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,120
How many?

685
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,840
A hundred and twenty-seven.

686
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,080
Not even enough for a fraction, right?

687
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,400
Our business team

688
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,200
put this account

689
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
on some promotion platforms

690
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,880
to give it a try.

691
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Some brands

692
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,480
are already reaching out.

693
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,760
[Zhang Ran, I've always emphasized]

694
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,320
that why we have a contract

695
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,520
is because you have

696
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,160
the "Desperate Personal Shopper" persona.

697
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,800
[You wanted to try other directions,]

698
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,880
[and we gave you time]

699
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
[and opportunity.]

700
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,760
So smart people

701
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,680
know when to stop.

702
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,040
I... I just feel

703
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
this "desperate"...

704
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,920
I know.

705
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,560
I understand.

706
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,200
You care about your pride.

707
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,360
Right?

708
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,880
[But do you want pride,]

709
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,120
or do you want fame? Your choice.

710
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,880
Honey, you've been

711
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,000
pretty busy lately, right?

712
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,520
You didn't expect to come back

713
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,080
and still do this kind of work,

714
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,960
did you?

715
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,960
It's fine. Work is work, wherever it is.

716
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,280
I visited Zhou today.

717
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,040
[My mentor]

718
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,160
[from the TV station.]

719
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,280
He's already retired.

720
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,520
It's been ten years

721
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,520
since I left the station.

722
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,080
When looking back

723
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,640
on how hard I fought

724
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,240
for screen time ten years ago,

725
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,120
it feels like yesterday.

726
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,720
Back then,

727
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,160
I pushed forward shamelessly

728
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,760
to get any chance to be on camera.

729
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,360
Now, with the chance to be on camera,

730
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,120
I still have to be shameless.

731
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,560
Not at all.

732
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,280
That's not shameless.

733
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,880
Inside.

734
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,960
I've lost my self-respect inside.

735
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,240
If you don't want to do it,

736
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,880
then don't.

737
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,160
No need to force yourself.

738
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,280
We're already back.

739
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,600
I have to stick with it.

740
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,760
How can I quit like that?

741
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,800
You always say the same things.

742
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,960
How... How can I just quit like that?

743
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,520
You're so reckless.

744
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,640
It's not about being shameless.

745
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,080
It's not.

746
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,600
If you don't want to fix pipes,

747
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,520
then don't.

748
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,520
Honey, do you think I can do this?

749
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,800
Yes.

750
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,960
Absolutely.

751
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,160
Hello, Mr. Neng Service.

752
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,720
Hello.

753
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,520
Ethan?

754
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Is that you, Ethan?

755
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,920
Well...

756
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,600
Ran, where are you?

757
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,720
I... I'm out.

758
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,320
Why didn't you tell me

759
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,840
you were back?

760
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,080
I'm mad at you.

761
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,120
Look how coincidental this is.

762
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,320
See who's here with me.

763
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,120
Can you see?

764
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,960
Can you see clearly?

765
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,080
[Let me zoom in.]

766
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,360
Come over for dinner tonight.

767
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,400
It's all ready.

768
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,920
[I'll send you the address.]

769
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,080
[Get here soon.]

770
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,800
Ethan, there's a problem, right?

771
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,600
A small one.

772
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,960
[Let me get you some water.]

773
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,920
No, thanks.

774
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,240
[Here, have some water.]

775
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,560
Thanks.

776
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,880
Oh, I didn't

777
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,640
[even offer you slippers. Sorry.]

778
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,480
[Don't bother.]

779
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,640
No, I insist.

780
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,760
If I'd known it was her home,

781
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,200
I wouldn't have taken this job.

782
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,240
I'm sorry.

783
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,800
You're not stealing or robbing anyone.

784
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,840
Nothing to be sorry for.

785
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,560
Not your fault. Don't worry about it.

786
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,480
[Ran, I'm really mad at you.]

787
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,240
[You don't even see me as a friend.]

788
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,600
You didn't even tell me you were back.

789
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,560
I thought you'd be busy.

790
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,400
This place is huge, Yuan Yuan.

791
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
It's alright.

792
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
Yudong, you're not drinking?

793
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,400
[You always just watch us drink.]

794
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,320
That's from Zhou's retirement party

795
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,920
the station held for him.

796
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,920
Ran, I've decided.

797
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,200
I'll take over his position.

798
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,200
A civil service job is secure. Right?

799
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,320
Better than struggling out there on my own.

800
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,040
That's great. It suits you.

801
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,560
I have to thank you.

802
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,000
You gave me the opportunity.

803
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,520
Here's to you.

804
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,600
Is this your first time at my place?

805
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,640
Yes.

806
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,120
Can't compare

807
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,280
to your big house abroad.

808
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,080
No point comparing them.

809
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,400
As long as you're comfy living in it.

810
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,800
Right.

811
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,640
The Forbidden City is huge,

812
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,840
but the emperor only lived in one room.

813
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,560
Yes, the place is quite livable.

814
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,880
But the decor

815
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,640
just feels a bit outdated sometimes.

816
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,960
Yudong, if I'd known

817
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,640
[you were good at this,]

818
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,800
I'd have asked you.

819
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,680
Did you learn this abroad

820
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,080
or after you came back?

821
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,320
Actually, I...

822
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,560
Our house in Canada

823
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,360
was quite big,

824
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,920
so sometimes,

825
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,080
when something went wrong,

826
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,600
[he'd fix them.]

827
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,040
Over time, he got the hang of it.

828
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,480
Right. The principles

829
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,200
are mostly the same.

830
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,080
See,

831
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,280
smart people really are different.

832
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,440
They learn everything fast.

833
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,000
[Right.]

834
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,200
So, do you have any plans

835
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,480
now that you're back?

836
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,840
Zhang Ran has a clear idea

837
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,680
of her career.

838
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,560
But I

839
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,440
haven't quite figured mine out yet.

840
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,760
So it's a temporary thing for now.

841
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,800
See, I knew it.

842
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,840
You have a PhD, after all.

843
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,600
You couldn't have come back

844
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,800
just to do this.

845
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Can I say something?

846
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,800
Background checks

847
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,200
are very strict here now.

848
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,720
Even for a temporary job,

849
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,840
I think you should weigh your options.

850
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,280
Choose something more suitable.

851
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,160
Like what?

852
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,720
Ran, your pride is getting in the way.

853
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,480
If you'd told me

854
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,440
about Yudong's situation earlier,

855
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,840
I could've helped.

856
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,960
[I could've found him]

857
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,120
[a more valuable job.]

858
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,520
What he's doing now

859
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,080
just isn't really appropriate.

860
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,200
What's wrong with what he's doing now?

861
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,720
I didn't mean anything by it.

862
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,480
I just think...

863
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,840
[Yuan Yuan, what kind of work]

864
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,160
do you consider valuable?

865
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,680
I just think

866
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,000
it's a waste of Yudong's talent.

867
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,640
This afternoon,

868
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,840
Fu Yudong

869
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,000
worked his butt off to fix

870
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,320
the problem in your home, right?

871
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,720
That kind of work

872
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,960
should count as valuable, right?

873
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,560
What valuable work

874
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,600
does your husband do?

875
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,960
Is he out hustling again?

876
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,280
He's not home? Where did he go?

877
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,240
What's it to do with you?

878
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,040
Nothing to do with me.

879
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,960
I was just asking.

880
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,320
I heard...

881
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,320
He's busy.

882
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,440
He has no time to fool around.

883
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,160
You must be so lonely

884
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,800
in this big house all by yourself.

885
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,720
I heard

886
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,160
your relationship isn't great.

887
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,880
Are you getting a divorce?

888
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,800
Who told you that?

889
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,320
I forgot. But it doesn't matter.

890
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,680
If you are getting divorced,

891
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,880
you should definitely consult me.

892
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,040
I've been through it. I'm experienced.

893
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,960
I can tell you all about it.

894
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,720
Right. You do have experience.

895
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,600
[We won't]

896
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,640
[stay for dinner.]

897
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,880
Thanks for having us.

898
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,040
Well, Yuan Yuan,

899
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,000
if you're so kind-hearted,

900
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,520
give Yudong

901
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,400
a five-star review. Thanks.

902
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,440
A five-star review.

903
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,360
Okay. Good.

904
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,240
I'm sorry

905
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,560
you had to go through that today.

906
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,880
It's nothing. I'm fine.

907
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,960
Today I vented all my anger

908
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,280
since I got back.

909
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,240
Fu Yudong, let me say it again,

910
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,360
you did nothing wrong.

911
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,280
Your job is nothing to be ashamed of.

912
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,040
Neither of us

913
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,240
did anything wrong.

914
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,520
You're not being sarcastic, are you?

915
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,080
Dear former colleagues,

916
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,000
hello.

917
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
This is Zhang Ran.

918
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,920
[I've returned to start my own business.]

919
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,000
I've created an account.

920
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,840
Hope you all can support me by sharing,

921
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,160
commenting, and liking! Thank you!

922
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,240
Honey, you're amazing.

923
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,560
Your old self is back.

924
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,280
For a second,

925
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,520
it was like you were Sun Wukong,

926
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,400
landing from the sky

927
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,800
with your golden staff

928
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
and sitting right here.

929
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,720
This is the golden staff.

930
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,160
And you're sitting right here.

931
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,040
Yes.

932
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:18,920
Really?

933
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,560
Yes.

934
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,000
So cool.

935
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,080
I'm a bit hungry.

936
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,320
Perfect. I earned

937
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,320
some money today.

938
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,600
I'll treat you to skewers.

939
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,320
It's Yuan Yuan's money.

940
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,200
Spending her money makes it even better.

941
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,000
Let's go!

942
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,000
I want to earn her money too.

943
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,240
I'll go clean her house.

944
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,440
You won't earn much.

945
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,240
It adds up over time.

946
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,480
No need.

947
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,600
Come on.

948
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,760
What are you doing?

949
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,640
A fairy doesn't walk.

950
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,680
Hey, Yuan Yuan.

951
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,640
Come have some skewers.

952
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,000
Hello, everyone.

953
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,480
I'm Zhang Ran, the person behind

954
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,520
the "Desperate Personal Shopper" meme.

955
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,320
I don't know

956
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,600
if you recognized me.

957
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,440
I hope you'll all support me.

958
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,680
Please give me a like

959
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,440
and follow my account.

960
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,600
I kind of regret it now.

961
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,120
If... If I'd known

962
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,920
I was going to be filmed that day,

963
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,040
I would've worn

964
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,440
something brighter.

965
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,480
Back when I was a host,

966
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,440
I took

967
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,640
on-camera appearances very seriously.

968
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,160
I never just grabbed any clothes

969
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,080
for a show.

970
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,160
I'm Zhang Ran.

971
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,840
Hello, everyone! I'm Zhang Ran.

972
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,520
Hello.

973
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,680
Hello, I'm Zhang Ran.

974
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,920
I'm your host, Zhang Ran.

975
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,360
The thing is,

976
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,320
I'm pretty ordinary,

977
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,640
so I'm afraid people

978
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,400
might not remember me.

979
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,080
Do you know

980
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,280
why we have a contract?

981
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,480
Maybe it's because of

982
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,480
my work skills

983
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,440
or my on-camera experience?

984
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,240
I... I also had

985
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,800
a meme that went viral...

986
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,240
[You've finally hit the nail on the head.]

987
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,000
It's exactly

988
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,720
because of that meme.

989
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,520
And only because of that meme.

990
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,560
It's been years since I faced a camera.

991
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,840
Now that I'm meeting everyone again,

992
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,640
I really hope you'll remember me.

993
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,640
So today, I specifically wore

994
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,200
the same clothes I had on

995
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,600
when that meme was filmed.

996
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,120
So I

997
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,960
am Zhang Ran, the person behind

998
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,960
the "Desperate Personal Shopper" meme.

999
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,880
Thank you, everyone.

1000
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,200
Having dreams?

1001
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:30,920
Zhang Ran.

1002
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,000
Zhang Ran,

1003
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,600
your phone has been vibrating non-stop.

1004
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,400
Here.

1005
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
Let me get you some water.

1006
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,960
[Like a rocket!]

1007
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,000
[Come on, let's celebrate!]

1008
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,800
One hundred thousand!

1009
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,320
I'm replying to their comments.

1010
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,600
So that's the soda depot

1011
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,080
you loved as a kid, right?

1012
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,000
Yes.

1013
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,440
You remembered what I said.

1014
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,200
This was the logistics department

1015
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,720
of our sugar factory.

1016
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,960
In summer when they handed out cola,

1017
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,080
we'd line up here.

1018
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,440
It may look run-down now.

1019
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,720
But back then, it was

1020
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,320
the CBD of our sugar factory.

1021
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,520
The core crowded area

1022
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,600
was right here. Right here.

1023
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,680
I'm always happy when I come back here.

1024
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,200
I thought celebrating

1025
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:39,840
for my 100k followers here

1026
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,800
would be meaningful.

1027
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,520
[Absolutely.]

1028
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,520
More meaningful than a candlelit dinner.

1029
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,000
Exactly.

1030
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,760
Another toast.

1031
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,480
Cheers.

1032
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,480
When I was a kid, after getting my cola,

1033
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,000
I'd take two to school.

1034
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,960
One for me,

1035
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,760
and one for the kid I liked.

1036
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,840
Which kid did you like?

1037
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,600
A boy or a girl?

1038
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,560
A really

1039
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,840
cute little boy.

1040
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,600
No. Just kidding.

1041
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,320
For the dog.

1042
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,520
Male or female?

1043
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,840
So annoying. Take that!

1044
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,440
Back when I couldn't

1045
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,320
get my videos right,

1046
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,280
you told me it was fine,

1047
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,000
and if it didn't work out,

1048
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,520
we can just go back.

1049
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,880
At first, it sounded pretty pessimistic.

1050
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,080
But it actually

1051
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,240
made me feel really secure.

1052
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,320
I feel like

1053
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,160
with you always supporting me,

1054
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,480
encouraging me,

1055
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,680
and having my back,

1056
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,840
I'm not afraid of anything.

1057
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,240
So I just charge ahead.

1058
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,160
And look,

1059
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,240
I actually made it work.

1060
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,640
Who would've thought?

1061
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,000
You're the one who's amazing.

1062
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,280
Anyway,

1063
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,280
I'll keep working hard.

1064
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,400
I'm determined to

1065
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,760
make something of myself on this path.

1066
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,160
I hope you'll

1067
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,280
keep supporting me, honey.

1068
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,680
Absolutely.

1069
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,520
This place really is

1070
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,320
your lucky spot.

1071
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,920
I can almost feel

1072
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,120
how glorious it used to be.

1073
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:07,840
Right?

1074
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,920
Look at those characters on the wall.

1075
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,520
Struggling gets you fire.

1076
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,560
Yes, but why the fire?

1077
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
No. It's

1078
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,400
struggling gets you on fire.

1079
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,880
Where is the preposition?

1080
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,880
You should get some paint

1081
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,760
and fix it tomorrow.

1082
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,720
Here. Everything I want to say

1083
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,560
boils down to one sentence.

1084
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,840
May you get on fire!

1085
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,640
Can you do it?

1086
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,040
What's this? A fake burp.

1087
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,960
This is what we did

1088
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,760
when we drank cola as kids.

1089
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,560
I can't do it.

1090
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,160
Try.

1091
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:41,720
I can't.

1092
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,840
Listen, the whole point

1093
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,280
of drinking cola is to burp.

1094
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,000
I can't make myself burp.

1095
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,520
Really. Just try. Come on.

1096
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,760
I always drink it but I can't do it.

1097
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,320
You stop

1098
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,120
whenever I stop.

1099
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,840
Feel great?

1100
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,600
Where's the force coming from?

1101
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,560
Take a few more big gulps.

1102
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,560
Tell me, where do I push from?

1103
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,480
Honey, your tonsils

1104
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,680
are a bit big.

1105
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,680
We need to go to the hospital tomorrow.

1106
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,640
Does your cola still have fizz?

1107
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,560
Let's try another one.

1108
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,760
-Honey, you...
-Come on.

1109
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,520
I really wish

1110
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,440
you could do it like me.

1111
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,400
Your lymph nodes are a bit...

1112
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,600
Come on, try.

1113
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,480
Always forgetting things when going out.

1114
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,760
So scatterbrained.

1115
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,320
By the bed. Where?

1116
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,280
I don't know.

1117
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,440
[Just search around that area.]

1118
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,240
[Check around the dressing table.]

1119
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,800
Not in the nightstand.

1120
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,120
[Around the dressing table.]

1121
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,720
The dressing table.

1122
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,880
[Hurry up, honey.]

1123
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,240
[The bank's about to close!]

1124
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,280
Okay. I know!

1125
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,080
[Found it? Need me to help?]

1126
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,040
No. Found it!
