1
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,320
So well-behaved! Name?

2
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,080
Staying still.

3
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,560
Its name is "Budong".

4
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,640
"Budong"?

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,800
Nah, its name is Happy.

6
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,759
That's a nice name. Happy.

7
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,479
Hey, Happy!

8
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,280
Did you get in touch with your dad?

9
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,800
Yes, I did.

10
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:57,840
I totally forgot

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,880
about the time difference.

12
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Thanks for letting me stay here,

13
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,080
or I'd be sleeping rough tonight.

14
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,880
I don't believe that.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,520
Really!

16
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,600
I actually like it here.

17
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,520
It feels safe.

18
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,759
Can I ask you something?

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,520
My dad won't be back home for a while,

20
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,880
so during this time,

21
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,320
could I stay here?

22
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,520
Because my stepmother

23
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,360
and her son are at home...

24
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,960
I understand.

25
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,600
Thanks.

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,840
I remember you told me

27
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,000
you were raised by your grandmother.

28
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,480
Quite a lot has happened recently.

29
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,240
Yu posted the clip

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,040
of you as a designated driver

31
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,520
in the overseas students' group.

32
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,160
Only then did I know you were back.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,880
Stop messing with the sofa.

34
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,800
If you don't mind,

35
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,640
I've cleaned up that room.

36
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,960
You can stay there.

37
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,360
I'm fine with it

38
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,240
as long as you don't mind.

39
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
Thanks, that's really kind of you.

40
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,560
Hey... why'd you

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,040
end up working at the zoo?

42
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,640
I never knew

43
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
you liked animals.

44
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,640
My grandmother loves animals.

45
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,320
She says they're easier than people.

46
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,600
There are lots of pigeons upstairs.

47
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Can I use them as models?

48
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,800
I want to draw them.

49
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,160
You flew all this way

50
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,240
just to draw pigeons?

51
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Of course not!

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,320
Pigeons are everywhere.

53
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,120
I draw what I see.

54
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,560
I signed a contract with a gallery.

55
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,880
I came back to sign the contract

56
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,960
and get some inspiration.

57
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,640
You want to draw pigeons?

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,600
Go ahead.

59
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,320
This place works.

60
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,880
The view is nice.

61
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,320
I can set up my canvas

62
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,080
right here

63
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
and paint.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,680
Sure, sure.

65
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,760
The environment is pretty basic.

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,000
If you're serious about art,

67
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,320
clean up this mess first.

68
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,279
How amateur.

69
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,760
Art can happen anywhere.

70
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,360
Remember when we used to

71
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,240
be at the activity center

72
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,040
or community center,

73
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,680
rehearsing?

74
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,120
How's the drama club doing now?

75
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,080
The drama club?

76
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,440
Well,

77
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,240
it disbanded right after you left.

78
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,159
Without you there,

79
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,240
what's the point of getting together?

80
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,080
Let me ask you,

81
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,280
why did you never

82
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,320
keep in touch with everyone?

83
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,520
Did you really not

84
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
miss any of us?

85
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,600
Looking back now,

86
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,400
in Canada,

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,080
I was quite naive.

88
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,200
Back then with the drama club,

89
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,360
I wasn't even sure

90
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,160
if I was really interested.

91
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,040
For me,

92
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,160
it was just killing time.

93
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,040
Am I hearing right,

94
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,760
Ge Kaiyang?

95
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,080
This doesn't sound like you.

96
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,960
Didn't you always say

97
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,760
to just do things

98
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,160
without overthinking the meaning?

99
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,000
If it's fun,

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,080
isn't that enough?

101
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,400
Experience changes people.

102
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,200
After losing everything,

103
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,000
I see how privileged that sounded.

104
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,920
When I was in Canada,

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,840
I sometimes had this

106
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,120
internal dialogue

107
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,040
about the

108
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
meaning of life.

109
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,360
Back then,

110
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,360
I thought living happily

111
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,960
was enough to make life worthwhile.

112
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,760
It wasn't until I came back

113
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,080
that I realized how much I'd missed.

114
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,680
I failed my grandmother

115
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,320
and I failed

116
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,800
to handle things at home.

117
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,080
I just hope

118
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,880
that from now on,

119
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,720
I don't fail anyone else.

120
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
There's also someone else

121
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,400
I owe a lot to.

122
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,320
That's my emotional knot.

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,360
Can you tell me now

124
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,520
why you came back too?

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,720
Kuang Dazhi's personal guarantee

126
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,640
fell through.

127
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,760
My work visa was cancelled.

128
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,120
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,680
It's okay. It's all in the past.

130
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,320
Why don't you go home?

131
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,760
I... I came back

132
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,600
in a panic.

133
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,440
Which home should I go to?

134
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,920
What are your plans now?

135
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,480
I just hope my parents' issues

136
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,520
get resolved soon.

137
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,840
Live well

138
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,920
and take care of my grandmother.

139
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,840
I wonder when I die,

140
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,440
what will be written on this form,

141
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,000
and who will

142
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,080
fill it out for me.

143
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,600
So much happened after I got back.

144
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,280
Luckily, Lu Xinying was there.

145
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,640
Otherwise I don't know

146
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,520
how I'd have made it.

147
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,600
How did you two end up

148
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,280
like this now?

149
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,440
I don't want to get into details.

150
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
But I definitely owe her a lot.

151
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,640

Hello,

179
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,320
Mr. Li!

180
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,080
Um, about this...

181
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,560
I received the pilot program proposal,

182
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,120
but why is it only

183
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,440
Mr. Fu?

184
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,280
I understand,

185
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,800
I understand.

186
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,880
Yes, but Mr. Fu...

187
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,600
I know, I know.

188
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,520
You see, because Mr. Fu

189
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,680
is actually

190
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,840
very shy.

191
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,840
Yes, and

192
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,160
when he sees cameras,

193
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,280
he'll definitely be nervous.

194
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,160
I was thinking maybe I could

195
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
participate too,

196
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,440
help create a better atmosphere,

197
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,240
and then also

198
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,400
introduce the products.

199
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,120
What do you think?

200
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,800
I understand.

201
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,840
I understand.

202
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,800
Alright,

203
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,960
I get it.

204
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,360
Of course, I get it.

205
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,800
Okay then.

206
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,600
Alright, that's it.

207
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,240
Good!

208
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,680
Thank you!

209
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,880
Well,

210
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,800
you go alone.

211
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,040
It's impossible, absolutely impossible.

212
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,520
Go alone

213
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,600
and face the cameras?

214
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,800
Wasn't it agreed before?

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,360
I'm just supposed to be a mascot

216
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,480
while you do the talking!

217
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,400
Well, they don't want me,

218
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,160
so you'll have to go solo now.

219
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,760
Don't mess up!

220
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,800
Let's do this,

221
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,560
forget about the brand story first,

222
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,040
memorize the product introduction.

223
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,640
Hurry up!

224
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,120
You go!

225
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,160
Quick!

226
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,560
These clinical trials,

227
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,440
I'll just

228
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,560
display them

229
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,080
for you to read.

230
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,840
You do it.

231
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,120
Get moving!

232
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,560
Quick!

233
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,840
How can I remember all this?

234
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,160
You're a PhD,

235
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,240
what can't you memorize?

236
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Let me see,

237
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,000
these Asian skin characteristics...

238
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,720
How about I

239
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,960
write them on your hand?

240
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,280
I think

241
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,200
tonight's going to be tough

242
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,120
if you need to memorize.

243
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,480
In a foreign land,

244
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,680
we faced

245
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,560
many challenges together.

246
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,000
I saw my wife's

247
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,520
struggle with skin issues

248
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,960
caused by the new

249
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,800
climate and environment.

250
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,720
Watching her

251
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,880
in discomfort

252
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,240
broke my heart.

253
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,880
Please stop! I'm begging you!

254
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,280
Does this sound natural?

255
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,360
The way you're speaking, really,

256
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,080
is even worse than

257
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,000
AI reading!

258
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,800
You have such good resources,

259
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,360
but here you are,

260
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,080
memorizing this,

261
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,280
while I have to watch.

262
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,080
What resources?

263
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,080
Zhang Ran,

264
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,520
the host, broadcaster, and influencer,

265
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,160
could easily coach you!

266
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,360
Are you two still on bad terms?

267
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,600
Look at what you're doing,

268
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,280
making me feel so guilty!

269
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,400
My bad.

270
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,800
Really!

271
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,480
Really, from now on,

272
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,960
I won't say anything, really.

273
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,480
But you can't entirely blame me.

274
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,520
Yudong, let me tell you,

275
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,760
such a big thing with your father,

276
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,600
you didn't tell Ran about it!

277
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,000
Are you still letting me memorize?

278
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,920
Are you still letting me

279
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,200
participate in this pilot?

280
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,080
Fine, you're a rare specimen now,

281
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,080
just keep memorizing.

282
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,480
About my situation with her,

283
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,960
it's complicated to explain.

284
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,960
What do you mean?

285
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,640
That day,

286
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,800
I meant to explain

287
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
but got interrupted

288
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,400
and missed the chance.

289
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,440
But she should understand.

290
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,760
No, what do you mean by 'should'?

291
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,960
You can't just guess in relationships!

292
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,320
Ran even came to me

293
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,800
specifically about this matter!

294
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,880
About Cheng Man's merits and interests...

295
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,680
There are so many merits.

296
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,640
Basically,

297
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,280
all of humanity's virtues.

298
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,000
She has a bit of each one.

299
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,720
Does she have

300
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,920
anything she particularly likes.

301
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,240
She loves lots of things.

302
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
Fresh air, healthy food.

303
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,840
Flowers and plants, jewelry.

304
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
She loves them all.

305
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,560
My son.

306
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,280
And me too.

307
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,480
She's quite fond of both.

308
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,280
Drink like that, you'll get thrown out.

309
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,800
Is that so?

310
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,440
Yes.

311
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,640
I'll kick you out.

312
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,920
She asked you about Cheng Man.

313
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,320
She wants to learn from a good example.

314
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,600
She just wanted to learn

315
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,080
how to be a good wife?

316
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,280
Look at her.

317
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,920
So proactive at solving problems.

318
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,120
Now look at yourself.

319
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,280
You should

320
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,320
step up your game.

321
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
Nian.

322
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,440
Why are you

323
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,520
playing with puzzles here?

324
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,160
Where's Mom?

325
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,080
His mom's not here. But I'm here.

326
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,920
Why are you here?

327
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,280
Don't let him drink that.

328
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,720
His mom doesn't allow it!

329
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,480
His mom's not home right now!

330
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
Come on, quick! Nian...

331
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,880
Where did his mom go?

332
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,880
She went out for dinner.

333
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,080
With whom?

334
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,640
How should I know?

335
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,960
Slow down.

336
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,680
Come here.

337
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,480
Who is it?

338
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,400
Yudong, what's up?

339
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,120
Who's Zhang Ran

340
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,200
having dinner with?

341
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,800
I might be wrong.

342
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,280
Probably with Cheng Man.

343
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,520
She wants to learn from her.

344
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Don't slack off.

345
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
It's a good chance

346
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,520
to practice those eight dishes.

347
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,480
Get out.

348
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,960
Mom, can you do something about him?

349
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,640
Yudong's getting so disrespectful.

350
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,720
Nian, go to your room

351
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,880
and play for a while, okay?

352
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,920
Come on, Nian, be good.

353
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,880
Dad will play with you.

354
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,520
Let him play alone.

355
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,640
No, I'll go with him.

356
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,080
No, he should play alone.

357
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,800
I want to play.

358
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,480
He plays alone! Sit down.

359
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,720
Take this, quick.

360
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,440
Nian, go play

361
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,160
in the tent.

362
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,640
Wait for me in the tent.

363
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,280
We'll play

364
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,120
Crazy Caveman later.

365
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,000
Don't spill it.

366
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,040
The cavemen are invading.

367
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,440
Stop howling - sit down.

368
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,920
My ears are bad.

369
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,800
I don't want to hear anything.

370
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,520
Don't talk.

371
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,480
Bad ears or not, you have to listen.

372
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,120
I've gone deaf.

373
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,800
Can't hear anything.

374
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,200
This is serious.

375
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,640
Look at this child.

376
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,520
At this age,

377
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,840
still staying at home.

378
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,960
No, about this,

379
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,800
Cheng Man has her own plans.

380
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,880
She'll plan and arrange things herself.

381
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,600
Just leave it be, okay?

382
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,200
I'm his grandmother.

383
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,240
How can I not worry?

384
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,040
What about Cheng Man's

385
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,960
arrangements?

386
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,000
What plan does she have?

387
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,920
Her arrangement is just

388
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,920
to keep the child at home.

389
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,720
Kids need to play with other kids.

390
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,680
They need to be outside often,

391
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,280
running around, back and forth.

392
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,000
That's how their personality develops,

393
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,880
right?

394
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,920
That's how they'll

395
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,240
integrate into society faster.

396
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,120
Staying home all day,

397
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,840
what kind of life is that?

398
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,560
Are you sleeping?

399
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,840
No need to integrate into the society.

400
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,360
How old is he anyway?

401
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,640
What do you want from him?

402
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,880
You tell me.

403
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,440
You're being ridiculous,

404
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,360
making alarmist statements.

405
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,760
How am I being alarmist?

406
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,080
I'm stating facts.

407
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,800
Fine, I see

408
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,839
how it is.

409
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,440
No matter what I say,

410
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,599
it's wrong.

411
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,400
While your wife Cheng Man,

412
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,720
everything she says is right.

413
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,760
You always just say yes

414
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,599
to everything.

415
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,040
Everything she says is right.

416
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,839
I just don't understand you.

417
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,440
A dignified grown man like you,

418
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,160
six feet

419
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,520
tall.

420
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,200
Your family has just three people,

421
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,720
including that hamster.

422
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,920
Son, you rank fourth.

423
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,520
I'm telling you.

424
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,120
Your family status is really concerning.

425
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,400
Mrs. Wang, you're now attempting

426
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,320
to stir up trouble

427
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,400
in my family.

428
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,240
You...

429
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,920
Besides, at our home,

430
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,040
how do I not have status?

431
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,520
Look, the living room now

432
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,560
is all my space.

433
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,800
This is all mine too, see.

434
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,880
Come on, is this really yours?

435
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,480
This is her greenhouse.

436
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,400
Knew it was a greenhouse. Sharp.

437
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,440
At least I have

438
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,120
one small area.

439
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,520
Stop joking around, I'm being serious.

440
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,200
Stop laughing.

441
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,720
Okay.

442
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,040
So full of ideas?

443
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,440
Tell Cheng Man yourself.

444
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,720
I'm afraid when relaying your message,

445
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,400
I might miss something.

446
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,240
No.

447
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,600
You know I don't dare talk to her.

448
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
That's why I'm telling you.

449
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,880
I've found the root.

450
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,000
I got it from you.

451
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,480
Get out.

452
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,480
Yudong got it from you too.

453
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,640
Look at this.

454
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,960
How did you pass these traits

455
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,200
even to Yudong?

456
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,480
Stop talking nonsense.

457
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,840
I'm trying to discuss something serious.

458
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,520
I'm trying to discuss

459
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,800
something serious.

460
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,000
I know, I know. You don't worry.

461
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,040
Stop playing, Nian.

462
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,920
Dad will take you to university.

463
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,560
Damn you.

464
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,760
You're killing me.

465
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,840
Come here, caveman.

466
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,760
Don't listen to your dad.

467
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,080
He's talking nonsense.

468
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,160
Weren't we playing cavemen?

469
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Why are you playing video games now?

470
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,400
Just let him play games.

471
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,080
Sit down.

472
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,840
Your mom's not home.

473
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,440
You're really letting loose.

474
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
This will do for now.

475
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,360
Okay, please wait.

476
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,520
Let me pour it.

477
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,240
Thank you.

478
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,520
I've been wanting to find a chance

479
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,840
to thank Li Daoqi and you

480
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,960
for helping us so much.

481
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,760
This is something I bought for you.

482
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,840
I picked it.

483
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,120
I don't know if you'll like it.

484
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,120
If you don't like it,

485
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,880
I can exchange it.

486
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,040
Don't look at me like that.

487
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,560
I don't have other intentions.

488
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,200
Li Daoqi and Fu Yudong

489
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,680
are like brothers anyway.

490
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,880
If we look at it that way,

491
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,320
we're sisters-in-law.

492
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,520
It's not strange for me to treat

493
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,760
a sister-in-law to dinner.

494
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,240
Tell me what's on your mind.

495
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,320
Just a small matter.

496
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,080
I want to invite you to be my friend

497
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,040
and record a talk video.

498
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,720
I've never recorded videos before.

499
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,400
I'm new

500
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,560
to your industry.

501
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,080
Besides,

502
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,080
we're not really close friends.

503
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,680
Right?

504
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,520
I'm sorry.

505
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,400
Actually,

506
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,800
there's a script.

507
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,440
If during the recording,

508
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,280
anything goes wrong.

509
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,320
I'll definitely take responsibility.

510
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,560
Isn't that deceptive?

511
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,080
Zhang Ran.

512
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,720
Maybe you're used to deceiving yourself.

513
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,480
But I'm not.

514
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,160
I'm not questioning you.

515
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,480
It's just... we work in different fields.

516
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,080
We're different people.

517
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,600
Don't rush to decide.

518
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,360
Let me honestly

519
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,600
talk to you about myself.

520
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,600
Mom!

521
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,040
Mom!

522
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,840
It's so late.

523
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,400
Why are you still here?

524
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,400
Let me call you a car.

525
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,680
I'm really sorry.

526
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,560
It's fine.

527
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,840
I can spend

528
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,320
more time with my grandson.

529
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,720
I made some white fungus soup for you,

530
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,520
wait, let me get you some.

531
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,160
Thanks, Mom.

532
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,120
Don't mention it.

533
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,960
The temperature's just right.

534
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,720
Mom, did you give Nian candy again?

535
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,480
Well...

536
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,920
He was crying so hard,

537
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,840
I couldn't calm him down.

538
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,840
All that crying is no reason for candy.

539
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,080
If you satisfy him once,

540
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,120
what about next time?

541
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,280
This added sugar

542
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,760
is not only bad for his teeth,

543
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,400
but also affects his intelligence.

544
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,720
Is it that serious?

545
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,320
I actually ate most of it.

546
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,560
That medical journal

547
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,360
I showed you before...

548
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,520
Especially with

549
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,000
Nian's condition now,

550
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,120
it's particularly bad.

551
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,040
That... that journal,

552
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,440
I didn't really understand it.

553
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,640
I'll remember this time.

554
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,280
If you want

555
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,560
me to watch Nian next time,

556
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,320
whatever requirements you have,

557
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,400
just tell me in advance.

558
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,200
If anything's unclear.

559
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,360
Are you fighting?

560
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,840
What are you talking about?

561
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,040
I called you a car.

562
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,160
It's here, let's go.

563
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,200
The car is here?

564
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,000
Go, go, hurry!

565
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,600
I'll go then.

566
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,560
Remember to drink the soup!

567
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,480
Thanks, Mom.

568
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
You're welcome.

569
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,160
Oh!

570
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,360
I almost forgot.

571
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,480
Since Li Daoqi

572
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,680
sold the wedding house for his startup,

573
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,520
so after thinking it over,

574
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,760
I had to set some aside for you.

575
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,280
Take it.

576
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,040
No, no, no!

577
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,480
This money was given to you.

578
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,280
This house is yours now.

579
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,160
Take it.

580
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,800
You've supported him enough.

581
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,920
And now you

582
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,040
don't have much income.

583
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,400
Consider it our filial duty.

584
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,680
Take it.

585
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,800
Don't look at me.

586
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,880
It's not from me.

587
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,840
I tried to persuade her last night.

588
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,960
She insisted on giving it to you.

589
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,000
This is her filial duty to you alone.

590
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,640
Well, well...

591
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,320
If that's the case,

592
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,680
then let's consider

593
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,280
this money as being kept with me.

594
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,640
When you need money,

595
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,440
just ask me.

596
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,640
I'll give it back to you.

597
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,840
Alright, alright, that's settled then.

598
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,640
Okay, time to go.

599
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,160
The car's here, the car's here!

600
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,880
Hurry, it's late!

601
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
Okay, get some rest.

602
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,280
Okay.

603
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,760
We're going.

604
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,960
Thanks, Mom.

605
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,840
It's no trouble.

606
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
Don't forget to drink the soup!

607
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,760
Take care, take care!

608
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,240
Text me when you get home.

609
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,960
I will, I will.

610
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
Take out all the money

611
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,400
and bury it in the hole.

612
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,840
I'll bury you instead.

613
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,480
Goodbye.

614
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,080
Goodbye.

615
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,880
Take care.

616
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,560
I know.

617
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,560
Time for bed, time for bed.

618
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,200
Time for bed, time for bed.

619
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,560
Someone doesn't want to sleep.

620
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,680
Are you not tired?

621
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,720
Stop spoiling your mother.

622
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,600
We have to be firm about Nian.

623
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,200
Right. She won't come next time.

624
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,240
She only causes problems.

625
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,560
I'll tell the security

626
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,200
whenever they see her,

627
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,080
to escort her out.

628
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,040
I'm being serious.

629
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,960
I know, I know.

630
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,600
But sometimes,

631
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,560
with Nian, you're really

632
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,800
a bit too worried.

633
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,320
It's unnecessary.

634
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,680
What do you mean "too worried"?

635
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,800
He's my child!

636
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,400
Who else should I worry about if not him?

637
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,840
Yes, I'm talking about my mom.

638
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,840
My mom came today

639
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,160
to cover for you, right?

640
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,280
And taking care of Nian is not easy.

641
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,920
She even made you white fungus soup

642
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,880
and everything,

643
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,880
worried you'd be hungry coming home late.

644
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
It's just a piece of candy.

645
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,320
You come in and say all that.

646
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,080
Eating candies is no big deal.

647
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,560
I've been eating candies since little,

648
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,640
right?

649
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,480
She's elderly.

650
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,200
Couldn't you be more understanding?

651
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,640
I know your mom worked hard,

652
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,000
but about the candy issue,

653
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,600
I've already

654
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,320
told her many times.

655
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,440
And, look,

656
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,440
Nian must have

657
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,600
played games all night.

658
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,400
Look at this!

659
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,320
When did he turn on the game console?

660
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,120
I don't even know.

661
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,040
Was it my mom who played?

662
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,160
She loves playing games these days.

663
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,640
Let me tell you,

664
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,800
we should just hire a nanny.

665
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,600
Then your mom won't

666
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,440
work so hard.

667
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,440
One isn't enough. Let's hire four!

668
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,520
Put up a protective circle

669
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,440
with Nian in the center,

670
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,240
so nothing and no one

671
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,680
can get near him!

672
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,360
Fine, I understand.

673
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,080
I'll seriously tell my mom.

674
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,440
I've realized that

675
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,520
this matter is very serious.

676
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,000
I'll let her know, don't worry.

677
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,400
I'll tell her

678
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,240
to listen to you, absolutely.

679
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
Listen,

680
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,960
everything I do now

681
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,080
is for Nian and you.

682
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,520
Why did I

683
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,800
come home so late tonight?

684
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,600
I had dinner with Ran

685
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,200
for your sake, you know?

686
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,840
Yes, yes.

687
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,080
And you're still criticizing me!

688
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,680
Really, Zhang Ran must

689
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,760
learn from you, truly.

690
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,640
Compared to you, Zhang Ran

691
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,400
is nothing.

692
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,720
Wanna take a shower?

693
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,680
No.

694
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,760
I can scrub your back.

695
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,400
No need.

696
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,640
Then you scrub mine?

697
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,040
No.

698
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,200
Just a little scrub...

699
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,280
These influencers nowadays

700
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,640
are really interesting.

701
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,040
It's getting a bit oily.

702
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,560
Perfect!

703
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,040
Please put on your earpieces.

704
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,760
Can we wear them on either side?

705
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,520
Yes.

706
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,040
When the director speaks,

707
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,280
we'll all be able to hear.

708
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,400
If later

709
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,640
things get too intense,

710
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,120
do you have any concerns?

711
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,920
I'm fine with anything.

712
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,320
You're the main character, up to you.

713
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,640
Do you have any?

714
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,200
Even if I do, it's okay.

715
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,440
I can overcome it.

716
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,240
Let's just

717
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,160
be honest with each other.

718
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,840
Lying would be too troublesome.

719
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,440
Okay.

720
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,960
Alright, crew members,

721
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,040
please clear out!

722
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,760
I know you don't like me.

723
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,720
Actually, I don't like you much either.

724
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,920
The reason I came to meet you today

725
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,240
is because

726
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,080
I have no one else to turn to.

727
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,520
I don't have any close friends.

728
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,240
As a person,

729
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,360
I have some personality issues.

730
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,800
So whether in China or abroad,

731
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,720
I don't have many friends.

732
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,320
Despite how I've appeared

733
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,480
successful these years,

734
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,280
it doesn't really matter.

735
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,000
When times are good,

736
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,360
you feel like you're surrounded

737
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,840
by friends.

738
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,720
But once good times have passed,

739
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,120
you're left with no one.

740
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,080
It's quite sad.

741
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,920
I thought

742
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,960
about finding an extra to help out.

743
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,800
But after thinking it through,

744
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
at least I know Li Daoqi

745
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,400
inside out.

746
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,040
You wouldn't try to cheat me.

747
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,440
So I thought today,

748
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
we could give it a try.

749
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,960
It's okay. I can understand

750
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,000
if you don't want to.

751
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,720
And you indeed have every right to be.

752
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,480
That's fine.

753
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Do you think we

754
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,720
look like close friends?

755
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,280
Whether believe it or not is their business.

756
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,880
If you're willing to help me,

757
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,760
I'll accept whatever they think.

758
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,720
Okay, let's look at the next question.

759
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,360
Have you ever

760
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,640
talked behind your best friend's back?

761
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,760
Please answer.

762
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,840
Three, two, one. Show your answers.

763
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,960
Great, Team Anran

764
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,200
gets another point.

765
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,720
For this round of

766
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,920
the "Meeting of Minds" segment...

767
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,160
Isn't it about being honest?

768
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm just trying

769
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,440
to make myself look good.

770
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,360
I'll be honest on the next question.

771
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,160
I've checked out

772
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,080
the other nine brands' products.

773
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,960
Let me tell you, tonight,

774
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,240
they're just to make up the numbers.

775
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,760
I have a feeling

776
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,760
that Dr. Fu

777
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,120
might become famous overnight.

778
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,640
Just watch.

779
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,000
Dr. Fu, Mr. Li.

780
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,280
Hello, Ms. Wang!

781
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,480
Well.

782
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,680
I think you're clear

783
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,760
about the livestream process.

784
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,160
Yes.

785
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,600
But I still need to emphasize.

786
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,600
In tonight's stream,

787
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,440
including yours,

788
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,680
there will be ten brands.

789
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,160
Understood.

790
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,840
Each brand has five minutes

791
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,600
to showcase products.

792
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,040
Five minutes?

793
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,640
Yes, during these five minutes,

794
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,240
please make sure to follow

795
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,520
the outline we sent you earlier

796
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,720
and introduce the products one by one.

797
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,920
Lady Wan will lead you.

798
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,320
Understood.

799
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,200
Follow her lead

800
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,040
and introduce accordingly.

801
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,120
Understood. Don't worry.

802
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,160
Hold on, let me greet Lady Wan.

803
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,520
I'll be right back.

804
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,200
Dr. Fu, did you understand

805
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,280
what I just said?

806
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,240
Do I need to repeat?

807
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,880
No need.

808
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,240
Then please prepare yourself.

809
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
Lady Wan, this is Dr. Fu.

810
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
He might be very nervous,

811
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,480
so please try your best

812
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,920
to support us.

813
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,960
If anything goes wrong,

814
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,040
try to bring him back on track.

815
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,920
Thank you, thank you.

816
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Thank you.

817
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,040
Relax.

818
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,760
Lady Wan has everything under control.

819
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,800
Just stay calm.

820
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,280
Be as natural

821
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,840
and relaxed as possible.

822
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,320
No problem.

823
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,880
It's over...

824
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,320
What's wrong?

825
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,360
No, no, don't say that.

826
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,520
I can't remember

827
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,760
a single word.

828
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,000
That's good!

829
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,120
It means you and Dr. Fu.

830
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,960
have become one.

831
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,320
This is what we call

832
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
the greatest form has no shape.

833
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,920
And the greatest memory is like forgetting.

834
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,800
Is that even a saying?

835
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,000
Relax, it's fine.

836
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,960
It's fine.

837
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,840
Relax.

838
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,320
You're doing great.

839
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,720
Hello, Dr. Fu!

840
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,040
I want to ask on behalf of all girls.

841
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
How can we girls

842
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,520
maintain our best skin condition?

843
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,280
Sunscreen.

844
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,040
That is, try to avoid

845
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,320
direct sun exposure.

846
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,960
For example,

847
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,400
for who live in coastal areas

848
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,200
and highland regions,

849
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,040
and who

850
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,480
often engage in outdoor activities

851
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,720
and work,

852
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,080
their skin

853
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,280
gets damaged more severely.

854
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,600
Instead, those who

855
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,160
live in places with year-round rain

856
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,360
where they don't get

857
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,400
much sun exposure,

858
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,160
their skin is much better.

859
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,760
What if we get

860
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,520
sunburnt?

861
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,600
The best way

862
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,520
is to apply some aloe vera gel.

863
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,040
What should we use

864
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,760
to repair our skin?

865
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,720
Repair...

866
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
How to repair it?

867
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,640
For...

868
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,240
For repair...

869
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,760
There's something called

870
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,920
ceramides.

871
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,080
It exists in our

872
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,120
skin's stratum corneum as

873
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,560
a phospholipid.

874
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,560
It can function as

875
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,640
repairing our damaged skin

876
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,040
and moisturizing.

877
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,160
Yeah.

878
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,840
How about your wife?

879
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,240
My wife is doing well.

880
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,560
As far as I know,

881
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,080
when you were studying

882
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,000
in Toronto,

883
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,640
you lived with your wife.

884
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,080
The climate there,

885
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,040
along with skincare products

886
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
for your wife's

887
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,120
sensitive skin type, was very unfriendly.

888
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,600
You tried many methods,

889
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,720
but nothing helped.

890
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,360
So you decided

891
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,960
to develop your own product,

892
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,280
is that right?

893
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,920
Yes, my wife's

894
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,760
skin is actually...

895
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,120
Her metabolism speed

896
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,120
is relatively slow,

897
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,280
so the conventional

898
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,840
moisturizing and hydrating products,

899
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,040
including those

900
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,200
for skin repair,

901
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,680
didn't really

902
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,320
help much.

903
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,080
So there's something called

904
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,320
bifida ferment.

905
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,800
What it mainly does is

906
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,960
to increase our skin's

907
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
metabolism,

908
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,000
while at the same time

909
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,200
it helps delay aging.

910
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,280
It's impossible

911
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,880
that using any single product

912
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,280
can fix

913
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,720
all of

914
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
the skin problems.

915
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,120
If any brands

916
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,720
claim that

917
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,080
after using their products,

918
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,120
you can go back to

919
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,160
how you looked

920
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,840
years ago,

921
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,240
it's either a scam

922
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,400
or the products contain hormones.

923
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,040
Right, I remember things

924
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,240
about bifida ferment

925
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,680
and anti-aging.

926
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,920
Yeah.

927
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,960
From chemistry

928
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,240
background,

929
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,480
there are many things

930
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,960
I can explain to you.

931
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,720
It's quite easy to understand.

932
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,840
I think if I explain it,

933
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,480
it might be

934
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,600
somewhat helpful to you

935
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,680
about skincare.

936
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,840
I just thought of something.

937
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,880
Would you like to hear it?

938
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,360
Yes.

939
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:17,920
Okay.

940
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,520
Of course!

941
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,200
Hold on.

942
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,800
Do you have a pen?

943
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,680
Thanks.

944
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,120
This...

945
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,320
Bifida...

946
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,360
What's he going to talk about?

947
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,520
He's probably going to say

948
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,840
some chemistry equations

949
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,760
related to his major

950
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,680
and such.

951
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,000
How long is he going to talk?

952
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,280
I should tell you all,

953
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,440
you only have one minute left.

954
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,680
I know.

955
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,280
Everyone knows

956
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,440
ceramide's

957
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,560
molecular formula

958
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,480
is quite complex

959
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,080
for ordinary people.

960
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,120
I won't get into that.

961
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,639
I'll just explain

962
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,679
what you can understand.

963
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,400
Through synthesis,

964
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,679
it reduces to

965
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,040
what's actually called

966
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,400
sphinganine.

967
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,520
Finally...

968
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:20,800
Lady Wan

969
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,000
seems to be losing interest.

970
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,320
It's over.

971
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,560
Fu Yudong...

972
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,719
Isn't this failing at the last hurdle?

973
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,040
Well, that's

974
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
basically it.

975
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,159
If you have

976
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,440
any questions,

977
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,800
ask me anytime.

978
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,880
I will

979
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,800
answer them online.

980
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,920
Thank you. Thank you, Lady Wan.

981
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:53,840
Well then...

982
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,840
Wait, Dr. Fu,

983
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,000
we haven't sold anything yet!

984
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,800
Come, sit down.

985
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,720
Let's talk.

986
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,080
Yes, we haven't sold anything yet.

987
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,440
Did you use molecular formulas

988
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,640
to pursue your wife back then?

989
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,960
Don't be shy!

990
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,440
Who pursued whom first?

991
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,320
How did you meet?

992
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,760
We...

993
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,360
Weren't we supposed to be selling products?

994
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,480
Alright, let's sell first.

995
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,600
Everyone, if you're

996
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,440
interested in Dr. Fu's story,

997
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,240
then please

998
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,640
show your support!

999
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,440
Three, two, one,

1000
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
link is up!

1001
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,920
Sold out instantly!

1002
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,920
Sold out!

1003
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,280
Dr. Fu, we've hit one thousand orders.

1004
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,200
Since our consumers are so supportive,

1005
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,800
shouldn't you

1006
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,960
answer the question from earlier?

1007
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,160
Actually, there wasn't really

1008
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,040
any pursuing between us.

1009
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,360
It just happened naturally.

1010
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,240
I don't believe that!

1011
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,360
Look,

1012
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,840
everyone wants you to tell the full story!

1013
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,520
No, no, let's not...

1014
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,320
Actually, I...

1015
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,160
Weren't we here to sell products?

1016
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,360
We've sold out.

1017
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,680
Let's leave that time for

1018
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,800
other brands.

1019
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,520
Don't waste their time.

1020
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,800
Wait!

1021
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,080
Mr. Li,

1022
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,640
can we add another thousand orders?

1023
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,680
No problem at all!

1024
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,400
Alright, three, two, one,

1025
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,120
link is up!

1026
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,040
Looks like we can

1027
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,920
chat a bit longer.

1028
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,640
Actually, when my wife and I

1029
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,200
first met,

1030
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,040
it was overseas.

1031
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,840
I came home

1032
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,800
- from work that day. Then...
- The viewer count is rising.

1033
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,920
Right, right.

1034
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,120
I was about to have dinner

1035
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,400
when I heard outside my window

1036
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
very loud noise.

1037
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,680
I wondered what was going on.

1038
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,080
So I stuck my head out

1039
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,880
and looked.

1040
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,800
Then I saw a girl

1041
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,920
who was

1042
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,920
arguing with a group of people.

1043
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,720
Those people were always

1044
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,040
there.

1045
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,840
They had parties

1046
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,240
until early hours

1047
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,400
and didn't sleep,

1048
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,000
making noise there every day.

1049
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,800
I wanted to complain about them,

1050
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,920
but never dared to.

1051
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,840
Then at that moment,

1052
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,160
[I suddenly saw this girl]

1053
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,320
[rushing forward,]

1054
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
[arguing with these people]

1055
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,960
[for her rights.]

1056
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,480
[I thought she was really brave]

1057
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,560
[and impressive.]

1058
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,200
Finally, I watched this girl

1059
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,600
eloquently argued with the group

1060
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,840
and drove them all away.

1061
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,120
Then I heard her voice,

1062
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,800
and I thought...

1063
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,760
Looking closer,

1064
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,640
I somehow felt that

1065
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,000
she isn't a foreigner.

1066
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,840
After their argument ended,

1067
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,560
I went to talk to her and saw...

1068
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,120
She is indeed Chinese,

1069
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,240
a Chinese girl.

1070
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,640
I wanted to chat with her then.

1071
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,280
I really

1072
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,440
admired her courage.

1073
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,920
Just as I was about to speak, she was bent over.

1074
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,960
When she looked up at me,

1075
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,480
she was crying heavily.

1076
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,480
She kept crying.

1077
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,160
At first,

1078
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,720
I asked what was wrong,

1079
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,040
but she didn't speak.

1080
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,040
Then suddenly I understood.

1081
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,000
I could relate to her.

1082
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,760
I'll help you.

1083
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,120
I don't have money.

1084
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,240
It's so hard.

1085
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
You know, for people like us

1086
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,160
who often live abroad.

1087
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,280
To be honest,

1088
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,320
we often feel very lonely.

1089
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,760
Even though we

1090
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,600
have work

1091
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,720
and friends there,

1092
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,360
but no matter what,

1093
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,160
in that kind of

1094
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,480
environment,

1095
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,360
you never quite feel like you belong,

1096
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,200
and never feel like it's your home.

1097
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,840
Only when you return to China

1098
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,800
you do realize,

1099
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,320
"I'm home".

1100
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,320
This is the first time our livestream

1101
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,000
has sold so well without even

1102
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,840
talking about the products.

1103
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,200
This is quite innovative.

1104
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,120
Then later,

1105
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,600
I tried to comfort her.

1106
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,960
She didn't pay much attention.

1107
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,400
Before I left, she suddenly said

1108
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,720
that it was her birthday.

1109
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,280
So I wondered what should I do.

1110
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,840
I said,

1111
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,720
"I should get you

1112
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,600
a cake

1113
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,920
to celebrate."

1114
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,040
Then I said,

1115
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,760
"I might as well take you out

1116
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,520
to buy a cake."

1117
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,680
But those foreign stores,

1118
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,600
well, you know,

1119
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,200
they close very early every day.

1120
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:03,920
So that day,

1121
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,320
we looked for a long time,

1122
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,840
but couldn't find a single cake shop.

1123
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,160
Finally found one,

1124
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,760
but they were just closing.

1125
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,400
What could we do?

1126
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,480
We had to go back.

1127
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,840
After returning,

1128
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,480
the more I thought about it,

1129
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,560
the worse I felt.

1130
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,760
I felt I still needed to

1131
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,560
do something for this girl.

1132
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,280
So then,

1133
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,440
I took out a large rice cooker

1134
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,800
and I cooked

1135
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,080
a big pot of rice.

1136
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,840
I took that rice and

1137
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,640
shaped it into

1138
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,160
something like a cake.

1139
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,920
I thought we need a candle.

1140
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,560
Looked around the house and well,

1141
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,960
no candles either.

1142
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,000
What to do?

1143
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,840
So I took

1144
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,960
some paper

1145
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,600
and drew a candle.

1146
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,960
Then I took that candle

1147
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,400
and stuck it in the rice.

1148
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,360
Then I held it with the candle

1149
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,920
and sang "Happy Birthday to You".

1150
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,560
That's how we met.

1151
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,680
Happy Birth...

1152
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,640
What's your name?

1153
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,400
Zhang Ran.

1154
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,240
Happy Birthday, Zhang Ran!

1155
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,040
Blow out the candle!

1156
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,680
Did you make a wish?

1157
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,480
No.

1158
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,560
Make a wish!

1159
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,640
Ready, go!

1160
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,480
Happy Birthday to you!

1161
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,360
She was very touched at that moment.

1162
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,480
Then...

1163
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,760
You live alone?

1164
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,680
Let's try being together.

1165
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,640
Just like that.

1166
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,360
So she was the one who pursued you!

1167
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,040
To tell you the truth,

1168
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,600
when we were

1169
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,320
driving on Toronto's streets late at night,

1170
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,960
looking for a cake shop,

1171
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,520
I think I had already fallen in love with her.

1172
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,960
And after all these years,

1173
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,000
I actually

1174
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,920
never told her this.

1175
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:45,680
You

1176
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,160
won't broadcast this, right?

1177
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,960
I used to think romantic dramas

1178
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,320
were all fake.

1179
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,080
Never thought in real life

1180
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,160
these things actually happen.

1181
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,880
Dr. Fu, you've really given us

1182
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
a dose of romance!

1183
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,960
Come on, everyone,

1184
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,760
if you're

1185
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,200
interested in Dr. Fu's story

1186
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,560
too...

1187
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,720
Lady Wan,

1188
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,880
hit another thousand orders!

1189
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Dr. Fu, it seems everyone

1190
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,040
wants to chat more with you.

1191
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,800
Mr. Li,

1192
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,680
how much inventory do we have left?

1193
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,840
Three thousand units.

1194
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,200
Let's add three thousand more!

1195
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,520
Link is up!

1196
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,000
[Hearing Dr. Fu]

1197
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,520
[share his story with his wife,]

1198
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,640
[I was really moved.]

1199
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,680
[It shows how much energy and love]

1200
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,240
[Dr. Fu invested]

1201
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,120
[in developing products.]

1202
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,520
[I believe this sincerity...]

1203
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,480
Alright!

1204
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,640
This worked out unexpectedly well.

1205
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,280
The second half!

1206
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,400
Let's go!

1207
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,160
This time,

1208
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,240
in Lady Wan's livestream,

1209
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,680
we specially prepared

1210
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,360
a carefully crafted limited edition.

1211
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,000
This is a newly updated design,

1212
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,040
very exquisite.

1213
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,160
What we're bringing you

1214
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,800
is a complete set from skincare to makeup,

1215
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,920
everything included.

1216
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,480
Look what Xing Kai said!

1217
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,200
I knew this would work out!

1218
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,120
You did great, Yudong!

1219
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,880
You know?

1220
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,880
Sorry to interrupt,

1221
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,800
do you both have time later?

1222
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,400
Yes.

1223
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,920
After the livestream,

1224
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,400
Lady Wan wants to talk with you.

1225
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,360
- No problem.
- About what?

1226
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,440
Why do you have so many questions?

1227
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,400
We'll talk after.

1228
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,640
She probably

1229
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,280
wants to continue to work with us.

1230
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,480
Why are you being so nosy?

1231
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,360
You're happy, but I'm in trouble.

1232
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,480
What trouble?

1233
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,840
Remember the cake thing?

1234
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,720
Remember how badly I was criticized?

1235
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,800
This time I'll probably be

1236
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,720
criticized even worse.

1237
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
Impossible. Let me tell you,

1238
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,760
times have changed!

1239
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,680
Ms. Wang just told me

1240
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,720
the livestream viewers

1241
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,680
all really like you.

1242
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,320
I'm telling you,

1243
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,960
Xing Kai is completely convinced now.

1244
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,040
[To tell you the truth,]

1245
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,680
[when we were]

1246
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,320
[driving on Toronto's streets late at night,]

1247
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,960
[looking for a cake shop,]

1248
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,520
[I think I had already fallen in love with her.]

1249
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,920
[And after all these years,]

1250
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,840
[I actually]

1251
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,080
[never told her this.]

1252
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,160
[You won't]

1253
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,120
[broadcast this, right?]

1254
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,000
What a coincidence

1255
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,160
to meet you here!

1256
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,840
Long time no see!

1257
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,920
Didn't you say you don't want

1258
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,840
me to talk about us in public?

1259
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,800
But you told our story with passion,

1260
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,160
even getting emotional.

1261
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,920
The National Husband.

1262
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,880
Then you must be

1263
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,320
the National Wife.

1264
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,880
Oh, stop it.

1265
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,480
Alright!
