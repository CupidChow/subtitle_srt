1
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,160
Okay, I got it, Dad.

2
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,080
Thanks.

3
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,080
Drive safe. Gotta go.

4
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,800
What did your dad say?

5
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,800
He said back when

6
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,280
he worked at the foreign company,

7
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,880
he knew a friend in foreign trade.

8
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,720
Deals in plush toys.

9
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,800
He might buy your cotton.

10
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,640
But he can only try.

11
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,160
No guarantee.

12
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,199
Thanks.

13
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,560
Ge Kaiyang, you actually can cook?

14
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,720
It won't be

15
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,920
some inedible mess,

16
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,000
huh?

17
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,040
I'm talented at cooking.

18
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,320
My parents were busy when I was little,

19
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,680
so I'd often make instant noodles,

20
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,520
and that's where it all started.

21
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,280
Alright. I'll give it a taste.

22
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,320
Can't wait.

23
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,280
Didn't you say

24
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,520
you'd make me malatang?

25
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,160
[Malatang?]

26
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,480
[Don't make it here.]

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
Can't stand the chili fumes.

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,079
Just kidding.

29
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,000
Have you eaten?

30
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,079
Not hungry.

31
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,320
Fed the pigeons yet?

32
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,840
Nope.

33
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,320
Young lady.

34
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,520
You're quite pretty.

35
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,760
Why hang around

36
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,320
my grandson all day?

37
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,320
Don't let his looks fool you.

38
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,120
He's dirt poor.

39
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,520
Don't laugh.

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,600
We're broke.

41
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,120
Think carefully.

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
Are you okay?

43
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,400
Can you go feed the pigeons?

44
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,640
Think it over, girl.

45
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,120
[Yeah, granny,]

46
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
[I will.]

47
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
She likes joking.

48
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:31,680
Pay no mind.

49
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,360
Our products

50
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,920
have strict raw material standards.

51
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,880
We usually don't consider

52
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,520
materials with unknown sources.

53
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,520
Here, feel this.

54
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,800
Feel the quality.

55
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,360
This is what happens

56
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,720
when we handpick

57
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,079
raw materials.

58
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,320
I see. How about this?

59
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,360
I'll give you a discount.

60
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
I really need the money.

61
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,920
It's not about the money.

62
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,840
If I hadn't known Lu

63
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
for decades,

64
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,520
[you wouldn't even]

65
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,680
[be inside our factory.]

66
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,880
[But honestly,]

67
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
[I checked carefully.]

68
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,840
[Your batch of cotton]

69
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,000
[is actually quite good.]

70
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,200
[Meets our standards.]

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,680
Deal.

72
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
Thank you, thank you!

73
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
You've helped me a ton.

74
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,880
Thanks!

75
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,279
Thanks a lot.

76
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,320
Feeling generous today?

77
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,640
I promised, didn't I?

78
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,240
Treat you to dinner once I get the money.

79
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,680
A drink isn't too much, right?

80
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,280
Your 200k IOU turned into

81
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,520
only 85k in goods payment.

82
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,680
Spend wisely.

83
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,640
If it weren't for you,

84
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,840
I probably wouldn't have gotten anything.

85
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,880
I want to talk to you

86
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,960
about something.

87
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,840
I could

88
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,400
give you some as a commission.

89
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,280
Wait, Ge Kaiyang.

90
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,720
I helped you

91
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,480
not for your money.

92
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,160
That's not what I meant.

93
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,120
Thanks.

94
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,640
Back in Canada,

95
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
we never would've guessed

96
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,160
we'd be doing this together.

97
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,200
I think

98
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,160
I should start a debt collection

99
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,520
company.

100
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,160
Right?

101
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,960
Sure.

102
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,280
I'm in.

103
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,160
This way I can

104
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,240
make ends meet.

105
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,840
Then we'd make the news.

106
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,680
Ten years studying abroad,

107
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,159
ended up as debt collectors.

108
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,120
How's that?

109
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,760
Sounds good.

110
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,960
What's up?

111
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,480
The job.

112
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,840
I got the job.

113
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,800
The company informed me

114
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,880
that I can join anytime.

115
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,880
That's good.

116
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,800
Aren't you happy about it?

117
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,720
I'm being honest,

118
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,240
but don't make fun of me, okay?

119
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,800
After studying abroad for years,

120
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,680
the only job I can find back home

121
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,040
is at a study abroad agency.

122
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,720
No debt collection company for us.

123
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,360
Aren't you hot?

124
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,080
At least

125
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,360
turn on the fan.

126
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,960
Need help?

127
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,159
How often do you take this?

128
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,360
I didn't see you take it yesterday.

129
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,200
It says

130
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,880
"24-hour efficacy".

131
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,280
That's all nonsense.

132
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,680
Once every two days is fine.

133
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,240
Won't die.

134
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,560
Says who? You're not a doc.

135
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,520
Listen,

136
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,400
this is no joke.

137
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,120
[No insulin left in the fridge.]

138
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,640
[I'll take you to the hospital tomorrow.]

139
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,600
Your fasting blood sugar

140
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,360
and A1C levels

141
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,760
are already past the danger zone.

142
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,560
You need to be hospitalized.

143
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,000
Listen to the doc.

144
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,080
I don't want to.

145
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,560
You should listen to the doctor.

146
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,920
Can't believe I fall

147
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,280
for your words about the insulin.

148
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,640
Ma'am,

149
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,880
at this stage,

150
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,120
hospitalization is a must.

151
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,720
If you don't control your sugar,

152
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,200
complications can easily arise.

153
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,520
That would be dangerous.

154
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,720
Is it that serious?

155
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,760
Are you worried about the cost?

156
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,840
Well, most of the

157
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,000
hospitalization expenses

158
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
can be reimbursed.

159
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,480
Including the insulin.

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,720
Once

161
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,200
your blood sugar stabilizes,

162
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,200
you can be discharged.

163
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,720
I'll also prescribe two weeks'

164
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,240
worth of insulin for you to take away.

165
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,200
Two whole weeks'

166
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,520
worth of insulin

167
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,160
to take home?

168
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,000
Right.

169
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,280
Saves a lot of money.

170
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,720
Fine, admit me.

171
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
That's right.

172
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
I'll write you a form.

173
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,640
Here, take them back.

174
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,160
Thanks.

175
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,320
Patient's name?

176
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,840
Huang Shufen.

177
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,200
Here.

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,120
Paid the fees.

179
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,440
Keep these papers.

180
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,240
Huang Shufen!

181
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,720
How dare you call me by my name?

182
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,120
What are you eating?

183
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,280
Let me see.

184
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,960
Let me see.

185
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,960
Where did you get this?

186
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,560
From the cabinet.

187
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,120
You can't eat this.

188
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,120
Go check them.

189
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,520
Where's my ID?

190
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,280
What are you doing?

191
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,160
Take a photo for memories.

192
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,080
November 8th, 1946.

193
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,320
Scorpio.

194
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,960
What?

195
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,160
Zodiac. Scorpio.

196
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,120
So?

197
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,000
Scorpios are kinda grudging.

198
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,320
Grudging?

199
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,560
Huh.

200
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,600
When was my grandpa's birthday?

201
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
What now?

202
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,040
Just curious if you two were meant to be.

203
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,960
Huh?

204
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,840
July 4th, 1941.

205
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,880
Cancer.

206
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,360
Why are you staring at me?

207
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,680
Were we meant to be?

208
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,600
Nope.

209
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,080
Ugh, stop annoying me.

210
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,200
Get out of my sight.

211
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,600
Stop watching over me.

212
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,920
And remember to

213
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,920
feed the pigeons.

214
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,360
You've told me a million times.

215
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Fly them twice a day.

216
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,160
Got it.

217
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,000
Why do you care more about

218
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,120
the pigeons than me?

219
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,720
Those pigeons

220
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
were all left by your grandpa.

221
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,160
So I wasn't left by Grandpa?

222
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,520
Unless my dad

223
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,080
wasn't my grandpa's real son.

224
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Or I wasn't my dad's real son.

225
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,200
You little rascal.

226
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,880
Why do you talk so sassy?

227
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,800
It hurts. Are you really a patient?

228
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,920
I'm just in the hospital,

229
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,000
not on my deathbed!

230
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,560
Don't jinx it!

231
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,600
Alright, alright.

232
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,680
Go home.

233
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,920
Pass me the remote.

234
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,920
Why are you so nice to animals?

235
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,480
I always see you talking to them.

236
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,680
You wouldn't understand, kiddo.

237
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,840
Dealing with animals

238
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,080
is much easier than dealing with people.

239
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,720
Got it.

240
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,560
Remote, the remote.

241
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,640
Need to get new pigeon grit.

242
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,720
Head to

243
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,720
the back of the flower-and-bird market,

244
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,720
look for Old Man Qian,

245
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,520
and buy it from him.

246
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
I know exactly how many

247
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,280
pigeons I have.

248
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,360
If even one's missing when I get back,

249
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,280
I'll beat you black and blue.

250
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,720
I love eating pigeon meat.

251
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,720
Say that again, I'll hold a grudge.

252
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,920
[I brought all this for you two.]

253
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,520
[You're staying at her house,]

254
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,040
[and you need to get along with her.]

255
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,440
Right?

256
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,680
And here's some fruit.

257
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,760
Your mom bought all this,

258
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,080
told me to bring it over.

259
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,240
So many snacks.

260
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,720
My mom bought all these?

261
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,120
Don't lie to me.

262
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,520
Maybe they were just

263
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,280
free samples

264
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,360
with the fruit she bought.

265
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,440
Your mom misses you a lot.

266
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,120
She's just tough on the outside.

267
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,520
Oh, right.

268
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,080
You were looking for a job, right?

269
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,320
So

270
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,640
how's that

271
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
working out?

272
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,560
I've got it.

273
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,760
Impressive! That's my girl.

274
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,080
But Dad, I was thinking

275
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,480
once my life gets a bit more settled,

276
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,760
and Mom knows

277
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,720
I'm doing fine

278
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,920
back in China,

279
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,160
maybe she'll let it go.

280
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,480
Alright.

281
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,840
Job's settled.

282
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,520
But staying at someone's place

283
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,120
isn't a long-term solution.

284
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,280
Should I rent you an apartment?

285
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,200
No, Dad, thanks.

286
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,840
It's nice having company.

287
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,400
I'm good.

288
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,760
You drive so much, must be tiring.

289
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,920
I don't want to be

290
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,680
an extra burden.

291
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,200
I'll rent my own place

292
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,800
once I start earning.

293
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:00,840
Alright then.

294
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,160
Alright, I'm off.

295
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,200
Drive safely.

296
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
It's a bit heavy, be careful.

297
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,760
It really is.

298
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,640
See you.

299
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,320
Take care.

300
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,360
Go on.

301
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,600
Go.

302
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,560
I'll wait till you go in.

303
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,080
[Okay, goodbye.]

304
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,120
[You're back.]

305
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,400
Come clean.

306
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,120
Who were you on a date with?

307
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,760
What date?

308
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,200
Just helping a friend.

309
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,120
I'm exhausted these days.

310
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,320
Then who bought

311
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,040
all these snacks?

312
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,560
No way you bought them yourself.

313
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,960
My dad bought them for us.

314
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,440
Your dad?

315
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Lucky I have proof.

316
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,960
So tell me,

317
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,720
who's the guy

318
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,760
bringing you food in the photo?

319
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,480
What's

320
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,960
really going on between you two?

321
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,560
You made my dad look

322
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,920
really handsome.

323
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,280
And young.

324
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,080
This is really your dad?

325
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,360
Yep, for real.

326
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,720
To be honest,

327
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,920
this is the first photo

328
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,840
I've taken with my dad since I grew up.

329
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,440
Send them all to me. Now.

330
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,520
Send them all.

331
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,880
Done.

332
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,280
Great shot. Really good.

333
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:04,920
Cynthia.

334
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,640
I have a general idea

335
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,560
of your background.

336
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,920
I don't know how the boss

337
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,120
introduced our department to you,

338
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:09,840
but let me

339
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,880
briefly explain your role.

340
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
Your job will involve

341
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,760
everything from client acquisition

342
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,840
to handling all

343
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,160
academic programs

344
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,440
once students join our agency,

345
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,120
including language training,

346
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,320
document preparation, portfolio design.

347
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,760
Every student has

348
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,520
different

349
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,320
learning needs,

350
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,040
so you'll need to

351
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,960
customize service plans for each.

352
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,200
Basically,

353
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,720
you can think of it as

354
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,400
personalized one-on-one service.

355
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,040
Resume says you

356
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,640
studied economics, right?

357
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,120
That's great.

358
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,200
I want my kid to study economics too.

359
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,600
Easier to find a job.

360
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,400
Sweetie, do you like economics?

361
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,280
She's still so young.

362
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,880
She doesn't know what she really wants.

363
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,520
We can't let her choose based on whims.

364
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,960
She doesn't understand anything.

365
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,920
I need to plan for her.

366
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,560
But she's only in 8th grade.

367
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,320
Isn't it a bit early to consider this?

368
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,560
Not at all.

369
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,160
It's often said kids

370
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,640
have to get a head start.

371
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,320
Ideally,

372
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,680
she should go abroad for high school.

373
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,760
She's been taking English tutoring

374
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,240
since kindergarten.

375
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,920
Already working on TOEFL scores.

376
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,400
Oh, come on.

377
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,760
Stop playing with your phone.

378
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,520
Language tests

379
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,440
might change in the future.

380
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,880
And studying abroad

381
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,680
is for the kid herself.

382
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,080
Shouldn't we respect

383
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,560
her own thoughts?

384
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,200
No matter what changes,

385
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,840
we need to

386
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,160
be fully prepared.

387
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,520
Kids don't know anything.

388
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,720
It's up to parents

389
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,600
to plan for them.

390
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,760
Have you considered the overall cost

391
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,080
of studying abroad?

392
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,760
No need to worry about that.

393
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,680
We've got it all figured out.

394
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,600
Okay.

395
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,640
My apologies, I overstepped.

396
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,800
I'll prepare some materials

397
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,880
on international high schools

398
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,120
for you to look over, okay?

399
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:00,800
Yeah.

400
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,560
Their food is pretty good here.

401
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,400
How was your first day?

402
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,200
Not bad, I think.

403
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,160
The offices are spacious,

404
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,680
and the supervisor is nice.

405
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,960
Usually when you say that,

406
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,720
there's a "but" coming.

407
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,680
Well...

408
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,760
To be honest,

409
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,200
this job comes with a lot

410
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
of responsibility.

411
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,760
I don't want to

412
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,520
make decisions for others.

413
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,080
All those kids

414
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,800
wanting to study abroad...

415
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
I'd prepare

416
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,560
so much of their materials.

417
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,160
If they get in, fine.

418
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,200
If they don't,

419
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,760
all that

420
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,840
admissions pressure

421
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,800
would fall on me.

422
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,040
I don't think I can handle that.

423
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,040
But you're not

424
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,440
making the decision for them.

425
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,560
Studying abroad

426
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,720
is their own choice.

427
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,440
You're just helping them

428
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,760
with one part of the process.

429
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,840
And whether they get accepted

430
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,600
depends on

431
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,960
their own abilities.

432
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,680
Right?

433
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,880
You can't always

434
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,440
do exactly what you love.

435
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,040
I don't like driving ride-hailing either.

436
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,200
You don't have much

437
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,920
work experience yet.

438
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,160
You can take this job

439
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,200
for now,

440
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:20,800
you know,

441
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,560
and keep an eye out

442
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,400
for something better.

443
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:31,880
Dad.

444
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,240
Do you think I'm being

445
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,200
too fussy or demanding?

446
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,480
Of course not!

447
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,520
My daughter should

448
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,320
have high standards

449
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,560
for her job.

450
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,440
You should do something you love.

451
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,760
I get it.

452
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,080
Okay.

453
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,560
To celebrate

454
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,560
my daughter landing a job,

455
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,480
I'm gonna

456
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
take extra fares today.

457
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,120
Great.

458
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
Reply your messages.

459
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,400
Dad, slow down a bit.

460
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:05,920
See ya.

Mate, I'm telling you,

465
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,360
if we're talking vocals,

466
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,800
Kaiyang.

467
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,480
Don't bring up that jinx.

468
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,200
Drink one yourself.

469
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,640
Who's Kaiyang?

470
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,080
Why didn't you invite him out?

471
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,240
He doesn't deserve it.

472
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,800
Who are you talking about?

473
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,320
Ge Kaiyang?

474
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,920
He's doing designated driving now.

475
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:06,960
Who?

476
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,800
Ge Kaiyang.

477
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,560
Doing what?

478
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,440
Designated driver.

479
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,640
Louder.

480
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,760
Ge Kaiyang is doing designated driver.

481
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
No way.

482
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,960
For real.

483
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,840
My bestie's car got scratched by a DD,

484
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,280
just fixing the wrap cost over 10 grand.

485
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,600
I heard it's him.

486
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,800
- No way.
- I swear.

487
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,880
Call him.

488
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,880
I deleted his WeChat ages ago.

489
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,920
But you've got his number, right?

490
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,160
Yeah, definitely.

491
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,080
Come on.

492
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,800
You really want me to call?

493
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,200
Fine.

494
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,520
Hey, bro.

495
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:42,880
No,

496
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,560
my last few jobs

497
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,360
all got canceled today.

498
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
I'm all the way

499
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
out in the High-Tech Zone now.

500
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,200
It's pretty far.

501
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,960
That's fine,

502
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,720
I'll wait around.

503
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,480
Thanks for your concern.

504
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,600
Hello,

505
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,920
this is Lidao Designated Driver.

506
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,120
[Hello, is this the DD service?]

507
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,520
Yes, it is.

508
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,560
[Well,]

509
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,400
[are you free right now?]

510
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,280
I am.

511
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,800
[Music Square,]

512
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,880
[next to the CoCo milk tea shop.]

513
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,920
[See you in half an hour.]

514
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,000
Got it.

515
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,600
Thanks, really.

516
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,600
So he really is doing DD.

517
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,240
Way to go.

518
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,160
No way.

519
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,560
That is Ge Kaiyang.

520
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,640
Dude!

521
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,600
At this moment,

522
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,560
I have to sing a party song!

523
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,800
Come on then!

524
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,560
Let's go!

525
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,440
Where's the mic?

526
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,040
Here.

527
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,720
Pick a song for me!

528
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,560
Go sing with him.

529
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,320
Go on.

530
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,720
Put on a Phoenix Legend track!

531
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,520
Don't worry,

532
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,800
I'm still in the High-Tech Zone.

533
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,000
I've already got an order

534
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,640
come in.

535
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,480
No worries.

536
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,560
Talk later.

537
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,840
Gotta take me to your hometown, deal?

538
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,160
Stop! Over here.

539
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,200
Don't go!

540
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,280
Come on.

541
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,760
Hurry up.

542
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,600
Kaiyang?

543
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,720
Long time no see.

544
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,280
Small world!

545
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,400
You're actually doing designated driver?

546
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,080
Ling.

547
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,880
Kaiyang, the karaoke king.

548
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,360
That's him?

549
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,560
Say hello.

550
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,800
Hi, Kaiyang.

551
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,560
Hey.

552
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,120
They said you're doing DD,

553
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
I didn't believe it.

554
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,040
So, experiencing life?

555
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,640
Kaiyang,

556
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,360
your colleague

557
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,320
will be here soon.

558
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,040
You're such a pain.

559
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
Just go.

560
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,960
Whenever

561
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,720
I need it, I'm calling you.

562
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,560
Absolutely.

563
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,000
Calm down.

564
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You guys still need a DD?

565
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,560
Hold up.

566
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,600
Of course we do.

567
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,600
I don't trust anyone else

568
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,720
with my car.

569
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,360
Exactly.

570
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,240
Good thing you're here.

571
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,600
Ling,

572
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,680
aren't you into Vlogging?

573
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,840
Take some shots of him later.

574
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,160
No problem.

575
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,640
So...

576
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,280
Kaiyang, here you go.

577
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,200
Alright.

578
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,400
Thank you.

579
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,200
Unlock it.

580
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,280
You guys get in first.

581
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,320
Go on, hop in.

582
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
I'll do a quick check.

583
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,480
You can get in first.

584
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,800
It's fine, I'll wait for you.

585
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,200
Just to confirm,

586
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,800
there's a scratch on your rear bumper.

587
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,800
Forget it.

588
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,600
Why are you being so serious?

589
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Standard procedure,

590
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,080
just to avoid disputes.

591
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,080
Okay, sure.

592
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,680
Where are we heading?

593
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,640
Ling,

594
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
where are we going?

595
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,280
Let's go to Pingli Island.

596
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,480
Pingli Island.

597
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,200
That's over 100 kilometers.

598
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,120
We're going for a drive.

599
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,960
You'll make more money too.

600
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:05,880
All right.

601
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,400
Just get in,

602
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,600
I'll put the bike in the trunk.

603
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,560
Wait a sec, please.

604
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,960
You smell.

605
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,240
Perfume.

606
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,960
Kaiyang, top-notch service.

607
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,720
You bet!

608
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
Back in the day,

609
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,720
he only drove supercars.

610
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,400
His driving skills are first-class,

611
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,160
right?

612
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,760
He really feels different now.

613
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,280
He's a lot steadier.

614
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,560
So, why out here doing DD?

615
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,560
Experiencing life?

616
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,960
Don't bring that up.

617
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,000
It's a bit of a sore spot.

618
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,320
Why?

619
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,480
Got dumped?

620
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,560
Way worse than that.

621
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,680
See that mall up ahead?

622
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,640
That one?

623
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,440
He used to own shares in it.

624
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,840
And what happened later?

625
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,880
Go on, tell them.

626
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,800
It's seized by the court.

627
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,200
Right.

628
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,640
And what about your uncle?

629
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,360
Tell us.

630
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,760
Got nailed for bribery and corruption.

631
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,200
It's all online.

632
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,800
Times really change, huh.

633
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,280
Your parents doing okay?

634
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,720
Sentenced already.

635
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,680
Kaiyang,

636
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,360
I'm so sorry.

637
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,600
You didn't even

638
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,560
finish school.

639
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,360
Your dad and I dragged you down.

640
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,320
It's okay.

641
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,920
He kept saying that me being in school

642
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,000
is just burning money.

643
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,600
So, just quit.

644
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,640
The lawyer said

645
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
you scraped together

646
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,840
every last cent for us.

647
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,840
What are you going to live on later?

648
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,640
What are you doing now?

649
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,800
You're so thin now, and tanned.

650
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,800
Doing odd jobs?

651
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,880
Making up the losses

652
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,120
is what I should do.

653
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,000
And that money

654
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,560
was yours in the first place.

655
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,760
I haven't lost that much weight.

656
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,800
I've just been exercising.

657
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,280
Have you found a job now?

658
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
I've got a steady one,

659
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,800
don't worry.

660
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,920
And stop grilling me.

661
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,280
Just look after yourself.

662
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,400
As Grandma said,

663
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,760
"Everyone should mind their own life."

664
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,520
You take care of you.

665
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,640
And,

666
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,280
I checked online,

667
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,160
looks like I can bring hair dye in,

668
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,160
so next time I'll bring you some.

669
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,360
Kaiyang,

670
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,760
don't worry about me.

671
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,880
Go see your dad when you can.

672
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,840
His prison's far away.

673
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,600
It's not easy to visit.

674
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,280
Kaiyang,

675
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,280
do you blame us?

676
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,440
I don't hate you.

677
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,640
Kaiyang,

678
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,400
lift your head.

679
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,600
Kaiyang,

680
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,480
look up so I can see you.

681
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,080
Take care of yourself.

682
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,360
Eat properly.

683
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,240
Yu, got enough footage yet?

684
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,760
Remember to give him a five-star review.

685
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,480
Definitely.

686
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
Make sure he looks cool on camera.

687
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,720
[I can't tell if she's acting out]

688
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,040
[or if she's been pushed into it.]

689
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,560
[Her mom's odd, too.]

690
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,960
[When she's in Canada with her,]

691
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
[she'd call me every few days]

692
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,840
[on voice chat]

693
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,320
[and talk for hours.]

694
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,880
[I was embarrassed to hang up on her.]

695
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,240
[I'm telling you,]

696
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,800
[Lu Xinying]

697
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,160
[was a total good girl growing up.]

698
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,720
[She's under]

699
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,840
[her mom's thumb.]

700
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,520
[She must've been so bottled up]

701
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,040
[that now she's flipped,]

702
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
[got a mind of her own about everything.]

703
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,920
[What's ridiculous]

704
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,800
[is that I take her kid in,]

705
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,560
[she accuses me]

706
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,640
[of scamming.]

707
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,480
[I can't believe her.]

708
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
[Nobody gets to spend their whole life]

709
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,200
[doing only what they like,]

710
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,240
[right?]

711
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,720
Fed the pigeons?

712
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,400
Yeah.

713
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,760
I know

714
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,040
what I'm doing.

715
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,000
Everyone

716
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,880
reaches this day sooner or later.

717
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,240
Are you scared?

718
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,480
There's nothing scary about death.

719
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,720
It's just taking off an old coat.

720
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,000
You think I've drifted off to sleep,

721
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,160
but maybe

722
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,880
I'm just waking up

723
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,080
from a long dream.

724
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,280
The Ivy League program you promised

725
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,600
is nothing like what you advertised.

726
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,560
What kind of junk schools

727
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,880
are these you're recommending?

728
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,960
What kind of scam agency are you,

729
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,760
cheating your clients like this?

730
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,000
The manager's not here, huh?

731
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:24,720
Fine.

732
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,240
I'll see if anyone

733
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,520
will deal with this.

734
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,840
Please, calm down.

735
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,640
Have some water.

736
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,880
You can talk to me.

737
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,920
I'm the person in charge here.

738
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:32,880
You can

739
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,440
tell me anything.

740
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,200
I've gone through Wu Jinxuan's file...

741
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,600
[Ge Kaiyang.]

742
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,360
Today the full-service funeral guys

743
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,000
gave me a form and asked me

744
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,720
to fill in my grandma's life story.

745
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,240
I realized I don't know

746
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,040
the first thing about her life,

747
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,280
like when she went to school,

748
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,960
worked, met my grandpa,

749
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,160
got married,

750
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,520
or had my dad...

751
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
All I've ever known

752
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,680
is that

753
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,040
she's my grandma.

754
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,680
I feel like

755
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,040
I'm the jinx of this family.

756
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,239
I keep thinking...

757
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,920
if I died,

758
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,199
what would happen to my family?

759
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,520
Don't talk nonsense.

760
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,320
Everyone dies.

761
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,960
If I were to die right now,

762
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,440
what would be written on this form?

763
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,960
And who'd even

764
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,120
fill it out?

765
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,239
You still have me.

766
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,360
Thanks.

767
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,360
It was really hard finding a photo

768
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,480
of my grandma this time.

769
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,080
She didn't have a single

770
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,880
proper picture.

771
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,200
Why don't you take one of me?

772
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,440
Maybe when I die they can use it.

773
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,920
Now?

774
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,160
Yes.

775
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,040
Let me check.

776
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,360
Not great.

777
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,560
300 yuan.

778
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,640
My condolences.

779
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,400
Thank you.

780
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,680
200 yuan.

781
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:19,800
My condolences.

782
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,920
Dear family and friends,

783
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,600
today we gather

784
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,280
with very heavy hearts

785
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,880
to mourn the passing

786
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,720
of my grandmother,

787
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
Ms. Huang Shufen.

788
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,720
My grandma was born

789
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,800
on November 8th, 1946,

790
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,120
and passed away

791
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,000
on the morning of July 14th, 2023

792
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,360
at Lucheng First Hospital,

793
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,160
at the age of 78.

794
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,320
She's devoted to her work,

795
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,360
and spent 20 years as a textile worker

796
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,240
at Lucheng No. 3 Handkerchief Factory.

797
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,600
Sorry

798
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,000
to take up a bit of your time.

799
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,280
And now,

800
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,360
here's what I want to say to her.

801
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,320
[Huang Shufen,]

802
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,280
[the truth is, I never really]

803
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,240
[understood your life.]

804
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,440
[It's only after you left]

805
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,760
[that I started to truly get to know you.]

806
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,440
[When I lived at your place,]

807
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,880
[I could hear your laughter]

808
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,400
[from far down the street.]

809
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,920
[I don't know when it changed,]

810
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,440
[but at some point]

811
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,360
[you stopped laughing so much.]

812
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,360
[Maybe it's after Grandpa passed,]

813
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,600
[or because you're always]

814
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,080
[worried about my parents,]

815
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,120
[or because I went overseas.]

816
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,520
[I remember you once told me,]

817
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,320
[that everyone]

818
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,040
[has relationships that drift apart.]

819
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,120
[But they're never]

820
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,920
[as broken as we imagine.]

821
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,320
[Or perhaps,]

822
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,040
[it's because before they faded,]

823
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,320
[they shone.]

824
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,720
[They were real and solid,]

825
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,760
[and for a time, they lit up our world.]

826
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,720
[We all walk]

827
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,240
[alongside different people.]

828
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,320
[Even if]

829
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,720
[we're not together now...]

830
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,720
[that's okay.]

831
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,160
[To me, you've only left. ]

832
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,240
[You haven't disappeared.]

833
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,520
[You became a part of me.]

834
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,800
[But it wasn't until this visit,]

835
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,480
[after I returned,]

836
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,560
[that I truly saw you—]

837
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,440
[really saw]

838
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,920
[how much we look alike.]

839
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,920
[Your brows arch like little moons,]

840
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,560
[your lashes are long,]

841
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,320
[your eyes are bright,]

842
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,560
[your nose is tall.]

843
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,480
[And your smile]

844
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,280
[is truly beautiful.]

845
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,920
[I've grown up now.]

846
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,520
[So please, don't worry about me.]

847
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,200
[There's a line from a book I recall:]

848
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,400
["We come from nowhere,"]

849
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,400
["and to nowhere we return."]

850
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,000
[May your journey be peaceful.]

851
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,720
[When I'm gone,]

852
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,840
[keep it as simple as you can.]

853
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,360
[Don't trouble]

854
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,480
[your uncles and aunties too much,]

855
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,080
[and don't blame them.]

856
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,400
[Everything]

857
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,080
[has its cause and its result.]

858
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
They've always complained that

859
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,880
your grandpa and I played favorites.

860
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,400
I know that.

861
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,520
But that's grown-up business.

862
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,000
You stay out of it.

863
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,080
From now on,

864
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,360
just live

865
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,480
your own life well.

866
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,040
Promise me.

867
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,360
Got it.

868
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,160
Why are you so fat though?

869
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,280
How dare you.

870
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,400
I'm leaving those pigeons in your care.

871
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,000
I love eating pigeons.

872
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,840
I'll remember that.

873
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,080
I hold grudges.

874
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,680
[Everyone]

875
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,440
[reaches this day sooner or later.]

876
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,960
[Are you scared?]

877
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,120
[There's nothing scary about death.]

878
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,480
[It's just taking off an old coat.]

879
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,600
[You think I've drifted off to sleep,]

880
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,840
[but maybe]

881
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,560
[I'm just waking up]

882
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,680
[from a long dream.]

883
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,320
[Huang Shufen,]

884
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,240
[thanks for making me in your dream.]

885
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,920
[It's time I woke up too.]

886
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,720
[My name is Ge Kaiyang,]

887
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,560
I'm 27 years old.

888
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,880
Nice to meet you, Ge Kaiyang.

889
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,080
My father

890
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,560
has called me useless since childhood.

891
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,720
[Everything is dust in the wind,]

892
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,560
[everything vanishes without a trace.]

893
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,960
[In this world of chaos,]

894
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,200
[where do I belong?]

895
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,880
Where am I meant to go?

896
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,120
But what if a person's entire life

897
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,840
is mapped out from the moment

898
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,360
they're born?

899
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,040
[Which grade school to attend,]

900
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,720
[which high school,]

901
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,920
[when to go abroad,]

902
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,400
[when to return,]

903
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,040
[which company to join,]

904
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,160
[which hospital when ill,]

905
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,760
[which grave to rest in...]

906
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,160
[Would that drive them mad?]
