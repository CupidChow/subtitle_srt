1
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,000
[Dr. Fu,]

2
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,759
[after discussion,]

3
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,080
[we think]

4
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,320
[your spoken English]

5
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,680
[doesn't meet our requirement,]

6
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,200
[so]

7
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,120
[we can't offer you this job.]

8
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,880
[Personally, I suggest]

9
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,240
[you improve your English speaking]

10
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,800
and communication skills.

11
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,280
[It'll make it easier for you to find a job.]

12
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,280
[Good night.]

13
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,600
Let me introduce

14
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,720
our new guy.

15
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,680
His surname's Fu. He's educated.

16
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,600
Never done manual labor before.

17
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,920
So cut him some slack, alright?

18
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,160
Mr. Zhu, so he's

19
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,520
laying floors with you this afternoon?

20
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,720
Please look out for me!

21
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,640
Never done renovation work before?

22
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,280
Just arrived here?

23
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:24,800
No,

24
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,400
I came here for school.

25
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,480
Just graduated.

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,920
Haven't found

27
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,840
the right job yet.

28
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
So I'm doing this

29
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,920
to make ends meet.

30
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,520
Just getting by for now.

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,400
Fresh grad?

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,720
So you got your master's here?

33
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,400
Master's and PhD.

34
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,760
Perfect.

35
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,160
Come take a look at

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,079
these instructions.

37
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,800
Translation apps are useless for them.

38
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,680
Hey,

39
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,680
don't feel awkward.

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,680
We're all just

41
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,040
trying to make a living.

42
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:54,960
Take it.

43
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,600
100, 150.

44
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,560
200, 250.

45
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,320
384.8 Canadian dollars.

46
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,280
Can I give you 380 dollars instead?

47
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,120
We're compatriots here, right?

48
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,600
[Dong,]

49
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,000
[I visited your dad today.]

50
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,720
[He asked]

51
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,159
[about your job.]

52
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,320
[I didn't tell the truth.]

53
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,240
[Remember,]

54
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,159
[don't slip.]

55
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,680
[I'm drinking with Mr. Fu.]

56
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,480
[My Mom cooked a whole feast.]

57
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,680
[Mr. Fu]

58
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,880
[asked about your graduation again.]

59
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,520
[I said you're buried in your thesis]

60
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
[and had no time for anything else.]

61
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,760
[Feels like he]

62
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
[still wants you to work back home.]

63
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,760
[I was trying to calm his worries.]

64
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,120
Shut up!

65
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,280
If you ask me,

66
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,280
not getting into that pharma company

67
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,520
isn't the end of the world.

68
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,360
Really.

69
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,280
Just stay here

70
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,400
and work with us.

71
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,360
Not bad at all, right?

72
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,080
Seriously.

73
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,680
If you actually left,

74
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,200
we'd be screwed.

75
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:25,880
Those

76
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,720
English manuals are a total headache

77
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,120
for us old folks.

78
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,720
A chemistry PhD doing renovation?

79
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,920
Not such a waste.

80
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,159
Look at Mr. Zhu.

81
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,680
He used to be a big shot

82
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,480
back home,

83
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,280
signing documents all day.

84
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,480
Now he's doing construction work like us.

85
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Why drag

86
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,840
me in?

87
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,159
You used to be a head surgeon

88
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,960
doing cancer surgeries.

89
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,440
Now you're

90
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,360
cutting wires every day.

91
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,440
Hey, all honest work is good work.

92
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,320
Alright, enough.

93
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,960
We're all just trying to survive here.

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,920
Alright, alright.

95
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680
I heard you guys from outside.

96
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,480
Finish lunch and get back to work.

97
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,520
Let me introduce a lad

98
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,800
from my hometown.

99
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,400
This is Duan Zhihao.

100
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,120
Just call him Zhihao.

101
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,200
He's

102
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,360
greenhorn,

103
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,120
so teach him the ropes.

104
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:11,640
Alright,

105
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,920
eat up and let's get moving.

106
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,440
Nice to meet you all.

107
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,120
I'll

108
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,800
do my best to keep up.

109
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
No worries.

110
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,320
Zhihao,

111
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
quick word.

112
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,200
Okay.

113
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,880
Something feels off.

114
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,200
We need to

115
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,320
watch ourselves from now on.

116
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,880
He looks pretty kind to me.

117
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,280
Kind?

118
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,520
Did you hear

119
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,240
that sneaky boss?

120
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,520
They're from the same place.

121
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,680
What does that mean?

122
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,240
I bet he's either a spy or a supervisor

123
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:01,880
sent by the boss.

124
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,040
Either way, let's be careful

125
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,840
or we'll be in trouble.

126
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,040
That's total nonsense.

127
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,360
We're all compatriots, like family.

128
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,960
How can you think so badly of people?

129
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,400
As they say, better safe than hurry.

130
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,240
Not hurry, sorry.

131
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,120
Where are you going?

132
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,840
Upstairs to take a leak.

133
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,280
Remember to flush when you're done.

134
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:22,920
Sure.

135
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,760
Wait, doesn't it auto-flush?

136
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,280
One more guy,

137
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,640
shorter deadline,

138
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,520
but same workload.

139
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,600
And we're

140
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,320
slower than before.

141
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,440
Guess we'll work overtime tonight.

142
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,520
Who's paying for that?

143
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,720
Lunch is decent today.

144
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,080
More meat than usual.

145
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,600
That sneaky boss...

146
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,840
Toss this.

147
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,520
Slow down, man.

148
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,760
No need to rush.

149
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:05,920
Here.

150
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,680
Thanks.

151
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,360
I eat fast normally.

152
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,440
My old job was always on a tight clock.

153
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,760
Old habit.

154
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,600
Can I ask

155
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,320
what did you do before?

156
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,520
Doctor,

157
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,280
back to work. Why poking around?

158
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,280
I'll be right there.

159
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,880
You're a doctor?

160
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,080
Yeah, PhD in chemistry.

161
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,440
I used to make films

162
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,960
in Taiwan, China.

163
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,160
I was a film director.

164
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,920
Mostly art films, and you

165
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,320
probably never heard of them.

166
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,880
I didn't make it big

167
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,640
and burned through all my money.

168
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,360
So I ended up here.

169
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,640
Why did you come

170
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,520
to Canada?

171
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,000
My kids

172
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,880
are here.

173
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,880
They came over early on.

174
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,320
I was alone back home.

175
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,960
I just couldn't let it go.

176
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,200
But now,

177
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,800
I just have to

178
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,600
accept it,

179
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,200
right?

180
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,080
Damn.

181
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,560
What happened?

182
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,600
Don't move.

183
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,040
Zhang Ran.

184
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,640
I don't know if you have any plans

185
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,520
this weekend,

186
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,040
but I think maybe we can go grab a drink?

187
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,560
Probably.

188
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Can I get your number?

189
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,880
I'll give you a call

190
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,480
and see if you're free.

191
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,760
Yes, yes.

192
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,000
Give it to me.

193
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,240
From the moment I met you,

194
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,120
I felt an incredible connection.

195
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,440
Please marry me.

196
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
It's too fast.

197
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,920
I'm not ready for marriage.

198
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
You bring so much joy

199
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,240
into my life.

200
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,040
I can't imagine

201
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,280
a future without you.

202
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,120
We can have a wonderful

203
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,000
life in Canada.

204
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,680
Ms. Zhang, your entry card.

205
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,200
Please call me Mrs. Zimmer.

206
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mrs. Zimmer,

207
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,960
but your name on the ticket is...

208
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,000
Just married. Last month.

209
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,800
Wow. What a gorgeous ring. Congratulations.

210
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,800
Can I give you our breakfast menu?

211
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,560
Yes, please.

212
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,720
Sorry, I'm late.

213
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,480
So many reports in the office.

214
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,160
Is this for me?

215
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,120
Yes, for you.

216
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,360
I'm gonna go shower.

217
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,880
Okay.

218
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,680
Mr. Wu, to what do I

219
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,080
owe the pleasure of this call?

220
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,920
Pierce isn't home.

221
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,360
What money?

222
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,880
C-Can you tell me what's going on?

223
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,280
This is none of your business.

224
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,680
What do you mean

225
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,560
none of my business?

226
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,360
If you don't pay rent,

227
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,160
you'll get kicked out.

228
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,080
You lied to me.

229
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,360
You told me

230
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,720
this is your place.

231
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,040
Oh, that's why you married me?

232
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,520
Huh?

233
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,120
You just want my money and my house.

234
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,000
Screw you.

235
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,840
I signed a fucking clean-up,

236
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,440
remember?

237
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,880
You didn't get shit,

238
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,040
but you spent every penny

239
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,720
I have.

240
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,520
You led me money? No, no, no.

241
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,280
You begged me to do the investment for you.

242
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,960
Not even charge you commission.

243
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,120
You bastard.

244
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,560
I'm sorry.

245
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,920
Hey, I lost my mind.

246
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,520
But it's just because I love you.

247
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,080
I love you so much.

248
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,000
You love me?

249
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,360
Don't worry about the money

250
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,200
- or the rent.
- You love me?

251
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,240
Don't touch me.

252
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,040
Baby, don't worry about the money or the rent.

253
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,280
If you

254
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,720
just give me three months,

255
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,160
my new business will be back,

256
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,720
and everything will be fine.

257
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,240
I can even buy you your own show.

258
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,680
You can't be trusted.

259
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,120
We're done.

260
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,720
I'm divorcing you.

261
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,480
And I'm getting my money back.

262
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,040
I want my two years back.

263
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,120
What about mine?

264
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,720
Loser! Loser!

265
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,560
The best

266
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,080
decision I've ever made in my life

267
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,080
is signing

268
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,160
a prenuptial agreement before we got married.

269
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,280
Again? Come on.

270
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,320
Talk to me here.

271
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,320
Anyway,

272
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,840
it's over.

273
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,040
I'm free, finally.

274
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,560
Go chase your pathetic dream.

275
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,160
Take it and get the hell out,

276
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,200
my wife.

277
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,280
[Dong?]

278
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,080
[Dong?]

279
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,160
Just talk. Say anything.

280
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,520
Nothing, just checking in

281
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,400
and making sure you stay awake.

282
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,720
How long's your drive back?

283
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,360
About an hour.

284
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,320
[Won't your fried noodles get cold?]

285
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,400
I've got a microwave.

286
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,920
These noodles are cheap anyway,

287
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,840
and they're good.

288
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,720
I'm getting home late, and I'm tired.

289
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
You always tight

290
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,520
on time?

291
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,640
Driving while half-asleep?

292
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,680
It's mainly because today's client

293
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,000
was so far from my place.

294
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,360
Farther than the last one.

295
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,000
But honestly,

296
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,120
[last time I almost]

297
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,760
[dozed off while driving.]

298
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,600
[Pretty dangerous.]

299
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
That's risky.

300
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,160
Be careful.

301
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,720
Crap,

302
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,880
talking to you while driving,

303
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,760
I think I took a wrong turn.

304
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,520
[No big deal.]

305
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,160
[If you made mistakes, just start over.]

306
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,840
[My bad.]

307
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,240
I'm on the right road.

308
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,320
I misread the navigation.

309
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,320
So it's not your brain that's the problem,

310
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,920
it's your eyes.

311
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,320
That's treatable.

312
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
[He said you visited him?]

313
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,960
Who?

314
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,080
Who else would it be?

315
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,920
[You mean your dad?]

316
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,720
[Yeah, that day]

317
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,240
[Cheng Man's friend]

318
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,680
[gave her two bottles of Maotai.]

319
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,800
We're trying

320
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,120
to stay healthy lately,

321
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,560
so I'm off alcohol.

322
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,760
And I gave them to Mr. Fu.

323
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,400
What's up?

324
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,080
It's fine.

325
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,280
You know what?

326
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,800
I really don't get it.

327
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,760
Why do you have to

328
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,080
butt heads with your dad?

329
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,160
Mr. Fu is really nice.

330
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,640
I love talking to him.

331
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,440
We never run out of things

332
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,960
to chat about.

333
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,480
You could talk to anyone.

334
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,000
You'd chat with a trash can

335
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,080
for half an hour.

336
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,720
Have you ever seen me talk to

337
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,240
a trash can?

338
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,280
I don't remember that.

339
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,520
Oh right,

340
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,400
your dad gave me a mission.

341
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,760
To talk some sense into you.

342
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,200
Mission accomplished.

343
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,360
Stop it.

344
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,280
I don't

345
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,000
have time to think about this.

346
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,760
Go do your thing.

347
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,080
Gotta go. Bye.

348
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,640
Stop the freaking party!

349
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,720
[It's already past midnight.]

350
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,320
[Don't you know that?]

351
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,680
Shut up. Let me finish.

352
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,520
We got families with small children

353
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:37,960
living here.

354
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,720
You're not allowed to

355
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,560
make noise all night.

356
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,000
[This is a public area,]

357
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
[you nosy lady.]

358
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,520
[We have every right]

359
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
[to party here.]

360
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,760
[Stop having a barbecue here.]

361
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,880
[It's a major fire hazard.]

362
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,240
You're such a meddling busybody.

363
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,800
Everyone around here

364
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,560
is sick and tired of the noise

365
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,160
[you've been making for months.]

366
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,560
[This isn't a suggestion for you guys.]

367
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
Shut

368
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,200
the party down right now.

369
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,960
This is against the rule.

370
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,040
It's hurtful,

371
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,440
[and I'm done with it.]

372
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,080
[Don't be a psycho.]

373
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,600
[Don't be a psycho, you cunt.]

374
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,200
[Go watch some TV.]

375
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,280
This shit is legal, lady,

376
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,080
and foreign entertainment.

377
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,720
You!

378
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,760
Don't be an idiot.

379
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,680
You're

380
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,280
a disgrace, sucker!

381
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,480
[Learn the law.]

382
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,960
[Don't give me this fucking attitude.]

383
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,880
[Fucking bastard.]

384
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,800
Did you hear that?

385
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,280
Listen,

386
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,080
I'm not gonna put up with it.

387
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,440
Stop fooling around, you prick.

388
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,400
Take a hike!

389
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,120
Don't try it.

390
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,880
Let's check with the police

391
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,760
and ask

392
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,040
how legal that is.

393
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,120
Hey, let it go.

394
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,040
[Don't come back.]

395
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,360
If you come back again,

396
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,560
I'll be crazy enough to kick your ass.

397
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,000
I promise I will.

398
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,920
Go to hell, you freaking trash.

399
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Get out of here!

400
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,000
Get out of here!

401
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,880
That's great.

402
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,720
Good for you.

403
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,080
Get out of here!

404
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,600
[Why's it so noisy over there?]

405
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,360
[Are you fighting with someone?]

406
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,840
You're cool. Give me five.

407
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:30,960
No,

408
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,400
we've got a badass here.

409
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,720
Remember what I told you before?

410
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,720
Some people downstairs

411
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,640
throw parties all the time.

412
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,360
Super loud every day.

413
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,400
Total disturbance.

414
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,960
It drives everyone crazy.

415
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,160
Complaints never worked.

416
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,840
Just now a woman

417
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,720
stormed down

418
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,200
and chewed

419
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,080
them out.

420
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,800
They finally left.

421
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,520
Thank you.

422
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,200
What?

423
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:58,840
Shit!

424
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,640
She's crying. What do I do?

425
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,640
The woman who yelled at them.

426
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:52,760
[What's that]

427
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,720
[got to do with you?]

428
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,440
From her crying,

429
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,960
I think she's Chinese too.

430
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,720
[Wow, PhD indeed.]

431
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,160
[You can tell that from how she cries?]

432
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,840
Imperial jade liquor?

433
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,120
180 yuan a glass.

434
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,120
You're Chinese too?

435
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,920
What's wrong?

436
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,240
Why sitting here?

437
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,400
My drain's clogged,

438
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,960
and I locked my keys inside.

439
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,640
Want me to help?

440
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,040
I'm broke!

441
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,320
I have no money!

442
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,120
What should I do?

443
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,000
This is so hard.

444
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,720
The pipes are all old.

445
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:26,880
I'll swap in

446
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,640
a new U-pipe.

447
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,920
How much?

448
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,640
No charge.

449
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,320
This is nothing.

450
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,400
Just one-minute job.

451
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,640
It's all

452
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,200
moldy under here.

453
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,000
I'll clean it up later

454
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,360
and spray some remover.

455
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,200
I'll be good as new.

456
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,920
I told you I don't have money.

457
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,760
Relax.

458
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,440
I'm not charging you.

459
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,760
Chinese help Chinese, right?

460
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,840
Who hasn't

461
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,160
hit hard times overseas?

462
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,520
And honestly,

463
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,040
I'm working as

464
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,200
a handyman now,

465
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,960
but I'm actually a PhD.

466
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,680
Well, I used to be a TV anchor.

467
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:15,960
You don't believe me?

468
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,960
It really is you?

469
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,280
But I think

470
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,160
heavy makeup doesn't

471
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,560
suit you.

472
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,600
I don't mean you're not attractive.

473
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,800
I just don't get

474
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,440
why many girls

475
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,120
wear such heavy

476
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,080
makeup.

477
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,000
They look completely

478
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,520
different

479
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,280
with it on.

480
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,480
You're really a PhD?

481
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,360
Chemistry PhD,

482
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,880
specializing in unclogging drains,

483
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,240
part-time problem solver.

484
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,320
You don't

485
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,520
dissolve bodies, do you?

486
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,440
Depends

487
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,520
who it is.

488
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,320
Scared?

489
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,440
Not really.

490
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,560
What about you?

491
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,440
You came here for

492
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,920
hosting work?

493
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,880
I came here for marriage.

494
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,120
Got divorced.

495
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:26,960
Shocked?

496
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:29,760
Not really.

497
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,840
Thought I found a soulmate.

498
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,240
Turned out to be a liar.

499
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,040
And today's my birthday.

500
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,440
Alright, all fixed.

501
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,440
That fast?

502
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,280
Y-You really don't want money?

503
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,880
Told you it's free.

504
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,240
Hey,

505
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,040
there's a gray

506
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,720
pickup truck downstairs.

507
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,440
It's mine.

508
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,800
I'll wait for you in the truck.

509
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:57,840
Why?

510
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,640
I'm not going.

511
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,800
Rest assured.

512
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,440
Chinese help Chinese.

513
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,520
It's your birthday, right?

514
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,200
Hurry up, we're running out of time.

515
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:19,840
Wait.

516
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,520
Let's go.

517
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,120
Then I'll head...

518
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,920
Happy birthday.

519
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,240
Then I'll head...

520
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,920
Happy birthday.

521
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,560
Life always seems to have other plans.

522
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,640
I thought I could be an interpreter.

523
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,080
But now

524
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,560
I'm a loser.

Make a wish.

I'll carry on.

536
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:01,920
Done.

537
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,880
It's just for the ceremony.

538
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,080
You really gonna eat it?

539
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,040
Isn't this rice?

540
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,800
Can't I eat this?

541
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:20,880
I haven't had

542
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,920
a proper meal in a month.

543
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,760
Looks like you don't have much stuff here.

544
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,760
I've got a lamp

545
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,080
I'm not using anymore.

546
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,120
I'll bring it over for you.

547
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,320
You have everything over there?

548
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:43,880
What?

549
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,640
Do you have everything in your room?

550
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,040
Yeah, yeah.

551
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,720
I've been living here two years.

552
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,800
Are you single?

553
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,760
Let's be together.
