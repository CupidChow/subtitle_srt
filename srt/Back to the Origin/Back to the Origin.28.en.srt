1
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,160
These numbers are insane!

2
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,760
Pass! It'll go to my head.

3
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,400
7% of your followers

4
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,760
overlap

5
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,480
with Lin Anran's.

6
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,120
Got it.

7
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,680
And 40% came from

8
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,520
her fanbase.

9
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,840
Gotta thank

10
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,320
the management and Anran!

11
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,040
Yeah.

12
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,760
Thank

14
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,040
Wait up,

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,079
one more thing.

16
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,800
Sure.

17
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,600
Your bonuses are

18
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,000
tripled this month!

19
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,480
Don't get cocky!

20
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,320
Guys,

21
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,880

22
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,079
Yeah!

23
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,480
Alright, party on!

24
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,560
Thank you!

25
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,960
Triple!

26
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,760
Y'all terrible, stop!

27
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,680
Let's see...

28
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,120
one, two, three...

29
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,920
five zeros!

30
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,960
1.6 million followers!

31
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,720
C'mon,

32
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,680
rewards!

33
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,200
Everyone hit those

34
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,840
shopping apps,

35
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,000
all on me!

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,640
Whoa!

37
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,960
It's on Ran!

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,440
Two grand limit,

39
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,600
guys, c'mon!

40
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,920
You're the best!

41
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,360
Xiaohe,

42
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,720
this isn't fixed yet?

43
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
Slipped my mind.

44
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,360
Slipped your mind?

45
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,440
So I don't matter...

46
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,280
You're done with me too?

47
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,280
You are

48
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,640
tuning me out too?

49
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,280
Can't stand me either, huh?

50
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,600
Nothing I say

51
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,280
matters anymore...

52
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,320
Everyone's

53
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,000
over me...

54
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,080
Nobody

55
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,880
wants me around...

56
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,200
Nobody listens...

57
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,840
Nobody gives a damn

58
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,280
about my feelings...

59
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,480
Nobody...

60
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,360
Anran,

61
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,640
perhaps it's time for your meds?

62
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,200
Mr. Fu,

63
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,480
you killed it last night,

64
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,080
that's why

65
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,720

69
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,159
Funding's looking sweet!

70
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,960
Mr. Fu, Mr. Li,

71
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,080
you've really knocked it

72
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,560
out of the park!

73
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,720
Nah, I barely

74
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,360
did anything.

75
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,120
He did all the heavy lifting,

76
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,200
he's the real MVP!

77
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,760
There's

78
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,080
another gem

79
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,720
about you, Mr. Fu.

80
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,040
Modesty!

89
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,640

If that's all,

I should get going.

97
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,240
Have a great time!

98
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,280
Why the rush?

99

Welcome aboard!

134
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,799
Cheers!

135
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,120
So, what were we?

136
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,280
About

137
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,120
Mr. Wang and

138
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
his

139
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,520
young fiancée.

140
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,400
No way!

141
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,160
Dumped the last one?

142
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,880
Yup.

143
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,520
Talk about fast.

144
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,640
This place

145
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,680
would be ideal.

146
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,120
We should acquire

147
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,080
the entire floor!

148
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,120
Yeah, definitely.

149
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,800
Right?

150
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,400
For sure.

151
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,360
Gotta keep up with

152
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,760
beauty routines, ladies.

153
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,280
Anyone check out

154
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,200
that spa I mentioned?

155
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,080
Yeah,

156
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,560
but wasn't

157
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,680
blown away.

158
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,480
The oils are top-notch though.

159
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,520
Really?

160
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,200
Let's do a ladies' day there!

161
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,440
You in?

162
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,720
Yeah.

163
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,960
What else is good?

164
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,720
Tell us!

165
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,600
They've got this

166
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,880
new fascia treatment...

167
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,920
Excuse me, ladies.

168
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,560
No prob.

169
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,200
About that treatment...

170
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,400
Yeah.

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,360
[You know what?]

172
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,200
[My partner]

173
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,600
[looks super young]

174
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,840
[but he's 38!]

175
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,360
[Yeah?]

176
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,520
[Great genes.]

177
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,840
Your wife's

178
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,920
the older one, right?

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,360
Yep! They say

180
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,120
marrying up in age brings luck.

181
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,920
I must be swimming in luck!

182
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,920
Yeah?

183
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,240
Lucky me!

184
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,280
Funny dude!

185
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,120
Yeah.

186
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,000
[She's amazing to me.]

187
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,880
[Here's to your]

188
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,040
[lucky star!]

189
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,800
[Cool.]

190
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,360
Pardon me, Mr. Xing.

191
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,560
Be right back!

192
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,360
Sure, make it quick.

193
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,760
Babe, babe!

194
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,480
Why

195
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,080
sneaking out?

196
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,400
Just beat.

197
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,760
Besides,

198
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
you're fine

199
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,680
flying solo in there...

200
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,000
You don't really need me here.

201
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,040
Come on now!

202
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,200
Mr. Xing just introduced

203
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
some investors,

204
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,160
one has

205
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,080
Hong Kong connections.

206
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,880
I'd love you to meet them.

207
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,520
C'mon.

208
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,440
Pass.

209
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,520
Done with the

210
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,840
networking game.

211
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,680
It's draining.

212
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,680
You have fun in there.

213
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,760
You mad?

214
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,480
Sorry I ditched you

215
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,440
back there...

216
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,080
Not at all.

217
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,600
It's how these things go,

218
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,680
guys talk shop,

219
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,800
ladies gossip.

220
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,280
Just surprised

221
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,440
to see you

222
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,320
mingling like a pro.

223
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,960
Never knew

224
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,840
you had it in you,

225
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,000
honestly.

226
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,520
Nah,

227
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
not my thing.

228
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,120
Just playing along.

229
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,600
With Yudong

230
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,080
skipping out,

231
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,920
someone had to...

232
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,080
They need you in there.

233
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,120
Get back.

234
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,000
C'mon.

235
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,160
Hey, if you're heading out,

236
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,080
- I'll...
- Daoqi!

237
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,120
I'll just say my goodbyes...

238
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,880
Mr. Jiang wants a word,

239
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,120
now!

240
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,080
OK, coming!

241
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,600
C'mon!

242
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,000
OK.

243
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,600
Go ahead.

244
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,000
Let me just

245
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,360
wrap this up...

246
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,360
Head home,

247
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,640
I'll be quick...

248
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,800
Won't be long!

249
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,880
Better now, buddy?

250
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,920
It's OK!

251
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,480
It's OK...

252
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,400
Nobody's caring for you, huh?

253
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,840
Nobody's caring for me either.

254
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,160
I'll dry myself.

255
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,440
That's better, right?

256
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,160
Didn't mean to drop by,

257
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,080
you just came to mind.

258
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,640
Wanna be friends?

259
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,880
You need a name...

260
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,480
Those lip movements,

261
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
that'll be your name.

262
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,360
Hey,

263
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,280
heads up,

264
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,200
put your canvas

265
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,240
in the coop.

266
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,320
Wind's picking up,

267
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,520
looks like rain coming.

268
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,520
OK.

269
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,880
Bye.

270
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,280
Wild, right?

271
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,520
Last time we

272
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,160
saw each other

273
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
was across the globe,

274
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,120
now we're here.

275
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,680
Totally.

276
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,800
Doing opera then,

277
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,840
me stuck in banking...

278
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,400
Cool.

279
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,080
Yeah.

280
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,120
Like some weird dream.

281
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,800
So why're you back?

282
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,640
Got a gallery deal.

283
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,000
Small show coming up.

284
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,000
Wow, proper artist

285
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,280
with gallery deals now!

286
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,720
Just messing around.

287
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,240
Good for you.

288
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,200
Well... you know,

289
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,400
after Ge Kaiyang left,

290
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,520
opera club kinda died.

291
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,000
No one

292
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,000
felt it anymore.

293
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,040
Too bad.

294
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,520
It's OK, it happens.

295
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,040
You guys still talk?

296
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,800
Since coming back?

297
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,000
Um... when I first got back,

298
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,160
kept in touch

299
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,720
for a bit,

300
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,400
then life got busy...

301
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,400
Just busy, huh?

302
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,720
You hungry?

303
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,480
We can catch up

304
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,360
over lunch.

305
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,240
This is your special place?

306
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,800
Still eating?

307
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,400
Yeah.

308
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,600
Alright then.

309
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,880
Load up, won't get to

310
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,120
eat here later.

311
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,640
Come on,

312
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,200
Malatang's everywhere.

313
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,800
This one's special.

314
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,360
Funny,

315
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
you're more upset about

316
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,560
missing this place

317
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,440
than

318
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,880
certain people.

319
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,120
What people?

320
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,080
Kaiyang, obviously.

321
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,640
Look, I get it.

322
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,720
He seems flaky,

323
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,640
not picking up,

324
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,440
ghosting,

325
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,520
I really do.

326
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,200
But here's the thing,

327
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,400
he was in jail

328
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,760
for half a month

329
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,480
because someone

330
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,560
set him up.

331
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,800
What?

332
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,200
What's going on?

333
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,240
Order's up!

334
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,920
Thanks.

335
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,640
Enjoy.

336
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
That's pretty much it.

337
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,960
Someone

338
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,720
did him dirty.

339
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,880
Remember our opera days

340
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,760
back in Canada?

341
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,960
We weren't pros,

342
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,680
but he was

343
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,520
so upbeat.

344
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,480
Coming back here...

345
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,400
life kept knocking him down.

346
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,560
He's different now.

347
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,880
These past few months,

348
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,880
he's dealt with stuff

349
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,160
most people

350
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,120
never face:

351
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,320
parents in prison,

352
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,000
family turning cold,

353
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,200
losing loved ones,

354
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,600
getting detained...

355
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
Honestly, these

356
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,440
huge changes

357
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,920
have cost him

358
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,400
more than just his lifestyle.

359
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,560
What worries me most is

360
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,640
he lost faith in himself,

361
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,800
and the ability to trust.

362
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,480
He doesn't think

363
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,640
he deserves

364
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,680
happiness

365
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,720
or friendship anymore.

366
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,360
Scared to connect,

367
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,240
scared to let people down.

368
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,240
Really,

369
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,000
he's most scared of

370
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,280
letting you down.

371
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,440
That's why he keeps his distance.

372
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,640
Listen, Xinying,

373
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,360
you mean

374
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,000
so much more

375
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,880
to him than anyone else.

376
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,680
If that's true,

377
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,360
why won't he face me?

378
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,040
[Hey,]

379
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,360
[listen,]

380
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,880
[you really should]

381
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,360
[come out]

382
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,360
[and meet Lu Xinying.]

383
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,120
[At least thank her properly.]

384
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,640
Got a power bank?

385
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,160
Play this.

386
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,320
How dare ya!

387
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,400
Assh*le!

388
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,480
[Made up your mind yet?]

389
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,560
Ugh,

390
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,720
chicken sh*t.

391
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,680
Sir, sir!

392
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,160
Take a look at our brochures?

393
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,400
Interested in North America

394
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,240
or Europe?

395
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,560
Please check these,

396
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,000
our advisors

397
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,320
can walk you through

398
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,240
everything later.

399
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,360
Would you like

400
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,160
to sign in?

401
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,680
I'm here for

402
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,360
Lu Xinying.

403
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,440
Eat up!

404
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,960
You, less; you, more.

405
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,800
C'mon.

406
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,480
C'mon, you little devil!

407
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,320
I crashed with

408
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,800
the lemurs last night,

409
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
had a bad dream.

410
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
How was your sleep?

411
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,200
Gonna check on Grandma.

412
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,560
Back to your sleep.

413
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,320
Not sleepy today.

414
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,960
Slacked off at work last night.

415
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,200
Gonna talk to Fran.

416
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,440
It got caught in the rain.

417
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,280
That's

418
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,600
the rain-blessed look I wanted.

419
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,400
Took Happy out?

420
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,880
Yep, otherwise he'd burst.

421
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,560
Pigeons fed?

422
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,160
Yep. Couldn't let them starve.

423
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,320
Up all night

424
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,000
and still micromanaging?

425
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,400
Rain last night

426
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,040
got a lemur all worked up.

427
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,800
I fell asleep

428
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,880
keeping it company.

429
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,080
Slacking off was a smart move.

430
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,040
Don't know

431
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,440
why I crashed there.

432
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,840
Maybe I just don't click with people.

433
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,800
Animals make me feel secure.

434
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
I had this dream.

435
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,040
It got me thinking:

436
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,720
is getting hit with

437
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
every possible bad thing

438
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,200
some kinda weird miracle?

439
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,200
Look, giving up is

440
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,120
the easy way out.

441
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,960
It's human nature.

442
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,120
The important part is

443
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,440
pushing forward and staying positive.

444
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,600
You know what,

445
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,800
I saw Xinying the other day.

446
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,720
She's waiting for

447
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,760
you to reach out.

448
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:23,960
I'll text you her address.

449
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,080
Go see her.

450
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,080
If you're uncertain,

451
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,840
perhaps consult

452
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,560
your furry friends?

453
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,160
Quit with

454
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,600
the judgey eyes.

455
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,640
I did go see her.

456
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,120
Must you act

457
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,160
so judgmental?

458
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,760
I stood outside forever.

459
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,120
I swear I was there.

460
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,080
Don't believe me?

461
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,120
OK, truth time.

462
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,240
I messed up,

463
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,080
I really did.

464
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,600
That sword was

465
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,480
barely a hair

466
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,520
from my neck.

467
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,160
If I got

468
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,320
a do-over,

469
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,000
I'd tell her how sorry I am.

470
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,120
I really screwed up.

471
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,680
Catch you guys later.

472
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,680
Gotta see

473
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,800
another buddy.

474
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,920
Whoa there,

475
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,000
speedy!

476
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,320
Sorry, sir.

477
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,680
Just dropping off a phone

478
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,680
for my friend.

479
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,720
Closed,

480
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
can't you tell?

481
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,680
Yeah, yeah,

482
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,760
he's got night shift.

483
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,880
Quick drop-off?

484
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,160
Who you here for?

485
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,120
Ge Kaiyang.

486
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,920
Who're you?

487
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,120
His friend.

488
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,520
He's got friends?

489
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,720
Yeah!

490
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,760
Forget it. Closed.

491
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,200
Go home.

492
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,840
Hey,

493
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,000
come on,

494
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
can I just

495
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,560
wait here?

496
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,240
Did you eat?

497
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
Got some food

498
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,440
and drinks to share.

499
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,200
Stop,

500
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,200
it won't work on me.

501
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,760
Take a look.

502
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,200
Might like what I got...

503
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,320
Never giving up, huh?

504
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,800
How about a drink?

505
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,280
Gotta admit,

506
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,840
this wine's weird

507
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,600
but it grows on you.

508
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,440
Ah,

509
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,880
you know your stuff!

510
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,720
Don't know much about wine.

511
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,040
Next time,

512
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,400
I'll bring some Maotai.

513
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,360
Nah, that's

514
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,480
too fancy for me.

515
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,520
C'mon,

516
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,320
just a gesture.

517
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,760
Y'know,

518
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,680
of all the young guys I've met,

519
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,960
you're actually alright.

520
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,920
For real?

521
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,080
Thanks.

522
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,000
I really like

523
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,960
hanging out with you.

524
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Cheers!

525
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,840
Cheers!

526
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,440
Knock yourself out!

527
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,200
Gotta work.

528
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,840
What's up?

529
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,760
This is

530
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
all new to me.

531
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,200
Not bad, right?

532
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
Yeah,

533
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,000
though I don't know

534
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,040
what half this stuff is.

535
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,480
Come visit me

536
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,440
since we get to know each other.

537
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,520
Sure, I'll

538
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,520
drop by sometime.

539
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,440
Cool.

540
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,560
Got some treats for you.

541
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,160
Am I just a pain?

542
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,480
Totally worthless?

543
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,840
Why don't you carry your phone?

544
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,080
Left it at home.

545
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
This place isn't

546
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,160
even on camera,

547
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,920
but you found it.

548
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,000
How'd you get in here?

549
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,960
Front door,

550
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,360
duh.

551
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,720
The guard and I

552
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,400
are buddies now,

553
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,160
like family.

554
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,280
You're good.

555
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,480
So, did you see her?

556
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,960
Dude...

557
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,080
Why'd you bother

558
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,080
spending time

559
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,560
with...

560
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,920
The hack is this ugly thing?

561
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,840
Come on.

562
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,280
Happy, potty time.

563
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,600
He's going

564
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:29,719
downhill.

565
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,600
Can't keep

566
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,679
hiding with animals.

567
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,159
Gotta help him out.

568
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,159
Happy,

569
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,920
this is the right thing

570
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,000
to do, isn't it?

571
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
Is it gonna work?

572
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,560
Yo, say something.

573
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,880
You're just as indecisive

574
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,639
as him.

575
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Blink for yes.

576
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,520
Sure, following your plan!

577
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,400
You'll take the heat

578
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,000
if it goes wrong, OK?

579
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,120
That's reassuring.

580
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,560
Give me paw, buddy!

581
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,400
C'mon!

582
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,920
What brings you here?

583
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
Got a ticket like everyone else.

584
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,000
Din Tai Fung, remember?

585
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,440
Had it in Canada.

586
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,200
It's amazing.

587
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,360
Try it, same taste.

588
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,520
You paid 198 admission

589
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,200
just to

590
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,720
deliver some buns?

591
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,000
You eating or not? They're closing.

592
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,000
I'll get booted

593
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,880
with the buns soon.

594
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,400
I'm literally covered in sh*t.

595
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,640
Can't eat them in here.

596
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,680
Don't throw money around

597
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,880
like I used to.

598
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,880
Great,

599
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,160
I try to be nice

600
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,080
and get a financial lecture.

601
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Feed them to your pals.

602
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,920
You seem close.

603
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,640
Getting offended?

604
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,240
See why animals

605
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,280
are easier than people?

606
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,640
Whatever floats your boat.

607
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,320
What a killer spot!

608
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,240
Would be epic for

609
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
my exhibition!

610
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,760
Remember that rainy day

611
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,120
I spent here?

612
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,840
I fell asleep here.

613
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,200
Just dropping by.

614
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,480
Get down!

615
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,640
What's with the outfit?

616
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,160
For my new gig.

617
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,680
Looking sharp!

618
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,240
Right? Better than you.

619
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,800
How's my

620
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,560
new office?

621
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,720
You're really taking this job?

622
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,000
Sure am! Perfect setup,

623
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,840
study birds,

624
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,720
get inspiration,

625
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,640
earn money. Win-win-win.

626
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,880
Do you need money?

627
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,360
Dude, everyone needs money.

628
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,720
Hey buddy,

629
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,880
water's for our bird friends,

630
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,520
OK?

631
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,920
Be nice to them,

632
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,600
and they'll be

633
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,200
nice back,

634
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:34,840
yeah?

635
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,280
Thanks!

636
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,520
Sure, sure.

637
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,320
Excuse me.

638
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,880
That'd be tricky though...

639
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,920
Donno if...

640
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,920
Excuse me, miss,

641
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,960
that your child?

642
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,600
Yeah, yeah.

643
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,440
Could you watch him?

644
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,240
We're closing soon.

645
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,280
Alright, Mr. Lin,

646
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,920
call you in ten minutes.

647
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,040
Got something here.

648
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,880
Sorry about that.

649
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,280
Jiayi, drop that.

650
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,040
Let's go!

651
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,800
Put that down!

652
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,240
It's dirty. Let's go.

653
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,000
Bye!

654
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,880
I'm off.

655
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,040
Have fun on night shift, peace!

656
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:12,800
Hey,

657
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,080
the supervisor and I

658
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,400
are tight now.

659
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,000
Need anything?

660
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,840
I've got

661
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,200
connections now.

662
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,280
Your academic record

663
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,120
looks good.

664
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,000
But considering your age,

665
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,480
I'd suggest

666
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,400
staying here

667
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,520
a while longer

668
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,920
to strengthen

669
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,880
your basics.

670
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,840
No need to rush.

671
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,640
[Water.]

672
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,400
[You've got a point.]

673
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,160
[Maybe building basics]

674
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,840
[is crucial.]

675
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,960
[Thanks]

676
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,000
[for the advice.]

677
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,360
You didn't have to

678
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,080
pick me up.

679
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,400
No worries.

680
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,680
The pin can be off sometimes.

681
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,000
I was close by.

682
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,360
Alright.

683
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,440
Maybe

684
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,160
I'm too casual

685
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,560
for your show?

686
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,080
We're dressed alike.

687
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
Just leave that purse.

688
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,040
C'mon!

689
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,680
Outfit ain't important.

690
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,920
The art is.

691
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,480
Big-time artist

692
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,560
with a late-night show,

693
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,560
still on Canadian time?

694
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,320
Art shows aren't

695
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,440
just for daylight hours,

696
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,280
you know?

697
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,800
I had no idea.

698
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,760
There you go,

699
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,320
free education strikes again!

700
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,960
Getting drowsy?

701
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,520
Nope, totally awake.

702
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,320
Yeah.

703
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,680
Better be.

704
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,040
Thanks!

705
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,040
Your show's

706
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,400
at the zoo?

707
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,320
Throws you off, huh?

708
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,640
Give me a sec.

709
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,200
Someone's coming for you.

710
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,120
Don't go anywhere.

711
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,840
Hi there!

712
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,800
Did Fran send you?

713
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,000
Ah, Fran got you to come too.

714
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,360
Well, come in,

715
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,680
got the whole place

716
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,760
to ourselves.
