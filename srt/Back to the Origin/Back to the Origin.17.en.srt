1
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,160
Fu Yudong...

2
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
Jeez!

3
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,840
You're like a ninja.

4
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,479
Any luck?

5
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,000
Awesome!

6
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,000
Hey, I need to get water.

7
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,680
C'mon,

8
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,800
let's try something fun,

9
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,480
a dare game.

10
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,680
Eyes closed.

11
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,880
I might trip!

12
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,759
Trust me.

13
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,680
You too then.

14
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,640
Deal, ready?

15
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,760
There's a step

16
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,680
exactly 367.23 mm

17
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
ahead.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,720
Right foot first, follow me.

19
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,400
Now forward.

20
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,720
Dining table's diagonal left,

21
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,720
two chairs there.

22
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,600
Careful now!

23
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,920
Staying close,

24
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
no funny business!

25
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,480
Keep walking.

26
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,360
Cabinet behind.

27
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,560
Moving on,

28
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,320
doorframe ahead,

29
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,360
cardboards underneath.

30
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,400
Keep going,

31
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,720
chair on your right,

32
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,240
and our stove's

33
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,200
right in front of it.

34
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,640
Stay with me.

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,200
Sure thing.

36
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,920
Stove's about

37
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,080
one meter ahead.

38
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,680
Don't reach out yet,

39
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,960
not there.

40
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:06,840
I've

41
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,960
banged into it enough

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,680
to map it out.

43
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,320
Keep going...

44
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,360
Fridge on right!

45
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,680
Well?

46
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,520
Opening eyes?

47
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,240
Yep.

48
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,079
Amazing!

49
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,880
What drink?

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,720
This!

51
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,440
Me?

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,520
Same.

53
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,160
Gonna unscrew it.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,840
Watch this move!

55
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,800
Seen that video?

56
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,960
Too dark now!

57
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
That viral one,

58
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,680
you know?

59
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,400
Give it.

60
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,360
It's fizzy!

61
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Fine.

62
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,520
Dare's over,

63
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,920
truth time?

64
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,560
OK.

65
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,120
The snacks in the nightstand,

66
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,720
your doing?

67
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,120
Nope.

68
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,000
Who then?

69
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,440
Raccoon did it.

70
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,680
What's making this

71
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,600
so heavy?

72
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,280
We could leave this.

73
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,200
You take all

74
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,720
the kitchen stuff...

75
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,960
Your folks OK with that?

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,880
They have enough.

77
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,200
We need basics,

78
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,480
no time to shop.

79
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,760
Let's get this picture up,

80
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,519
alright?

81
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,279
That mess

82
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,680
can wait.

83
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,120
Checking...

84
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,160
Cool, all good.

85
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,960
Where to?

86
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll just stand here

87
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,880
forever,

88
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,520
greeting you.

89
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,600
Perfect,

90
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,320
you're our new decoration.

91
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,200
A nail there.

92
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,720
Perfect spot.

93
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,120
Done.

94
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,520
It's crooked. Can't tell?

95
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,680
Look yourself, see?

96
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,000
See!

97
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,480
Right side's off.

98
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,440
Direct me from there.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,680
C'mon!

100
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Outside's fine.

101
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
In!

102
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,600
Market research, now!

103
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,920
Hey,

104
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,520
our future

105
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,600
territory!

106
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,080
Need help,

107
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,240
sir?

108
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,760
Thanks.

109
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,880
But just planning.

110
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,080
Hey,

111
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,400
see this chaos?

112
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,520
Feel that?

113
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,440
Total amateur hour.

114
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,720
Our launch

115
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,760
will be different.

116
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,680
One product

117
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,600
per counter.

118
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,680
Here,

119
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,360
only our

120
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
star product:

121
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
anti-aging cream.

122
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,600
There,

123
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,880
our allergy serum.

124
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,160
Eye cream section!

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,320
Masks displayed properly,

126
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,520
not this

127
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,360
messy arrangement.

128
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,360
Clean, organized,

129
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,440
premium!

130
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,560
Body lotion here,

131
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,840
sunscreen

132
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,000
here,

133
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,159
perfect summer...

134
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,880
Shush.

135
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,680
Whatever line...

136
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,760
- Keep it down.
- What?

137
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,680
Everyone's looking.

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,720
So what?

139
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,080
Your face's

140
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,720
gonna be everywhere.

141
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,120
They're lucky to

142
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,320
see you live,

143
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,520
soon it'll be all billboards,

144
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,040
y'know!

145
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,280
Shut up!

146
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,040
Just you wait!

147
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,520
I'll have Xing Kai

148
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,160
shoot

149
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,400
your commercial.

150
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,120
Playing right here,

151
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,760
non-stop.

152
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,040
You'll be

153
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,000
our permanent fixture!

154
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,000
Snap outta it!

155
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,200
Seriously,

156
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,520
your fantasies are

157
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,400
getting wild.

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,640
Fantasies?

159
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,120
Dr. Fu,

160
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,120
we just registered

161
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,440
the trademark!

162
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
This is

163
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,800
happening

164
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,680
for sure!

165
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,760
It's real!

166
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,720
You're making me

167
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,960
more uncertain.

168
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,159
Why's that?

169
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,720
We're new to business.

170
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,480
I don't understand financials.

171
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,080
Plus you sold your house.

172
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,480
Why worry?

173
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,720
Stop there.

174
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,040
That's not for ears!

175
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,920
Talked to Xing Kai,

176
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,159
he happens

177
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,600
to know

178
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,920
a pro manager,

179
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,000
fresh out of

180
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,160
a listed company.

181
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,000
Perfect timing

182
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,800
to join us.

183
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,360
I'm planning

184
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,880
to check offices soon.

185
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,280
I'll swing by to catch up with them.

186
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,120
Don't worry.

187
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,720
Let experts

188
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,160
handle their part!

189
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
Just focus on

190
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,360
being CEO!

191
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,520
Picking my ears, back off!

192
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,360
Gentlemen,

193
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,440
would you like to

194
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,520
try our

195
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,120
free samples?

196
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,920
- Sure!
- No, thanks.

197
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,360
Show me

198
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,200
errr...

199
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,960
Dr. Fu's cosmetics.

200
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,240
Sorry,

201
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,400
never heard of

202
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,840
that brand.

203
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,200
Daoqi!

204
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,280
You will soon.

205
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,159
These are free?

206
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:45,720
Yes.

207
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,440
Taking one.

208
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,120
Yo, bounce!

209
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,520
Thanks!

210
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,240
Goodbye!

211
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,240
Thanks again!

212
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,600
What's wrong?

213
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,520
So embarrassing.

214
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,280
Why?

215
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:53,640
Sorry!

216
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,480
You know why.

217
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,320
Watch where you're going!

218
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,480
Hello,

219
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,240
can we have our ball back?

220
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,360
Dude,

221
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,160
from

222
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,520
now on,

223
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,040
done with passing.

224
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Shooting's my thing!

225
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,360
Fine!

226
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,800
I'll be your

227
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,720
sidekick!

228
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,720
You and I, we'll

229
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,880
rule the universe!

230
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,720
The universe...

231
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,600
I just wanna

232
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
get your house money back!

233
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,120
Think bigger!

234
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,280
You've got to risk it

235
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,320
for the biscuit!

236
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,520
Which "risk" are we talking,

237
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,480
gambling

238
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,400
or trying?

239
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,560
Same difference, innit?

240
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,360
No way!

241
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,960
One means gambling, one means effort!

242
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Totally different!

243
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,880
C'mon!

244
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,120
Offside!

245
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,800
Honey.

246
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,120
I'm...

247
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,880
at Mom's.

248
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,400
Yeah, with Yudong.

249
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,480
My breath?

250
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,440
What's up?

251
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,480
OK, coming home.

252
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,320
Cool, home

253
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,080
for dinner!

254
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,240
Sure thing!

255
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,120
I'm on my way!

256
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,080
Cool, OK!

257
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,280
Real smooth, "at Mom's," sure.

258
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,640
Haven't told her about

259
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,720
the startup.

260
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,120
Keep quiet about it!

261
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,920
Big shot here with me,

262
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:39,960
can't even

263
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,320
level with your wife.

264
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,520
Does she know

265
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,720
you sold your house?

266
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,080
Once

267
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,480
the business is up,

268
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,640
I'll break it to her gently.

269
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,720
Not a word!

270
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,360
I'm off!

271
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,800
Later!

272
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,440
Back to our respective realities!

273
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,800
Last goal,

274
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,720
then I'm gone!

275
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,120
3, 2, 1, dropping the link!

276
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,880
Next up,

277
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,400
we've got the amazing

278
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,080
posture corrector!

279
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
You know it,

280
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,280
BackBuddy's back in action!

281
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,000
Check out

282
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,120

283
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,000
Xiaojian looks

284
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,720
wearing it!

285
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,960
Without BackBuddy,

286
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,280
everyone,

287
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,640
guys and girls alike,

288
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,000
ends up looking all slouched

289
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,880
and sketchy.

290
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,320
That slouchy look

291
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,480
makes you seem

292
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,720
super depressed

293
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,160
and miserable.

294
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,920
But

295
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
pop on a BackBuddy,

296
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,120
boom!

297
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,080
Shoulders squared,

298
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,480
chest proud,

299
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,320
slimmer back!

300
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,560
This posture corrector

301
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,520
is absolutely life-changing!

302
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,120
Ran, hanging in there?

303
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,080
All good,

00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,640

305
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,800
no success!

Such a different aura!

Amazing!

313
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,720
Looking good?

314
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,640

with three flavors.

328
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,680
Xiaojian, tell us about them.

329
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,080
Today's special lineup:

330
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,960
grape, coffee,

331
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,440
and cola.

332
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,920
Perfect.

333
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,680
Ran,

334
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
try the cola.

335
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,480
Absolutely.

336
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,280
I'll go for coffee.

337
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:33,560
Alrighty!

338
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,040
Then grape for me!

339
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,640
C'mon,

340
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,920
let's try them out.

341
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,040
Give it a try.

342
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,520
OK.

343
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,560
Feeling full already.

344
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,600
Right?

345
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,520
The coffee one

346
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,280
is just like a latte,

347
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,200
super rich and creamy.

348
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:51,920
Yours?

349
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,720
Hold on,

350
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,080
this is cola, right?

351
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,640
Yeah.

352
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,080
I rarely

353
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,280
drink cola,

354
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:06,760
when I

355
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,560
taste it,

356
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,720
my...

357
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,920
um...

358
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,600
face kinda... reacts.

359
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,400
So, after tasting it...

360
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,600
definitely cola flavor,

361
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,720
very strong taste.

362
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,720
So this is...

363
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,040
perfectly fine.

364
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,800

in my throat.

377
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,600
Need anything?

Better after throwing up.

379
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,480
Anran.

380
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,520
Is she OK?

381
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,400
I'm OK.

382
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:53,760
You sure?

383
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,280
Yes, yes.

384
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,200
Got meds?

385
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,720
Yeah.

386
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,400
Get it.

387
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,000
Will do.

388
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,600
One sip's nothing.

389
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,720
Did I ruin your stream?

390
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,840
Sorry,

391
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,360
Xiaohe

392
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,680
messed up.

393
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
Wrong samples.

394
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,880
Not intentional.

395
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,720
It's cool.

396
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
Dinner's on me sometime.

397
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,560
OK.

398
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Such a trooper.

399
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,320
Always my fault!

400
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,360
Easy target!

401
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,640
Blame me!

402
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,520
Picking on me...

403
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,560
You're nuts?

404
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,640
Came for ramen...

405
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,520
Here.

406
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,280
Take 'em all!

407
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,080
Enough.

408
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,920
They're good.

409
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,560
I'm okay.

410
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,120
Hey...

411
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,600
Compensation

412
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,680
for emotional damage!

413
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,760
What's wrong?

414
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,280
Nothing...

415
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,320
just...

416
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,760
boss stuff.

417
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,560
Ah, boss issues.

418
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,280
She eats fancy...

419
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,440
While we get snacks,

420
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,240
she'd claim

421
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,560
"You're family!"

422
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,200
Pure manipulation!

423
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,280
Yeah, yeah.

424
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,160
Right.

425
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,600
But listen,

426
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,760
back when I

427
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,000
was a tour guide?

428
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,360
Always working, all weather,

429
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,920
no one cared!

430
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,680
Y'know?

431
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,960
Here?

432
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,080
I get snacks,

433
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,240
drinks,

434
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,440
AC, rest breaks.

435
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,160
Pretty sweet.

436
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,600
Be grateful.

437
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,240
Plus,

438
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,360
she's good to me.

439
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh yeah,

440
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,160
do you manage

441
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,480
the comments?

442
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,480
Nope,

443
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,160
but I can see them.

444
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,360
Just...

445
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,800
don't get

446
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,160
those

447
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,680
trolls.

448
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,560
Such nasty comments...

449
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,360
Like bombs

450
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,720
dropping daily.

451
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,040
No matter what

452
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,920
the content is,

453
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,240
they just lash out.

454
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,920
Really annoying,

455
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,520
right?

456
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,240
What's the deal?

457
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,280
It's great!

458
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,280
After she yells at me,

459
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,800
I read her comments.

460
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,920
The mean ones especially.

461
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,600
Pure joy!

462
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,080
Whatever works!

463
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,880
Stay positive!

464
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,400
Stay happy!

465
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,240
Hello?

466
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:06,920
[Hello?]

467
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,760
[Yudong!]

468
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,840
[The foot bath]

469
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,360
[you bought]

470
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,760
[arrived.]

471
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,520
[Your dad's using it,]

472
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,320
[loves it!]

473
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,560
What's that?

474
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,600
I didn't buy one.

475
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,840
[Not yours?]

476
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,920
[Oh,]

477
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,000
[must be Zhang Ran.]

478
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,280
[At hospital,]

479
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,240
[a nurse said]

480
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,840
[daily foot soaks]

481
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,040
[would help]

482
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,600
[your dad's condition.]

483
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,320
Good if it helps.

484
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Keep it.

485
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,280
[Hey, didn't you]

486
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,680
[wanna say thanks to your boy?]

487
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,960
[He's feeling shy about it.]

488
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:40,920
Auntie.

489
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,800
Gotta go,

490
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,160
busy now.

491
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,200
[OK.]

492
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,080
Talk later.

493
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
[See ya!]

494
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,920
You bought the foot bath?

495
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:04,920
[Yes.]

496
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,359
[Dad got it?]

497
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,200
[Quick shipping!]

498
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,440
Yeah,

499
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,440
he likes it.

500
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,720
Thanks.

501
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,000
But

502
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,280
let me know

503
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,160
before buying anything

504
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,319
next time.

505
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,840
Incredible.

506
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,080
Ridiculous.

507
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,480
No gratitude.

508
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,440
You mean Ace?

509
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,440
My hubby.

510
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,880
Bought his dad

511
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,200
a nice gift

512
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,520
and he gets

513
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,760
all upset.

514
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,480
Why?

515
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,000
Weird with his dad.

516
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,920
Won't visit, won't talk.

517
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,080
Like enemies.

518
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,440
Don't get it.

519
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,720
Not that extreme,

520
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,280
but this is

521
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,600
pretty common.

522
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,800
Like my dad and me...

523
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,440
When I was a kid,

524
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
he's up early

525
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,600
and home late selling fish.

526
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
I hardly saw him.

527
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,840
It's like we're strangers

528
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,920
sharing a meal.

529
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,360
But then in college,

530
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
we'd catch up

531
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,960
every week, even if

532
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,640
just for 2 or 3 minutes.

533
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Now?

534
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,680
Talk when

535
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,520
you're home?

536
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,160
Yeah!

537
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,480
Sort of.

538
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,000
When mom's gone,

539
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,440
he's like,

540
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
"Order food."

541
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,320
I say "OK."

542
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,360
Before bed,

543
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,560
"Going to sleep."

544
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,360
He says, "Mm."

545
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,720
Grunts and nods, huh?

546
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,720
Basically.

547
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,360
So my husband's

548
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,640
normal then.

549
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,720
In Canada,

550
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,000
fathers and sons

551
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,960
are like buddies.

552
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,320
Why are we

553
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,920
so different here?

554
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,240
Well, you know...

555
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,400
Chinese style

556
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,680
comes from tradition.

557
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:02,760
Beyond me.

558
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,480
Ran.

559
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,800
Why not make content about this?

560
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,760
About father-son dynamics?

561
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,440
Look,

562
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,240
your "rice guy" joke

563
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,000
about him was gold!

564
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,520
Such a hit.

565
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,360
We thought

566
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,920
you'd do

567
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,040
more sassy wife content.

568
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:19,720
Yeah?

569
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,240
Nah,

570
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,280
he got mad

571
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,120
last time.

572
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,400
Promised to stop using him.

573
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,280
But seriously,

574
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,320
great topic.

575
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,040
Just don't say it's him.

576
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,520
Make it about some friend.

577
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,040
Made-up friends?

578
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:35,920
Why not?

579
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,520
Just don't mention him,

580
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,200
right?

581
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,720
Sleeping already?

582
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,240
Thirty hours without

583
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,080
sleep here.

584
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,680
Bounce, let him rest.

585
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,640
Let's go.

586
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,800
Champion.

587
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,400
[Folks,]

588
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,840

[relationships.]

[These relations]

"Bad relationships"

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,680

"These are my observations only,"

605
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,920
"not universal."

606
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,040
"Share your different experiences"

607
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,520
"in comments."

608

Drives engagement.

609
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,040
Your TV experience shows!

610
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,480
Wow,

611
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,800
nice touch.

612
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Ass-kisser!

613
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,160
Just facts!

614
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,480
Numbers?

615
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,600
Great!

616
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,600
Almost 100k,

617
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,360
comments flowing.

618
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,320
100k per hour,

619
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,760
perfect!

620
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
Hello Mom?

621
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,400
Why are you

622
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,320
talking nonsense

623
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,480
again?

624
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,520
[Remember what happened?]

625
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,040
[Yudong almost returned to Canada]

626
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,680
[because of your loose talk!]

627
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:13,840
Mark my words,

628
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,320
he'll be upset again.

629
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,440
Didn't name him.

630
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,520
I said it was

631
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,560
a friend,

632
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,640
no names.

633
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,720
What's the problem?

634
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,560
Don't worry so much.

635
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,480
I'm working,

636
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,920
these sudden calls

637
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,680
are startling.

638
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,160
Bye.

639
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,280
Zhang Jianbin!

640
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,400
Zhang Jianbin!

641
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,240
Talking to you!

642
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,960
Did you watch it?

643
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,120
Yeah?

644
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,520
Focus!

645
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,880
I'm talking to you!

646
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,720
Did you check

647
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,840
what I sent?

648
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,600
You good?

649
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,560
Yeah.

650
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,280
[Guys, let's talk about something]

651
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,360
[heartfelt today.]

652
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,360
[Why do Chinese fathers and sons]

653
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,520
[often act like strangers]

654
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,520
[or enemies?]

655
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,360
[Experienced this?]

656
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,680
[When both sides]

657
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,400
[care deeply]

658
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,920
[but maintain]

659
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,600
[this cold exterior?]

660
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,880
[I wonder]

661
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,440
[why these blood ties...]

662
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,720
Home, honey!

663
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,960
What's all this?

664
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,800
Shoes off?

665
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,000
Nah!

666
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,600
Cardboard's down,

667
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,880
just come in.

668
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,840
Door's done?

669
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,480
Whoa,

670
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,600
mattress here?

671
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,800
Wasn't that coming later?

672
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,960
Got a call,

673
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,320
said they could deliver today

674
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
if I was home.

675
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,040
Said yes.

676
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,680
Wow,

677
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,240
Ethan is back online!

678
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,360
You're amazing!

679
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,520
Working all day?

680
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:44,960
Exhausted?

681
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,160
I'm OK.

682
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,720
Let me work

683
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,440
those knots out.

684
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,920
Why so nice?

685
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,840
What's happening?

686
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,840
Come on,

687
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,680
I'm always

688
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,080
this nice!

689
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,520
Made content today?

690
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,240
About what?

691
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,320
Just daily stuff,

692
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
few views.

693
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,600
Nothing special,

694
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,680
don't bother watching.

695
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,000
Didn't get promoted,

696
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,840
disappeared.

697
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:10,680
Stop tapping,

698
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,760
can't align.

699
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,440
Done.

700
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:15,920
OK.

701
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,160
Honey, I really can't live

702
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
without you!

703
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,960
Place looks fantastic,

704
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,080
all your work!

705
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,280
Must celebrate.

706
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,920
Your birthday's coming up,

707
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,640
let's make it special.

708
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,280
I'll organize

709
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
everything.

710
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,400
Skip it, I don't do birthdays.

711
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,400
Can't skip birthdays!

712
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,520
Gotta celebrate!

713
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,240
Li Daoqi told me

714
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,440
the "Dr. Fu" trademark got

715
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:40,920
cleared.

716
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,840
Need to handle stuff

717
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,520
that day.

718
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,720
Might take a while.

719
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,160
I'll grab quick noodles.

720
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
"Might take a while?"

721
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,240
No matter the time,

722
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,320
eat at home,

723
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,080
clear?

724
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,360
Got it.

725
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,640
Gotta finish the bathroom.

726
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,920
Gonna work on it.

727
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,320
Hello, can I help you?

728
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,000
I am Fu Yudong.

729
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,320
Mr. Li here?

730
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,280
Mr. Li...

731
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,200
Mr. Li right here!

732
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,920
Mr. Li.

733
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,160
No need to be nice.

734
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,400
See strangers like this one,

735
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
kick'em out!

736
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,960
Meet Dr. Fu,

737
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
our CEO!

738
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,520
Look!

739
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,320
Welcome, Mr. Fu!

740
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,360
Hello.

741
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:35,680
C'mon,

742
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,640
let me show you around.

743
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,640
See this?

744
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,280
CEO's office!

745
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,720
Your office?

746
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,800
Yours.

747
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,240
Mine's all the way there.

748
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,440
Isn't this too much?

749
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,760
We're barely a company.

750
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,680
Be careful!

751
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,640
Staff's listening.

752
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,520
Folks,

753
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,800
meet our CEO,

754
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,680
Mr. Fu!

755
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,600
Mr. Fu!

756
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,080
Stay seated.

757
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,760
Keep working, please.

758
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Continue everyone.

759
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,360
All these people...

760
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,080
new hires?

761
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,520
Like I said,

762
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,560
Xing Kai's

763
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,400
pro manager

764
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,560
handled

765
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,440
recruitment.

766
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,360
He said,

767
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,320
once we're settled,

768
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,520
we can hire more

769
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,440
ourselves.

770
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,920
More staff?

771
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,320
C'mon,

772
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,160
that's

773
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,120
too expensive!

774
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,240
How many houses needed?

775
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,160
Are there any left?

776
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,440
Such small thinking!

777
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,160
Here,

778
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,000
your tag!

779
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,920
Listen,

780
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,080
no messing up

781
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,960
in there.

782
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,480
Stay confident,

783
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,600
got it?

784
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,840
I'm decoration,

785
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,120
you talk, got it!

786
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,920
Alright,

787
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,080
perfect,

788
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,520
looking sharp!

789
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,560
Show time!

790
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,520
Yudong,

791
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,320
Daoqi,

792
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,600

793
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,400
whom I've always

794
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,080
brought up.

795
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,560
Michael,

796
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,280
our CEO,

797
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,520
Dr. Fu Yudong.

798
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,640
Sit, sit.

799
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,160
And our COO,

800
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,720
Mr. Li Daoqi.

801
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,720
Michael,

802
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,120
your introduction?

803
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,560
Hello,

804
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,480
Mr. Fu, Mr. Li.

805
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,640
I'm Michael.

806
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,240
About my background...

807
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,640
Economics at

808
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,560
an Ivy League,

809
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,840
then Big Four

810
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,400
consulting

811
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:28,840
for four years.

812
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,360
In 2010...

813
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,280
yeah 2010,

814
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,120
went to Wharton for MBA.

815
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,360
Since then,

816
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,320
I've worked with

817
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,560
startup companies

818
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,880
as corporate partner.

819
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,680
Wasn't quite successful

820
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,000
until meeting Mr. Xing.

821
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,200
Mr. Xing...

822
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,080
he's been

823
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,920
my mentor,

824
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,160
absolutely.

825
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,240
Yeah.

826
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,320
Taught me valuable lessons,

827
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,720
both

828
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,920
business and life.

829
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,440
I'm confident Mr. Xing

830
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,120
chose you both

831
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,000
as partners

832
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,080
because you're

833
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,240
truly exceptional...

834
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,120
Can we trust this dude?

835
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,520
Seems clever

836
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,160
but

837
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,320
not exactly...

838
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,760
We're

839
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,560
new to

840
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,000
management.

841
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,160
What if...

842
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,520
No worry.

843
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,680
With Xing Kai's investment,

844
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,240
he wouldn't pick someone

845
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,360
who'd fail.

846
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,320
True.

847
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,880
Actually, our inexperience

848
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,720
is why

849
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,040
we need someone

850
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,320
like Michael.

851
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,760
Let him demonstrate.

852
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,720
We watch,

853
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,720
we learn.

854
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,840
Simple, right?

855
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,840
Yeah,

856
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,680
watch and learn.

857
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,520
Do you know

858
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,320
what my outfit's

859
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,120
called?

860
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,000
Business casual!

861
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,760
Deliberately underdressed

862
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,680
compared to his business professional.

863
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,200
Shows him

864
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,280
who's really in charge

865
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,160
around here!

866
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,360
Yours is different!

867
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,320
That's

868
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,360
your PhD warrior gear!

869
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,520
Meaningful!

870
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,080
Power-up outfit!

871
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,680
Dude, we're all the way up,

872
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,960
no going down!

873
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,560
Enter.

874
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,920
Mr. Li, Mr. Fu,

875
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,120
business cards ready.

876
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,880
Good.

877
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,680
Mr. Li's.

878
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,400
-And these are Mr. Fu's. -Thanks.

879
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,160
Thanks.

880
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,920
Welcome.

881
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,760
"Mr. Fu (Second in charge)"

882
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,040
sounds odd,

883
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,680
doesn't it?

884
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,960
Yes, CEO

885
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,080
sounds like VP.

886
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,320
It's OK!

887
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,160
Just a title.

888
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,680
How about "Mr. Dong!"

889
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,040
Just kidding!

890
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,240
Why not!

891
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,040
Tell everyone,

892
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,000
dinner's

893
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
on me tonight.

894
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,840
Michael's team already

895
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,920
left for dinner.

896
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,320
Saving my money!

897
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,080
Just us three then.

898
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,360
You pick a restaurant.

899
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,320
Still got work...

900
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,680
Fine, just us!

901
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Executive meeting!

902
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,680
I...

903
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,520
Shut up!

904
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,360
Solo dinner then!

905
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,680
OK, I'm coming!

906
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,360
We were just messing around.

907
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,440
Carry on.

908
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,440
Right, leaving now.

909
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,080
OK.

910
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,080
Jesse must think we're nuts.

911
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,200
We are.

912
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,000
Li Daoqi,

913
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,840
President, Dr. Fu Limited.

914
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,800
Good enough?

915
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,480
Perfect.

916
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,960
BUSINESS CASUAL!

917
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,160
Enough videos.

918
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,160
Always on

919
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,240
that phone.

920
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,680
Mom.

921
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,320
C'mon!

922
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
Come here, quick!

923
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,000
Alright, alright.

924
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,120
Over here!

925
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,600
C'mon!

926
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,960
1, 2, 3,

927
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,240
-Happy Birthday! -Welcome...

928
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,000
wait...

929
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,000
Happy Birthday! Yay!

930
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,680
Heart signs, remember?

931
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,120
Hearts!

932
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,920
Hearts!

933
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,840
From TV...

934
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,960
what's it...Party...

935
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,840
Yeah...

936
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,920
Hearts,

937
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,400
young people's style,

938
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,040
right?

939
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,960
Yes...thanks.

940
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,080
I'm home!

941
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,240
Coming!

942
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,960
Fu Yudong here?

943
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,080
Right here.

944
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,680
Sweet party...

945
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,040
Dad, Mom!

946
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,840
So,

947
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,880
everyone's acquainted?

948
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,800
Yeah, yeah.

949
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,440
Your mom's wonderful.

950
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,600
Nice party, sit!

951
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,280
Move along,

952
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,080
don't hover.

953
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,040
Here, man,

954
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,920
this seat.

955
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,240
Please!

956
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,320
No formalities.

957
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,040
We're all family.

958
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,080
Dad, this side,

959
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,920
here.

960
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,840
This spot's fine.

961
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,000
Sure, sure.

962
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,800
OK, I'm here.

963
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,280
I'll take this.

964
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:04,880
Elders first.

965
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,680
Yudong, here.

966
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,680
Need to wash up.

967
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,920
Mom, that spot.

968
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,920
This works.

969
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,280
Please, everyone.

970
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:12,960
Sit.

971
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:13,960
OK,

972
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,440
I'm center.

973
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,440
Everything's perfect.

974
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,800
Shrimp?

975
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:23,920
Dig in!

976
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,920
Yudong, eat!

977
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,760
You won't believe

978
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,200
how famous I am

979
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,320
in our neighborhood!

980
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,120
First thought neighbors

981
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,080
were greeting me,

982
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,720
but no!

983
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,000
Everyone asks about him!

984
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,880
Yeah.

985
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,320
Better than

986
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,560
maintenance staff,

987
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,480
seriously!

988
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,320
Yeah!

989
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,120
Announcement,

990
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,680
he's retiring from

991
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,960
repairs.

992
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,320
He and Li Daoqi

993
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,760
started...

994
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,640
what's it called...

995
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,720
he's a CEO now!

996
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,360
With his

997
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,680
chemistry background,

998
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,080
they're doing cosmetics.

999
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,840
No more

1000
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,560
Yudong, the handyman.

1001
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,960
Now he's Mr. Fu, the CEO!

1002
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,120
They should know,

1003
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,000
it's huge!

1004
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,240
With Li Daoqi?

1005
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,080
Toast time!

1006
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,000
Congrats!

1007
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,560
To our CEO!

1008
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,600
C'mon, Yudong!

1009
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,560
Mr. Fu!

1010
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,840
First round!

1011
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,320
Cheers!

1012
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,240
Drink up.

1013
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,800
She oversold it.

1014
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,640
Startups

1015
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,520
can succeed

1016
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,600
or fail.

1017
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,760
Have a drink!

1018
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,560
Success isn't everything.

1019
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,800
You'll make it!

1020
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,320
Will succeed!

1021
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,960
Just

1022
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,440
do your best!

1023
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,520
Proud of you!

1024
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,760
Eat up,

1025
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,320
let them speak.

1026
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,080
Right, right.

1027
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,720
Dear parents,

1028
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,840
another toast.

1029
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,960
Since he's shy,

1030
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,200
I'll speak.

1031
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,560
On his birthday,

1032
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,200
thanks for coming

1033
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,560
all the way here.

1034
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,080
Sorry we're late,

1035
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,360
thank you

1036
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,920
for the surprise!

1037
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,040
Thanks!

1038
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,400
You can

1039
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,680
count on us

1040
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,520
to look after you.

1041
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,960
Wishing you health

1042
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,800
and fortune,

1043
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,680
yes?

1044
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,320
Your health means

1045
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:58,960
everything!

1046
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,240
♪Wonder if the horizon♪

1047
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,600
♪has an end...♪

1048
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,480
Living room's done,

1049
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
trash gone.

1050
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,360
Perfect!

1051
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,080
Quick, help choose

1052
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:12,760
one,

1053
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,000
a party photo.

1054
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,480
No smiles from you,

1055
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,520
babe.

1056
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,920
Need to talk.

1057
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,440
Birthday treat?

1058
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,120
Roger, into the shower!

1059
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,760
This is serious.

1060
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,000
I mean it.

1061
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,800
What?

1062
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,320
I'm grateful for

1063
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,679
the surprise party,

1064
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,520
really.

1065
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,880
But truthfully...

1066
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
I didn't enjoy it.

1067
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,920
Just...

1068
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,800
why were there suddenly

1069
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,640
so many people?

1070
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,600
Many people?

1071
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,120
Just our parents

1072
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,240
and us.

1073
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,880
Who else?

1074
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,880
That's my point.

1075
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,960
That video about

1076
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,200
Chinese father-son relationships,

1077
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,320
I watched it.

1078
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,520
People may say

1079
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,520
create more communication.

1080
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,720
You meant well.

1081
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,480
I get it.

1082
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,800
It might

1083
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,720
work for others,

1084
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,040
but

1085
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,520
I'm different.

1086
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,680
My case is different.

1087
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,840
How different?

1088
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,320
He's your father!

1089
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,680
What's

1090
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,800
the big issue?

1091
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,920
I don't get it.

1092
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,120
Can you explain?

1093
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,400
I and him...

1094
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,960
I know how to handle it.

1095
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,480
Got a plan.

1096
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,520
What plan?

1097
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,200
Tell me.

1098
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,240
Tell me about it.

1099
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,640
Look,

1100
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,120
we're back now.

1101
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,560
You can't avoid

1102
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,080
him, right?

1103
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,640
If you must see him,

1104
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,400
why not make it pleasant?

1105
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,120
So you're saying

1106
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,760
I messed up?

1107
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,520
Not about blame.

1108
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,840
Let's skip who's right or wrong,

1109
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,160
and others' comments

1110
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,320
online.

1111
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,200
I'm just sharing

1112
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,120
my honest feelings,

1113
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,680
I felt awkward!

1114
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,360
Unhappy.

1115
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,480
Don't like it.

1116
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:08,920
Why...

1117
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,800
Point is,

1118
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,320
whatever you're planning,

1119
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,920
please

1120
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,000
talk with me

1121
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,920
first!

1122
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,760
Especially

1123
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,080
about him!

1124
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,200
Fine!

1125
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,680
Tried helping, got rejected.

1126
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,120
My fault for meddling,

1127
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,600
alright?

1128
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,080
Sorry, my bad!

1129
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,920
My fault!

1130
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,960
Sorry, Dr. Fu!

1131
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,560
Won't happen again!

1132
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,960
I'm stupid!

1133
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,880
Moron!

1134
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,880
No shower?

1135
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,120
No! Never again!

1136
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,680
Stay stinky!

1137
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,120
Stink you out!

1138
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,400
Was all good,

1139
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,400
why this madness!

1140
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,400
You startled me!

1141
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,960
Drinking?

1142
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,880
With whom?

1143
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,480
Listen here,

1144
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,760
no drinking with Uncle Fu,

1145
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,880
he's got live issues...

1146
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,880
Wasn't him.

1147
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,600
Got something good.

1148
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,720
Eyes open.

1149
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,000
Still meditating...

1150
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,920
Open up.

1151
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,400
Shower!

1152
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,680
You reek.

1153
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,680
Shoo!

1154
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,920
Open up.

1155
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,840
Won't.

1156
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,920
Check it out.

1157
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,680
What?

1158
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,000
Can't read it.

1159
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,920
What's this?

1160
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,240
New job?

1161
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,480
Which company?

1162
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,400
Read.

1163
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,520
"Dr. Fu?"

1164
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,520
Yudong's company?

1165
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,240
He's starting up?

1166
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,680
You're president?

1167
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,160
Technically, me, your darling

1168
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,880
brought him in. Handled everything,

1169
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,200
investments,

1170
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,520
registration,

1171
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,280
all me!

1172
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,880
My office

1173
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,040
is ready,

1174
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,840
gorgeous.

1175
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,520
Tomorrow morning,

1176
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,160
showing you and Nian

1177
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,440
around.

1178
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,520
You?

1179
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,760
Startup?

1180
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,840
Legal rep?

1181
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,120
49% shares?

1182
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,600
Why would they

1183
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,080
give you that much?

1184
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,760
Everyone knows?

1185
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,680
Explain!

1186
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,640
I wanted

1187
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,600
51%,

1188
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,520
can't happen!

1189
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,320
They wanted control!

1190
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,120
Didn't mean to hide it...

1191
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,880
Knew you'd

1192
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,360
say no.

1193
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,400
My age,

1194
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,240
nothing to show.

1195
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,120
Dining with

1196
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,960
your friends,

1197
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,120
introducing

1198
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,600
myself...

1199
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,720
I'm embarrassed!

1200
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,840
Might be

1201
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,200
my final shot.

1202
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,280
Had to try.

1203
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,880
Maybe it'll work?

1204
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,640
Truth is, I'm scared.

1205
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:46,960
Really.

1206
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,520
Just wanted your support.

1207
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,440
If you're against it,

1208
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,760
I'll go tomorrow,

1209
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,840
pull out,

1210
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,440
end it...

1211
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,720
[Amanda,]

1212
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,760
[ridiculous!]

1213
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,000
[A younger man?]

1214
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,680
[Six years younger.]

1215
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,760
[Can you handle him?]

1216
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,600
[Be realistic!]

1217
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,280
[Yeah,]

1218
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,520
[think ahead.]

1219
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,600
[Close now,]

1220
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,840
[but later when you age]

1221
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,880
[and he's still young...]

1222
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,880
[What will you be to him,]

1223
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,080
[wife or mother?]

1224
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,120
[Sis, open your eyes.]

1225
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,040
[He wants a sugar mama.]

1226
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,360
[He'll spend your money]

1227
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,920
[and leave you!]

1228
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,600
[To conclude,]

1229
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,640
[accept kindness.]

1230
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,840
[Offering it]

1231
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,160
[takes courage.]

1232
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,000
[That's all for today,]

1233
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,840
[thanks!]

1234
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,720
So focused on

1235
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,880
someone being a CEO.

1236
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,520
Oops,

1237
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,600
made extra breakfast

1238
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,320
without asking.

1239
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,840
Annoying him again.

1240
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:26,560
My fault.

1241
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,400
Taking back.

1242
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,600
Must take it back.

1243
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,240
Dumbass,

1244
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,360
zero

1245
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,240
sense,

1246
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,040
complete loser,

1247
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,760
just

1248
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,560
annoying him!

1249
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,880
Lousy startup!

1250
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,600
Big shot!

1251
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,840
Mr. CEO getting cocky,

1252
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,320
huh?

1253
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,960
Acting all mighty!

1254
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,280
Running late.

1255
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,480
OK,

1256
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,360
for the road.

1257
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:58,760
Thanks!

1258
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,040
Bang!

1259
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
Shoes done.

1260
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,240
Saw it.

1261
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,240
Love you!
