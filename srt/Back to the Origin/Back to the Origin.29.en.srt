1
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,320
This bottle of wine

2
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,200
is the one you brought last time.

3
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,320
There's half left.

4
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,720
Let's drink it today.

5
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,440
Hey.

6
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,560
It's fine.

7
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,440
I can bring you more.

8
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,880
Alright.

9
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
Let's finish this first.

10
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,960
Is this your first time

11
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,480
at the zoo since coming back?

12
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,880
If you mean coming at night,

13
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,520
that's a first in my life.

14
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,840
Did you ever go to the zoo

15
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,840
when you were in Toronto?

16
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,320
No, not once.

17
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,360
My mom was there with me.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,840
You know. I had no freedom.

19
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,960
See it?

20
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,720
There's one.

21
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,840
They're so cute.

22
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,280
Cute, right?

23
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,920
Want me to be your guide today?

24
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,200
Sure.

25
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,200
I... I need to use the bathroom.

26
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,920
Let's go together then.

27
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,360
Together, don't go alone.

28
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,120
Look at you.

29
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,880
Here, let me help you.

30
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:11,920
Let's go.

31
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,720
I need to check.

32
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,280
I need to check. Let me see.

33
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,839
Don't worry about the rest.

34
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,399
Hurry, quick.

35
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,440
Can't hold it much longer.

36
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,600
Watch your step.

37
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,640
I'm on duty.

38
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,280
Watch your step. Let's go.

39
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,120
Hey, look at you.

40
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:25,800
Look at you.

41
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,640
Wait for me.

42
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,080
Take this.

43
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,440
If they get close,

44
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,760
just hold this out towards them.

45
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,360
Slowly back away.

46
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,040
What do you do

47
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,560
at the zoo?

48
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,760
I feel like all the animals

49
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,800
really like you.

50
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,560
I'm a zoo tycoon.

51
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,520
Night-shift cleaner.

52
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,120
Did Fran tell you?

53
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,320
Tell me what?

54
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,320
My parents got sentenced.

55
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,800
A bit.

56
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
Did Fran tell you

57
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,520
about my parents?

58
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes.

59
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,480
Said they went traveling in an RV.

60
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,000
Fran is

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,720
such a gossip.

62
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,680
Gotta thank him though.

63
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
Let's thank Fran.

64
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,680
Look at that one.

65
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,520
It's coming over.

66
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,880
Coming over.

67
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,680
Here it comes.

68
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,159
Look at you, are you drunk?

69
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,720
Hey.

70
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,680
No, just perking myself up.

71
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,400
You took so long.

72
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
I thought you fell in.

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,920
You rascal, just you wait.

74
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,440
When you get old,

75
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,320
you might

76
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,680
take longer to pee than I do.

77
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,040
I don't know why,

78
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,640
but we can't get in today.

79
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,240
We could a few days ago.

80
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,800
Would you like to see

81
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,760
any other animals?

82
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,640
How about pandas?

83
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,160
Any other national treasures would do.

84
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,040
We can't get in there.

85
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,640
They won't pay attention to us.

86
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,680
They go to sleep

87
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,400
right after closing time.

88
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,560
You danced really well, really.

89
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,120
Okay?

90
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,800
Absolutely.

91
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,360
Is it good?

92
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:45,840
Very.

93
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,480
I danced all the time when I was young.

94
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,480
I can tell.

95
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,600
Dance like crazy.

96
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,520
Alright.

97
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,400
Catch your breath.

98
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,840
Catch your breath.

99
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,080
I... I'll go scout

100
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,600
outside.

101
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,000
Don't want any trouble, okay?

102
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,640
Don't go.

103
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,160
You can't do that.

104
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,960
We haven't drunk properly yet.

105
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,600
Sit still.

106
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,800
I need to have a proper drink with you.

107
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,760
You're not going anywhere.

108
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,080
Fu.

109
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,040
Do you have something on your mind?

110
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,440
I feel like

111
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,640
you're acting weird.

112
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,080
No. I...

113
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,960
I just wanted to drink with you.

114
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,280
Let's drink until we drop.

115
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,520
Drink until we drop?

116
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,640
You must have something on your mind.

117
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,960
You won't say, huh?

118
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,560
That's not it.

119
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,040
Fine, then leave.

120
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,240
I'm going to sleep right now.

121
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:30,840
Get out.

122
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,880
Hey, no. Please.

123
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,600
I'll tell you.

124
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,480
I'll talk, alright?

125
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,559
I'll talk.

126
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,480
You definitely have sharp eyes.

127
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,640
You saw right through me.

128
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,200
I'm an open book to you.

129
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,240
I'll talk.

130
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,080
I'm a bit sad today.

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,480
I broke up.

132
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,440
See?

133
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
What did I say?

134
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,000
I knew you came here

135
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,800
with something on your mind.

136
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,000
Whatever it is, tell me.

137
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,720
I'll help you sort it out.

138
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,240
Alright?

139
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,040
Easy does it. Thank you.

140
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,320
The first time I came here,

141
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,600
it reminded me

142
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
of Canada's Wonderland.

143
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,800
There's a similar pumpkin cart here.

144
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,680
Just a different color.

145
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,400
Don't you think life is amazing?

146
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,640
So many places

147
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,960
feel familiar.

148
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
I've only seen pictures

149
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,760
of Wonderland online.

150
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,640
Never been there.

151
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,640
You haven't been?

152
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,960
Then today, I'll show you

153
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,320
a not-so-wonderful Wonderland.

154
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,720
Well, I have a girlfriend.

155
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,320
It's been a little while.

156
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,280
But today

157
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,960
I found out she...

158
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,640
For the past six months, I've given her

159
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,000
everything she wanted.

160
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,640
Seatbelt.

161
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,040
I always see people riding this

162
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,080
during the day when I'm cleaning.

163
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,680
It only runs during the day.

164
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,360
This is my first time too.

165
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,360
From this high-altitude bike,

166
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,640
you can see

167
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,920
the whole park.

168
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,040
You can see the animals during the day.

169
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,760
At night, you can even hear

170
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,640
them calling.

171
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,640
I heard it.

172
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,680
What animal

173
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,800
was calling over there just now?

174
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,640
Probably a peacock.

175
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,040
Peacocks can make sounds?

176
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,240
My grandma said animals are simpler.

177
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,080
So working at the zoo

178
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,760
is pretty good for me.

179
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,240
I have animals around me.

180
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,440
But now you don't just

181
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,120
have animals,

182
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,040
you also have friends.

183
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,080
Like Fran.

184
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,880
Like me.

185
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,720
We're all your friends.

186
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,440
Did I wake you?

187
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,480
No, I just fell asleep.

188
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,760
Great news.

189
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,880
What good news?

190
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,320
I found a school for Nian.

191
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,960
This school has

192
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,240
its own horse ranch

193
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,440
and

194
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,160
golf training area.

195
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,800
It even offers ski training.

196
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,000
Don't you love skiing

197
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,120
and golf?

198
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,000
Oh, great.

199
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,960
Now I'm the one falling behind.

200
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,160
I need to catch up with you two.

201
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,040
Why do you seem

202
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
a bit upset?

203
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,400
Daoqi,

204
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,920
I thought we were on the same page

205
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,080
about the child's education.

206
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,960
We already discussed this.

207
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,000
And then you suddenly tell me this.

208
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,840
You should've discussed it with me.

209
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,960
I am discussing it with you.

210
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,960
You were worried the public school's

211
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,440
teaching resources were limited

212
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,680
and afraid Nian

213
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,240
wouldn't get the proper attention.

214
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:24,960
Look.

215
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,160
This school

216
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,360
has one teacher for every two students.

217
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,560
And every teacher

218
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,400
is qualified to work with

219
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,200
special needs children like Nian.

220
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,800
You can completely

221
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,200
trust them with him.

222
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,480
Daoqi, Nian is my child.

223
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,720
I know best what he needs

224
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,320
and what's best for him.

225
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,280
You didn't even give me a heads-up.

226
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,560
This is a bit reckless.

227
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,880
Nian is your child,

228
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,320
and he's my child too.

229
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,120
I wouldn't hurt him.

230
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,600
And you know what?

231
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,480
This is the best private school

232
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,400
in Lucheng City.

233
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,240
You can't get in just with money.

234
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,640
They screen the parents.

235
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,240
I specifically asked Xing Kai to help,

236
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,160
then he asked a friend,

237
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,440
and we went through more connections

238
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,319
just to get this one spot.

239
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,599
How is that reckless?

240
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,160
You know Nian's situation

241
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,720
is special.

242
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,359
He could be bullied.

243
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,880
What he needs most is

244
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,600
family life

245
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
with his parents.

246
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,880
And for you, as his dad,

247
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
you should spend

248
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,640
more time with him.

249
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,600
Did Nian tell you that?

250
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,320
What... What?

251
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,320
Are these

252
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,280
Nian's thoughts

253
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,400
or yours?

254
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,640
I know what you're anxious about.

255
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
But you can't decide

256
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,080
how Nian's childhood

257
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,720
should be spent just because of

258
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,600
your excessive worry.

259
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,680
Your thoughts

260
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,680
don't speak for him.

261
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,560
Anyway, I've already paid the deposit.

262
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,880
What is this?

263
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,280
This is a horse ranch, see?

264
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,800
And what's this?

265
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,480
This is the golf training center.

266
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,320
What is this?

267
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,880
This is an indoor ski slope.

268
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,400
And this?

269
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,160
This is the cafeteria.

270
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,960
Look, it says so right there.

271
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,560
See?

272
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,840
Then what's this?

273
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,280
This is the library.

274
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,440
Look, is it big?

275
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,360
Big.

276
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,680
All of this area is part of the library.

277
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,320
Look over here. What's this?

278
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,760
What's this?

279
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,120
This is the big playground.

280
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,360
And what's this?

281
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,120
This is called the staff center.

282
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,120
Then what's this over here?

283
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,360
This is the interest...

284
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,520
Okay.

285
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,160
Nian, I'm heading to work.

286
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,040
Listen to your mom, alright?

287
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,640
Be good.

288
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,160
I'm leaving.

289
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,640
I'm off to work.

290
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,040
Nian, sit.

291
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,200
Time for breakfast.

292
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,200
No more watching this.

293
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,800
Right this way, please.

294
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,680
Take it easy, don't run!

295
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,360
This is our

296
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,120
teaching building.

297
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,720
It has four floors in total.

298
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,520
On this side we have classrooms,

299
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,920
a dining area, and a media room.

300
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,840
Over here are some

301
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,120
students' works for appreciation,

302
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,280
along with memorable moments.

303
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,560
Apart from this,

304
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,400
we also have

305
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,960
a multi-purpose playground,

306
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,160
a children's swimming pool,

307
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,280
and a mini golf course at the back.

308
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,200
Up front is

309
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,320
the Lemon Class I mentioned.

310
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,640
Lemon Class is the designed class

311
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,400
for children with special needs.

312
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,600
It's perfect for children

313
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,320
like yours.

314
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,600
They're having a study session.

315
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
We can go take a look.

316
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,680
This is the Lemon Class.

317
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,760
The teacher-to-student ratio here

318
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,440
is one to two,

319
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,800
which is quite high.

320
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,120
All the teaching resources,

321
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,080
curriculum, and after-school programs

322
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,920
for Lemon Class

323
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,400
are specially designed.

324
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,920
So these children are separated

325
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,120
from the others?

326
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,760
Children like yours

327
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,200
have different needs

328
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,000
from typical ones.

329
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,000
Lemons may be sour,

330
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,480
but they're really nutritious.

331
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,760
It's all about

332
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,640
how you put them to use.

333
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,920
Ms. Xue.

334
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,920
It's fine.

335
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,640
Sorry about that.

336
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,320
This student's still receiving guidance.

337
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,480
Let's go take a break over there.

338
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,240
Okay.

339
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,280
It's alright. Don't be scared.

340
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,080
Mom's right here.

341
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,640
Lemon Class

342
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,640
is really popular.

343
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,400
We just

344
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,520
had a student transfer out,

345
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
so one spot opened up.

346
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,320
And you were referred by Mr. Wang.

347
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
Li Nian's dad has already paid

348
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,000
the deposit.

349
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,600
You just need to fill out

350
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,680
the registration form.

351
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,120
Can I ask something?

352
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,120
You just said

353
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,600
a child transferred out.

354
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,520
Where did he go?

355
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,760
I'm sorry.

356
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,000
That's private student info.

357
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,080
I can't really tell you that.

358
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,480
You're back so early today?

359
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,720
Have you eaten?

360
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,640
Let me fix you something.

361
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,760
What do you want?

362
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,040
What's wrong?

363
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,040
I just got a call from the school.

364
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,480
They said you took Nian there today.

365
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,640
But you didn't register him,

366
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,880
and you had them

367
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,280
refund the deposit instead.

368
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,960
Calm down.

369
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,320
Let's not get mad in front of the child.

370
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,280
Sit down.

371
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
I'll explain it to you.

372
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,080
We did go to

373
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,920
the school today.

374
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,360
But that Lemon Class

375
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,960
is for special needs children.

376
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,240
I was worried Nian would get labeled

377
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,760
if he attended.

378
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,880
When I suggested sending him

379
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,200
to a public school...

380
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,520
Keep your voice down.

381
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,600
When I suggested sending him

382
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,440
to a public school,

383
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,080
you said he needed special care

384
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,400
and were afraid he'd be bullied.

385
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,360
Now I found the best private school

386
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,280
in Lucheng City,

387
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,080
and this class

388
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,000
is specifically for children

389
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,320
like him.

390
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,080
And you're worried he might get labeled.

391
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,640
He's at the age

392
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,040
to go to school now.

393
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,480
But he stays home

394
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,920
every single day.

395
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,360
I really don't know

396
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,200
if you even want him

397
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,480
to have a normal life.

398
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,160
Are you finished?

399
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,560
Can I speak now?

400
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,240
No.

401
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,960
I don't want to hear you today.

402
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,160
In this house,

403
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,000
whatever I say,

404
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,280
we end up doing things your way anyway.

405
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,160
From now on, just listen to your mom.

406
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,560
[Zhang Ran, your team's topics]

407
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,640
[are all buzzworthy.]

408
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,720
[During the actual show,]

409
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,840
[you have to maintain]

410
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,920
[this style.]

411
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,280
[Anran,]

412
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,960
[same for you.]

413
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,360
[Just relax and open up,]

414
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,880
[alright?]

415
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Got it, director.

416
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,600
Don't worry.

417
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,080
We'll go all out

418
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,800
to collaborate for the show's success.

419
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,160
Director, I'll also do my best

420
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,640
to work with Anran.

421
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,760
[Good. I have very high hopes]

422
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,640
[for your duo.]

423
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,440
[Let's all work together]

424
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,560
[to turn this little hit]

425
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,080
[into a major one.]

426
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,920
The theme for today's debate

427
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,480
is "Lie Flat or Grind".

428
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,880
So, which side are you guys

429
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,600
leaning toward?

430
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,600
Alright, I'll go first.

431
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,720
I really love

432
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,920
this episode's theme.

433
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,920
To be honest, in our industry,

434
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,080
if you can't grind, you're done.

435
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,600
But I've been exhausted these years.

436
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,000
I feel like I'm burning out.

437
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,240
So I'd like to choose

438
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,560
the pro side. Is that okay?

439
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,680
Don't you want to

440
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,800
challenge yourself?

441
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,520
[Breaking out]

442
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,560
[of your usual persona]

443
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,360
[might get you more attention.]

444
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,840
Director,

445
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,760
I think for the first episode,

446
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,840
it'd be easier for the audience

447
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,880
to accept

448
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,560
if we stick to what they expect.

449
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,520
I agree

450
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,640
with Anran.

451
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,160
I think going all-in on the grind

452
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,240
is a solid choice.

453
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,040
[Alright.]

454
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,520
[I get your points.]

455
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,080
[We'll]

456
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,560
[refine the show's flow]

457
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,480
[and discuss more later.]

458
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,920
Okay. No problem.

459
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,120
Bye, sir.

460
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:40,720
[Okay.]

461
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
[We'll wrap up here today. Bye.]

462
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,320
Alright. Thanks, sir.

463
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,120
Appreciate your work, sir.

464
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:43,920
Thanks for your effort, sir.

465
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,200
That's it then.

466
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,120
Meeting's over, then.

467
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,480
Alright. We'll get back to work.

468
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,760
Okay. Everyone, go get ready.

469
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,160
Aren't you leaving?

470
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,040
I have another meeting to attend.

471
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,000
Okay. We're heading out then.

472
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:57,680
Okay.

473
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,560
Xiaohe.

474
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,800
Gather our team

475
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,680
for a meeting.

476
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:04,840
Look, Ran.

477
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,800
No matter how you put it,

478
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,120
choosing "grind" will get you flak.

479
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,840
So what?

480
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,560
It won't hurt.

481
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,800
Besides, the more...

482
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,440
Unconventional the move.

483
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,400
Right. The more...

484
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,800
surprising the outcome.

485
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,360
Exactly.

486
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,840
Okay. Just remember to speak slower.

487
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,160
Alright.

488
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,560
This episode must be a success.

489
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,040
No room for failure.

490
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,800
For the next two days, everyone

491
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,920
needs to do serious preparation.

492
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,320
Sort through

493
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,040
all the videos,

494
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,080
articles,

495
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,200
and any other materials

496
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,560
related to "lie flat" or "grind".

497
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,560
I will have three speeches.

498
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,240
Each one needs

499
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,000
a killer quote.

500
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,520
Something that'll go viral.

501
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,880
Every minute must have a punchline.

502
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,360
Anran, when you say punchline,

503
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,680
do you mean like stand-up style?

504
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,920
Any kind of punchline is fine,

505
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,680
as long as it sparks conversation

506
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,000
and gets people talking.

507
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,800
We all know

508
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,520
this show

509
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,640
uses audience voting.

510
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,200
So what do we have to do?

511
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,280
We have to win!

512
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,720
Don't you guys want to win?

513
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,080
Win!

514
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,840
What are you clapping for?

515
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,080
We haven't even won yet.

516
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Any other questions?

517
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,000
Anran,

518
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,760
the TCM appointment is coming up.

519
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Should I call a ride now?

520
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,160
Let's go.

521
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,520
Go for it.

522
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,480
Come on!

523
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,760
We have to win!

524
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,560
Come on, guys.

525
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,720
Grinding like crazy

526
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,400
but still talking about self-acceptance?

527
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,720
I give up. I'm lying flat.

528
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,280
I want to lie flat too.

529
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,440
Who would grind if they could lie flat?

530
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,320
Then why do we grind?

531
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,840
Simple. We have no choice.

532
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,320
I wish I could

533
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,120
spill coffee

534
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,560
on someone's shirt

535
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,840
and have them say,

536
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,120
"Sweetheart,

537
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,520
you've caught my attention."

538
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,000
"Here's my card. "

539
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,480
"Spend it however you like."

540
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,400
That's actually pretty cringe.

541
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,440
Who wrote this?

542
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,680
It's disgusting.

543
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,240
The values are all wrong.

544
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,160
Why are you still up so late?

545
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,200
I'm exhausted.

546
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,680
I'm working

547
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,600
on my speech.

548
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,840
I'm going to bed.

549
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,280
Gotta get up early tomorrow.

550
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,840
[No.]

551
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,720
[I think it's good.]

552
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,800
[Or you could ask Yudong?]

553
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,280
[He can represent the audience.]

554
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,720
I'm asleep. Stop talking.

555
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:11,960
Good night.

556
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,840
Let's go.

557
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,760
Hello, Cheng Man.

558
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,600
[It's Zhang Ran.]

559
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,680
[Sorry to bother you.]

560
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,480
[I... I really]

561
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,880
[have no one else to discuss this with.]

562
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,000
About that talk show

563
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
you helped me with,

564
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,360
we're recording the first episode today.

565
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,840
I have a segment in it

566
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
and I'm not sure

567
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,920
if what I'm saying will work

568
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,760
or if it might cause issues.

569
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,920
[So I want]

570
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,840
[your advice on it.]

571
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,280
Alright. Tell me what you've got.

572
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,680
Okay. Here goes.

573
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,280
The theme of our talk is

574
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,480
about how to live life.

575
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,720
Should we lie flat or should we grind?

576
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,000
[I've been thinking a lot]

577
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,280
[about how to approach this episode.]

578
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,600
[Honestly, I'm quite conflicted.]

579
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,200
[In the end, I decided to]

580
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,480
[use people around me as examples.]

581
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,880
[Like how Yudong and Daoqi changed]

582
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,160
[after starting their own business.]

583
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,520
Look at Fu Yudong.

584
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,480
Before, he'd do

585
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,640
whatever I told him.

586
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
Now he's a completely different person.

587
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
Let me introduce

588
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,760
a new friend.

589
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,640
His surname is Fu. An academic.

590
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,600
He's never done manual work.

591
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,760
Please go easy on him.

592
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,120
Mr. Zhu, should he help you

593
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,480
lay the flooring this afternoon?

594
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,680
Looking forward to working with you all.

595
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,640
Never done decoration work before?

596
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,240
Just arrived from China?

597
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:31,840
No.

598
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,400
I studied here.

599
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,480
I just graduated.

600
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,920
Haven't found

601
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,720
the right job yet.

602
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,960
So I'm just here for now

603
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,880
to make some money

604
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,520
and get by.

605
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,160
A hundred. A hundred fifty.

606
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,280
How about we make it three-eighty?

607
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,080
We're family, you know.

608
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,000
If you ask me,

609
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,040
not getting into that pharma company

610
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,440
isn't something to regret.

611
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:58,960
Really.

612
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,760
Staying here

613
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,600
and working with us

614
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,760
is pretty good, isn't it?

615
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,520
My wife says she

616
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,240
can't accept it.

617
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,680
And

618
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,560
she wants to come back and try.

619
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,720
Since that's what she wants,

620
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,240
I have to come back with her.

621
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,520
If it doesn't work out, I can always

622
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
go back to my old line of work.

623
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,080
Yudong is a Ph.D.

624
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,280
from a top university, after all.

625
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,440
I think it's a waste of talent for him

626
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,720
to be a decorator abroad.

627
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,440
Look how coincidental this is.

628
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,560
See who's here with me.

629
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,400
Can you see?

630
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,480
Let me get you some water.

631
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,440
No, thanks.

632
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,960
Zhang Ran

633
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,720
has a clear idea

634
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
of what she wants to do.

635
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,600
But I

636
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,480
haven't quite figured mine out yet.

637
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
So it's a temporary thing for now.

638
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,720
See, I knew it.

639
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,880
You have a PhD, after all.

640
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,640
You couldn't have come back

641
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,640
just to do this.

642
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,360
Sir, close the door.

643
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,960
The smell's drifting into the living room.

644
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,920
How can we eat with that stench?

645
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,880
[Sir, please]

646
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,520
[take the trash out.]

647
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,600
[And close the door too.]

648
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:06,960
Fu Yudong.

649
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,520
What are you doing?

650
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,400
Nothing. Just watching a video.

651
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,000
[Yudong,]

652
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:23,880
[meet me at the cafe]

653
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,480
[downstairs from your place in 20 minutes.]

654
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,120
Take your time.

655
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,400
I haven't paid any attention

656
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
to the skincare niche.

657
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
I don't even know

658
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,560
what all those face creams

659
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,360
are for.

660
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,760
You have a Ph.D.

661
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,800
from Royal University of Toronto.

662
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,480
You just need to help me

663
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,679
figure out

664
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,000
all the chemistry stuff,

665
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
the molecules

666
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,840
or whatever.

667
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,280
Yeah, but...

668
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,760
Yudong, let me ask you something.

669
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,480
You came back to work on your career,

670
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:47,679
right?

671
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,239
You've sent out so many resumes.

672
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,520
Did you get a single job offer

673
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,280
you actually wanted,

674
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,239
and that Zhang Ran

675
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:53,960
was happy with?

676
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,000
Did you?

677
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,560
Why are you scratching it?

678
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,960
It itches. There's fluff.

679
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,200
Hold on a bit longer.

680
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,520
Just keep holding. Good job.

681
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,560
Hands in your pockets.

682
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,080
In your pants pockets, man.

683
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,000
In your pockets.

684
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,640
Watch me.

685
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,320
Let me think.

686
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,480
What should I make?

687
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,520
Got it.

688
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,320
Do I look like a Ph.D.?

689
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,200
Li Daoqi taught me.

690
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,600
I think

691
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,360
you were great.

692
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,240
Just charging ahead.

693
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,320
Always pushing forward.

694
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,560
You're an internet celebrity now.

695
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,680
But why have you become

696
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,920
so timid and nervous

697
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,120
all of a sudden?

698
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,760
I can totally do this.

699
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,560
I won't give up.

700
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,000
Just keep pushing forward. It's fine.

701
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:46,800
Come on.

702
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,880
Let's have a taste of success.

703
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,480
I think it's really hard for you.

704
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,400
If it gets too much, just quit.

705
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,040
I'll take care of you.

706
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,240
I have

707
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,800
my own career now. Don't laugh.

708
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,760
I'm serious.

709
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,640
So

710
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,040
for both Yudong and Li Daoqi,

711
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
grinding is the necessary path

712
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,480
to success.

713
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,000
I watched their livestream.

714
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,360
It was a huge success.

715
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,040
They've really been transformed.

716
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,760
[What do you think?]

717
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,240
Then let me tell you

718
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,800
their startup story.

719
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,960
From my personal perspective,

720
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,040
I'll share how I feel.

721
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,440
Watch out.

722
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,200
Be careful. There are steps.

723
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,400
Steps.

724
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,840
Lift your leg.

725
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,200
Yes. Come on.

726
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,760
Move forward.

727
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,160
Alright?

728
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,480
He had too much to drink today.

729
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,480
Sorry.

730
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,000
It's fine.

731
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,360
Don't say that.

732
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,280
I couldn't stop him.

733
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
It's already a big help

734
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,520
that you brought him back.

735
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,960
[So, the feeling of needing to]

736
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,680
[drink water]

737
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,360
[and use the bathroom is a kind of...]

738
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,760
Look who's back.

739
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,120
Honestly, I feel terrible right now.

740
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,160
But I'm still happy

741
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,360
to tell you

742
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,920
I brought back a great bottle of wine.

743
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,480
Daoqi, look what time it is now.

744
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,600
What time is it? Tell me.

745
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,520
It's past 1 AM. Keep your voice down.

746
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,400
Don't wake...

747
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,760
Don't wake the child.

748
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,360
It's past 1 AM, so we need to be quiet.

749
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,000
Can't wake the baby.

750
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,840
Daoqi.

751
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,280
Can you try to

752
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,600
come back earlier next time?

753
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,680
How much did you drink?

754
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,400
We landed

755
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,600
Lady Wan today.

756
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,160
You should have seen the looks

757
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,360
Xing Kai and Michael gave us.

758
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,240
Finally hold our heads high.

759
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,600
So good.

760
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,080
Believe me, Man.

761
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,920
One day,

762
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,120
I will

763
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,880
become the man

764
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
you truly...

765
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,480
I believe you.

766
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,800
Yudong, we used to be like

767
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,560
these two decorations by the door.

768
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,800
Now we're

769
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,480
these two big pincers. Seriously.

770
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,480
Charging through everything.

771
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,280
Raking it in.

772
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,800
Raking it in.

773
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,760
Come here. Let's go.

774
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,520
Aren't you taking me home?

775
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,120
Come home with me. Let's go.

776
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,120
We're going back to the ocean.

777
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,000
Are you crazy?

778
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,200
We're going back to the ocean.

779
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,440
If I strike it rich,

780
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,320
I'll make a film

781
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,560
about our

782
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:42,880
startup story.

783
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,720
[Li Daoqi's entrepreneurial efforts]

784
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,440
[sound romantic.]

785
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,240
[But to support]

786
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
[his venture,]

787
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,600
[our whole family]

788
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,120
[is making sacrifices.]

789
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,360
[I don't agree with you,]

790
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,560
[but I respect your choice.]

791
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,760
Ran.

792
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,400
Time for makeup.

793
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:40,760
Let's go.
