1
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,240
Let me.

2
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,880
Please proceed to

3
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,040
the crematorium.

4
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,360
We need to clean up here.

5
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,840
Thanks.

6
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,880
You're welcome.

7
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,000
My condolences.

8
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,320
Haven't kicked it?

9
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,680
I did.

10
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,840
Your mom hated

11
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,680
me smoking.

12
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,400
Said it would put me

13
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,920
in an early grave.

14
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,680
Got it checked?

15
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,760
Yeah.

16
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,400
Nothing big,

17
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,000
just bronchiectasis.

18
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,760
Won't kill me,

19
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,640
but won't get better either.

20
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,080
Sorry.

21
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,480
I should have known.

22
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,560
It's OK.

23
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,000
It happened

24
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
after you left.

25
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,159
Daoqi

26
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,200
went with me to the hospital.

27
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,280
Any regrets?

28
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,800
Yeah,

29
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,400
at first,

30
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,720
plenty.

31
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,760
It got better

32
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,440
eventually.

33
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,720
How long?

34
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,720
Couple of years.

35
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,360
How about now?

36
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,480
It still

37
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,360
hits me

38
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,560
sometimes.

39
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,040
I keep wondering

40
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
if I did

41
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,000
the right thing.

42
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,280
I know you resent me for it.

43
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,159
I resent myself too.

44
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,080
I live...

45
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,520
with regret every day.

46
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,680
If I

47
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,800
had stayed...

48
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,960
then...

49
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Don't torture yourself.

50
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,440
But...

51
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,920
Can't change the past.

52
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,600
We gotta

53
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,720
keep moving forward.

54
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,280
C'mon,

55
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,400
let's go,

56
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,560
dinner time.

57
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,320
Yudong,

58
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,040
heard you were in.

59
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,160
Came to see how you're doing.

60
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,640
Clearing out Daoqi's office?

61
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,320
Got your stuff packed

62
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,840
for Canada?

63
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,960
Rest assured, Mr. Xing.

64
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm not going anywhere.

65
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,919
Daoqi was my brother.

66
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,440
This is on us both.

67
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,160
I won't leave

68
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,200
until we make it right.

69
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,840
I knew it.

70
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,480
I never doubted you for a second.

71
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,320
What's our next move?

72
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,040
Our PR

73
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,800
came up with something.

74
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
Let me

75
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,960
run it by you.

76
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,320
Daoqi's death

77
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,200
is a terrible loss.

78
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,960
Taken in his prime!

79
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,520
While it's a

80
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,920
massive loss for us.

81
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,760
But, consider this,

82
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,320
it might actually

83
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,240
work in

84
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,200
our favor.

85
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,240
We've already got

86
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,400
serious clout.

87
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,640
We're well-stocked.

88
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,160
No need

89
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,480
to panic.

90
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,040
Lady Wan's scandal?

91
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,240
Please. Influencers're

92
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
everywhere these days.

93
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,840
The market moves fast.

94
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,520
Lady Wan's

95
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,240
gone,

96
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,360
but there'll be

97
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,440
new faces.

98
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,960
With our resources,

99
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,960
we can attract

100
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,080
the best talent out there!

101
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,360
Plus,

102
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,720
what happened to him

103
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,840
is

104
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,280
his personal issue.

105
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,200
If you

106
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,760
and your team

107
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,880
cut ties...

108
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,040
We could

109
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,160
rewrite this narrative

110
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,880
completely.

111
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,120
Picture this,

112
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,720
a man honors

113
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,280
his fallen friend

114
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,040
by

115
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,280
leading his team

116
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,000
forward,

117
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,360
fulfilling his

118
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,640
unfinished dreams.

119
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,160
It's powerful stuff.

120
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,160
It'd do wonders

121
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,840
for our image

122
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,360
and win

123
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
public sympathy!

124
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,640
Sure, we're at

125
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,800
rock bottom now.

126
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,320
But believe me,

127
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,520
our future's

128
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,960
bright!

129
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,320
Dr. Fu...

130
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,240
actually, no,

131
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,200
if you and I

132
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,240
join forces,

133
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,240
push through

134
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,680
this together,

135
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,720
we'll overcome anything!

136
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,720
We'll honor

137
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,000
his final wish,

138
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,720
make

139
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,520
"Dr. Fu"

140
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,440
a shining example of

141
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
Chinese excellence!

142
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,040
Lies will never become truth.

143
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,160
I'm releasing

144
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,560
a statement

145
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,520
with the full story.

146
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,960
And

147
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,480
consider this a farewell.

148
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,440
Let's go home.

149
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,560
Mr. Xing,

150
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:10,920
we're

151
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,040
going live.

152
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,640
Greetings,

153
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,920
esteemed customers of

154
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,240
Dr. Fu.

155
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,960
It is with

156
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,120
great sadness that

157
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,720
I address you today.

158
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,600
Lately,

159
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,800
there's been

160
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,720
negative coverage regarding

161
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,280
our founder,

162
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Mr. Li Daoqi,

163
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,440
and Lady Wan.

164
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,720
After

165
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,200
this statement,

166
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,240
I expect

167
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,000
an end

168
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,080
to these

169
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,000
baseless attacks!

170
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,480
Mr. Li bore

171
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,320
tremendous pressure

172
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,800
building this dream,

173
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,320
all to

174
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,040
nurture

175
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,960
this up-and-coming brand.

176
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,040
For "Dr. Fu" to survive

177
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,320
and thrive...

178
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,720
Zhang Ran.

179
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,120
Yeah?

180
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,160
His nerve is

181
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,520
almost admirable,

182
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,480
hosting a

183
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,040
press conference

184
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,960
while universally despised.

185
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,600
Were you listening

186
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,840
to me at all?

187
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,000
That slap

188
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,600
was

189
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,000
golden!

190
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,440
The teaser's

191
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,480
a hit!

192
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,920
They're rewriting

193
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,440
the whole script.

194
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,960
The season will

195
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,240
center on you now.

196
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,640
I've even

197
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,360
branded you:

198
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,640
"The Slap Queen."

199
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,840
You've lost your mind.

200
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,360
I was crystal clear,

201
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,640
I'm terminating.

202
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,000
I won't do the show.

203
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,040
I'm out!

204
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,680
You're viral.

205
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,840
Seize the momentum!

206
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,000
One last time,

207
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,920
I'm done with the show.

208
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,720
Done with the lies.

209
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,840
I'm ending the contract.

210
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,000
Got it?

211
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,160
You can't.

212
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,160
Three-year contract.

213
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,560
Break it and

214
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,520
you'll pay.

215
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,000
Then I'll pay.

216
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,680
Whatever the penalty.

217
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,920
Dream on!

218
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,839
I'll expose everything

219
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,440
about your husband's scam.

220
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,680
You'll both burn.

221
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,119
Listen up,

222
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,400
I'm not afraid of that.

223
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,480
I'll take

224
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,160
what I deserve.

225
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,440
But you need to see a psychologist.

226
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,880
As your ex-colleague,

227
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,000
I sincerely wish you an early recovery.

228
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,760
This is...

229
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,240
Sorry, sorry...

230
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,200
Wrong one...

231
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,200
Open...

232
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,920
New design?

233
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,760
Get well soon...

234
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,800
who to get well?

235
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,440
Daoqi,

236
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,560
you did this?

237
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,760
Don't leave...

238
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,760
Come back!

239
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,080
What did

240
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,280
I do wrong?

241
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,360
Tell me, Daoqi...

242
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,040
Need a ride?

243
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,200
Five yuan.

244
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,000
Why are you here?

245
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Your chariot awaits!

246
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,320
Playing fancy driver?

247
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,920
Let's take a spin.

248
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,200
Hands off that one,

249
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,560
my boss' property.

250
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,440
Sweet ride though.

251
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,080
Out of our league now.

252
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,240
It's not.

253
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,120
All show,

254
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,240
like a display.

255
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,600
Our scooter's better.

256
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,160
Let's roll.

257
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,760
Let's roll.

258
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:31,920
Ready?

259
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,520
Hit it!

260
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,240

Yep!

268
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,320
Realtor found

269
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
some places,

270
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,880
three or four options.

271
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,480
Near the sugar factory

272
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,240
or Lucheng University.

273
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,360
What's your pick?

274
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,240
Did you mention

275
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,520
our tight budget?

276
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,720
I did.

277
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,560
All small places, affordable.

278
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,280
Let's stick to

279
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,720
the factory area.

280
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,880
Dad mentioned

281
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,440
taking Aunt Wang to the old house.

282
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,360
You just miss

283
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,080
my mom's cooking.

284
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,240
Her cooking's the best!

285
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,320

287
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Nah, I'm the Chinese deity

289
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,560

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,080
a teen movie, babe.

292
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,280
Teen movie?

293
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,440
We're pushing forty!

294
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,760
Stop being so realistic!

295
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,160
Let me dream.

296
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,480

Let's go,

299
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,000

300
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,920

[if I just worked hard enough,]

[dignity or success?]

[But]

313
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,360
[I drifted off course]

[somehow.]

[but lost my integrity.]

[Became a joke.]

[Looking back,]

322
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,480
[I really messed up.]

323
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,160
[I messed up even worse.]

324
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,280

[Got lost in it all,]

[became a phony.]

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,280
[Seemed busy]

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,400
[but accomplished nothing.]

[All that drama]

331
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,560
[nearly tore us apart.]

[No big deal.]

It's fine!

363
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,520

374
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,240

I haven't eaten all day.

376
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,200
Why?

377
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,000
Just to mooch this meal off me?

378
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,760
Yeah.

379
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,040
Actually, I...

380
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,240
I brought wine.

381
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,920

When I was a kid,

399
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,560
I'd eat there once a week,

400
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,880
though I had to do it

401
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,800
behind my mom's back.

402
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,040
She even suspected

403
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,440
the broth had

404
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,640
poppy in it.

405
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,400
She even reported the owner.

406
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,360
Hilarious, right?

407
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,400
Any good malatang places here?

408
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,080
I've tried a bunch here.

409
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,480
They're just awful.

410
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,880
No matter how they make it.

411
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,360
I've come to a conclusion.

412
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,600
Which is?

413
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,360
Canadian water's no good.

414
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,320
Water?

415
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,360
Then I'll treat you to a play.

416
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,240
Wanted to invite you back in Canada,

417
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,080
but never got to.

418
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,000
The shop's busy on Sundays.

419
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,080
I know.

420
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,160
So it's settled.

421
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,160
If it's busy, I won't make it.

422
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,720
I'll wait for you.

423
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,440
Tired these days?

424
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,080
Yeah.

425
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,320
Too tired to even talk.

426
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,680
But I feel so accomplished

427
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
every day.

428
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,520
How about you?

429
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,280
You switched to days at the zoo,

430
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,880
and do designated driving at night.

431
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,200
Must be more tired, huh?

432
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,560
I'm alright.

433
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,800
Not as tired as you.

434
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,200
But pretty happy.

435
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,280
Back in Canada, I just swiped the card

436
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,920
and never thought about the money.

437
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,560
Now 600 yuan is

438
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,680
right there in my hand,

439
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,640
so I gotta spend it smart.

440
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,520
You've truly become more mature.

441
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
Lately at our zoo,

442
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,960
a monkey got sick.

443
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,520
Looks really pitiful.

444
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,080
But there's not much I can do.

445
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,840
I think animals are just like humans.

446
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,560
I mean,

447
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,560
if you catch a cold or fever,

448
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,840
medicine just eases the symptoms.

449
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,400
Time heals it in the end.

450
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,240
Yeah.

451
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,640
I guess people of our generation

452
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,800
all rely on self-healing.

453
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,720
Mom.

454
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,080
Can you get out of the car by yourself?

455
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,600
Been waiting long?

456
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,040
No, no, just got here.

457
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,880
Which way?

458
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:07,880
This way.

459
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,560
I'll show you, come on.

460
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,160
You good?

461
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,360
Look, paintings.

462
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,800
Fran painted them.

463
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,400
Who?

464
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,320
You know,

465
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,600
my friend from Canada.

466
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,880
He came back a while ago.

467
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
That's nice.

468
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,400
Too hot?

469
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,640
No, no, it's fine.

470
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,520
Try my malatang.

471
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,960
Smells great.

472
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,720
Yeah?

473
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,760
Your malatang is

474
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,960
the non-spicy kind?

475
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,760
Well...

476
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,760
Chili's here.

477
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,880
Mom doesn't eat spicy food, right?

478
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,280
Help yourself to it.

479
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,200
Just the smell of this chili

480
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,080
tells me it's super spicy.

481
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,360
Not bad.

482
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,160
Good, right?

483
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,600
Delicious.

484
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,720
The broth is so rich.

485
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,640
Mom,

486
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,400
I put that lucky cat you gave me

487
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,480
over there.

488
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,880
Does it work?

489
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,200
Totally.

490
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,640
Normally at this time,

491
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,680
the line is at least half an hour long.

492
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,800
I closed the shop today

493
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,640
just for you two.

494
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,280
So we've got the place to ourselves.

495
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,000
Oh, I...

496
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,440
I thought business was slow.

497
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,200
No, no.

498
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:31,920
It's fine.

499
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,040
It's usually packed.

500
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,600
Dad, why are you

501
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,080
scanning the code?

502
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,200
Leave him be.

503
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,120
Then transfer me a bigger amount.

504
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,360
Call it my investment in you.

505
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,320
I'm taking a stake.

506
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,240
Okay.

507
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,240
This is my first time eating a meal

508
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,440
my daughter cooked herself.

509
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,080
I love it.

510
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,440
You like this?

511
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,480
Give me another scoop of chili.

512
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,480
All this time away,

513
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,520
never saw you eat spicy.

514
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,160
Now you want extra chili?

515
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,960
So what?

516
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,160
My girl made it.

517
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,320
Nian.

518
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:17,960
Like I told you,

519
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,160
I have a business trip

520
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,000
for a week.

521
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,440
During this week,

522
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,080
you'll stay with Grandma.

523
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,040
Be good, okay?

524
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,160
You can have junk food

525
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,640
and candy,

526
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,760
but not too much.

527
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,000
In a couple days,

528
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,400
Grandma will bring you back.

529
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,320
You need to clean

530
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,360
the hamster cage yourself,

531
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,800
feed them,

532
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,800
and water Mom's plants.

533
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,600
Can you do that?

534
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,800
[I Found it!]

535
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,320
Found what?

536
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,280
I found that missing puzzle piece

537
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,640
in the flowerpot.

538
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,640
Dad must have

539
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,120
hidden it there.

540
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,040
Dad is so mischievous.

541
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,280
Lu Xinying!

542
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,400
Get back here, now.

543
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,360
Wait, what's wrong

544
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,400
with your cousin?

545
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,080
It hasn't even

546
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,199
started yet.

547
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,440
It's fine, let her stay up front.

548
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,239
Wait, wait.

549
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:25,920
Don't you think

550
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,560
their boat,

551
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,560
its bow is already

552
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,719
ahead of ours?

553
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,639
Just fall back a bit.

554
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,719
It's just drifting over.

555
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,440
Li Daoqi, it's all

556
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,400
'cause your hand

557
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:32,920
got hurt

558
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,960
that I let you

559
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,719
use the pedal boat.

560
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,280
Can you do it or not?

561
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,440
If not, jump in and swim.

562
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,560
Your cousin's already off.

563
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,880
Your family cheats,

564
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,719
I'm telling you!

565
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,960
It hasn't even started.

566
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,080
It's a cheating gene!

567
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,320
Go!

568
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,520
Li Daoqi!

569
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,280
Why am I the only one rowing?

570
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,120
Li Daoqi, start rowing!

571
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,880
Come on, let's go!

572
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,680
Bye!

573
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,760
We passed them!

574
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,600
We're ahead!

575
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,720
Ge Kaiyang, you're not moving!

576
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,360
Duck.

577
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,200
We're too slow.

578
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,360
Now we can't even see them anymore.

579
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,720
We're basically lost,

580
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,440
you know?

581
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,360
I don't even know

582
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,320
which way to go now.

583
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,360
Fu Yudong, didn't I tell you

584
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,320
not to bring the fishing rod?

585
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,080
This is a race!

586
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,600
You don't respect it at all.

587
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,080
I was rowing just now.

588
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:45,920
But you are not now.

589
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,920
Or how could we possibly

590
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,760
be in first?

591
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,800
Besides,

592
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,520
why does everything have to be a race?

593
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,600
There's not even a finish line.

594
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,640
Why do we keep drifting that way?

595
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,640
Buddy, wrong direction.

596
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,360
That way.

597
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,000
I know.

598
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,680
Li Daoqi said look for the crooked tree.

599
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,680
That's the finish.

600
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,240
But every tree along the way

601
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,920
is crooked.

602
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,440
There was

603
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,120
a little fork earlier,

604
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,240
we took the wrong turn.

605
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,960
We should've gone left.

606
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,960
Now look at us.

607
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,480
We're falling behind.

608
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,160
I'm rowing up front,

609
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,440
and you're just fishing?

610
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,680
You can do it.

611
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,000
You're the best, honey.

612
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,880
I've got something.

613
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,040
- What?
- Something like a branch.

614
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,120
Why is...

615
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,080
Where did it go?

616
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,000
Why is our boat going in circles?

617
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,240
They're catching up!

618
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,160
Hurry, hurry!

619
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,280
Where are they?

620
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,320
Behind us.

621
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,080
Go, go!

622
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,640
Go!

623
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,280
Yeah, that's right.

624
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,680
Almost struggled my ass off.

625
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,480
Let's go. Straight ahead.

626
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,560
Why is it suddenly foggy?

627
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,440
Yeah, weird time for fog.

628
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,240
It was fine just now.

629
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,560
Which way do we go now?

630
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,560
My fault.

631
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,680
I thought

632
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,440
I found a shortcut.

633
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,080
Didn't expect to get lost.

634
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,960
There's

635
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,480
no signal at all here.

636
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,320
Maybe the satellites

637
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,880
don't cover us here.

638
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:25,840
When we were

639
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,560
driving here,

640
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,440
the GPS was already

641
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,320
giving wrong directions.

642
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,520
Didn't you say

643
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,640
you'd been here before?

644
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,240
I've been nearby,

645
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,360
not exactly here.

646
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,920
Well...

647
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,360
Honey.

648
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,840
Sorry about that.

649
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,440
My hand's no good for

650
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,440
steering.

651
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
The whole direction thing,

652
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,640
starting today,

653
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,480
I'm handing it over to you.

654
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,800
I'll just pedal in the back.

655
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,120
Where you say, I go.

656
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,320
Okay?

657
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,160
Okay.

658
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,040
So now, should we

659
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,200
rest here,

660
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,640
wait for the fog to clear?

661
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,480
Or what?

662
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,480
Your call.

663
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,560
Whatever you say,

664
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,520
we do.

665
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,480
My call?

666
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,880
Then we'll go

667
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,240
this way!

668
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,000
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

669
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,720
Come on.

670
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,800
Don't hit that.

671
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,920
Let me reverse!

672
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,520
Reverse! Reverse!

673
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,560
Come on!

674
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,640
Ge Kaiyang,

675
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,280
remember that time

676
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,880
we went to see the sunrise?

677
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,160
I said life,

678
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,640
when you look back,

679
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,360
is really just

680
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,520
about a few moments.

681
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,400
Of course I remember.

682
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,200
Now I think

683
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,360
it makes more sense than ever.

684
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,920
How old are you,

685
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,680
getting all philosophical?

686
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,200
Just feeling sentimental.

687
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,320
Look at this river,

688
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,080
it flows nonstop.

689
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,800
We've passed

690
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,800
so many forks,

691
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,160
seen so many scenes,

692
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,640
run into heavy fog,

693
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,160
even hit rocks.

694
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,320
But that's what makes up

695
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,320
our journey,

696
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,400
right?

697
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,360
True.

698
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,400
Lu Xinying.

699
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,200
I've been waiting forever.

700
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,640
I literally finished a book.

701
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,320
Way too slow.

702
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,360
It's not that bad.

703
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,320
Didn't you say

704
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,240
a crooked tree

705
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,160
was the finish line?

706
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,880
Where is it?

707
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,040
See?

708
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,360
Told you so.

709
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,280
Looks like we all agree.

710
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,600
I think Zhang Ran

711
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,680
made it clear.

712
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,800
You know,

713
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,200
whichever crooked tree

714
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,920
you think is

715
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,840
your finish line,

716
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,200
that's it.

717
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,760
For me,

718
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,240
it's the one

719
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,440
we saw when we

720
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,240
first set off.

721
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,600
I finished long ago.

722
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,480
Why not just say the tree

723
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,480
outside your door

724
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,680
is the finish line?

725
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,960
By the way, Zhang Ran,

726
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,320
I've been wanting to tell you something.

727
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,080
Yeah?

728
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,320
Ha!

729
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
I'll get you!

730
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
Hey,

731
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,200
I'm catching up!

732
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,040
Pass your own crooked tree.

733
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,200
Li Daoqi is insane.

734
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,800
Yeah! First place!

735
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,840
No way, I can't stay behind.

736
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,840
Gonna hit the tree.

737
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,280
Pass the crooked tree!

738
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,320
Go! Go!

739
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,120
First place!

740
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,760
Wrong way!
