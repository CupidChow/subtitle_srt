1
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,000
Aiying.

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,080
I've got some news. Want it?

3
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,800
Stop fooling around. Out with it.

4
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,280
Yudong's going back to Canada.

5
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,720
Nonsense.

6
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,960
It's true.

7
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,840
Right here yesterday,

8
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,000
we had a heart-to-heart talk.

9
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,079
He told me himself.

10
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,680
He's going back to Canada.

11
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,400
But Zhang Ran's staying.

12
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,960
They have their own

13
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,280
reasons.

14
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,440
What reasons?

15
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,480
Separated today,

16
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,640
they'll be divorced tomorrow.

17
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,000
Besides,

18
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,880
all this "Rice Guy" nonsense

19
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,560
going public in her livestreams...

20
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,840
The whole world knows!

21
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,400
It's only because Yudong

22
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,920
is kind and lets her have her way.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,440
Even I can't stand it.

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,040
You know how divorce goes.

25
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,360
Once you break that seal,

26
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,000
there's no turning back.

27
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,600
I'm not wasting breath on this.

28
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,079
I must...

29
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
Calm down.

30
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,760
I don't think Yudong will leave.

31
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Why wouldn't he?

32
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,680
He told me

33
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,320
he's going back to work,

34
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,840
for Ran.

35
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,280
If Ran's career doesn't work out here,

36
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,320
he'll be her safety net.

37
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,480
The family won't fall apart.

38
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,960
You actually believe that?

39
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,440
Ran.

40
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,680
I'm coming in.

41
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,320
Yeah.

42
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,800
Hmm?

43
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:22,920
I'm good.

44
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,800
About time for work.

45
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,400
Leaving soon.

46
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,560
Your mom cut you

47
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,760
this melon specially.

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,400
Just get to the point.

49
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,960
Yudong's going back to Canada?

50
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,840
He's going. I'm not.

51
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,000
You two

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,960
are married now.

53
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,920
You make your own decisions.

54
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,200
Your mom and I won't interfere.

55
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,000
This is the first time

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,760
you've brought Yudong back for me

57
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
and your mom to meet.

58
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,080
We really like him.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,760
Not because he's handsome

60
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
or tall.

61
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,800
He's down-to-earth and responsible.

62
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,800
Most importantly, he treats you well.

63
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
As long as you two

64
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,960
live happily together,

65
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,360
whether it's here

66
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,760
or somewhere else,

67
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,040
your mom and I will be at ease.

68
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
So you're now

69
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,240
Mom's spy on the side?

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
We're family,

71
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,200
no need for this spy stuff.

72
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,520
Let me analyze this for you:

73
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,400
Yudong is

74
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
a good man.

75
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,840
He's different from most young people

76
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,520
these days.

77
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,040
He's a bit like me.

78
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,600
Don't make me laugh.

79
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,440
He knows how to be a supportive husband.

80
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,360
When Ran said she wanted to come back,

81
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,640
he came right along.

82
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,480
Not long ago, in Ran's livestream,

83
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,960
that "Rice Guy" thing,

84
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,240
that was Ran's fault.

85
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,560
What did Yudong say?

86
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,520
Not a single word of complaint.

87
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,040
But he should stand his ground, right?

88
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,960
He needs to draw a clear line

89
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,240
for Ran as a warning.

90
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,680
So he says he's going back to Canada

91
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,320
just to give our daughter

92
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,720
a graceful exit.

93
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,920
If Ran just admits she was wrong,

94
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,880
softens up a bit, acts sweet,

95
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,960
this whole thing will blow over.

96
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,080
Ran.

97
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,160
You're not in the right this time.

98
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,040
That livestream,

99
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,280
that "Rice Guy" story...

100
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,640
You embarrassed Yudong.

101
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,040
Did he say anything?

102
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,640
Not a single word of complaint.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,560
Sweetie, you really were in the wrong.

104
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,720
Ran

105
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,159
is as stubborn as a mule!

106
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,680
Apologize?

107
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,800
Say something soft?

108
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,200
Not a chance!

109
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,920
He wants to go back to Canada,

110
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,360
and I haven't complained either.

111
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm not stopping him.

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I respect his decision.

113
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,760
She gets that stubbornness from you.

114
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,040
What do you mean?

115
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,400
Keep it down.

116
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,640
I was just watching a video.

117
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,840
It said we shouldn't meddle too much.

118
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,440
Too much pressure

119
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,160
only makes her rebel.

120
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,680
If you just go along with her,

121
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,040
maybe she'll come around

122
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,640
on her own.

123
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,480
You need to understand

124
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,880
that family

125
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,360
isn't about who's right.

126
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,440
It's about love.

127
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,160
You only see the surface.

128
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,360
You don't know Yudong's feelings.

129
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,040
What does a man want?

130
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,240
They just want dignity.

131
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,640
Him bringing up

132
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,040
going back to Canada

133
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,960
proves he cares about you.

134
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,360
About that livestream,

135
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,520
just say something nice to him.

136
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,400
Give him a way out.

137
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,680
I guarantee,

138
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,120
he'll do whatever you say.

139
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,520
Alright, I need to change.

140
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,680
Time for work.

141
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,240
Listen to your old man.

142
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,000
Give it a try.

143
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,720
Now you're not gonna give it to me?

144
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,560
I'll eat it.

145
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:06,960
Never mind.

146
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,800
I need to change.

147
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,800
On regular dates,

148
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,680
guys usually like girls in dresses.

149
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,240
Because dresses

150
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,760
make girls

151
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,159
look elegant

152
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,159
and gentle.

153
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,120
But in special cases,

154
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,840
like if your crush

155
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,640
is a toy boy,

156
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
then girls,

157
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,680
it's best to...

158
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,440
Anran.

159
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,920
Memorizing lines?

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,240
You're working too hard.

161
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,840
Take a break.

162
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,400
Why so serious?

163
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,200
Other top streamers are just

164
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,320
messing around.

165
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,800
I need to

166
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,000
keep updating myself,

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,600
right?

168
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
So dedicated.

169
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,320
What's a toy boy?

170
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,360
You don't know that?

171
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,400
It means

172
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,360
a guy younger than you.

173
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,440
There's the "puppy" type

174
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,040
and the "wolf" type.

175
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,880
First time I've heard that.

176
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,560
Learned something new.

177
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,480
Anran.

178
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,320
Today's lucky color fruit.

179
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,440
How did you know

180
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,280
my lucky color today is green?

181
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,880
Been working with you so long,

182
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,039
of course I have your lucky color

183
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,720
memorized by heart.

184
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,920
Well, Anran.

185
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,640
There's something I wanna

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,800
talk to you about.

187
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,040
What is it? Go ahead.

188
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,520
It's not a big deal, really.

189
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,320
It's just that

190
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,720
recently, the company

191
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,200
got me some ads.

192
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,280
And some of them

193
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,680
target middle-class clients.

194
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,560
So the planning team said

195
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,240
my future style shouldn't be

196
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,960
so low-key.

197
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,520
I see.

198
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,360
You're gonna take

199
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,720
the handsome guy route.

200
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,120
Gonna be an idol.

201
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,600
Nah.

202
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,160
I'm just average.

203
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,360
I wouldn't dare dream that big.

204
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,040
Why not?

205
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,800
You're pretty good-looking.

206
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,440
You can be a handsome streamer.

207
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,560
Besides,

208
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,840
I'm happy you're moving up.

209
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
What do you think?

210
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,560
Well, the planning team mentioned it,

211
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,440
but I told them

212
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,560
I'm your assistant

213
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,640
streamer.

214
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,320
Whatever look

215
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,160
you need me to do, I'll nail it.

216
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,720
Right?

217
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,440
Yeah?

218
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,680
The other side.

219
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,080
What did the clients say?

220
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,120
The clients said

221
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,160
my current style

222
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,600
is a bit too much.

223
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,360
It's just

224
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,520
not up to their

225
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,680
level.

226
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,840
I'm happy for you.

227
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,080
People should always aim higher.

228
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's push each other.

229
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,640
That's good. Keep it up.

230
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,280
Thanks, Anran.

231
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Xiaohe, help me find someone

232
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,640
who's good at

233
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,520
livening up the live stream vibe,

234
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,960
a funny assistant streamer.

235
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,880
Anran, I'm just

236
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,960
doing a couple of ads.

237
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,840
I can still be your assistant.

238
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,440
Don't worry.

239
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm not replacing you.

240
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,800
You'll still be in my live stream.

241
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,880
I just need

242
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,040
someone to be funny

243
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,520
to hype up the vibe.

244
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,160
Okay?

245
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,280
Okay.

246
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,880
I'm on call anytime.

247
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,080
Did you hear what I said just now?

248
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,240
I was tallying invoices.

249
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Please say it again?

250
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,040
What's wrong with you?

251
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,080
Why do you always

252
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,920
live in your own bubble?

253
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,440
Xiaojian and I were talking

254
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,800
about finding a new

255
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,840
funny streamer

256
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,160
who can liven things up

257
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,680
to be my assistant

258
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,160
streamer.

259
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,000
Who's good for this?

260
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,200
Miss Liao?

261
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,560
She's been doing well lately.

262
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Totally letting loose.

263
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,640
Miss Liao?

264
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,120
The pole dancer?

265
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,760
Way too low-end.

266
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,640
She's not fit for

267
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,800
Anran's live stream at all.

268
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,160
It's not that

269
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,960
she's low-end.

270
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,600
Miss Liao just talks too much.

271
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,240
Find someone else.

272
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,240
Wait, what kind of logic is that?

273
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,760
How did you think of Miss Liao?

274
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,680
Think again.

275
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,120
Zhang Ran.

276
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,200
Desperate Personal Shopper.

277
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,680
Her stats are pretty good lately.

278
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,640
Just holds back a bit.

279
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,200
Zhang Ran? Holds back?

280
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,360
I think Zhang Ran is quite cute.

281
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,240
Zhang Ran's not bad.

282
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,480
She's pretty funny.

283
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,480
Zhang Ran works, right?

284
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,400
Okay.

285
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,640
Go tell Zhang Ran

286
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,400
that my livestream room

287
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,640
needs more fun lately.

288
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,760
And I really like her.

289
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,800
See if she gets what I mean.

290
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,200
Okay.

291
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,760
Anran, have some fruit.

292
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,120
Call me if you need anything.

293
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,160
I'm on standby.

294
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,120
You're feeling the pressure, huh?

295
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,080
Don't be afraid.

296
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,440
I'll still have your back.

297
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,640
You must know

298
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,800
this brand, Ran.

299
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,120
It's about one-stop shopping.

300
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,000
Here's Anran's live stream plan:

301
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,320
you model the fake clothes'

302
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,880
fabric and fit,

303
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,240
wear them

304
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,920
with messy styling.

305
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,240
Based on that,

306
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,960
Anran will step in,

307
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,000
re-style with real ones,

308
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,120
and show

309
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,360
the final vibe.

310
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,480
The point is to show

311
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,000
real vs fake differences

312
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,600
and her styling tricks.

313
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,240
Got it.

314
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,000
You wanna use Ran as a contrast?

315
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,080
It's okay, no problem.

316
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,920
It's easy.

317
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,160
As long as I can help Anran

318
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,600
sell the clothes well.

319
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,280
It's all good.

320
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,920
You okay with that?

321
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,640
Yeah, let's go.

322
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,520
Okay.

323
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,960
So many clothes.

324
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,000
From the company,

325
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,360
they want me to wear them

326
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,880
on Lin Anran's live stream.

327
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,040
Thanks.

328
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,320
Give it to me.

329
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,200
You said

330
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,560
you'd buy me a

331
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,760
higher pillow.

332
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,880
Are you

333
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,920
still gonna buy it?

334
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,400
Yeah, I'll buy it online

335
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,720
and have it shipped home.

336
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Mr. Zhu said the busy season is coming.

337
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,840
If I go back now,

338
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,800
the past year won't be for nothing.

339
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,760
Earn what I can.

340
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,400
You won't change your phone number, huh?

341
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,240
Huh?

342
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,560
Your phone number. Changing it?

343
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,640
Why would I change it?

344
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,240
Who knows.

345
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,200
Wanna change yours?

346
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,960
I could, I guess.

347
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,600
It's okay, we still have email.

348
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,000
- I bought the ticket.
- Did you buy the ticket?

349
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,120
Okay.

350
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,680
Okay.

351
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,560
Let me help you.

352
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,040
Leave it.

353
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,800
I'll do it.

354
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,760
Just leave it there.

355
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,080
Time for bed.

356
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,280
Want some water?

357
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,800
No.

358
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,640
Give me your phone.

359
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,240
I'll charge it for you.

360
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,920
I'll do it myself.

361
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,200
You got something to say?

362
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,319
When did you get scraped here?

363
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,560
It's been a week. It's fine now.

364
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,280
Let me dab some iodine on it.

365
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,839
No need.

366
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,400
It's already healed.

367
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:16,880
Just a sec.

368
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,640
I'm okay, Fu Yudong!

369
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,240
I said no, it's fine now.

370
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,600
It's better to be safe.

371
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:36,920
Be good.

372
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,640
I won't.

373
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,240
After I leave,

374
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,200
you need to take care of yourself.

375
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,120
You're not a kid anymore.

376
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,480
Call me anytime if you need anything.

377
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,320
I don't want it.

378
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,480
I'm not dying, you know.

379
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,240
I scraped it a week ago, why ask now?

380
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,920
It's already healed, and here you are

381
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,680
scrambling to put iodine on it.

382
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,920
You didn't tell me.

383
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,320
Weren't you paying attention?

384
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,680
Can't you see?

385
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,680
You always wear long sleeves.

386
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,480
Alright, alright.

387
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,600
It's my fault.

388
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,000
Just be more careful.

389
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,880
What about the other side?

390
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,440
No. I'm fine.

391
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,680
Let me check.

392
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,360
Really, nothing.

393
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,040
Are you sure?

394
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,560
A mosquito bite.

395
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,040
Are you sleeping or not?

396
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,360
Anywhere else?

397
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,440
Here, inside.

398
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,200
Where?

399
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,640
My heart.

400
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,760
I'll spray some medicine on it.

401
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,240
Come here.

402
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,280
Quit messing with me.

403
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,000
Okay.

404
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,400
[Breaking news:]

405
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,880
[currently on Lucheng Avenue,]

406
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,200
[from Shannan to Haibin District,]

407
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,640
[a major traffic accident]

408
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,880
[is causing a jam.]

409

[Lucheng Radio]

410
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,680
[reminds all drivers]

411
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,800
[to please detour.]

412
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,400
Anran.

413
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,040
I left early today,

414
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,640
but there's an accident ahead.

415
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,320
I might be stuck

416
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,640
for a little while here.

417
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,800
I won't miss the

418
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,480
official start time,

419
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,360
but I might be

420
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,840
a bit late for rehearsal.

421
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,440
I'll get there as soon as I can.

422
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,080
Sorry, really sorry.

423
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,280
Okay.

424
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,120
Sir, is this the only road

425
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,760
to get there?

426
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,040
Yeah, only this road.

427
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,240
No way around here? Crap.

428
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,560
Here.

429
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,280
Okay.

430
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,600
Director Zhou, yours.

431
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,960
Dr. Fu, yours.

432
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,680
This pair is mine.

433
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,200
Ran's not coming back.

434
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,960
I grabbed an extra.

435
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,800
The serving pair then.

436
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,360
What an excuse.

437
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,200
Serving chopsticks, huh?

438
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,320
It's cleaner.

439
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,320
Other countries all do separate servings.

440
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,960
But that's abroad.

441
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,440
We're in China now.

442
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,320
And we're at home.

443
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,200
Yudong's going back

444
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,600
to Canada soon.

445
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,720
Why bring that up?

446
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,920
You want them to split up?

447
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,480
No, I...I was talking about chopsticks,

448
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,280
and you...

449
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,960
I'll take this call.

450
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,920
What were you talking about?

451
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,720
Didn't you say

452
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,880
you'd persuade him?

453
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,000
Alright, keep it down.

454
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:13,920
Okay,

455
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,600
I'm heading over now.

456
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,040
Mom, Dad,

457
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,480
something came up.

458
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,280
I gotta go.

459
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,520
Don't wait for me.

460
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,320
What's so urgent?

461
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,880
At least eat first.

462
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,880
Fu Yong...

463
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,280
My dad, had a heart attack.

464
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,560
He's at the city hospital.

465
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
I need to go see him.

466
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,000
Okay, then...

467
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,120
Don't just stand here.

468
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,240
Quick, let's change and go.

469
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,600
Okay.

470
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,480
No, no, don't.

471
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:45,880
We'll go with you.

472
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,760
You don't have to.

473
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,560
It might not be serious.

474
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,760
Heart attacks are

475
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,120
common emergencies.

476
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,840
It might not be a big deal.

477
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,840
Well...

478
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,560
Hey, your shoes.

479
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,640
Yeah, shoes.

480
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,520
Change your shoes.

481
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:00,960
Okay.

482
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,480
Let me.

483
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,600
Just stay calm.

484
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,200
Got it.

485
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,360
Call us if anything happens,

486
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,360
and we'll come.

487
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,840
It's fine.

488
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,000
Got your phone?

489
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,560
Yes.

490
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,800
You go ahead.

491
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,840
I'm going now.

492
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,400
Let us

493
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:15,640
know

494
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,840
how things are, okay?

495
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,800
Sure.

496
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,240
We haven't even met his dad yet.

497
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,000
Hope it's not too late.

498
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,560
Hey! Don't jinx it!

499
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,240
Heart attacks are common now?

500
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,680
Don't leave preventive meds

501
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,720
in the drawer.

502
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,320
Keep some with you.

503
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:52,960
Okay.

504
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,160
Hello, Mom. What's up?

505
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
[Where are you?]

506
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,200
[Has Yudong]

507
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,120
[called you?]

508
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,880
[His dad's rushed to the hospital. Heart attack.]

509
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,160
What?

510
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,080
What's going on?

511
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,040
How is he now?

512
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,280
I don't know. Nobody told me.

513
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,960
[Didn't Yudong tell you?]

514
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,600
[What was he thinking? Listen,]

515
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,680
[drop whatever]

516
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,440
[you're doing]

517
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,240
[and head to the hospital now.]

518
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,480
[If you need anything,]

519
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,760
[tell me and your dad.]

520
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,080
[We've got savings.]

521
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,240
[We can withdraw money anytime.]

522
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,800
[Got it?]

523
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,880
Yeah, got it.

524
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,120
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

525
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:27,880
Gotta go.

526
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,640
Why's it taking so long?

527
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,960
It's okay.

528
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,760
They brought him back.

529
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,880
It was scary in the ambulance.

530
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,560
The paramedics said his heart

531
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,120
stopped for a bit.

532
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,000
Daoqi.

533
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:11,880
He almost...

534
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,400
Li Daoqi.

535
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:13,920
Sit down.

536
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,960
I was just making

537
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,480
a joke

538
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,520
so he could relax a bit.

539
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
Stop talking nonsense.

540
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,680
Last night Yongjun

541
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,240
said his chest

542
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,040
hurt.

543
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,080
I told him

544
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,200
see a doctor right away

545
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,320
to have a check-up,

546
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,760
but he didn't listen.

547
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,160
It's hard to

548
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,680
see such things coming.

549
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,080
It's your fault.

550
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,880
Don't blame yourself.

551
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,800
[Anran,]

552
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,280
[I'm so sorry.]

553
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,320
[I can't make it today.]

554
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,560
[My father-in-law had an acute heart attack]

555
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,840
[and is in the ER.]

556
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,880
[I have to be at the hospital.]

557
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,400
Sorry to

558
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,920
cause you so much trouble.

559
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,360
I'll make it up to you when I get back.

560
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,040
[I'm so sorry.]

561
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,920
[I really, really am.]

562
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,440
[I've told Xiaohe about this, and you'll]

563
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,880
[see my messages after the livestream ends.]

564
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,000
Sorry, Anran.

565
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,160
Actually...

566
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,120
What?

567
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,920
Actually, if you're busy with work,

568
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,680
you don't

569
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,840
have to waste time here.

570
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,000
Nonsense. Just go back.

571
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,200
Ms. Wang.

572
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,280
Why didn't you save my Mom?

573
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,520
Yudong...

574
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,200
The doctor said your dad needs

575
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,160
someone with him around the clock.

576
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,160
I'm taking my Mom back to get some things.

577
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,160
Man needs to go back to look after Nian.

578
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,680
You stay with him.

579
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,560
Ran still has work.

580
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,440
Who says I have work?

581
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,280
We'll be quick.

582
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,640
No need to come back.

583
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,400
Just rest at home.

584
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,920
We two will stay here.

585
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,880
I talked to my Mom.

586
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,320
She refused.

587
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,880
She insists on staying here tonight.

588
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,080
Let's go.

589
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,240
We're here. Don't worry.

590
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,280
Why still standing? Sit.

591
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,400
Sit down.

592
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,680
Your wife has been bedridden

593
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,760
for years.

594
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,560
[Honestly,]

595
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,320
[no quality life to speak of.]

596
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,840
So

597
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,840
I think we need to

598
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,320
discuss with you

599
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,040
whether to keep her on life support.

600
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,200
[Think it over]

601
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,760
[and make a decision.]

602
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,080
I...I've been thinking about this,

603
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,080
but still want to ask you.

604
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,240
[If you agree to stop treatment,]

605
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,680
blink twice.

606
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,760
[If you don't,]

607
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,280
[blink three times.]

608
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,120
Ling?

609
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,360
[Ling...]

610
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
[He's awake. He moved.]

611
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,320
[Yudong.]

612
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,680
[Come over. He's awake.]

613
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,520
[Dad,]

614
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,520
[I'm Zhang Ran,]

615
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,280
[Yudong's wife.]

616
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,360
[We've met on video before.]

617
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,200
[Ms. Wang and Daoqi went home]

618
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,200
[to get things.]

619
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,280
[They'll be right back.]

620
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,320
[The doctor said]

621
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,840
[to take this off once you wake up.]

622
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,640
[Would you like some water?]

623
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,800
Why are the lights...

624
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,840
Are they back?

625
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,320
Mom, Dad.

626
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,280
We've been waiting for you.

627
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,320
How is everything?

628
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Nothing serious.

629
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,800
Out of danger now.

630
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,760
Just wait

631
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,520
[for the hospital to schedule]

632
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,720
[the bypass surgery.]

633
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,040
He's okay.

634
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,400
Good to hear that.

635
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,880
How old is your dad?

636
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,840
65.

637
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,280
A bit younger than me.

638
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,680
Just go to bed. Go on.

639
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,400
It's late.

640
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,640
You should be sleeping.

641
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,320
Alright. Listen,

642
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,320
[it's good you two came back from abroad.]

643
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,880
When parents get older,

644
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,200
having children nearby

645
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,480
brings peace of mind.

646
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,360
Enough.

647
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,640
They were at the hospital all day.

648
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,880
Go get some rest.

649
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,600
[Don't worry about us.]

650
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,520
[Go to sleep, quick.]

651
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,440
[Okay.]

652
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,640
[There's hot water.]

653
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,760
Got it.

654
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,520
Go to sleep now.

655
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,000
Need to charge your phone?

656
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,080
No.

657
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,080
Just plug it in.

658
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,679
It's full.

659
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,720
But it won't last the whole night.

660
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,800
What did Daoqi say to you?

661
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,880
Is it about your dad?

662
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,560
No.

663
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,720
I canceled my flight back to Canada.

664
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,480
Refund fee costs over 2,000 yuan.

665
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,880
I'll cover it.

666
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,560
What?

667
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,360
I'll cover it.

668
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,400
What?

669
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,560
The ticket price.

670
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,400
Yudong, look.

671
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,600
Is that a shooting star?

672
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,960
Another one.

673
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,960
Make another wish.

674
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,840
I did.

675
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,720
What is it?

676
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,880
I hope I can

677
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:38,760
[protect my family.]

678
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,320
Luckily, Xinying's

679
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,240
always

680
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,240
listened to me.

681
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,640
It'll save her

682
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,360
from trial and error.

683
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,520
She smoothly

684
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,000
landed a job at a Canadian bank.

685
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,080
Not like my sister's daughter.

686
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,160
She's

687
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,200
too stubborn.

688
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,720
I could tell ever since she was little.

689
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,320
A while back, she tried reselling

690
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,160
yet became a total joke.

691
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,680
I thought the whole thing

692
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,080
would soon be over,

693
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,840
but guess what?

694
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,880
That young lady

695
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,680
is planning

696
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,280
to do

697
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,440
livestreaming sales.

698
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,560
Livestreaming.

699
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,000
What is it?

700
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,440
[Is she the one]

701
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,120
[who used to]

702
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,440
[be a TV host?]

703
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,480
That's her.

704
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,200
[Called Desperate Personal Shopper?]

705
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,360
[Manfei showed me]

706
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,480
[the other day,]

707
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,360
[saying she's really popular.]

708
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,960
You've watched her livestreams?

709
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,720
You call that popular?

710
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,400
That's just a disgrace.

711
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,600
[Well, she definitely can't]

712
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,640
[compare to Xinying.]

713
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,880
[Xinying works at Royal Bank]

714
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,400
[of Canada,]

715
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,160
[right?]

716
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,400
[No ordinary people]

717
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,400
[can work there.]

718
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,840
Well, I can't

719
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,120
talk this too much in front of

720
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,880
my sister,

721
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,680
in case she'd be awkward.

722
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,880
She is too proud

723
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,040
and just

724
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,240
has to win.

725
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,840
At first,

726
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,520
Xinying's grades weren't

727
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,800
as good as Ran's for a while.

728
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,680
But everything has

729
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,760
changed now.

730
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,560
Look at Xinying,

731
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,920
and look what Ran ended up.

732
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
[Exactly.]

733
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,720
[You've finally made it through.]

734
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,040
[During the six years of caring for Xinying,]

735
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,480
[the whole family nearly broke up.]

736
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,240
Those years

737
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,160
were just too hard.

738
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,240
[Indeed.]

739
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,080
[Has Lu been behaving lately?]

740
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,760
Lu Ming?

741
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,240
He's fine.

742
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,800
[What about that Sunny]

743
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,320
[Butterfly?]

744
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,360
[No more contact?]

745
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,280
Why are you so nosy?

746
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,320
I've noticed you bring this up

747
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,640
more than I do.

748
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,560
And, it

749
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,200
doesn't prove anything.

750
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,320
[Seriously?]

751
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,600
[Listen up,]

752
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,400
[he just]

753
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,600
[won't admit it.]

754
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,320
[That's how men are.]

755
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,840
[Unless you catch them red-handed,]

756
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,440
[or they'll never confess.]

757
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,440
[Then if you scold him,]

758
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,320
[he acts like]

759
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,280
[he's wronged]

760
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,680
[and talks even louder than you.]

761
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,640
At our age,

762
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,160
every family

763
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,760
has its own mess.

764
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,720
Xinying's grown up.

765
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,280
I wanna

766
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,640
keep this marriage,

767
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,560
just get by

768
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,080
and let some things go.

769
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,840
[Yeah.]

770
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,760
I tell you something.

771
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,040
Don't tell anyone else.

772
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,440
[Okay, go ahead.]

773
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,520
I've noticed

774
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,280
when Lu uses his phone,

775
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,880
he sometimes unlocks it

776
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,000
with one finger

777
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,880
and sometimes

778
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,600
switches to a different finger.

779
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,360
[So I looked it up online]

780
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,840
[and found something weird.]

781
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,840
[You know what that means?]

782
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,000
[One fingerprint controls one account.]

783
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,680
[Basically, one fingerprint]

784
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,120
[manages one system.]

785
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,320
[Super secretive.]

786
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,200
[Safer than using two phones.]

787
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,560
[Hard to discover.]

788
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,920
[Don't you think]

789
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,160
[there's something fishy going on?]

790
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,840
I just want to tell you,

791
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,360
this is a trick.

792
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,600
None of these men

793
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,880
nowadays are easy to deal with.

794
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,560
[Have you gotten any evidence?]

795
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,640
[You need to have solid proof]

796
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,440
[and then confront him.]

797
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,160
I know.

798
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,040
[You need to take it seriously.]

799
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
Okay, okay.

800
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,000
Gotta go.

801
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,600
[Alright.]

802
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,200
[Bye.]

803
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,840
Evidence?

804
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
What? You startled me.

805
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,400
What's wrong?

806
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,560
Hello, honey?

807
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,560
[What's up?]

808
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,440
What are you doing?

809
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,080
I...I'm at work.

810
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,120
[I'm near your office.]

811
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,880
[Wanna grab lunch together?]

812
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,800
I...I'm not at the office

813
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,400
right now.

814
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,360
I'm out

815
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,000
meeting with a client.

816
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,440
[Where are you?]

817
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,040
I'm at the...

818
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,880
The...

819
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,760
Oh, the Hening Hotel.

820
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,240
[Fine. Focus on your work.]

821
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,560
[I won't bother you.]

822
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,120
Okay.

823
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,040
Hening Hotel?

824
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:48,800
Sir,

825
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,400
I've been waiting

826
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,760
for almost 20 minutes. How much

827
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,000
longer until you come down?

828
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,360
[I'm sorry.]

829
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,280
[Something came up.]

830
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,280
[I need to cancel.]

831
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,320
Alright, alright.

832
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:10,800
Hello?

833
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,920
[Dad, I'm at Lucheng Plaza]

834
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,960
[waiting for a ride.]

835
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,160
[Can you pick me up?]

836
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,560
Sure, on my way.

837
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,280
I'm nearby.

838
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:20,960
Bye.

839
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,840
Sir, please follow

840
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,920
that car in front.

841
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,680
I'm changing my destination.

842
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,480
The black Volvo?

843
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,440
Right.

844
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,240
Okay.
