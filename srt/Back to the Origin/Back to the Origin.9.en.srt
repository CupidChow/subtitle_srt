1
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,840
[It's cold by the lake at night.]

2
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,560
[Come out, hurry!]

3
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,240
[Let's not go out.]

4
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,960
[Chop-chop!]

5
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,479
[I'm going stargazing right now.]

6
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,160
Suit yourself then.

7
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,440
[There are bears out there.]

8
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,759
No, there aren't.

9
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,120
[You're the biggest bear here.]

10
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,120
[I mean it!]

11
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,080
[They might attack...]

12
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,240
[Come back inside!]

13
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,000
Not half cold outside.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,600
Come on!

15
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,400
[There are raccoons!]

16
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,560
Get out here.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,680
[Look.]

18
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,840
Move it.

19
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,360
I don't want to drag you out.

20
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,440
Come out, now!

21
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,520
Hey, you.

22
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,440
Out.

23
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,039
Out now.

24
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,759
It's really nice.

25
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,080
What am I doing that for?

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,160
To take a break.

27
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,800
It was perfectly fine inside.

28
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,960
Warm, isn't it?

29
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,840
Thank you.

30
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,200
Look at all these stars.

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,320
Why being a hermit?

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,400
Beautiful.

33
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,520
Beautiful. Here.

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,320
Clink.

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,960
Cheers.

36
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,000
See that?

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,360
A plane.

38
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
Not a plane.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,079
Planes have blinking lights.

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,560
Must be a shooting star.

41
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,160
What did you wish for?

42
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,280
That you'd have less work to do,

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,640
and make more money.

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,079
As if.

45
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,680
Hey, it's a wish. You never know.

46
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,560
You make one.

47
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,440
It's still there. Make a wish!

48
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,520
Three, two, one!

49
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,640
Done.

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,360
What?

51
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,080
I wished for...

52
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,000
world peace.

53
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,120
No more wars.

54
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,640
No more famine.

55
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,600
For everyone to live in freedom,

56
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,320
just like us.

57
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,920
Carefree and content.

58
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,760
I'll make another one.

59
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,440
My last one was not

60
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,000
grand enough.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,680
Go ahead.

62
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,560
What was that?

63
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,960
Not telling.

64
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,800
Oh, come on, tell me.

65
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,600
I'll tell you in ten years.

66
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,320
If we...

67
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,600
were still together then.

68
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,840
Of course we will.

69
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,400
We'll be together for a hundred years.

70
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,640
We'll be like two old turtles.

71
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,960
I wish that ten years from now,

72
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,520
same spot,

73
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,720
we still sit side by side.

74
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,840
We will.

75
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,000
[Stop dawdling.]

76
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,600
[Coming!]

77
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,320
What are you doing?

78
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,880
Just got a new bank card.

79
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,840
Keeping a memento.

80
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,240
It marks my journey

81
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,560
from zero fans to something.

82
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,440
When I hit a million followers,

83
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,880
and this card's balance

84
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,240
reaches a million,

85
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,720
I'll post a pic side by side.

86
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
Just imagine.

87
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:45,640
By then,

88
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,080
we'll buy a villa in Li Daoqi's

89
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,920
neighborhood.

90
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,000
While they're

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,159
having tea over there,

92
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,720
we'll be on our balcony opposite,

93
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,520
grilling lobsters.

94
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,400
The smell will drift over.

95
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,200
If they want some,

96
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,280
we'll share a little.

97
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,520
Wouldn't that be great?

98
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,680
Dreamlike.

99
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,040
We're not going back to Canada?

100
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,040
Once we're rich,

101
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,720
we can go anywhere we want.

102
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,400
Everyone, help yourselves.

103
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,240
Make yourself at home.

104
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,440
Don't stand on ceremony.

105
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,000
Take whatever you like.

106
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,480
Here, have some milk tea.

107
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,520
Help yourselves.

108
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,120
There's cake too.

109
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,680
Afternoon tea's on Ms. Zhang!

110
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:33,960
Thanks.

111
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,880
You're welcome. You've all worked hard.

112
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,560
[So who's the generous sponsor?]

113
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,400
Come take a break.

114
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,159
Have something to eat.

115
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,120
Is it Zhang Ran's treat?

116
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,360
Miss... Ms. Qian.

117
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,520
Ms. Liao.

118
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,120
You both

119
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,120
joined the company at the same time.

120
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,000
Ran's followers

121
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,159
have surpassed 100,000.

122
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,280
And the first commercial deal

123
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,360
were sensational, right?

124
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,200
You should learn more from Ran.

125
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,840
That's exaggerated.

126
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,640
you're making me

127
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,520
feel awkward.

128
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,640
So,

129
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,200
nice being famous, huh?

130
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,280
Minor fame feels

131
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,080
quite nice indeed.

132
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
As if all the knots of stress

133
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,240
have just loosened up.

134
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,200
So you see, you should listen to me.

135
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,920
You're starting over.

136
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,200
You need to drop the act.

137
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,160
Stop clinging to your past prestige.

138
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,440
Got it.

139
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,400
Is there, uh, something warmer?

140
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,120
Mr. Lin.

141
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,840
Have something sweet.

142
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,000
This one is dairy-free.

143
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,040
No rocks, better for your health.

144
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,600
Good performance.

145
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,080
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

146
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,840
I'll get back to you later.

147
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,320
Ms. Qian.

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,360
Shouldn't we assign Zhang Ran

149
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,800
an assistant?

150
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,040
Zhang Ran's workload

151
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,320
isn't at full capacity yet.

152
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,200
Wouldn't it

153
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,000
be a bit premature?

154
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,159
We can make an exception.

155
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
It's just that recently,

156
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,360
two assistants just resigned.

157
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,600
I haven't hired new ones yet.

158
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,520
Once I find some,

159
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,680
I'll assign one to Ran.

160
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,280
M... Mr. Lin,

161
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,360
I know a young man

162
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,120
who's quite good.

163
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,320
He used to be a tour guide.

164
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,120
Honest and pretty sharp.

165
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,040
If possible,

166
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,320
I can have him send

167
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,200
a resume over.

168
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,120
A known contact is good.

169
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,640
More reliable.

170
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,000
What do you think?

171
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,880
Okay.

172
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,040
Alright, send me the materials later.

173
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,080
Thank you.

174
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,080
Have another one.

175
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,480
I'm good.

176
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
Covering all bases.

177
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,400
Hi, Ran.

178
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh, it's you.

179
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,320
Where's your ride?

180
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,800
Still on the previous one.

181
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,840
Mine, either.

182
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,040
You okay?

183
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,440
Ran,

184
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,800
I heard you came to the office today

185
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
to sign the revenue-sharing agreement.

186
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,120
Oh, that's just supplemental.

187
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,840
The terms were agreed on earlier.

188
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,440
That's great.

189
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,400
It's starting to pay back at last.

190
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,480
Not like me.

191
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,920
I'm here to get scolded.

192
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,240
Don't think like that.

193
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,080
Everyone starts out like this.

194
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,960
I went to borrow a venue once,

195
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,800
ending up breaking

196
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,560
one of the cups.

197
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,840
Had to pay over CNY 8,000 for it.

198
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,240
The return wasn't

199
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,000
even enough to

200
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,960
cover a fraction of the cost.

201
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,080
That's just how it is.

202
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Shooting a video

203
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,960
costs that much?

204
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,600
Yeah, it does.

205
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,280
So things are

206
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,400
never plain sailing.

207
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,000
But it'll get better. Don't sweat.

208
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,040
How can I not worry?

209
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,880
I got another warning from Ms. Qian today.

210
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,320
The company keeps signing new people.

211
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,760
They give us

212
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,320
guidance and review

213
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,680
at the start.

214
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
But no hit

215
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,320
in three months?

216
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,400
You're out.

217
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,159
She put it that bluntly?

218
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,919
Ran, you've had viral hits.

219
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,240
And "Little White Sail"

220
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,800
got over two million views.

221
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,240
Those numbers beat the top streamer's.

222
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,080
Of course you're not worried.

223
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,040
Don't look at it that way.

224
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,920
Just because I

225
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,880
have a hit now,

226
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,120
doesn't mean I'm safe.

227
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,680
We're in the same situation.

228
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
The company would drop me

229
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,680
if I can't keep up.

230
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,640
Let me tell you,

231
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,840
in our line of work,

232
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,520
believing in yourself is crucial.

233
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,520
As for viral hits,

234
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,280
a lot of it is just luck.

235
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,120
Right?

236
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,360
How do you know

237
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,000
that tonight

238
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,320
you won't have a breakout hit?

239
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,040
I'm serious.

240
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,680
You can't just...

241
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,080
lose your nerve,

242
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,960
before getting things done.

243
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
Promise me you won't.

244
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,320
Unknit those brows,

245
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,800
and then

246
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,160
good luck can find you.

247
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,520
And beam a bit too.

248
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,680
That's my girl.

249
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,080
My car's here, I gotta go.

250
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,480
Seriously, perk up a bit!

251
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,640
Thanks, Ran.

252
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,200
I mean it.

253
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,840
Don't chicken out. You can do this.

254
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,800
Bye.

255
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,960
Sorry.

256
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,920
I'm almost there!

257
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,880
I tried to cheer her up

258
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,800
and literally

259
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,200
sprinted 800 meters.

260
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,920
That definitely counts as a good deed.

261
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,600
Doesn't it?

262
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,920
Absolutely.

263
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,160
This Ms. Liao is

264
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,000
too introverted.

265
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,600
Can't look people in the eye.

266
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,760
Always staring down, like this.

267
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,200
Muttering under her breath.

268
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,680
Her hands always on the

269
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,320
bag straps,

270
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,240
fiddling all the time.

271
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,440
Who knows what for.

272
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,360
I give it a few days

273
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,760
before she rubs the straps off.

274
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
Our company's idea

275
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,040
is to train her as a

276
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,800
comedy prankster.

277
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,240
A prankster?

278
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,160
She'd need to really let loose.

279
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,920
To put it bluntly,

280
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,800
she needs to be shameless.

281
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,040
Personality-wise,

282
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,360
she isn't cut out for it.

283
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,280
I doubt she'll make it.

284
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,280
She's just beginning.

285
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,440
With your kind of contract,

286
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,880
is the term you sign for

287
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,760
really long?

288
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,320
As long as you can glean

289
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,920
a decent number of fans within the term,

290
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,640
the company will still value you, right?

291
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,840
So that's why I say,

292
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,200
it starts out like this for everyone.

293
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,000
You must persevere.

294
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,920
You never know when

295
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,480
luck will strike.

296
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,960
It comes when it comes.

297
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,040
You know, back then,

298
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,400
if you hadn't encouraged me,

299
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,600
told me not to give up,

300
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,520
would I be where I am today?

301
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,280
Would I be this successful?

302
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
It was my duty.

303
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,120
Encouraging your wife

304
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,240
is Article Two of

305
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,880
the Husband's Code.

306
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,840
What's Article One?

307
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,040
Believing in your wife.

308
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,520
Fu Yudong, you're pretty smooth now.

309
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,560
What books have you been reading?

310
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,360
Show them to me.

311
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,480
Who needs books for life insights?

312
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,560
No wonder they say

313
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,920
life begins at forty for men.

314
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,720
You're right in your prime now.

315
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,720
I mean, you're highly educated,

316
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,760
a returnee scholar,

317
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,920
good-looking,

318
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,880
easy-going and friendly,

319
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,960
gentle and attentive...

320
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,720
Oh my god,

321
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
you have everything that

322
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,280
young girls love.

323
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,840
No wonder they like

324
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,040
you middle-aged bunch.

325
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,040
Who else would

326
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,200
take me except you?

327
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
That girl at the bank today?

328
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,880
Her eyes sparkled

329
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,960
at the sight of you.

330
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,880
I saw it all.

331
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,720
Got her WeChat, right?

332
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,480
Come on,

333
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,040
see for yourself.

334
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,600
I respect people's privacy,

335
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,320
No way.

336
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,200
You have to check.

337
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,360
I must clear my name.

338
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,880
Not interested.

339
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,400
Just want to make one thing clear:

340
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,680
if I'm the sun,

341
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
you're the sunflower.

342
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,520
Your focus stays on me,

343
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,680
no looking elsewhere.

344
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,240
Or I'll kick you to mom's room!

345
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
You know,

346
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,160
you seem different now

347
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,640
compared to when we

348
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,440
were abroad.

349
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,920
In what way?

350
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,040
Hard to put into words.

351
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,080
Just...

352
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,600
never saw

353
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,560
this side of you.

354
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,760
You seem more alive.

355
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,120
Which version do you like better?

356
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,800
Both are perfect.

357
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,160
Hammer coming!

358
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,080
Pass me the phone.

359
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,480
Here.

360
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,120
It's my phone ringing!

361
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,240
Your hearing is terrible!

362
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,560
Should get that checked.

363
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,800
Let me see that.

364
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,800
Honey! My first paycheck.

365
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,560
I actually made money!

366
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,840
This is my first real income!

367
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,600
Honey...

368
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,080
Book a nice restaurant now!

369
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,600
I'm inviting my mom and aunt now.

370
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,440
Wow!

371
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
I got paid!

372
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,440
How much?

373
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,960
I'm rich.

374
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,480
How much?

375
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,600
Guess! I'm not telling.

376
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,720
You guess! How many digits?

377
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,480
Let's see...

378
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,640
Ones, tens, hundreds... ten-thousands?

379
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,200
Too much?

380
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,080
Oh my god.

381
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,160
Stop guessing.

382
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,240
Just tell me

383
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,040
what you want.

384
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,920
My treat.

385
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,720
Right now.

386
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
I want the absolute best...

387
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,920
[Dear viewers,]

388
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,400
[the secret to long life]

389
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,040
[is as follows:]

390
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,880
[plenty of sleep,]

391
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,120
[moderate exercise,]

392
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,560
[loads of veggies,]

393
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,680
[and most importantly—]

394
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,960
[put your mind at ease.]

395
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,560
[Spend time with loved ones,]

396
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,720
[and laugh often.]

397
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,360
[That's the best antidote]

398
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,080
[to aging.]

399
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,520
Why'd you turn it off?

400
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,680
The game's on later.

401
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,640
Health show's over.

402
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
Bedtime.

403
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,400
It's so early!

404
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,960
It's 10:00 PM.

405
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,600
Major breakthrough!

406
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,280
What?

407
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,240
The letter C.

408
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,920
All the pieces have letters

409
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,640
on the back,

410
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,520
signaling their zones.

411
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,320
Zone C pieces go together,

412
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,080
Pieces with B go to Zone B.

413
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,480
So we should group

414
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
all the C's here?

415
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:47,800
Exactly.

416
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,200
Let's sort them

417
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,040
by zone first.

418
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,600
Wait, there's

419
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,840
an even bigger discovery.

420
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,600
What is it?

421
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,560
Some pieces

422
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,040
aren't even from this puzzle!

423
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,600
Meaning we can never finish it.

424
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,280
Look at this mouse.

425
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,400
Stuck in this cage.

426
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Must be depressed.

427
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,200
They won't even move.

428
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,600
Don't touch it!

429
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,920
What, venomous?

430
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,120
It might turn into

431
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,280
Splinter from Ninja Turtles

432
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,400
and beat you with a stick.

433
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,200
For lab mice like this,

434
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,880
what happens

435
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,200
to them afterwards?

436
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,360
How should I know?

437
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,440
Not my lab.

438
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,120
Done here.

439
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,760
Let's go.

440
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,400
Bye!

441
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,080
We're off.

442
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,040
What to eat?

443
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,520
Anything.

444
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,760
Your choice.

445
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,320
[Treat me to satay noodles.]

446
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
[There's a new place nearby.]

447
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,880
[Sure.]

448
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,160
[You suggested it, you pay.]

449
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,960
[I waited ages for you!]

450
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,920
[At least buy me dinner.]

451
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,680
[I'm broke.]

452
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,320
[Look at you! So cheap.]

453
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,880
Our philosophy:

454
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,040
from nature,

455
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,000
back to nature,

456
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,200
become nature.

457
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
We protect

458
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,280
every Asian gene.

459
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,880
We pooled the world's

460
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,960
top biology PhDs

461
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,080
and...

462
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,040
Uh...

463
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,200
What was that again?

464
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,600
Every inch of skin...

465
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,680
Every inch of skin

466
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,440
is treated with care,

467
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,000
designed specifically for Asian skin.

468
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,960
Come on, buck up!

469
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,080
Excuse me,

470
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,200
do you speak Mandarin?

471
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,440
I can.

472
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,280
Quick question.

473
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,400
Aren't suits required today?

474
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,680
"Check the invocation?"

475
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,160
"Dress cole: Business catual."

476
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,000
Right.

477
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,080
Your mastery

478
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,840
of Mandarin

479
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,040
is pretty much none, huh?

480
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,240
I am speaking "Tangerine"!

481
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,960
I see.

482
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,440
Alright.

483
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,400
You're all top talent,

484
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,280
so I'll be direct.

485
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,440
See that mountain?

486
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,760
We started in

487
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,320
a rundown factory

488
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,520
at its base.

489
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,680
You've all done your homework,

490
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,720
so let's start simple.

491
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,920
Quick warm-up.

492
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,960
When was our brand

493
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,040
founded?

494
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,080
In 1991.

495
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,040
1991.

496
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,320
Correct.

497
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,680
We started in 1991.

498
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,360
Mr. Wang, you've prepared

499
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,600
thoroughly.

500
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,240
And you're confident.

501
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,080
Good.

502
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,240
That's the practical attitude

503
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,360
and diligence

504
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,680
we're looking for.

505
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,240
[Tide foragers!]

506
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,680
Bring back a big haul!

507
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,800
I'm here.

508
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,200
No coral like you said.

509
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,880
Just rocks.

510
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,160
Why would I go in?

511
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,560
It's freezing!

512
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,400
Looks fine,

513
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,280
but try it.

514
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,560
Can't last a minute.

515
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,200
Stings like icicles.

516
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,040
I'm fine.

517
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,680
Nothing to be upset about.

518
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,840
I'm at peace.

519
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,440
Don't take yourself

520
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,360
too seriously,

521
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,880
or others either.

522
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,480
Really.

523
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,320
Things that

524
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,200
bother you now

525
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,480
will be a joke

526
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
years later.

527
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:02,960
For real.

528
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,600
What's that saying...

529
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,200
Thank you.

530
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Gotta go.

531
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,920
Wasn't there a dress code

532
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,240
on the notice?

533
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,120
There was.

534
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,680
Said

535
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,480
"business

536
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,400
casual",

537
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,440
and I thought,

538
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,120
isn't this

539
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,040
what this is?

540
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,520
What I'm

541
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,280
wearing is casual too!

542
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,600
Then I showed up

543
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,640
and everyone's dressed

544
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,520
like they're here to

545
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,800
play golf.

546
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,520
You know?

547
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,400
Tiger Woods types.

548
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,000
All they need is a club.

549
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,400
To think I

550
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,280
spent a whole day

551
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,040
in the flea market

552
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,080
for this outfit.

553
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,240
Total waste.

554
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,720
You'd kill to work in Hong Kong.

555
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,680
Why?

556
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,760
Well...

557
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,680
It's just...

558
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,760
Don't feel impelled to tell me.

559
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,200
No...

560
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,800
Really.

561
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,680
No, it's not a secret.

562
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,040
Just finding the words.

563
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,520
I do want to.

564
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,400
As a kid,

565
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,520
I loved those

566
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,880
Hong Kong business dramas.

567
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,760
Those shows

568
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,840
got me obsessed.

569
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,240
I always wanted

570
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,160
to be

571
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,120
a tycoon.

572
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,280
Or a business hero,

573
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,800
that kind of thing.

574
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:47,960
Hence Hong Kong.

575
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,880
When I saw you earlier,

576
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,840
I was stunned.

577
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,800
You looked just like

578
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,360
those actresses

579
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,560
from my childhood.

580
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,880
At the beach,

581
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,920
crying your heart out.

582
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,240
I thought, "This is it.

583
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,480
A star

584
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,400
fading tonight."

585
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,000
Had to witness

586
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,280
history.

587
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,480
Waited all night,

588
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,160
but you weren't going to do anything.

589
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,200
What a shame,

590
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,760
real pity.

591
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,960
You're so dramatic.

592
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,640
Just nonsense.

593
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,360
Normally, I'm

594
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,800
not this chatty.

595
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,080
Do you think I'm annoying?

596
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,280
No, not at all.

597
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,320
You're cute.

598
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,440
Yeah?

599
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,720
Okay.

600
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,200
Tell you what.

601
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,600
I'm older than you,

602
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,440
and more experienced.

603
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,200
If you need

604
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,120
interview tips,

605
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,120
just ask.

606
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:35,680
Wait...

607
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,200
It should be...

608
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,240
Like this.

609
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,120
Splendid.

610
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,440
Cheng Man.

611
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,480
Vice President.

612
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,600
And your name...

613
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,800
Li Daoqi.

614
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,720
I almost forgot to ask you.

615
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,480
Nice to meet you!

616
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,440
Looking forward to working with you.

617
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
Oh, come on.

618
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,760
So, I can contact you anytime?

619
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,680
Right?

620
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,440
Well, not exactly.

621
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,440
Don't call me in the middle of the night.

622
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,240
Okay, okay.

623
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,360
So, anytime except for the middle

624
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,320
of the night.

625
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,000
Right?

626
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,600
Give it back.

627
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,000
No, let me keep it.

628
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,720
Put it in my pocket.

629
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,680
The pockets are still sealed.

630
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,760
Can I return this?

631
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,800
Big mistake

632
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,920
tearing the tag off.

633
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,520
Do you wanna

634
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,240
ask the new director

635
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,840
to play soccer this weekend?

636
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,720
Nah.

637
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,000
Why ask him? I don't know him well.

638
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,320
Just with colleagues.

639
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,920
Last Family Day,

640
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,200
I met his wife.

641
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,960
We went shopping yesterday.

642
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,440
She bought two jerseys.

643
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,680
Said her husband

644
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,080
just transferred to the Lucheng City branch

645
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,120
and wants to connect with colleagues.

646
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,600
I think you should ask him.

647
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,200
He doesn't really seem like

648
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,520
the athletic type.

649
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,960
When I was in Hong Kong,

650
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,520
I often played tennis with

651
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,120
the big shots from investment banks.

652
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,560
One time,

653
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,800
the big boss showed up.

654
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,080
Everyone said he

655
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,360
was an amazing player.

656
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,480
That no one in the company

657
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,960
could beat him.

658
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,000
Bunch of brown-nosers.

659
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,640
Well, not exactly.

660
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,160
The boss was just okay.

661
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,320
We played five games.

662
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,280
He won three.

663
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,480
The first two,

664
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,200
I wiped the floor with him.

665
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,640
Then I lost the last three.

666
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,080
Always by just a point or two.

667
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,240
After that,

668
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,080
every time he played with friends,

669
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,120
he invited me.

670
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,640
He even introduced me

671
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,720
to a lot of contacts.

672
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,640
Got it.

673
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,800
Okay.

674
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,480
Mom.

675
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,120
Coming. Stop shouting!

676
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:39,960
He's here.

677
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,440
Happy birthday!

678
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,280
Get inside.

679
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:43,880
So embarrassing.

680
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,440
Mr. Fu.

681
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,640
Brought you some tea.

682
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,200
You brought me tea again?

683
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,560
You always get me the good stuff.

684
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,360
It's nothing.

685
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
Where are Cheng Man and Nian?

686
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,360
Uh, Cheng Man

687
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,200
isn't feeling well.

688
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,320
So she didn't come with me.

689
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,680
Told her to rest at home.

690
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,600
The tea is for you.

691
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,760
I'll put this cake in the fridge.

692
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,280
Go on.

693
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,800
Every time he comes,

694
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,200
he brings me such good tea.

695
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,960
Mingqian Longjing.

696
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,080
Do it yourself.

697
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,880
What?

698
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,840
What's with you now?

699
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,320
You tell me.

700
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,920
Cheng Man was going to come,

701
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,720
but then she heard

702
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,280
there would be strangers here.

703
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,160
She was afraid Nian

704
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,680
would feel uncomfortable.

705
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,520
She'll visit in a couple of days

706
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,800
to wish you happy birthday.

707
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,680
"Wish me happy birthday"? So formal.

708
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,000
I just wanted a simple

709
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,800
birthday celebration.

710
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,200
A casual meal at home.

711
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,480
Why couldn't they come?

712
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,280
Yeah.

713
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,800
Nian is like this because you

714
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,640
kept him cooped up

715
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,480
at home.

716
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,960
Think about when you were little.

717
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,160
You were always

718
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,920
running around

719
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,960
all over the market.

720
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,520
Yeah.

721
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,240
Free-range parenting.

722
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,720
And you were so talkative.

723
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,840
Even I couldn't outtalk you.

724
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,040
So kids shouldn't

725
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,520
- be overprotected.
- Yeah.

726
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,360
I've said this so many times.

727
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,600
Yes, I think you're

728
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,120
a hundred percent correct.

729
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,240
Next time,

730
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,840
fill this living room

731
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,560
with people.

732
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,480
I'll drag them over here,

733
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,560
put them right in the middle.

734
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,680
Let them get some social practice.

735
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,280
You wouldn't dare.

736
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,920
Go say hello to the others.

737
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,320
Mr. Fu.

738
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,680
Hello, guys.

739
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,680
They're all praising how filial you are.

740
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,720
Thank you, thank you.

741
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,000
You remember them, right?

742
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,560
Uh...

743
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,080
I...

744
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,640
This is Mrs. Yan.

745
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,920
And Mrs. Liu, Mrs. Zhang.

746
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,080
And this is...

747
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,440
Tan.

748
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,320
Mr. Tan.

749
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,080
Yes, Mr. Tan.

750
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,480
Always bought Golden Hamsters from you

751
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,040
when I was little. Little mice.

752
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,680
Hamsters.

753
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,040
You always came to my place to play.

754
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
This is Mr. Wang.

755
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,560
I met you

756
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,680
a couple years ago, Mr. Wang.

757
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,600
Li.

758
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,640
Yes?

759
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,760
Do you remember

760
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,680
your little brother?

761
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,160
My little brother?

762
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,080
The one you always played soccer with.

763
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,000
My son.

764
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,520
Your son! Of course I know him.

765
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,000
You scared me, calling him my brother.

766
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,560
My mom never mentioned that.

767
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,040
What's wrong?

768
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,440
Nothing.

769
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,160
I remember him.

770
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,360
Not too tall, pretty stout.

771
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,520
He was always picking on me.

772
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,200
Picking on you?

773
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,120
Yeah. I heard

774
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,400
he's in Beijing picking on others now.

775
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,360
He's a big boss, isn't he?

776
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,720
That was so many years ago.

777
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,120
You're holding a grudge?

778
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:10,760
No, no.

779
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,800
Our relationship was always

780
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,840
just not that great.

781
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,520
Don't take it seriously.

782
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,440
What did you want to ask?

783
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,320
Well, he's coming back to get married.

784
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,640
And they're looking for a house.

785
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,880
Your mom said

786
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,320
the houses in your community

787
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,440
are really nice.

788
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,000
Spacious.

789
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,000
And the loan interest is low.

790
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,640
Only 6,000 yuan monthly payment.

791
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,480
What a great deal!

792
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,560
Could you keep an eye out for me?

793
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:37,920
Yeah.

794
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,120
Keep her posted.

795
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,680
Well.

796
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,160
I'll ask around the community later.

797
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,280
If there are any available houses,

798
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,000
I'll tell my mom

799
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,280
and she'll notify you right away.

800
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,640
Look at Daoqi.

801
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,960
The older he gets,

802
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,920
the more accomplished he becomes.

803
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,560
We've watched him grow up

804
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,640
since he was little.

805
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
We all like him.

806
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,400
So tall now. We wouldn't

807
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,840
recognize him on the street.

808
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,560
Yeah!

809
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,080
Okay.

810
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,720
Uh, I think...

811
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,400
I'll go check on my mom.

812
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:58,960
See how the food's coming.

813
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,480
I know you have low blood sugar.

814
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:00,960
Right, Mr. Wang?

815
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,720
I should go ask her

816
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,040
if the food is ready.

817
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,840
What's up?

818
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,720
Madam Wang.

819
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,400
I have a request.

820
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,000
So serious? What is it?

821
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,120
Could you please stop telling people

822
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,200
about my mortgage?

823
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,120
What do you want?

824
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,720
It's so embarrassing.

825
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,960
Why shouldn't I?

826
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,400
Buying a house is a good thing.

827
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,680
Besides,

828
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,760
you know how those folks

829
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,680
from the market are.

830
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,880
Their gossip.

831
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,040
You're with Cheng Man now.

832
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,600
She's older than you,

833
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,880
and richer than you.

834
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,000
If I don't say something,

835
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,520
how can I shut them up?

836
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,560
Cheng Man

837
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,000
paid 90% of the down payment.

838
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,440
I'm only paying

839
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,600
the mortgage for the remaining 10%.

840
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,880
So stop talking with them about it.

841
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,880
So what?

842
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,160
You're still paying that ten percent.

843
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,760
Let me tell you,

844
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,680
what you said is

845
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,320
absolutely correct.

846
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,440
Then stop complaining about it.

847
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,800
But please stop bringing it up.

848
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,400
Fine, fine.

849
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,280
Don't just stand there.

850
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,120
Wash the vegetables.

851
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,400
Okay.

852
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,840
Manager Qiu.

853
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
This is Li Daoqi.

854
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,920
I came to your office

855
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,760
last week

856
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,200
for an interview. Remember?

857
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,960
About the salary you offered...

858
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,840
I feel it's

859
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,800
a bit lower than I expected.

860
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,600
Anyway,

861
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,760
thank you very much for your time.

862
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,120
Do you not see

863
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,400
the Yellow River

864
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,560
pour from heaven,

865
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,680
rushing

866
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,480
to the sea,

867
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,560
never to return?

868
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,960
Let me tell you all,

869
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,640
it's not easy

870
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,680
for us to get together

871
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,280
after all these years,

872
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:43,800
alright?

873
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,280
We grow distant if we don't meet.

874
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,960
Meet up more, okay?

875
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,400
Meet up more!

876
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,320
Come on.

877
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:50,800
Cheers.

878
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,040
Yudong.

879
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,200
How have you been?

880
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,840
I heard from Daoqi

881
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,760
you're in renovation now.

882
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:57,880
Yeah.

883
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,880
It's just a temporary gig.

884
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,120
I'll find something better later.

885
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,680
Let me tell you,

886
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,960
you've been

887
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,600
abroad for way too long.

888
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,360
Otherwise,

889
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,760
you wouldn't have to

890
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,280
start from scratch like this, right?

891
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,520
Listen to me,

892
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,840
don't worry about it.

893
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,600
Don't overthink it.

894
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,400
Just work hard.

895
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,800
Hey, guys.

896
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,760
Li Daoqi

897
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,280
just quit his job.

898
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,440
Officially retired.

899
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,120
Daoqi, when did you retire?

900
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm

901
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,120
Why didn't you tell us?

902
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,560
officially retired!

903
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,520
Aren't you happy?

904
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:29,560
Aren't you happy?

905
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,320
Retired life

906
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,120
is absolutely wonderful.

907
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,000
Daoqi.

908
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,639
It's like a dream!

909
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,639
Stop humblebragging!

910
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,480
You know what.

911
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,840
Your life

912
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,400
is my dream.

913
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,480
My life is your dream?

914
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,719
Well, that's good!

915
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,520
I'll have another bottle!

916
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,320
Guys.

917
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,960
I'm so happy today.

918
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,280
Let me handle him.

919
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:04,920
Put it down.

920
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,440
Alright, alright.

921
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,240
No more drinking.

922
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,280
Stop it.

923
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,360
Stop it.

924
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,400
Enough.

925
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,600
Told you. Stop it.

926
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,560
Sit down.

927
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,800
Enough.

928
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,760
Put it down.

929
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,040
Stop drinking. You've had enough.

930
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,440
Yudong.

931
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,640
Yeah?

932
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,040
What's up?

933
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,240
I think I lost my car keys.

934
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,000
I lost my car keys!

935
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,480
It's okay, don't worry.

936
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,720
We'll find them.

937
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,840
Nian.

938
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,760
Today's sensory integration training

939
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,400
will end

940
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,520
half an hour later than usual.

941
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,880
Roger. Standing by.

942
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,240
Say goodbye to daddy.

943
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,920
Bye-bye.

944
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,080
Bye-bye.

945
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,560
See you later.

946
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,880
[Well done!]

947
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,840
[Well done!]

948
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,360
[Attack.]

949
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,880
[Nice!]

950
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,800
[Awesome goal, son!]

951
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,040
[Ball's coming! Ball's coming!]

952
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,680
[Go, go, go! Charge forward!]

953
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,880
[Yeah, charge!]

954
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,280
[Attack, attack! That's right!]

955
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,760
[Attack!]

956
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,840
Nice!

957
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,800
[Attack!]

958
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,600
[Kick it. Yeah!]

959
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,960
[Li Daoqi!]

960
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,880
[Pass me the ball!]

961
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,880
Li Daoqi!

962
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,600
Pass me the ball!

963
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,520
Pass me the ball! Li Daoqi!

964
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,440
Hurry up!

965
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
[Why didn't you pass when I told you to?]

966
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,560
Do you even know how to play?

967
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,560
You just got lucky with that shot!

968
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,320
I told you to pass to me.

969
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,240
Didn't you hear me?

970
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,120
I told you to pass it.

971
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,840
Didn't you hear me?

972
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,040
I said pass to me.

973
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,840
From now on, I take the shots.

974
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,520
Got it?

975
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,920
Your job is just to pass me the ball.

976
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,080
Understood?

977
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,200
Three cucumber skewers,

978
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,600
four lotus root,

979
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,880
four potato,

980
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,040
eight corn kernels.

981
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,760
three chives.

982
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,880
Want potatoes?

983
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,600
Yeah.

984
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,680
How many skewers?

985
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,640
Ten.

986
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,640
Too many.

987
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,640
We can't finish that much.

988
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,880
Make it seven.

989
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,520
You ordered so much meat.

990
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,560
Cut it in half.

991
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,800
Excuse me.

992
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,880
Coming.

993
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,840
Here's our order.

994
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,800
Okay, thanks.

995
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,520
Leave it here.

996
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:43,920
Pen.

997
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,000
This little place's

998
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,640
still the same after all these years.

999
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,800
Hasn't changed a bit.

1000
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,720
It has.

1001
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,400
Those little flags,

1002
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,640
the TV,

1003
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,120
and even the paintings next to it

1004
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,600
were all added later.

1005
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,360
Has my memory been playing tricks on me?

1006
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,400
Well,

1007
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,840
of course it changed.

1008
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,320
So long it's been

1009
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,280
since we graduated.

1010
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,200
I remember that day

1011
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,640
you got that offer

1012
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,320
from the foreign university,

1013
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,720
we drank here. I got drunk

1014
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,480
and stood on the table shouting.

1015
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,520
So embarrassing!

1016
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,800
Feels like just yesterday.

1017
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,760
Life was so simple back then.

1018
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,280
We just wanted some money

1019
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,400
to afford a buffet meal,

1020
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,560
and we'd be over the moon.

1021
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,120
So happy.

1022
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,960
Time really flies.

1023
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,840
If we had known back in school

1024
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,920
that more than ten years later

1025
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,160
we'd still be the way we were,

1026
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,520
what would we have done?

1027
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,360
Can't bear to think.

1028
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,920
You loser.

1029
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,600
I'm a loser.

1030
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,840
I'm a total loser.

1031
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,880
Loser.

1032
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,320
We're not

1033
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,760
losers.

1034
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,160
Yudong.

1035
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,840
Believe me.

1036
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,240
We can still make it.

1037
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,960
We all have a place in this world.

1038
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,000
Look at you!

1039
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,160
Yudong coughs and you change your move.

1040
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,320
You're totally cheating!

1041
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,640
Who's cheating?

1042
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,560
You are!

1043
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,440
Jin.

1044
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,480
Stop keep calling him Yudong.

1045
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,320
Is "Yudong" for you to call?

1046
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,000
My son-in-law, after all,

1047
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,280
has a PhD!

1048
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,320
You should call him Dr. Fu!

1049
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,760
At my age,

1050
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,280
what's wrong with calling him "Yudong"?

1051
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,800
True, you're quite old,

1052
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,880
but how many doctors

1053
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,360
have you met in your life?

1054
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,240
Have you?

1055
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,840
My son-in-law is a PhD.

1056
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,760
I only know full and

1057
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,840
associate professors.

1058
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,400
What, do PhDs have ranks too?

1059
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,600
Associate(same sound as Fu) PhD?

1060
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,280
When do you get promoted to full?

1061
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,360
Oh, Please, Mr. Jin.

1062
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,480
Don't say that.

1063
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,920
You can call me whatever you like.

1064
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,440
Close the door.

1065
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,040
Smell's wafting into the living room.

1066
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,000
How can we eat like this?

1067
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,040
It stinks!

1068
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,560
Sorry about that.

1069
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,360
Let him focus on his meal.

1070
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,000
Don't keep staring at the phone.

1071
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,800
How can he focus on his meal

1072
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,560
without looking at the phone?

1073
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,240
Huh?

1074
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:05,720
This bad habit

1075
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,960
is all your fault for spoiling him.

1076
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,080
Enough. Eat properly.

1077
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,240
Fu Yudong.

1078
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:31,720
What are you doing?

1079
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,240
Nothing.

1080
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,080
Just watching a video.

1081
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,360
What video? Why so nervous?

1082
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,600
You know

1083
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,840
this old place has thin walls.

1084
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,080
Don't watch anything questionable.

1085
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

1086
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,080
It's not what you think.

1087
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,400
I'm going to shoot a video later.

1088
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,200
Help me out?

1089
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,960
Come with me.

1090
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,760
You're free anyway.

1091
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,240
You're free, right?

1092
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,920
Yeah.

1093
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,240
[What do you feel like eating?]

1094
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,440
[Let's go grab a bite.]

1095
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,440
[McDonald's.]

1096
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,320
[Let's go.]

1097
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:25,880
[See?]

1098
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,920
[If you don't study hard,]

1099
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,040
[you'll end up like them,]

1100
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,400
eating on the street.

1101
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,440
Hey,

1102
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,120
my grades were pretty good.

1103
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,440
Let's go. It's not right to lie.

1104
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,120
I have a PhD.

1105
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,920
It's true.

1106
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,160
[Hey.]

1107
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,440
[Take out the trash for me.]

1108
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,200
[Thank you.]

1109
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,080
Okay.

1110
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,080
[And close the door, please.]

1111
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:43,840
Sure.

1112
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,160
[Yudong.]

1113
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,960
[Be at the café downstairs]

1114
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,560
[from your place in twenty minutes.]

1115
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,120
Slow down.

1116
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,200
[Got a great idea! Definitely gonna work.]

1117
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,320
[Didn't you say "we all have a place"]

1118
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:33,920
["in this world"?]

1119
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,480
[Now's the time.]

1120
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,400
I thought you were just drunk

1121
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,200
talking nonsense.

1122
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,440
Are you serious?

1123
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,040
This brand.

1124
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,200
It's a household name,

1125
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,960
great value for money.

1126
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,360
I've already discussed everything.

1127
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,120
They said they'll transfer

1128
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,880
the brand, formula, production line,

1129
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,840
the whole package!

1130
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,040
When it's done,

1131
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,120
I'll be the CEO,

1132
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,440
and you'll be

1133
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,000
the head honcho

1134
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,320
in charge of technology.

1135
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,120
Once the money's in place,

1136
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,680
we're off to the races!

1137
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:00,760
Don't be silly.

1138
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,840
I studied biochemical engineering,

1139
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,040
focused on basic research.

1140
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,160
I've never paid any attention

1141
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,200
to the skincare niche.

1142
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,560
The closest I've ever gotten to skincare

1143
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,840
was the day I returned to China.

1144
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,120
I had a big pimple on my face,

1145
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,400
so I used one of

1146
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,120
my wife's products.

1147
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,200
That thing you stick on,

1148
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,360
the clear one, what's it called...

1149
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,000
A pimple patch.

1150
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,520
Right, a pimple patch!

1151
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,840
As for those face creams,

1152
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,200
all those bottles and jars,

1153
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:21,880
I have no idea what they're for.

1154
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,080
What does that matter?

1155
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,160
That got nothing to do with you.

1156
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,400
Those are just packaging.

1157
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,960
You're a doctor

1158
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,160
from the Royal College of Toronto.

1159
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,680
You just need to figure out

1160
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,040
the chemical composition inside,

1161
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,200
like the molecules and stuff.

1162
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,200
You figure that out,

1163
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,200
and that's it.

1164
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,800
That's easy to say, but I...

1165
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,080
Yudong, let me ask you.

1166
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,760
You want to develop your career

1167
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,040
back here, right?

1168
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,520
You've sent out so many resumes.

1169
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,720
Has there been a single job offer

1170
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,480
that both you and Zhang Ran

1171
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,240
are satisfied with?

1172
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,320
Any?

1173
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,520
See?

1174
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,320
So why don't we

1175
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,240
work together?

1176
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,880
Even if things don't work out,

1177
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:01,760
and the company fails,

1178
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,120
you'll still have the experience

1179
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,920
of being the CTO

1180
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,600
of a cosmetics company

1181
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,280
on your resume.

1182
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,040
If you're really worried,

1183
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,200
I'll sign a contract with you.

1184
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,160
You'll have the right

1185
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,080
to pull out whenever you want.

1186
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,520
Okay?

1187
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,960
But when you leave,

1188
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,000
I might not pay you

1189
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,600
your full salary for the last month.

1190
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,120
Oh, and also,

1191
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,920
don't tell Zhang Ran about this.

1192
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,360
I haven't told Cheng Man either.

1193
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,240
Let's keep it quiet for now.

1194
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,080
Who knows, maybe

1195
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,400
we'll strike it rich

1196
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,680
and surprise them.

1197
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,720
Then we can

1198
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,520
hold our heads high with pride.

1199
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,520
Tomorrow I'll start visiting

1200
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,120
investment firms, investors...

1201
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:41,960
You don't have to worry about that.

1202
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,360
I'll meet them.

1203
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,600
You just need to be there

1204
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,480
to support me technically.

1205
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,000
Is that okay?

1206
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,160
You know the saying.

1207
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,280
Unity is strength, right?

1208
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,480
We're talking big plans,

1209
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,120
why are you hugging that old bag?

1210
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,400
My tools of the trade.

1211
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,240
Listen.

1212
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,680
Hear that?

1213
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,520
What?

1214
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,960
Ding-ding-ding-ding!

1215
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,920
Only mosquitoes buzzing.

1216
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,080
The NASDAQ bell!

1217
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,760
I can already see you

1218
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,840
hitting that button.

1219
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,080
Me clapping right beside you.

1220
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,080
You're insane.
