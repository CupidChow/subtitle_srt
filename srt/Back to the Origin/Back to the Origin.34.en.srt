How's your day?

29
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,480
Not bad.

30
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,840
Why are you having takeout again?

31
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,840
It's your first day

32
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,440
at the company,

33
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,360
shouldn't we celebrate?

34
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,280
I bought a cake.

35
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,680
I don't have time.

36
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,720
I'm about to start streaming.

37
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,520
Streaming? What streaming?

38
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,880
Aren't you back working at the company?

39
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,000
Lin Chang says my alt account

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
is doing really well,

41
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,280
with highly engaged followers.

42
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,240
She wants me to keep it up.

43
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Work during the day,

44
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,000
and stream at night.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,800
So you've scheduled your

46
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,760
entire 24 hours?

47
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,200
Don't worry about this. Just leave it here.

48
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,800
I'm in my career's upward trajectory,

49
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,720
just support me a bit.

50
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,120
But are you leaving any time for me?

51
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,640
I did!

52
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,960
I asked you to lunch,

53
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,840
but you said you were busy.

54
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,520
I was busy?

55
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,400
It's funny how we're living under the same roof

56
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,880
but experiencing jet lag.

57
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,760
[Just put the cake in the fridge.]

58
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,800
[I'll eat it after I finish streaming.]

59
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,840
Fine.

60
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,000
Have you finished eating?

61
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,560
[Just leave it there. Don't worry about it.]

62
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,520
[Stop talking,]

63
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,600
I'll clean up for you.

64
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,200
[Stop talking, Fu Yudong.]

65
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,000
How's the talk with Cheng Man going?

66
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,640
It's settled.

67
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,800
She said

68
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,760
she'll support me.

69
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,440
Cheng Man

70
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,680
is truly a remarkable wife.

71
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,840
She supports whatever you want to do.

72
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,000
That's all because of

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,200
my personal charm.

74
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,840
Are you done warming up?

75
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,240
Yeah, just one last stretch.

76
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,760
Ready?

77
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,360
Come on!

78
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,600
Where do we start?

79
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,600
This line here.

80
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,680
Here.

81
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,440
This line, right?

82
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,880
Alright.

83
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,560
Okay.

84
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,320
Three,

85
00:05:59,320 --> 00:05:59,880
two,

86
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,320
one,

87
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,720
go!

88
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,480
Same rules as always,

89
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,240
first one to reach the five-meter mark

90
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,840
loses,

91
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,840
and the loser buys skewers.

92
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,760
No stopping!

93
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
And you're even putting your hands in your pockets?

94
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Who do you think you are,

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,200
acting like a grandmaster?

96
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,159
Go!

97
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,760
You lose.

98
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,520
Looks like you're buying skewers.

99
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,000
You're really something else.

100
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,159
Which restaurant?

101
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,720
Your choice.

102
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,080
Have a drink, Yudong.

103
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,680
How will you explain it

104
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,520
after drinking?

105
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,400
I'll just say you made me drink.

106
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,240
Good,

107
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,240
then we're all settled.

108
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,560
I'll print out

109
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,480
the revised contract.

110
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,680
Let's sign it today.

111
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,320
No problem,

112
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,200
today is

113
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,560
perfect for signing contracts.

114
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,680
Wait a moment,

115
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,360
I've been thinking,

116
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
we can add one more clause.

117
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,040
Mr. Fu,

118
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,960
during Double 11,

119
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
you could come with your wife

120
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,080
to the livestream.

121
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,760
This would add

122
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,200
credibility to your brand story.

123
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,000
What do you think?

124
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,400
Sure,

125
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,720
she's also an influencer.

126
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,200
Her name is Zhang Ran.

127
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,480
I'll discuss it with her.

128
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,120
Yes, his wife has a huge following.

129
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,440
She's one of those really famous

130
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,280
influencers.

131
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,080
What do we call this?

132
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,480
This would be a perfect power collaboration!

133
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
That might not be appropriate.

134
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,080
You see,

135
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,520
we've done some background checks,

136
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,840
your wife's company

137
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,680
actually competes with ours.

138
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,040
There's a conflict of interest,

139
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,600
so cooperation wouldn't be possible.

140
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,040
Besides,

141
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,440
we're not even in the same market segment.

142
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440
I remember now,

143
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,720
she is quite popular.

144
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,000
She once said,

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,080
ordinary people should be shameless,

146
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,280
but that's quite different from

147
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,040
the persona we want

148
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,880
to create for Mrs. Fu.

149
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,360
It probably wouldn't suit

150
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,720
your brand image.

151
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,520
That's fine if we don't do it together.

152
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,360
After all,

153
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,840
it was just a random thought.

154
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,160
Then,

155
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,720
he can just go on by himself.

156
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,000
Actually, she's not...

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,600
Yes, yes,

158
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,880
she's actually a really nice person.

159
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,160
But we still need someone.

160
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,200
Otherwise,

161
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,360
what makes you different

162
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,120
from other brands?

163
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,640
What's the point?

164
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,440
No, Lady Wan,

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,880
regarding this collaboration,

166
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,200
we're very sincere.

167
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,240
You can't dismiss everything

168
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,360
we've already agreed upon

169
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,840
just because we couldn't agree

170
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,200
on this one thing.

171
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,159
We've

172
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,440
already started preparing inventory.

173
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,800
Mr. Fu, don't worry.

174
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,160
I haven't said no.

175
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,680
There's always a solution.

176
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,920
Let's think about it,

177
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,000
find a win-win solution.

178
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,680
This isn't just for

179
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,520
our livestream,

180
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,160
but also for

181
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,480
your brand's longevity

182
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,240
to consider.

183
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,400
Specifically,

184
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,600
how would this win-win situation

185
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,720
work?

186
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,720
In livestreaming,

187
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,400
what's real or fake,

188
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,200
who cares?

189
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,520
What matters is

190
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,960
selling your products

191
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
and building your brand.

192
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,840
It's quite simple.

193
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,080
I understand.

194
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,960
I get it.

195
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,920
What do you understand?

196
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,880
I get it.

197
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,520
Don't worry,

198
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,320
I'll arrange this.

199
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,320
Mr. Li is so smart!

200
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,720
Well then, wish us good luck!

201
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,440
We have the luck.

202
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,320
Yes, we have it.

203
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,600
Cheers to cooperation.

204
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,200
We have

205
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,320
another brand meeting later.

206
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,000
Alright, go ahead with your work.

207
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,560
I won't see you out then.

208
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,040
We are okey.

209
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,400
What do you understand now?

210
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,240
Isn't it clear?

211
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,080
They want to find someone else

212
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,720
to pretend to be Mrs. Fu,

213
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,320
to livestream with you.

214
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,920
This is insane!

215
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,440
I have my own wife,

216
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,280
why do I need someone else

217
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,120
to pretend to be my wife?

218
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,480
They said Zhang Ran won't work,

219
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,520
well then I won't work either.

220
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,640
I'll tell them I quit!

221
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,000
You should go quickly.

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,040
Six million.

223
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,800
I have my everything on it.

224
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,040
You go ahead.

225
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,720
I've spent six million already

226
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,040
and sold everything I had.

227
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,480
That amount is just right,

228
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,400
enough to pay their penalty fee.

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,920
I'll divorce my wife thereafter.

230
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,080
She never

231
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,960
approved of this anyway.

232
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,280
I really don't care.

233
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,960
I just feel sorry for my boy.

234
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,120
At such a young age,

235
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,360
having to pay off my debt.

236
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,840
Well, that's fine too. No need to stay at home,

237
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,240
go out

238
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,480
and sell things for living.

239
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,040
Li Daoqi,

240
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,280
if we weren't at someone else's company,

241
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,760
I would slap you!

242
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,920
Don't touch me!

243
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
What's the big deal?

244
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,440
What's the big deal?

245
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,760
You, you...

246
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,320
Look at it from a different perspective.

247
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,000
Zhang Ran does this for a living.

248
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,040
Just tell her the truth,

249
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,360
say it's for work.

250
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,760
And they said

251
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,280
it's all part of the show.

252
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,800
Zhang Ran must understand that.

253
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,480
She previously said

254
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,920
freeloading thing about you to her audience.

255
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,640
Wasn't that also for the show's needs,

256
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,120
to gain followers?

257
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,960
Didn't she have to act too?

258
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,960
Zhang Ran will definitely understand!

259
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,200
Besides, Yudong,

260
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,920
we've come so far

261
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,480
with such difficulty, right?

262
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
You need to see the bigger picture.

263
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,360
What are you sighing about?

264
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,360
Why did you come here?

265
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,800
To feel the environment.

266
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,560
No changes.

267
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,560
No changes?

268
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,880
Over there.

269
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,600
The lemur.

270
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,080
How is it?

271
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,840
The lemur? It's good.

272
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,080
The duty guard told me

273
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,400
that the lemur enclosure's

274
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,440
keeper

275
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,560
is quitting

276
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,640
and going back home.

277
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,760
But

278
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,640
the zoo hasn't found

279
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,120
a suitable replacement,

280
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,840
and they asked him to stay for a few more weeks.

281
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,080
Bro, still don't get it?

282
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,320
Your comprehension is really something else.

283
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,800
Isn't working here better?

284
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,240
Better than being a cleaner?

285
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,480
At least you won't have to work late nights.

286
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,200
And look at the lemurs,

287
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,280
how simple is that?

288
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,440
They can't escape

289
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,400
like what happened

290
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,240
before.

291
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,440
It won't be my responsibility.

292
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,160
I don't have experience or qualifications.

293
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,400
If I say you have qualifications,

294
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,360
then you do.

295
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,080
Experience is simple too.

296
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,480
I'll pass on the experience

297
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,360
to you now.

298
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,040
Still using this approach?

299
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
All essential skills.

300
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,520
Just look at it when you have time.

301
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,200
This is him, say hello.

302
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,920
Hey, Lee.

303
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,720
Ge Kaiyang.

304
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,160
[Smile.]

305
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,800
Hello.

306
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,440
[Greet him properly!]

307
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,680
Why so reluctant?

308
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,320
Looks worse than crying.

309
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,200
I just naturally look reluctant.

310
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,640
Actually, I haven't told you,

311
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,040
I'm fine working there.

312
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,520
This area has many people,

313
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,520
many keepers,

314
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,280
and I don't feel very comfortable.

315
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,520
Fine,

316
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,600
why should you be comfortable?

317
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,720
Was cleaning toilets comfortable?

318
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,600
So unnecessary, Ge Kaiyang,

319
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,880
you're always like this,

320
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,600
trying to avoid everything.

321
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,080
If you're so afraid of people, don't be human then.

322
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,960
[You have serious issues, really.]

323
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,840
Ge Kaiyang, let me tell you,

324
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,920
for you to work here,

325
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,280
qualifications and experience

326
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,520
aren't the most important things.

327
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,600
You know my relationship

328
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
with my father,

329
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,280
we're practically strangers.

330
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,600
For your sake,

331
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,840
I even used

332
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,560
his connections.

333
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,520
Oh my...

334
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,920
Why did you contact your father?

335
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,160
Because I couldn't

336
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,000
contact your father.

337
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:44,840
Ge Kaiyang...

338
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,960
Why is she wearing a wedding dress?

339
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,880
Is it already decided?

340
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,720
Don't joke around, I'm not happy.

341
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,360
Look at these two.

342
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,840
Neither of them came today,

343
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,880
but I think,

344
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,800
judging from their temperament and educational background,

345
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,080
they seem quite suitable.

346
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,040
No, no,

347
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,240
the photos are heavily edited.

348
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,880
She had work done.

349
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,800
It affects

350
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,000
the company's image.

351
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,880
Really?

352
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,000
Come here.

353
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,520
Here you are!

354
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,160
You've been looking for me?

355
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,240
What's this about?

356
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,840
After Lady Wan's

357
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,040
suggestion last time,

358
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,120
I immediately

359
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,760
reported this to Mr. Xing.

360
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,840
He acted quickly

361
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,080
and helped you

362
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,440
arrange everything.

363
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:42,960
I

364
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,200
knew your cooperation level

365
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,360
wouldn't be very high,

366
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,200
so we didn't call you for the first two rounds.

367
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,640
Today is the third round

368
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,880
and final round.

369
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,640
Of course, for the final candidate,

370
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,440
Lady Wan's side will make the decision.

371
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,800
At least take a look yourself.

372
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,400
Look at what?

373
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,360
What do you mean?

374
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,160
Your future Mrs. Fu candidates!

375
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,960
Take a look,

376
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,000
we've nearly gone cross-eyed reviewing them.

377
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,160
Stop it!

378
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,200
What are you doing?

379
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:09,920
Sit down!

380
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,760
Where are you going?

381
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,680
This is a matter of principle!

382
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,000
What principle?

383
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,560
This is work.

384
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,840
Sit down.

385
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,000
Do you know how much effort

386
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,240
we've put into this?

387
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,680
Hello everyone, I'm Mary,

388
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,640
I'm 164 cm tall,

389
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,720
50 kg.

390
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,040
I'm currently a yoga instructor,

391
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,160
and my hobbies are

392
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,560
music and fitness.

393
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,320
I have level 8 English

394
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,360
and level 6 piano.

395
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,160
If I could

396
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,360
become Mrs. Fu,

397
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,120
I believe I'll be

398
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,680
a great help to him.

399
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,160
Hi, I'm Hanna,

400
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,800
168 cm tall,

401
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,960
45 kg.

402
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,120
I'm a minor actress.

403
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,800
I don't think

404
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,840
I have any outstanding skills,

405
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,760
but I'm excellent at adapting my communication style

406
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,440
to different situations,

407
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,320
especially

408
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,080
in special circumstances

409
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,079
and emergencies.

410
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,119
Excuse me,

411
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,880
one question.

412
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,920
Suppose

413
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,880
one night you come home from work,

414
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:10,880
it's very late,

415
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,400
and you suddenly find

416
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,079
a ghost sitting in your living room.

417
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,280
How would you use their language

418
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,160
to promote

419
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
our product to it?

420
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,200
Hello, I'm Wei Qiuqiu,

421
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,280
178 cm tall,

422
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,599
57 kg...

423
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,119
Hello, I'm Yuxiu,

424
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,000
gentle and refined...

425
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,960
Hi, I'm Billy...

426
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
Hello,

427
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,640
I believe you've already seen

428
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,800
my profile.

429
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,680
Mr. Fu and I

430
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,320
share similar

431
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,360
overseas living experiences.

432
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,680
I want to say

433
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,520
my experience and capabilities

434
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,080
make me more qualified than the other candidates here

435
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,840
for this position.

436
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,240
You can call me Qi.

437
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,320
Alright, Ms. Qi,

438
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,600
if you had to use one sentence

439
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,560
to recommend to those

440
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,800
who haven't used

441
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,760
our product,

442
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,080
what would you say?

443
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,160
Try it and you'll know.

444
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,960
I think product matters

445
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,040
should be Mr. Fu's company's

446
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,840
concern.

447
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,200
As his wife,

448
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,440
I shouldn't interfere with his work

449
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,560
or participate in his work.

450
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
That's what

451
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,160
a Mrs. Fu should do.

452
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,800
Thank you.

453
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,560
Thank you.

454
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,200
Fu Yudong!

455
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,480
Are you retaliating against me?

456
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,160
Not at all.

457
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Li Daoqi and Lady Wan

458
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,480
signed the contract.

459
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,680
Lady Wan insisted on it.

460
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,320
What could I do?

461
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,360
So whatever Lady Wan wants,

462
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,600
you'll do it, is that it?

463
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,440
Now

464
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
you're bringing in a fake wife,

465
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,000
what does that make me?

466
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,960
What am I to you?

467
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,360
It's just acting, it's not real!

468
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,000
What if the acting becomes real?

469
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,200
How is that possible?

470
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,720
Things are different now,

471
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,800
you know that clearly.

472
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,680
You think I should agree

473
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,000
and I should just agree?

474
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,680
Let me tell you,

475
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,720
I've tried my best.

476
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,160
I told Lady Wan

477
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,320
that my wife is also an influencer.

478
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:43,880
I was thinking

479
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,080
of bringing you to the livestream

480
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,000
to help

481
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,880
you somewhat.

482
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,400
But Lady Wan said,

483
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,520
since you're not from the same company,

484
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,480
you're with Tide Media,

485
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,800
there exists a conflict of interest

486
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,360
between the two companies.

487
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,600
What can I do about that?

488
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,240
So you're saying

489
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,360
I'm holding you back,

490
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
I've become

491
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,000
a stumbling block in your career,

492
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,520
that's what you mean, right?

493
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,360
That's not what I mean!

494
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,400
How could you interpret it that way?

495
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,480
That's exactly what you mean!

496
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,160
I just want you to cooperate

497
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,800
with my work,

498
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,960
is it so difficult?

499
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,640
I didn't mind

500
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,600
about the rice cake story before.

501
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,200
During your livestream the other day,

502
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,800
for your sales,

503
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,560
you used me as

504
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,360
a tool to talk about having children,

505
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,560
and you didn't mind.

506
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,920
Now when I need to work,

507
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,040
to cooperate with my work,

508
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
is it so difficult?

509
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,120
Fu Yudong, these are completely different things!

510
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,240
How can they be the same?

511
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,240
When I talked about you,

512
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,560
nobody knew you were my husband,

513
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,160
right?

514
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,080
Even if people online

515
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,960
wanted to judge you,

516
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,360
they didn't know who you were.

517
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:25,920
But if

518
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
you get a fake wife,

519
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,880
everyone will assume

520
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,280
I'm not your wife, right?

521
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,840
The same logic applies.

522
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,680
Nobody online

523
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,080
knows who I am,

524
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
let alone

525
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,400
who my wife is.

526
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,280
In the future,

527
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,400
if there are any problems,

528
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,000
they'll attack that person,

529
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,840
not you.

530
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,360
I'm protecting you!

531
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,320
You're so amazing,

532
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,400
thinking so much about me!

533
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,640
Well, I'm telling you I don't agree.

534
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,760
Don't I have the right to disagree?

535
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,560
It's so frustrating!

536
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,520
Fu Yudong,

537
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,480
I think

538
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,680
since we came

539
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,520
from Canada...

540
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,160
Fine,

541
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,600
let's talk about Canada.

542
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,960
I was living in Canada before,

543
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,240
and I was happy.

544
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,880
When you said you wanted to return to China,

545
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,440
I supported you, alright?

546
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,360
We came back together.

547
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,320
Do you know

548
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,760
how much pressure I've been under?

549
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,680
After coming back,

550
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,640
I had to consider your feelings,

551
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,680
consider your father's feelings,

552
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,640
your mother's feelings.

553
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,440
I had to think about

554
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,160
all of them.

555
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,920
Every day out there,

556
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,760
fixing things for people,

557
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,400
have I complained once?

558
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,760
All these things,

559
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,920
I've dealt with myself.

560
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,880
Now Li Daoqi for this matter

561
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,080
has put everything on the line.

562
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,760
How can I not help him out?

563
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,520
I understand now,

564
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,360
Fu Yudong,

565
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,080
I used to think

566
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,640
when you came back from Canada with me,

567
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,960
you genuinely supported me,

568
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,360
wanted to back me up.

569
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,680
But now I see

570
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,480
you've got it all calculated.

571
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
You're constantly calculating

572
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,640
what you've sacrificed,

573
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,680
what you've given up,

574
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,640
right?

575
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,720
Whatever.

576
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,040
Since you think

577
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,360
everyone else is more important than me,

578
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,680
Li Daoqi,

579
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,320
Lady Wan,

580
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,880
your company, fine.

581
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
I used to be

582
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,280
your everything,

583
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,040
but now I realize

584
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,520
I'm nothing.

585
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,600
It's a simple thing.

586
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,080
Do whatever you want.

587
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,240
Why are you making such a big deal out of this?

588
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,920
I'm not.

589
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,680
Do whatever you want.

590
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,520
I won't be

591
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,280
a stumbling block for you anymore.

592
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,800
So just do whatever you want.

593
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,360
Fine,

594
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,200
do what you like.

595
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,680
I won't bother you anymore.

596
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,840
Don't bother me either.

597
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,440
Damn it!

598
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,560
Mr. Fu, Mr. Li, I need to go.

599
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
What you just said

600
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,080
was really inappropriate.

601
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,520
Even Michael looked embarrassed.

602
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,520
Listen, Yudong,

603
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,760
if he had just argued with me directly,

604
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,960
that would've been fine.

605
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,880
I just can't stand

606
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,920
his passive-aggressive

607
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,520
attitude.

608
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,720
It makes

609
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,040
my blood boil.

610
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,640
You're the CEO,

611
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,120
and I'm the legal representative.

612
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,400
He's just a professional manager.

613
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,840
Who does he think he is?

614
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,680
Alright, don't get angry.

615
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,960
I'm not really angry.

616
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,440
I'm just showing him who's boss.

617
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,840
Plus, I want him to pass

618
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,240
this message to Xing Kai.

619
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
What's wrong with Xing Kai now?

620
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,920
He's a sly old fox.

621
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,680
He won't move without a payoff.

622
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,200
He hasn't paid me a penny yet,

623
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
waiting for my money to come in first.

624
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,120
How are things on your end?

625
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
Any difficulties?

626
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,360
No difficulties.

627
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,880
It's just that

628
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,840
Cheng Man has set up all these

629
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,640
financial products and funds,

630
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,520
and such things.

631
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,320
I withdrew in the morning,

632
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,880
but they can't give it to me in the afternoon.

633
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,200
It'll take several days.

634
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,360
Don't worry,

635
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,320
we can work something out.

636
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,600
If you're having troubles, let me know

637
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,120
and we'll figure it out together.

638
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,560
Great, if you want to help,

639
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,040
how about

640
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,960
treating me to dinner tonight?

641
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,720
I can't.

642
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,280
Zhang Ran is waiting for me at home.

643
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,520
So you were just talking nonsense earlier,

644
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,360
all fake.

645
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,680
You're just like him,

646
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,440
I tell you.

647
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,360
You're all deceivers.

648
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,040
The difficulties I mentioned

649
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,280
aren't about that.

650
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,640
Listen,

651
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,200
when others make valid points,

652
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,080
we should listen.

653
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,720
If they're wrong,

654
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,480
no need to butt heads with them.

655
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Yeah, I get it.

656
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,680
I know what I'm doing.

657
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,440
Don't worry.

658
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,040
Mr. Fu,

659
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,840
when you're at the mall on Double 11,

660
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,600
you'll see the big LED screens.

661
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,800
Just stand there and wait a bit.

662
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,680
The screen cycles through ads,

663
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,120
and after a while

664
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,240
Yudong'll come up.

665
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,760
Really?

666
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,720
Really.

667
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
Yudong on the LED screen?

668
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,920
We bought ad space.

669
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,520
Yudong's doing commercials now?

670
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,000
Yes.

671
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,560
He's the face of our company.

672
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,560
You two have really made it.

673
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,400
Face of the company?

674
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,960
We should celebrate.

675
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,400
[Two more dishes coming right up.]

676
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,040
No rush at all, really.

677
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,280
I'm just starving.

678
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,320
Almost ready. Wait a second.

679
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,520
Such a big day.

680
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,840
Why didn't Yudong come with you?

681
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,400
He...

682
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,360
He was supposed to.

683
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,000
[Well, we were actually]

684
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,680
[on our way here together,]

685
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,800
but halfway someone called him

686
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,640
and he had to go.

687
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,240
Since he's the face of the company,

688
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,280
he's busier than me.

689
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,080
He's rushed off his feet these days.

690
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,880
Really busy.

691
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,480
Dishes are up. Let's celebrate

692
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,320
before you starve to death.

693
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,160
Time to eat.

694
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,160
Let's have a few drinks.

695
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,080
Great. Let's drink a few more today.

696
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,760
No problem.

697
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,360
A proper celebration for you both.

698
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,560
Here, let's drink.

699
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,760
Come on.

700
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,360
Flying Millet,

701
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,120
welcome to my livestream.

702
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,120
Thanks for the support.

703
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,480
Really?

704
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,680
You noticed?

705
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,200
I am a bit tired.

706
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,400
I had a small

707
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,840
clash with someone,

708
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,640
but that's normal.

709
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,960
Did you fight with your husband?

710
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,640
Couples argue all the time.

711
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,120
I mean,

712
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,600
in relationships

713
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,920
especially marriages,

714
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,080
no one can

715
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,000
stay calm

716
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,280
and peaceful every

717
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,720
single day.

718
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,600
I often

719
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,720
think

720
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,400
marriage is like

721
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,720
a savings

722
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
account at

723
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,560
the bank.

724
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,720
Those happy

725
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,640
moments

726
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,920
are the "money" you deposit.

727
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,600
When you argue,

728
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,080
it's like you're withdrawing

729
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,200
from that account,

730
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,800
because when you're fighting

731
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,560
and emotions run high,

732
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,880
you just want to

733
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,200
tear the other person apart.

734
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,240
In that moment,

735
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,960
no one can't remember

736
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,280
the good times you've shared.

737
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
No one.

738
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,360
But when you calm down

739
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,200
and think about it,

740
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,520
you have to rely on

741
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,840
those good memories to get through it.

742
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,200
Otherwise,

743
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,320
how do you keep marriage going?

744
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,720
Enjoy and cherish the good times.

745
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,280
When you're arguing,

746
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,640
remind yourself of those good moments.

747
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,320
If we can

748
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
all do that,

749
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,440
life feels a lot lighter

750
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,400
and happier.

751
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,280
But if you

752
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,680
let negative emotions

753
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,640
take over

754
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,720
and walk around

755
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,200
with a sour face all day,

756
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,400
it's bad for you

757
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,760
and the people around you.

758
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,360
You're back?

759
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,240
What's up? You're in such a good mood.

760
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,920
What's that you're holding?

761
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,200
A gift, for you.

762
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,640
Why are you giving me a gift?

763
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,720
This is your favorite brand.

764
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,200
No more shopping online from overseas.

765
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,840
I'll buy at the boutique for you.

766
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,800
Today's a good day.

767
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,880
We have to celebrate.

768
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,800
We signed the Double 11

769
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,880
livestream contract with Lady Wan.

770
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,440
You did?

771
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,480
Didn't you say

772
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,040
there was a big funding gap?

773
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,080
All taken care of.

774
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,160
I handled it.

775
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,240
Like you said,

776
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,000
I've learned a lot.

777
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,960
Congratulations.

778
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,000
Pretty impressive, huh?

779
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,680
I knew you could pull it off.

780
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,280
What's this?

781
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,000
It's pork my mom stewed.

782
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,160
She already made it.

783
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,880
If I didn't take it, she'd be heartbroken.

784
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,480
I know,

785
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,840
but you've been so busy lately.

786
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,160
You need to watch what you eat.

787
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,080
Got it.

788
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,240
Don't worry.

789
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,320
I'm gonna take a shower.

790
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,800
Okay.

791
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,880
You not coming?

792
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,720
I'm doing the dishes.

793
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,560
[Shower time.]

794
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,080
[What]

795
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,640
[is marriage really?]

796
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,280
Maybe you can only answer that question

797
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,320
when you've lived through it all.

798
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,600
Right now, when

799
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,520
negative emotions come flooding in,

800
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,600
I don't know what to do either.

801
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,240
Sometimes I just feel

802
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,480
really tired.

803
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,080
But I've

804
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,440
had truly joyful

805
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,800
moments in my marriage too.

806
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,040
How can marriage be all sweet

807
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,160
with no bitter?

808
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,320
That wouldn't be fair either.

809
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,760
So arguing is normal.

810
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,680
No, I'll pass on the drink, Mr. Lin.

811
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,000
Come on, have some.

812
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,520
I told you that you're

813
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,760
the best

814
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,240
streamer I've ever seen.

815
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,560
I'm flattered.

816
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,440
You've already

817
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,520
figured out your character.

818
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,000
I actually didn't want to

819
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,280
be the bitter wife.

820
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,080
I wasn't trying to

821
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,440
trash-talk my husband.

822
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,720
I'm not asking you to.

823
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,760
You're better as the independent woman type.

824
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,480
Didn't you say

825
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,080
since I'm married,

826
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,520
that image doesn't really work?

827
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,880
Get a divorce then.

828
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,560
Divorce is

829
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,040
a huge boost for female streamers.

830
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,000
[No, wait, Mr. Lin.]

831
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,560
Something just

832
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,000
happened yesterday

833
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,840
and I vented a bit.

834
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,520
We're nowhere near divorce.

835
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,840
Ran,

836
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,920
did you see how hyped everyone was

837
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,480
in the comment section?

838
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,000
[Queen on her own.]

839
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,400
Queen on her own.

840
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,240
You're the chosen divorce icon.

841
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,680
Don't waste this opportunity.

842
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,840
I'll think about it.

843
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,840
When are you divorcing that freeloader guy?

844
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,400
Why do you

845
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,760
all want me to get divorced?

846
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,240
Can't you wish me something good?

847
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,200
Let's drop it.

848
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,000
Wow,

849
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,240
you're settling in pretty fast.

850
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,800
Your dad got me this job.

851
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,360
How could I not work hard?

852
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,120
Also,

853
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,960
I wasn't

854
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,200
very nice that day.

855
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,920
I never took it to heart anyway.

856
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:05,840
So,

857
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,000
consider this your first wish

858
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,840
granted.

859
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:08,800
It's nothing.

860
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,160
I made the decision for you

861
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,360
without asking.

862
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,440
Just think of me

863
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,640
as your genie from the lamp.

864
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,880
Have you seen Pirates of the Caribbean?

865
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,400
The Black Pearl

866
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,440
has a monkey, right?

867
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,200
Let's get a boat.

868
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,600
Deal, that's wish number two then.

869
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,200
Right, and a monkey too.

870
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,880
You actually got a boat?

871
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,080
Impressed?

872
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,720
Yeah.

873
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,080
Where'd you get it?

874
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,560
Found it by the beach.

875
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,240
There are many

876
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,680
abandoned boats there.

877
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,520
You really are a genie?

878
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,960
You just figured it out?

879
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,200
Don't tell anyone,

880
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,240
or they'll all come asking for favors.

881
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,920
I just want you to

882
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,280
open yourself up

883
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,760
to the world.

884
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,280
[Don't shut yourself away.]

885
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,640
[It's so unfair to yourself.]

886
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,680
[And no more night shifts now.]

887
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
We can help out

888
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,880
at Xinying's restaurant more often.

889
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,320
What I said earlier, I meant it.

890
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,280
I don't buy it.

891
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,280
[Tomorrow, get those ingredients...]

892
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,000
Don't lie to me.

893
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,040
I can tell.

894
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,679
Bye.

895
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,400
Bye.

896
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,800
Happy?

897
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,840
Good work today.

898
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,280
Thanks, bye.

899
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,280
Happy's such a good boy.

900
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,480
So many customers

901
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,560
[loved him today.]

902
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,760
So cute.

903
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,280
Xinying,

904
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,360
why don't you keep Happy?

905
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,320
Okay?

906
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,960
As a store mascot?

907
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,159
He brings you

908
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,120
customers.

909
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,640
[Kaiyang can drop him off]

910
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,960
[on his way]

911
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,120
[to work]

912
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,080
[and pick]

913
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,560
[him up after.]

914
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,160
Wanna stay here, Happy?

915
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,280
[Do you like me?]

916
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,600
[Do you?]

917
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,920
[Get him a girlfriend.]

918
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,200
Look, he's smiling.

919
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,360
He likes me.

920
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,760
Okay, you're staying.

921
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,200
From now on

922
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,240
you'll be here with me,

923
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,960
okay?

924
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,640
Your dad will

925
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,760
visit after work.

926
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
I heard that.

927
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,320
[So he's staying here then.]

928
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,200
If you're free on weekends,

929
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,360
come help me out.

930
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,800
What's the hesitation?

931
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,440
For free? We're busy on weekends.

932
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,680
I'll make you deluxe staff meals.

933
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,360
How's that?

934
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,560
We work all week

935
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,480
and do chores for you on weekends,

936
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,720
just for malatang?

937
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,240
You're ruthless.

938
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,080
Take it or leave it.

939
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,560
We're happy to help.

940
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,360
[Right, Kaiyang?]

941
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,840
[Even if it's for free.]

942
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,280
[Stop feeding him that stuff.]

943
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,840
He won't even touch his dog food later.

944
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,640
Happy's been pulling in

945
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,800
customers for me

946
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,480
and making me money.

947
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,440
[That's a reward for him.]

948
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,480
Go eat.

949
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,560
Business is booming, huh?

950
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:25,960
How does it feel?

951
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
Dreams come true.

952
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,160
Entering

953
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,560
the food business.

954
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,360
How do you feel?

955
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,200
It really feels like a dream.

956
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,920
When I think

957
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,440
about our time in Canada,

958
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,400
[it feels like a past life.]

959
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,160
I spent so much money

960
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,280
in Canada on those props

961
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,240
and that LED screen.

962
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,960
[Basically throwing money at a dream,]

963
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,360
just to bring everyone together.

964
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,560
Now it feels kinda stupid.

965
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,640
[It's not stupid.]

966
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,320
[Dreams can't be]

967
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,320
[measured in money.]

968
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,200
You did the right thing,

969
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,120
though our dreams

970
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,480
back then were kind of naïve.

971
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,840
Do you remember?

972
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,960
[I was totally lost.]

973
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,240
[That's your line.]

974
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,080
[I didn't even know where I was]

975
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,400
[or where I was headed.]

976
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,720
Remember? That poor Mr. Liang

977
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,800
was acting

978
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,480
out the scene with you.

979
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,520
And Chen Xi

980
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,720
holding that huge prop rock.

981
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,200
So funny.

982
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,280
And that line.

983
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,680
I know this can't be changed

984
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,200
[and fate is inevitable.]

985
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,240
[I supported you, Kaiyang.]

986
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,120
[You were right.]

987
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:33,800
[There was a time]

988
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,920
[when I was desperate to see the stars.]

989
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,040
So I bought a ticket to

990
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,960
New Zealand and stayed there

991
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,840
for two months.

992
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,040
[That night sky was unreal.]

993
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,880
It felt like the stars

994
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,720
were right in front of you,

995
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,120
So bright and so dense.

996
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,520
It was insanely beautiful.

997
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,680
If there's such a thing

998
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,520
as the Milky Way,

999
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,160
that's exactly what I was looking at.

1000
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,080
That's it.

1001
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
[The Milky Way?]

1002
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,320
Fran, if I had your life,

1003
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:01,920
I'd be

1004
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,640
smiling in my sleep.

1005
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,360
[Flying halfway across the world for stars?]

1006
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,160
That's crazy.

1007
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,120
Once you live that life,

1008
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,880
you'll understand.

1009
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,560
Xinying said

1010
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,360
we ordinary people can't

1011
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,000
understand your luxurious lifestyle.

1012
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,320
Kaiyang, don't copy me.

1013
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:20,920
Stop it.

1014
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,320
Actually, I think

1015
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,320
a lot of

1016
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,680
so-called dreams

1017
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,320
or wishes

1018
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,400
don't really cost money.

1019
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,520
I've seen

1020
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,240
[people online posting sunrise photos]

1021
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,720
[from our Lucheng beach.]

1022
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,680
They look amazing.

1023
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,360
Have you ever watched the sunrise here?

1024
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,280
You?

1025
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,000
[Look,]

1026
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,240
we've watched sunrises in so many places

1027
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,160
around the world, right?

1028
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,880
But never once in our own hometown.

1029
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,520
That just feels wrong.

1030
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,440
I'll go watch it with you.

1031
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:00,960
Let's go then.

1032
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,040
Let's go.

1033
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,480
Come on, get up.

1034
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,320
Legs up.

1035
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,720
Move, you two.

1036
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,680
Move.

1037
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
Go.

1038
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
The chair has me trapped.

1039
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,280
Kaiyang, slow down.

1040
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
Ride faster.

1041
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840
Catch up to him, Fran.

1042
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,040
Avenge me.

1043
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,000
I passed you.

1044
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,520
I think the internet photos

1045
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,400
totally lied to me.

1046
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,320
The photos didn't look like this.

1047
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,440
It's pitch dark here.

1048
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,800
The rocks are hard as hell.

1049
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,920
If the sunrise isn't spectacular,

1050
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,000
I'll feel bad for dragging you here.

1051
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,480
Don't say that.

1052
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,560
[Listen,]

1053
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,360
[there was a writer]

1054
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
[who once said that life isn't]

1055
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,840
[measured in]

1056
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,400
years, months, or days,

1057
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,840
but in a handful of moments.

1058
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,160
[That writer is you,]

1059
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,080
isn't it? So dramatic.

1060
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,440
Shut up.

1061
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,720
Just drink your beer.

1062
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,280
I spent ten years in Canada.

1063
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,680
That makes

1064
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,080
up almost half

1065
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,680
my life.

1066
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,240
But how many moments are there really?

1067
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,880
I left Lucheng when I was young too.

1068
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,200
So I never felt much attachment to this city.

1069
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,480
Sometimes

1070
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,960
I see celebrity interviews where

1071
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,760
they talk about their deep love

1072
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,160
[for their hometowns,]

1073
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,800
[and I just couldn't relate.]

1074
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,720
But coming back this time,

1075
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,360
I'm finally rebuilding

1076
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,240
the connection.

1077
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,800
When did you go abroad?

1078
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,720
I'm not being mysterious.

1079
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,960
I honestly can't quite remember.

1080
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,520
It was so long ago.

1081
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,360
[I went abroad when I was little.]

1082
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,720
You said your time abroad

1083
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,320
takes up half your life,

1084
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,520
but I feel like

1085
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,760
my entire life so far

1086
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,360
has been spent overseas.

1087
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,800
Sabishii.

1088
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,520
Sabishii?

1089
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,480
Sounds like a curse word.

1090
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:48,680
[Kaiyang,]

1091
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,440
[it's Japanese.]

1092
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,120
It means lonely.

1093
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,560
Sabishii.

1094
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,160
Very sabishii.

1095
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:11,840
Cheers.

1096
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,960
Let's toast to ourselves. Come on.

1097
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,840
To destiny!

1098
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,440
To the sunrise!

1099
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,440
When will the sun come up?

1100
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,520
Soon.

1101
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,640
Trust me.

1102
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,280
Keep your eyes on that direction,

1103
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,600
on that mountain.

1104
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,880
Right there.

1105
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,200
It's over there.
