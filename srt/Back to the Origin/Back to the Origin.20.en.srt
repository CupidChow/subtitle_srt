1
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,080
[This time is]

2
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,240
[different from before.]

3
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,520
[You must unleash]

4
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,440
[your potential.]

5
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,759
[My lady.]

6
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,920
[Act natural.]

7
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,039
[Lady Tiger.]

8
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,840
Here you are, honey!

9
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,120
My dear!

10
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,560
I've missed you so much!

11
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,000
Look at you.

12
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,280
How skinny you are!

13
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,560
Don't tease me!

14
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,880
I love you too much

15
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,720
to ever tease you!

16
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,800
I tell you...

17
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,080
She looks a bit fatter on camera.

18
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,919
I don't think so.

19
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,199
She's not that fat.

20
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,560
That's not a lunch box.

21
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,520
That's a rice barrel!

22
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,120
You're so clumsy with words!

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,360
I'll send my assistant

24
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,160
over to you tomorrow.

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,960
It's a deal.

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,680
Deal.

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,200
Sorry.

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,000
It's okay.

29
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,600
Alright?

30
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,720
Do you remember Miss Lan

31
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,120
who just won Best Actress?

32
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,600
Days ago,

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,640
I met her on an event.

34
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,640
Her figure

35
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,920
is the result of relentless dieting.

36
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,440
I saw her savoring

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,520
every single leaf of lettuce.

38
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,160
My gosh!

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,240
Don't follow her example!

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,560
That's not your style

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,560
and bad for your health.

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,079
Alright. Let me introduce.

43
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,920
Come here.

44
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,800
I'm Zhang Ran. Nice to meet you.

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,600
Nice to meet you.

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,120
My entire family are your fans.

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,960
My parents watch

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
your videos every day.

49
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,400
They follow your daily meal plan.

50
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,840
You're always making them laugh.

51
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,920
Thank you! Your

52
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,920
entire family

53
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:49,960
are my bread and butter.

54
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,800
You're making me blush.

55
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,560
Just let yourself go

56
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,880
during acting.

57
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,960
Don't be nervous.

58
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:55,880
Okay.

59
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,400
We'll go get ready.

60
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,600
Wait. I'll introduce

61
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,480
you to the director.

62
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,720
His videos have all gone viral.

63
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,880
Director.

64
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,680
Nice to meet you.

65
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,640
We've met before.

66
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,880
Ten years ago.

67
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,400
I remember you.

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,840
Ran, it's the director.

69
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,800
Handshake!

70
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,440
Okay.

71
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,960
You're Mr. Yu, right?

72
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,960
Yes.

73
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,360
Director.

74
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,640
Nice to meet you.

75
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,600
We'll go get ready.

76
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,320
Go get changed.

77
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:21,920
See you in a bit.

78
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,040
Okay, see you.

79
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,000
See what she got?

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,200
That's way too much!

81
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,920
I believe you can do it.

82
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,600
I can't!

83
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,800
You can. I believe you.

84
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,079
I'm going to persuade her.

85
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,480
Then you'll have to do that too.

86
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,720
Director!

87
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,800
Wipe on my sleeve, Ran.

88
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,240
Come on.

89
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,360
Is this rainproof fabric?

90
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,680
Then wipe on here.

91
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,200
Bo.

92
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,960
Is anyone outside?

93
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,280
Yes.

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,720
Me.

95
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,200
What?

96
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,600
Is this going to work?

97
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,280
I can't believe it.

98
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:04,960
Well...

99
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,360
What?

100
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,480
Ran.

101
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,560
What do you think?

102
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,240
To be honest, Ran.

103
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,120
I don't know whether it's going to work,

104
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,120
but I can tell

105
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,040
that you're working hard.

106
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,720
Really.

107
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,880
Shut up.

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,320
I'd ruin my reputation.

109
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,080
Ran, hurry.

110
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,960
Come over here!

111
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,200
Have you memorized

112
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,960
all the dance moves?

113
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,480
Yes.

114
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,240
Okay.

115
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,360
The four of us

116
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,640
have identical figures.

117
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,040
As long as we move in unison,

118
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,000
they'll think we're the same.

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,040
Come a little closer.

120
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,760
No one will notice the difference.

121
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,360
Let's practice it again.

122
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,200
Come and sit.

123
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,400
You can do it. Ready.

124
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,880
Girls, stick your heads out!

125
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,080
Royal Laundry!

126
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,720
Follow the beat!

127
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,360
Wash it!

128
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,120
Harder!

129
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,640
Harder!

130
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,200
Faster!

131
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:50,840
Come on!

132
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,360
[Hello, hello.]

133
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,360
[Test. One, two.]

134
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,280
[Hello, everybody.]

135
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,760
[Welcome to]

136
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,840
[Today's Financial Interview.]

137
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
[I'm the host, Zhang Ran.]

138
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,800
[Life seems to happen unexpectedly.]

139
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,000
[I thought I would be an interpreter.]

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,680
[But now,]

141
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
[I am a host instead.]

142
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,520
Over there!

143
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,960
Why does Ran's dancing

144
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,880
look so pitiful?

145
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,360
No.

146
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,720
You don't know her.

147
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,040
Really?

148
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,320
[Come on!]

149
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,320
[Follow me! Royal Laundry!]

150
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,760
[Go!]

151
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,880
I knew you have talent.

152
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,720
Lady Tiger's team

153
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,040
spoke highly of Zhang Ran.

154
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,440
They want to work with her again.

155
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,640
I went out on a limb to sign you.

156
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
I knew you

157
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
wouldn't let me down.

158
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,920
Look at

159
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,800
this rising data.

160
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,880
Faster than anyone else in the company.

161
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,080
All thanks to both of you.

162
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,440
I never imagined it

163
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,520
would come to this.

164
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,880
It's a lucky accident.

165
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,720
I will keep working hard.

166
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,600
Anran.

167
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:39,960
Guys.

168
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,000
Have a seat.

169
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,320
Anran. Please have a seat.

170
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,360
I'm fine.

171
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,640
Congratulations!

172
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,159
Thank you.

173
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,640
You've become an overnight sensation!

174
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,159
Everyone is talking about you.

175
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:49,800
Congratulations!

176
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,159
Thank you for your encouragement.

177
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,400
This one is for

178
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:53,960
Mr. Lin.

179
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
I've had it.

180
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,640
Here.

181
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,080
Ladies first.

182
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,480
Great!

183
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,040
Anran.

184
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,520
Lady Tiger intends to continue

185
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,080
collaborating with Zhang Ran.

186
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,480
You've got to work harder.

187
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,280
That's silly.

188
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,280
That's cute.

189
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,440
Since everyone's here,

190
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,400
I'll say a few words.

191
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,160
Okay.

192
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,080
Zhang Ran's success also

193
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,120
represents an exploration

194
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,200
in collaboration for our company.

195
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,960
This exploration

196
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,240
proved to be quite effective.

197
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,640
We will press ahead.

198
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,200
This isn't my first

199
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,520
venture into entrepreneurship,

200
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
but it's the one

201
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,280
where I've given it my absolute all.

202
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,560
Why?

203
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,360
Because this endeavor

204
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,800
is so meaningful.

205
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,480
It brings joy to the people.

206
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,360
It's very important.

207
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,080
With more effort from you,

208
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,600
the world will have more joy

209
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
and less sorrow

210
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,000
for the families.

211
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,680
We are not

212
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,920
merely fulfilling

213
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,640
company KPIs.

214
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,640
We are cultivating ourselves.

215
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,760
[Only after this job did I realize]

216
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,680
[how much work there is]

217
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,240
[at an overseas education agency.]

218
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,640
[Though it's tough at first,]

219
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
[it's also]

220
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,120
[fulfilling.]

221
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,720
[All I want now is to]

222
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,440
[have my own...]

223
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,040
[...have my own client.]

224
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,360
[Then I'd get a commission.]

225
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:53,920
[I'll]

226
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,000
[treat you to malatang then.]

227
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:02,960
Hello?

228
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,880
[Hello, Kaiyang.]

229
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,520
[I'm Yu.]

230
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,680
[I apologize for my]

231
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,480
[attitude last time.]

232
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,960
[We've heard]

233
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,680
[about your family.]

234
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,680
[Please take care.]

235
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,120
[Look,]

236
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,640
[I just met a guy who could]

237
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,280
[be a big help to your family.]

238
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
[You must come meet him.]

239
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,400
[I'll send the address.]

240
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,160
[See you.]

241
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,600
Hello, sir.

242
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,280
Hello.

243
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,160
Who are you looking for?

244
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,720
Have you clocked out for the day?

245
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,400
No.

246
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,760
I'm still on duty.

247
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,360
I'm here to consult about

248
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,720
my child's study abroad options.

249
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,960
People say you're

250
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,640
the best agency

251
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,440
in Lucheng City.

252
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,920
I'm here to ask for advice.

253
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,680
I see.

254
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,400
I'm the consultant.

255
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,520
You can come to me

256
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,320
if you need anything.

257
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,520
I'm Lu.

258
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,480
That's great!

259
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,720
Thank you.

260
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,640
I'm Gu.

261
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,200
[I've read the contract.]

262
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,400
[I'm okay with it.]

263
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,720
[I'll go with the most expensive]

264
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,480
[all-inclusive package.]

265
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,880
[Just take care]

266
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,040
[of everything for my child.]

267
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,800
[And,]

268
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,520
[the application deadline is approaching.]

269
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,160
[Please hurry up.]

270
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,960
Okay, no problem.

271
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,480
Mr. Gu.

272
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,840
I'll find you the best

273
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,440
consultant tomorrow.

274
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,760
[No need.]

275
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,600
[You can work on it.]

276
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,160
[You must be responsible]

277
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,960
[to work this late.]

278
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,680
[I choose you.]

279
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,840
Okay.

280
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,880
I can do it, Mr. Gu.

281
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,400
[Alright then.]

282
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,080
Tomorrow, I...

283
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,240
I've brought you drinks.

284
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,800
Thank you so much.

285
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,960
You're all sweaty from the rush.

286
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,240
How's the setup here?

287
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,240
Pretty good?

288
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,120
Yeah?

289
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,200
It's going to rain.

290
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,800
Let's get

291
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,840
down to business.

292
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,280
Don't be in such a hurry.

293
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,840
Let me make the introductions.

294
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,040
Bro.

295
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,800
Kaiyang.

296
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,040
And this is Sis.

297
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,000
Kaiyang.

298
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,960
Tonight, your problem

299
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,360
will be taken care of.

300
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,040
If there's nothing else, I'll leave then.

301
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,520
Kaiyang, I need to talk to you.

302
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,680
I fished

303
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,040
here all day and didn't

304
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,560
catch a single fish.

305
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,240
The boss said I'm not skilled enough.

306
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,120
I wasn't happy about it.

307
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:28,960
Kaiyang.

308
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,440
If the fish didn't behave,

309
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,640
we must discipline it.

310
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,840
The same goes for a person.

311
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,720
Yeah?

312
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,440
I've got things to do.

313
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,480
Kaiyang.

314
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,800
If you're still my friend,

315
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
you've got to help me out.

316
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,320
You won't have come in vain.

317
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,400
You will be rewarded.

318
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,560
I've got this fish up here.

319
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,600
Boom!

320
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,200
How about it?

321
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,440
I've already resolved most of it.

322
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,880
But the more I think, the angrier I get.

323
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,000
This place

324
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,240
must be burned down today.

325
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,560
Give us a hand.

326
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,360
Yu.

327
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,560
What are you doing?

328
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,880
Don't be a coward.

329
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,560
I won't shortchange you on money.

330
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,240
80,000 yuan.

331
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,760
Or I'll make it 88,000?

332
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,440
What are you doing?

333
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,640
Just take it!

334
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,040
Take it!

335
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,960
Do nothing but take it!

336
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,680
It's worth 88,000 yuan!

337
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,440
Leave the rest of the work to me!

338
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,760
Kaiyang!

339
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,440
Kaiyang!

340
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,880
Kaiyang!

341
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,960
Kaiyang!

342
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,320
Kaiyang!

343
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,840
Kaiyang!

344
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,880
Call the police!

345
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
Run! This way!

346
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,480
Stop there!

347
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,240
What did you do?

348
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,160
Get them!

349
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,120
Get them! Call the police!

350
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,160
It's not me!

351
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,280
We saw you!

352
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,960
Liar!

353
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,720
Hold him down! Call the police!

354
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,160
Stop!

355
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,880
Don't let them get away!

356
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,840
Stop!

357
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,200
Have you caught the rest of them?

358
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,320
Yes.

359
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,480
Pal.

360
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,000
What have you done?

361
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,600
Go ahead and tell me about it.

362
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,800
Ge Kaiyang.

363
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,120
How about now?

364
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,520
If you remember,

365
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,520
tell me about your family

366
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,640
and your address.

367
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,640
I checked it.

368
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,760
His parents are imprisoned

369
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,680
for illegal fundraising.

370
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,320
Do you have any other

371
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,400
relatives to help you?

372
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,320
Only a dog remains.

373
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,320
If I were to stay here,

374
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,360
I'm afraid it would

375
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,400
starve to death.

376
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,800
You won't be able

377
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,400
to go out anytime soon.

378
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,680
It'll take at least 15 days.

379
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,480
Is your dog at your

380
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,760
registered address?

381
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,920
Alright.

382
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,040
We'll ask the neighborhood

383
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,680
committee for help.

384
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,680
Go back to your seat.

385
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,280
This big client of yours is really great.

386
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,240
I hear this rich man

387
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,360
doesn't have any

388
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,040
complicated demands.

389
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,600
Whatever you say goes.

390
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,480
Great.

391
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,200
He's just in a hurry.

392
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,920
The application

393
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,200
deadline is approaching.

394
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,720
He just wants to spend money

395
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,880
to get his daughter

396
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,960
a degree abroad.

397
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,960
He doesn't care about school rankings.

398
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,960
How enviable!

399
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,880
He doesn't care about rankings

400
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,320
and doesn't skimp on tuition.

401
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,800
You are free to choose

402
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,000
any school and apply it.

403
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,040
When will I ever get

404
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,360
such easy work?

405
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,480
I didn't treat it easily.

406
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,400
I've applied to

407
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,880
over twenty schools and

408
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,280
prepared materials every night.

409
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,160
I'm exhausted.

410
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,680
Over twenty?

411
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,800
Are you done yet?

412
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,720
Yes.

413
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,720
They've been submitted.

414
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,240
You're good!

415
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,200
You're sure to

416
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,280
get this month's bonus.

417
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,320
Treat me to a meal?

418
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,520
Okay.

419
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,560
How about malatang?

420
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,119
Malatang doesn't

421
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,240
match your bonus.

422
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,280
Something fancier.

423
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,920
Don't look down on malatang!

424
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,359
I want something fancy!

425
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,560
Don't push your luck!

426
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,240
Lu Xinying!

427
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,280
Yes?

428
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,880
The boss is looking for you.

429
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,680
Why is she looking for me?

430
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,440
Is she giving you a bonus?

431
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,920
I'll go take a look.

432
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,760
See you.

433
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,119
Good luck.

434
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,520
Okay.

435
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,200
Mr. Gu.

436
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,800
Finally.

437
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,440
See for yourself.

438
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,560
And these.

439
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,440
These are

440
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,960
the materials I prepared for Beibei.

441
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,560
Is there a problem?

442
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,200
So you know

443
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,000
they're application materials.

444
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,560
What's wrong?

445
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,000
I'll tell you what's wrong.

446
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,600
Check this.

447
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,280
And this.

448
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,440
Are they the same?

449
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,160
This is the template

450
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
I sent her.

451
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,120
I told her she needed

452
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,880
to change

453
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,000
the school's name to

454
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,920
the one she was

455
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,600
applying to before submitting.

456
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,320
You told her?

457
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,040
Yes, I told her.

458
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,240
Look, I've told her

459
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,800
both in the group chat

460
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,600
and via email.

461
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
I don't care.

462
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,760
Look,

463
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,880
I made it

464
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,720
perfectly clear

465
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,960
from day one that I needed

466
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,000
someone to handle

467
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,680
everything

468
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,400
from start to finish.

469
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,480
All-Inclusive package,

470
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,000
you know?

471
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,080
Don't you know what it is?

472
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,840
I know.

473
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,320
I had intended to help her

474
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,720
modify the template

475
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,400
and had asked her for

476
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,240
her email password.

477
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,960
But she refused,

478
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
saying it was

479
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,120
her personal privacy.

480
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,920
So I couldn't.

481
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,680
Was she wrong?

482
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,840
It is her personal privacy!

483
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,000
This showed

484
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,040
she's cautious!

485
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,440
Listen.

486
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,640
This concerns

487
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,360
my daughter's future.

488
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,800
If I don't get

489
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,920
an explanation, your agency

490
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,560
won't be able to operate.

491
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,800
Mr. Gu.

492
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,120
We'll give you a

493
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,160
satisfactory response today.

494
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,880
[Xinying, stop making excuses.]

495
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,280
[In any case,]

496
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,160
[you have already had]

497
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,320
[an impact on our company.]

498
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,080
[If it weren't for the fact]

499
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,800
[that you're broke]

500
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,240
[but diligent at work,]

501
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,160
[I'd make you pay for all]

502
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,440
[the damages and fire you.]

503
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,760
[I've decided with HR]

504
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
[to withhold your salary]

505
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,400
[and bonus for this month.]

506
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,720
[You really need to work twice as hard]

507
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,280
[to repay me]

508
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,280
[and the company.]

509
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,280
Yes?

510
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:39,960
Aiying.

511
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,280
I just dreamed

512
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,320
about you last night.

513
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,880
Really?

514
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,520
Yeah.

515
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,560
That's sister connection.

516
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,120
What would you like for dinner?

517
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,760
I'll cook it for you.

518
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,240
You know nothing about cooking.

519
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,600
Let me cook for you.

520
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,920
Is there something you want from me?

521
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,640
I'm ok.

522
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,760
Your face says it all.

523
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,240
I'm fine.

524
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,000
I just miss you.

525
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,280
Did Lu Ming upset you?

526
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,800
Then it must be Lu Xinying.

527
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,240
Don't mention those two to me.

528
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,960
None of them are any good.

529
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,120
If you have something to say, spit it out.

530
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,000
Don't keep me waiting.

531
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,840
Lu Xinying

532
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,560
is back.

533
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,240
I thought it was something big.

534
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,760
She misses you.

535
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,480
That's not true.

536
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,080
She had a perfectly good

537
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,880
bank job in Canada

538
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,680
and she just dropped it and came back.

539
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,920
And she didn't just return today.

540
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,640
She's been back for a while now.

541
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Lu Ming even knows about it.

542
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,120
The two of them are in cahoots,

543
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,320
keeping it from me all along.

544
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,160
What kind of father is this?

545
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,760
He has no sense of right or wrong.

546
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,880
He told me it was fine

547
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,960
that she could

548
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,800
find a decent job.

549
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,880
I'm open

550
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,680
to hearing their thoughts.

551
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,400
They stood before me,

552
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
painting a grand picture of the future,

553
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,040
and I actually bought into it.

554
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,480
It almost felt like

555
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,200
having them around was nice

556
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,600
and the job seemed respectable enough.

557
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,840
Then at least put in some effort.

558
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,080
She just started and she's already taking leave.

559
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,600
I said, Ying

560
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,560
how could you do this?

561
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,800
You just started this job.

562
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,880
You should at least try to make a good impression.

563
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,680
How can you just take leave like that?

564
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,600
You're sick or not feeling well?

565
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,880
She tells me a friend has something going on.

566
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,680
I ask, what friend?

567
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,080
A friend

568
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,800
who's not even close.

569
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,200
Same.

570
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,000
Zhang Ran is no different.

571
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,040
Getting married on a whim

572
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,000
then poof, she's gone.

573
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,560
And then she just got divorced out of nowhere.

574
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,240
I haven't even processed it yet,

575
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,480
and she remarried.

576
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,560
And I'm always the last one

577
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,720
to be informed.

578
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,040
The two daughters we have...

579
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,400
But,

580
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,680
I think Zhang Ran

581
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,120
is better

582
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,600
than Lu Xinying.

583
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,240
She's more mature.

584
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,600
Aiying,

585
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,680
you have to do me a favor.

586
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,920
Please talk to Zhang Ran for me.

587
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,240
Get her

588
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,720
to sort things out

589
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,640
with Lu Xinying.

590
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,600
They are easier to communicate with.

591
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,920
I just can't figure out

592
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,720
what Lu Xinying

593
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,080
is thinking right now.

594
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,600
Fine.

595
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,720
I'm feeling really anxious.

596
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,840
Let me tell you.

597
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:55,840
Look at this.

598
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,360
See?

599
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,320
Look at all this hair falling out.

600
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,160
Fine.

601
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,560
Just stop worrying about it.

602
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,240
I haven't been sleeping at all.

603
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,880
But you not sleeping won't help.

604
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,040
Alright,

605
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,400
I'll have Zhang Ran talk to her.

606
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,640
Let's see what she's really thinking.

607
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
You know you mom sent me here.

608
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,880
I figured.

609
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,800
Have some coffee.

610
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,440
I don't usually drink coffee.

611
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,800
I can't sleep if I drink it.

612
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,280
Oh, you don't drink coffee.

613
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,840
I... I don't know.

614
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,880
It's fine.

615
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,680
Wrong place.

616
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,160
Our relationship

617
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,000
isn't very close.

618
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,920
It's really beautiful here.

619
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,680
Sitting for a while is quite nice.

620
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,240
Xinying...

621
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,040
I...

622
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,560
I actually feel quite guilty towards you.

623
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,840
After being in Canada for so long,

624
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,360
I haven't really looked after you much.

625
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,280
And I'm not trying to make excuses

626
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,160
for myself.

627
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,640
I actually

628
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,480
couldn't really help much at the time.

629
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
You're overthinking it, Ran.

630
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,640
I have

631
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
no idea why,

632
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,600
but I just woke up

633
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,960
in Canada.

634
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,840
I don't like it there either.

635
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,040
My mom just thinks

636
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,600
staying in Canada

637
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,280
is a success in itself.

638
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,840
That way, she herself would be successful.

639
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,840
I just wanted to make her happy,

640
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
so I did many things

641
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,520
that I never liked doing,

642
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,440
that I never wanted to do.

643
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,400
Then I thought

644
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,360
I should live for myself this life.

645
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,400
Ran, are you doing okay over there?

646
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,520
Back then,

647
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,680
why did you want to go to Canada?

648
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,000
I...

649
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,320
I guess because of my dream.

650
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,400
I majored in English, right?

651
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
Back then,

652
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,680
I was doing pretty well.

653
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,520
I became a host.

654
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,760
I felt like

655
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,560
all the doors

656
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,800
were open to me.

657
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,440
I just thought

658
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,080
what if I could go abroad?

659
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,160
I just gave it a try.

660
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,760
You know sometimes

661
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
the choices people make...

662
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,880
When you have to choose a path,

663
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,920
you get this feeling.

664
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,480
You feel like

665
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,840
this path was laid just for you.

666
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,520
And you just went for it

667
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,280
without a second thought.

668
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,640
But, after all the twists

669
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,760
and turns,

670
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,480
you realize

671
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,760
that sometimes what you lose

672
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,440
might be far more

673
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,360
than what you gain.

674
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,560
Right.

675
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,800
Well,

676
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,640
I wound up

677
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,840
back here anyway.

678
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,040
Actually, when I was little,

679
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,000
my mother had high hopes for me.

680
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,240
Making me learn this and that.

681
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,600
But after I grew up,

682
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,960
I didn't meet their expectations.

683
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,120
I failed.

684
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,480
I embarrassed her.

685
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,960
This is my mother's value system.

686
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,800
This is just how my mother is.

687
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,280
She thinks that's the only version of me

688
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,400
that qualifies as success.

689
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,320
It's been like this since I was a child.

690
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,440
We are completely at odds with each other.

691
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,080
Are you low-key talking about me?

692
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,480
Is there a possibility that

693
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,400
her original intention

694
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,440
was actually for your own good?

695
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,560
Of course, there's a generation gap.

696
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,840
People from their era

697
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,000
do believe it's for your benefit.

698
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,960
But from my own reflection,

699
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,120
I think in this life

700
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,120
you should do the things you want to do

701
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,640
with all your might.

702
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,920
Give it one last push.

703
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,120
If it doesn't work out, forget it.

704
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,800
Ran, how's your push going?

705
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,520
I'm being a clown right now.

706
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,440
Didn't you watch my livestream?

707
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,000
I did.

708
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,240
I don't think you're a clown.

709
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,960
I believe

710
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,520
hard work pays off.

711
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,720
And you?

712
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,680
What exactly are you doing now?

713
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,680
I'm at a study abroad agency.

714
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,920
Sales?

715
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,600
That's right.

716
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,560
Sales is pretty tough.

717
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,800
But I chose it myself.

718
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,200
[It's been years]

719
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,600
[since we had]

720
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,280
[a meal together.]

721
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,640
Welcome home, Xinying.

722
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,480
Come on.

723
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,560
Let's eat.

724
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,120
Here.

725
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,760
Thanks, Dad.

726
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,800
Here.

727
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,000
Let me say a few words.

728
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,720
Ying, you're grown up now.

729
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,440
Actually, Mom has been thinking

730
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,080
about these words for many days.

731
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,480
I want to say...

732
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,960
I need to adjust myself as well.

733
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,360
I might have given you

734
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,120
too little encouragement before.

735
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,800
But everything I do

736
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,000
is definitely for your own good.

737
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,200
Mom loves you most.

738
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
You know that, right, baby?

739
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,440
Dad knows me well.

740
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,240
My bark is worse than my bite.

741
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,920
Mom can make mistakes too.

742
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,400
Sometimes I might

743
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,160
hurt your feelings.

744
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,840
I've thought it over carefully.

745
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,360
If I do something wrong in the future,

746
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,240
you need

747
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,120
to tell me,

748
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,200
okay?

749
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,200
And then,

750
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,160
I want to say I'm sorry.

751
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,440
I'll change from now on.

752
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,560
Mom.

753
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,080
Mom,

754
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,840
I'm sorry.

755
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,480
I shouldn't have been so willful

756
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,240
and argued with you.

757
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,560
Then I shouldn't always make you angry.

758
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,040
I'll change in the future.

759
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,720
Come on, eat.

760
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,200
Mom, hurry up.

761
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Eat this fish tofu.

762
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,280
Mom, you eat some too.

763
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,120
Xinying, you love eating this,

764
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,040
but you still need to

765
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,640
cut back on spicy food.

766
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,360
Alright.

767
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,160
Eat less spicy food.

768
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,240
Cool down your temper.

769
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,160
No, I'm not angry at all.

770
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,960
I'm actually quite happy now.

771
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,200
Is this not cooked properly?

772
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,320
Then put it back in.

773
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,120
Raw food cools me down.

774
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,480
Here's a cooked one for you.

775
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,400
Okay, okay.

776
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,880
Dad got a little emotional today,

777
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,800
so he can handle spicy food.

778
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,280
I'm just overjoyed.

779
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,240
Watching you two being so sentimental,

780
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,000
I don't even know what to say.

781
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,280
You're just here enjoying the show.

782
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,800
Hurry up and eat.

783
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,840
Shut your mouth.

784
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,680
Alright.

785
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,520
Here's what I'm thinking.

786
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,480
Now that our daughter's back...

787
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,080
More words?

788
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,240
It's good to be back.

789
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,760
Now you can stay home every day,

790
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,280
eat well and sleep well,

791
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,720
then call up your friends

792
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,440
and head out,

793
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,680
hit some restaurants,

794
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,800
watch a movie

795
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,920
and just relax.

796
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,640
Then if you have anything to say,

797
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,120
you can talk to me anytime.

798
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,200
We'll sort things out together

799
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,400
after you return to Canada

800
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,240
about how to move forward in the future.

801
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,280
For example,

802
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,000
if you tell me

803
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,200
you don't want to work at the bank,

804
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,080
I think that's fine too.

805
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,240
We don't necessarily have to

806
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,880
work at a bank.

807
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,680
just because we studied finance.

808
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,160
Let's say, if you want to continue your studies

809
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,240
and take the postgraduate exam,

810
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,520
we will support you.

811
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,000
Yes.

812
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,960
You won't feel any pressure.

813
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,000
Why don't you eat something first?

814
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,880
All you think about is eating.

815
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,200
Can you stop interrupting me?

816
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,040
And you've grown up now.

817
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,280
If you told me,

818
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,840
"Mom, I want to get married.

819
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,760
I want to be in a relationship."

820
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,600
What's going on here?

821
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,960
I'm an open-minded mom.

822
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,400
What are you up to today?

823
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,840
I'm a woman too.

824
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,560
I've been your age before.

825
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,840
I can share the lessons

826
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,920
I learned

827
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,720
with you.

828
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,920
Wait, what lessons?

829
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,200
The lessons I learned from you.

830
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,160
You have no self-awareness.

831
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,080
Listen, Xinying.

832
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,040
Listen to me.

833
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,400
No matter what,

834
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,160
you need to find someone locally

835
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,640
who's respectable

836
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,280
with status and position

837
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,240
and at least has a stable income.

838
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,680
Where are you even going with this?

839
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,600
You own a place over there.

840
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,320
So if you marry into that family,

841
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,920
you can stand tall.

842
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,360
Of course,

843
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,520
you can have your own thoughts too.

844
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
Just tell me.

845
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,680
I'll try to see things from your perspective,

846
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,200
okay?

847
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,520
What do you think?

848
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,880
My work visa

849
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,240
has run into some issues.

850
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,280
The visa issue is nothing.

851
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,080
Just a

852
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,520
man-made problem.

853
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,560
I'll handle it for you.

854
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,720
I'll smoothly

855
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,880
send you back.

856
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,600
Mom,

857
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,120
this isn't that simple.

858
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,400
When my work visa was about to expire,

859
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,240
my job was gone.

860
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,840
So, to transfer my immigration status,

861
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,040
I hired a lawyer,

862
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,080
and I got a personal guarantee,

863
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,080
which was somewhat illegal to begin with.

864
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,760
Then the guarantor ran into trouble

865
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,560
and I got put on

866
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,960
the list of untrustworthy individuals.

867
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,720
So,

868
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,440
I'm being deported immediately

869
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,040
and can never go back to Canada again.

870
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,480
So I can only stay

871
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,080
in the country.

872
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,080
But look,

873
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,560
I haven't been slacking off here.

874
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,160
I found a job

875
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,360
and I support myself.

876
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,520
It's been quite fulfilling.

877
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,880
We can still get together often,

878
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,640
right?

879
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,040
Did you know about this?

880
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,000
No.

881
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:55,960
Why didn't

882
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,600
you tell me before?

883
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,200
Something this big,

884
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,080
why didn't you let me know?

885
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,560
Dad, listen.

886
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,480
It's pointless.

887
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,400
It's already happened.

888
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,280
It's already the result now.

889
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,679
Acting, huh?

890
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,000
You old liar.

891
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,920
You little liar.

892
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,639
You two teamed up to deceive me,

893
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,159
Right?

894
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,000
What did I lie to you about?

895
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,199
Haven't you lied to me enough?

896
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,239
About her coming back,

897
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,159
I did keep it from you.

898
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,000
But the fact that she can't go back,

899
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,199
I just found out about it myself.

900
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,800
Let me tell you something.

901
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,360
You, in my eyes

902
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,560
have absolutely no credibility.

903
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,719
As for your job,

904
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,000
have you ever told me the truth?

905
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,360
Oh no.

906
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,480
So this isn't over?

907
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,159
Didn't I already

908
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,360
explain this to you before?

909
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,679
I told you

910
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,480
that's because I was afraid you'd worry.

911
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,280
That's why I didn't tell you.

912
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,600
Do you think I'm not upset

913
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,840
about losing my job?

914
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,199
I wanted to talk to someone about it too.

915
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,080
Who could I even talk to?

916
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,199
You go find someone to talk to.

917
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,320
I didn't.

918
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,679
I'm just...

919
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,080
I can only talk to my car.

920
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,600
I make money

921
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,880
to fill that hole.

922
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,840
But the wound inside me

923
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,960
remains unhealed.

924
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,520
You know who can fix it.

925
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,679
Is this ever going to end?

926
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,160
Are you going to bring this up forever?

927
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,560
Dad.

928
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,000
Why do you always mention this?

929
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,160
So angry now?

930
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,040
Can you two stop fighting?

931
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,920
Dad, Mom.

932
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,720
I never would have thought,

933
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,080
after all these years away,

934
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,200
our family would end up like this.

935
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,880
How could you two

936
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,920
end up fighting like this?

937
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,880
Just think about

938
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,600
what's most important

939
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,000
in our family?

940
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,960
I'll take responsibility

941
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,120
for myself.

942
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,960
[Back when I was in Canada,]

943
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,960
[I waited day and night]

944
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,360
longing to return home

945
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,720
to have a meal with my family.

946
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,960
I never imagined

947
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,800
the meal I dreamed of

948
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,560
would end

949
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,000
with my family falling apart.

950
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,600
Don't be too sad about it.

951
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,760
To be honest,

952
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,840
just leave it

953
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,360
for them to solve.

954
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,560
There's no use worrying about it.

955
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,280
When I was little,

956
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,120
no matter how strict my mom was,

957
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,800
making me practice the piano

958
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,000
day and night,

959
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,920
even making me do homework,

960
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,200
I always knew

961
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,000
she did it for my own good.

962
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,280
I never doubted that.

963
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
How could

964
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,880
our life

965
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,480
become so unhappy?

966
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,160
I suddenly felt

967
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,880
that even family,

968
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,280
the closest of bonds,

969
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,280
can change.

970
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,960
I used to look forward to growing up.

971
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,080
Thinking back, it was so foolish.

972
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,840
[Now that I've grown up, I have to rely on myself.]

973
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,360
[But,]

974
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,200
[when I can only rely on myself,]

975
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,600
[it really hurts.]

976
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,760
Have you lost weight?

977
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,840
Yang, I'm right here.

978
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,200
Yang, looks like you're starving.

979
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
You haven't been in much

980
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,680
so you're not used to it.

981
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,520
Enough talk.

982
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,880
Where's the food I told you to prepare?

983
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,800
Serve it up for Yang.

984
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,000
See?

985
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,800
We haven't forgotten you.

986
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,400
Eat this piece of tofu.

987
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,200
From now on, we'll all

988
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,360
live with a clear conscience.

989
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,520
Eat it.

990
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,400
We stick together.

991
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,760
I'm giving you a way out.

992
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,240
You should

993
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,160
stop doing designated driver.

994
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,400
From now on, work for me.

995
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,560
Be my personal driver.

996
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,120
You won't lose out.

997
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,840
I keep my word.

998
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,920
Seeing how pitiful you are,

999
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,520
we are giving you some money.

1000
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,320
Spend it for now.

1001
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,520
We'll leave it all here.

1002
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,640
Just a token of our goodwill.

1003
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,040
How can you just get up and leave?

1004
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,400
Are you still working as my driver or not?

1005
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,760
Pay the bill.

1006
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,480
[So now,]

1007
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,080
[your biggest life goal]

1008
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,200
[is to throw a stone]

1009
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,800
and make it skip seven times?

1010
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,560
Don't you think that phrase

1011
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,120
sounds philosophical

1012
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,440
coming from you?

1013
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,720
Let me ask you a question.

1014
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,560
When your play is over,

1015
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,680
what are you planning to do?

1016
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,080
Truth or Dare.

1017
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,200
Whoever wins gets to ask.

1018
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,040
Come on.

1019
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,240
Rock, paper, scissors.

1020
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,640
I'm planning to buy a small asteroid.

1021
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,800
Why don't you buy the moon?

1022
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,720
I actually bought an asteroid,

1023
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,560
named after me.

1024
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,240
I thought you were dead.

1025
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,560
I almost died.

1026
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,520
[Kuang Dazhi's personal guarantee]

1027
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,400
[has a problem.]

1028
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,480
My work visa is invalid.

1029
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,840
I'm sorry.

1030
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,480
It's okay. It's all in the past.

1031
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,120
It was just my bad luck.

1032
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,840
It wasn't your bad luck.

1033
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,400
Maybe my misfortune

1034
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:58,960
was passed on to you.

1035
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,320
I was just thinking I'd die.

1036
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,640
What can be filled on that form

1037
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,320
And who would be

1038
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,360
the one to help me fill it out?

1039
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,000
I'll help you collect your debt.

1040
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,680
You still dare to help me?

1041
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,560
Of course.
