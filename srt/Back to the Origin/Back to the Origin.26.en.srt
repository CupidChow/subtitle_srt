1
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:44,759
Lady Wan,

2
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,160
do you think this will work?

3
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,960
I think

4
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
it might.

5
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,880
You sure?

6
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,520
Let me think about it. I need a moment.

7
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,000
It's urgent.

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,960
I think it...

9
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,920
will work.

10
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,040
[Hello, you must be Mr. Li?]

11
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,960
Hello, hello.

12
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,120
I'm the business development manager.

13
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,960
Not at all.

15
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,560
Please sit.

16
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,280
We received the cooperation inquiry

17
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,880
from your business department.

18
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,640
Yes.

19
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,440
We already replied.

20
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,200
I know, I know.

21
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,800
Here's the thing.

22
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,360
I'm the COO

23
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,040
of Dr. Fu.

24
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,720
I personally put together

25
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,840
a company profile

26
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,600
and a proposal.

27
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,560
I was hoping to speak

28
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,360
with Lady Wan

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,880
face-to-face,

30
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,200
to see if there's

31
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,760
a chance we could

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,640
work together.

33
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,360
Ms. Wang, Lady Wan has arrived.

34
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,040
The meeting's about to start.

35
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,720
Got it.

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,520
I see...

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,920
but I have a standing meeting.

38
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,800
Yes, I understand.

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,680
Leave the materials.

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,320
I'll bring them up during the meeting.

41
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,320
Really?

42
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,640
Thank you so much.

43
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,079
Sorry to trouble you.

44
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,640
Thank you, seriously.

45
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,280
On my way here this morning,

46
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,600
my right eyelid kept twitching.

47
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,000
Feels like something's

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,280
gonna go wrong today.

49
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,160
Same here.

50
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,640
Nothing's gone smoothly lately.

51
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,520
Hello, Mr. Fu.

52
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,320
Morning, Mr. Fu.

53
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,280
Morning, sir.

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,400
Mr. Fu spent the night at the office?

55
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah.

56
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,760
Mr. Fu!

57
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,159
My dear Mr. Fu!

58
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,480
Sit, sit. Just sit.

59
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,360
You and Daoqi are truly amazing.

60
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Absolutely incredible work.

61
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,320
You pulled

62
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,840
off the impossible!

63
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,720
If we can partner with Lady Wan,

64
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,600
our product is

65
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,159
already halfway to success.

66
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,440
A round of applause for Mr. Fu!

67
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,680
I just found out about this myself.

68
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,320
Daoqi!

69
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,960
Let's make the applause even louder!

70
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,920
Was this you?

71
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,080
Mr. Li, tell us,

72
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,080
how did you two make it happen?

73
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,120
[It all started at a car wash.]

74
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,720
[Staring at the soap]

75
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,960
[bubbles sliding down the windshield,]

76
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,080
[I came up with 13 strategies.]

77
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,400
[I finally picked the first one.]

78
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,680
Got it.

79
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,880
Lady Wan, I'm coming to see you.

80
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,800
[This time,]

81
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,920
[it's impossible for her to say no.]

82
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,120
Hello.

83
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,320
Mr. Li.

84
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,520
Hello, hello.

85
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,400
This is the proposal

86
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,320
we prepared.

87
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,200
Then...

88
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,400
Let's talk in the car.

89
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,240
Sure.

90
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,960
Be serious.

91
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,960
Was what you just said true?

92
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,080
Didn't I signal you

93
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,159
when I walked in?

94
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:50,640
You missed that?

95
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,240
What good is

96
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,040
signaling me then?

97
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,920
If you wanted me to play along,

98
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,120
you should tell me ahead of time.

99
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,360
You made me look

100
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,320
like an idiot.

101
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,920
How is that okay?

102
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,440
Relax. You didn't look stupid.

103
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
We were totally

104
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,760
in sync just now.

105
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,040
But that Michael,

106
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,960
I have to say,

107
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,120
he drives me crazy.

108
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,080
Whatever I say,

109
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,000
he contradicts.

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,400
Feels like

111
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,560
he has it out for me.

112
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,920
Let it go, man.

113
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
You already crushed

114
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,480
Michael today.

115
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,760
And Xing Kai even spoke up for you.

116
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,520
Don't push it.

117
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,440
Also,

118
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,560
what's going on

119
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
with you and Lady Wan?

120
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,720
Don't mess around.

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,560
Otherwise, I'm telling

122
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,400
Cheng Man.

123
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,000
Mess around?

124
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,760
Sure,

125
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,440
I indeed

126
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,400
exaggerated a bit

127
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,640
just now,

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,520
but I did

129
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,159
put in serious effort.

130
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,400
Tell me the truth.

131
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,000
This is top level business intel.

132
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,720
I'm only telling you

133
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,600
because you're my buddy.

134
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,320
Please take a tissue.

135
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,920
Thanks.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,960
Please take a tissue

137
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,920
to wipe your noble...

138
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,720
Lady Wan, hello.

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,920
Let me introduce myself briefly.

140
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,320
My name is Li Daoqi, and I'm from...

141
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,040
Get him out of here.

142
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,560
Because our company

143
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,160
is a new...

144
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,880
Sir, sir, this way.

145
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,600
Sir, please come this way.

146
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,400
Take a tissue

147
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,360
and wipe your hands!

148
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,400
The elevator's over there.

149
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,320
Okay.

150
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,320
This way please.

151
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,799
Alright.

152
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,240
Maybe

153
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,120
I should return this pack

154
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,600
of tissues?

155
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,320
Just give it to me.

156
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,799
Wait,

157
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,880
I took it from the men's restroom.

158
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,799
It's fine. Please just leave.

159
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,440
Okay.

160
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,240
This way.

161
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,880
Can you go in the men's restroom?

162
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,840
This way, sir.

163
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,679
Alright, you can go back now.

164
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,400
Okay.

165
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,400
Sorry about that.

166
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,360
It's fine. Just leave.

167
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,080
Okay, I'm leaving.

168
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,440
See? I'm going now.

169
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,480
You're still here?

170
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,040
Okay, no worries.

171
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,520
Wait, how do I go down?

172
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,760
Okay, I got it.

173
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,040
I'm really leaving.

174
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,920
Hello, everyone in the fan group!

175
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,720
I'm the newbie, Daoqi.

176
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,760
I'm so excited today.

177
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,920
I feel like

178
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,640
I finally found my people,

179
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,080
my home,

180
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,240
and where my heart belongs.

181
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,320
I still have a lot to learn,

182
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,120
and I hope you can

183
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,520
help me out.

184
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,440
I've got

185
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,720
plenty of free time.

186
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,680
If there are any events,

187
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,720
please bring me along.

188
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,720
Over here, attention.

189
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,000
This one's a medium.

190
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
Here you go.

191
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,600
There's a large over here.

192
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,000
[Where's the XL?]

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,640
XL...

194
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Is this an XL?

195
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,000
[Today's event was]

196
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,800
[such a success.]

197
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
[Daoqi, you're incredible.]

198
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,240
[Why not make him]

199
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,800
[our fan club rep?]

200
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,640
[Great idea.]

201
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,400
Mei, what can I do for you?

202
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,880
[Hello, is this Daoqi?]

203
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,880
[Can you make it to]

204
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,000
[Lady Wan's event?]

205
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,960
Of course.

206
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,120
[Perfect.]

207
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:45,960
[Here's the thing.]

208
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,360
[Lady Wan is attending]

209
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,200
[a movie premiere.]

210
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,120
[Her manager knew about]

211
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,160
[our fan T-shirts]

212
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,240
[and was thrilled.]

213
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,720
Okay.

214
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,240
[They want us to come]

215
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,560
[and show support for Lady Wan.]

216
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,720
[As the fan club rep,]

217
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,640
[you have to come.]

218
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,280
No problem.

219
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,200
Just

220
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,320
send me the time

221
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,000
and location.

222
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,920
[Will do.]

223
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,920
See you then.

224
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,240
[See you then.]

225
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,800
Lady Wan, I'm coming to see you.

226
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,600
Lady Wan,

227
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,080
this is a gift from your fans.

228
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,400
The fan club

229
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,280
prepared...

230
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,400
Be careful.

231
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,040
What are you doing?

232
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,560
I'm giving this to her.

233
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,240
Sorry,

234
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,120
no entry without a staff pass,

235
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,560
okay?

236
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,400
Stop poking me.

237
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:26,840
Quiet!

238
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,640
Staff pass.

239
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,280
[Everyone just keep quiet!]

240
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,560
Hurry.

241
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,640
[Quiet down!]

242
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,880
[Stop pushing! Careful!]

243
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,160
I have my pass.

244
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,240
I just didn't bring it.

245
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,040
I changed my pants.

246
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,000
No pass, no entry.

247
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,840
Here, here.

248
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,080
Be quick.

249
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,080
[Calm down!]

250
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,320
[Quiet!]

251
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,520
[Everyone calm down!]

252
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,440
[Ladies and gentlemen,]

253
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,280
[the film]

254
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,360
[Journey of Life is about to begin.]

255
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,560
[Please make sure]

256
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,280
[your phones are on silent.]

257
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,400
[Enjoy the movie.]

258
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,720
Excuse me.

259
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,320
Sorry.

260
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,440
Lady Wan, sorry to interrupt.

261
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,880
You are?

262
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm a member of your

263
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,560
fan club.

264
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,720
I'm here on behalf

265
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,080
of your fans to give you a gift.

266
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,880
You don't remember me?

267
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,400
I handed you a tissue once.

268
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,240
Tissue guy?

269
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,520
Yes, that's me.

270
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,640
What do you want?

271
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,200
My name is Li Daoqi.

272
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,320
Besides being your devoted fan,

273
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,640
I also run a domestic

274
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,880
skincare brand

275
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
called Dr. Fu.

276
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,720
Our...

277
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,920
Sorry, sorry.

278
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,120
Though we're a domestic company,

279
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,200
our goal is to

280
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,000
rival top global brands.

281
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,000
Domestic brands should also pursue excellence.

282
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,800
I've followed your livestreams closely

283
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and noticed

284
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,400
domestic beauty brands

285
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,120
don't get

286
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,120
enough spotlight there.

287
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,360
So I'm

288
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,000
planning a domestic

289
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,720
brands special.

290
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,320
Really?

291
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,840
We're aiming for the same thing.

292
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,160
That's the foundation for a partnership.

293
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,600
If this movie weren't so boring,

294
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,200
I wouldn't have time for your nonsense.

295
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,520
Yeah, right.

296
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,480
This movie is terrible.

297
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,920
Can you shut up?

298
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,560
Sorry. No more talking.

299
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,280
Sorry. Sorry.

300
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,280
Dr. Fu

301
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,600
isn't just a brand name.

302
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,960
He's real.

303
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,120
He's my childhood friend,

304
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,960
a chemistry PhD from a top university.

305
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,320
He came back to start this business.

306
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,200
Why are you taking so long?

307
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,560
Let's go.

308
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,480
Wait, my leg's numb.

309
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,360
Slow down.

310
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,000
There are samples in the bag.

311
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,560
[I know, I know.]

312
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,440
My leg's numb.

313
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,840
Stop pulling, okay?

314
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,000
You're disturbing others.

315
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,200
My leg's numb.

316
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,120
Samples. In the gift bag.

317
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:41,920
Move.

318
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,640
I know.

319
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,480
Lady Wan

320
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,280
has also expressed

321
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,960
her gratitude to...

322
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,200
Lady Wan!

323
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,680
Lady Wan!

324
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,000
Thank you for the gifts.

325
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,760
You're so thoughtful.

326
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,440
I've received them.

327
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,360
Thank you!

328
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,120
Lady Wan,

329
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,640
could you sign for us?

330
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,320
Quick, the pen!

331
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Sign here,

332
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,880
use my back.

333
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,960
Lady Wan,

334
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,840
our fan T-shirts were

335
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,480
all made by him.

336
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,880
He's the newest super-fan.

337
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,360
Thanks for your work.

338
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,640
Not at all.

339
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,720
Take your time.

340
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,800
I'm talking about Dr. Fu.

341
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,360
Wanna join my livestream?

342
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,400
You'll need real strength.

343
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,640
Can you stick it out until the end?

344
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,880
No problem.

345
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,080
Definitely.

346
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,320
Good.

347
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,240
My team will reach out

348
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,160
to you later.

349
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,680
Okay.

350
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,960
Alright, thank you all.

351
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,080
Thank you.

352
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,200
Thank you very much.

353
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,080
Thank you.

354
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,520
Thanks.

355
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,480
Thanks.

356
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,400
Mei, tell everyone

357
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,880
that

358
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,240
midnight snacks are on me.

359
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,560
Nice.

360
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,680
Guys,

361
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,800
Daoqi's treating us tonight!

362
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,000
Great!

363
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,880
Daoqi! Daoqi! Daoqi!

364
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,760
Daoqi! Daoqi! Daoqi!

365
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,320
[How could you do this]

366
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,120
[on your own?]

367
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,080
Bro,

368
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:28,800
come on.

369
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,040
I threw away my pride to achieve this.

370
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,360
Even if I'd dragged you with me,

371
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,400
what could you have helped with?

372
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,240
Besides,

373
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,800
you seemed

374
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,320
out of it those days.

375
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,520
I didn't want to add to your mess.

376
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,280
How was I out of it?

377
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,240
Dude,

378
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,800
you've been sleeping at the office?

379
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,200
Is it because

380
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,520
I slipped up that day?

381
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,120
I thought she'd known it.

382
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,000
My bad, my bad.

383
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,319
It's fine, it's all over.

384
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,280
You know,

385
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,640
I haven't gone home these days,

386
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,480
and she didn't even ask where I was.

387
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,119
So you're waiting for

388
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,400
an excuse to go back?

389
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,800
Come on,

390
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,200
you're a grown man.

391
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,560
Two days of sulking is enough. Go home.

392
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,520
I will!

393
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,480
I can't shower here.

394
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,680
I have to take a bath.

395
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,200
You're really something.

396
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,360
You're the most stubborn one I've known.

397
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,240
Mr. Xing.

398
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,680
Sorry,

399
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,760
I'm a bit slow.

400
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,640
I didn't

401
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,680
quite catch

402
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,760
what you meant

403
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,680
in the meeting.

404
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,280
I just

405
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,720
discussed it with

406
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,000
other executives.

407
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,520
We all think

408
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,800
the company can't

409
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,640
carry the cost of Lady Wan's

410
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,680
livestream.

411
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,560
Even if production keeps up,

412
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,040
any slip-up

413
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,360
during this process

414
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,080
could be

415
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,160
catastrophic for us.

416
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,880
Of course I know that.

417
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,040
So the company won't

418
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,280
give him full

419
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,360
financial support.

420
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,120
[Since he's so eager]

421
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,120
[and driven,]

422
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,960
[he should pay the price]

423
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,800
[for that eagerness,]

424
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,440
[right?]

425
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,040
[If the trial livestream goes well]

426
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,920
and we sign with Lady Wan,

427
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,360
then Li Daoqi can go raise money

428
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,920
and scale production.

429
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,000
If not,

430
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,480
the loss is on him,

431
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,800
and I'll have

432
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,840
every reason to remove him.

433
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,000
Brilliant.

434
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,920
I get it now.

435
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,120
Sir,

436
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,520
I just have one more question.

437
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,440
If things

438
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,640
really get to that point,

439
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,320
what about our products?

440
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,240
[What's the rush?]

441
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,000
Don't we still have markets

442
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,200
in third and fourth-tier cities?

443
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,560
Listen,

444
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,640
the company won't

445
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,520
suffer any losses.

446
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,160
[Relax.]

447
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
[You must know that]

448
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,800
every choice cuts both ways.

449
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,920
Why is Li Daoqi

450
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,400
pushing himself so hard?

451
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,760
Because he wants

452
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,280
to prove himself.

453
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,360
[Right?]

454
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,800
[No need to crush his enthusiasm.]

455
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,640
[Let him have what he wants for now.]

456
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,120
Maybe we're all

457
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,560
underestimating him.

458
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,280
He dares to gamble,

459
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,080
and he goes all in every time.

460
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,200
The risk is high,

461
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,400
but

462
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,960
if he wins,

463
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,800
the payoff will be massive.

464
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yes, exactly.

465
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,880
I'll prepare contingency plans.

466
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,080
Trust me.

467
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,560
[Also,]

468
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,880
[make sure]

469
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,640
he gets a bit

470
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,480
of encouragement.

471
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,560
Got it. I'll give him a push.

472
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,600
Okay.

473
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,720
Book a restaurant for me.

474
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,520
[Let me make an introduction.]

475
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,280
[This is Director Zhu,]

476
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,200
[a famous filmmaker]

477
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:21,960
we invited.

478
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,120
Hello, Director Zhu.

479
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,960
Hi, Director Zhu.

480
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,360
Thank you.

481
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,840
As for Lin Anran,

482
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,040
- I'm sure you already know her.
- Right.

483
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,520
Qian Dan, Vice President.

484
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,280
Hello.

485
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,440
Zhang Ran, our breakout star.

486
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,480
Hi, Director.

487
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,480
I used to be a host as well,

488
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,080
a financial talk show host.

489
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,720
Nice to meet you.

490
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,120
Director,

491
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,720
do you have any thoughts

492
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,360
on our proposal?

493
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,880
I've flipped through it.

494
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,040
Overall, I think it's

495
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,640
pretty solid.

496
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,160
However, there's one issue.

497
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,120
It's that

498
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,360
the two hosts'

499
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,800
audience demographics

500
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,320
might differ quite a bit.

501
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,040
For instance, Anran

502
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,520
appeals more to

503
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,480
modern, independent women.

504
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
While Zhang Ran

505
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,520
connects more with the mass-market.

506
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,520
So how

507
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,680
can we pull these

508
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,520
two audiences

509
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,160
into one talk series?

510
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,880
That could be

511
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,080
a significant hurdle.

512
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,120
Therefore,

513
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,560
my suggestion is

514
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,320
we produce a pilot episode first

515
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,920
to test the waters.

516
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,000
I see. That's your take.

517
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,960
You're being very cautious

518
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,680
and thorough.

519
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,960
But we have

520
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,640
full confidence in both of them.

521
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,480
Absolutely.

522
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,920
But what about their

523
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,000
clashing styles?

524
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,360
Our current idea is

525
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,680
to frame it as a debate.

526
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,280
By taking opposing stances,

527
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,440
each side attracting

528
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,480
their followers.

529
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,280
Then, we stir up buzz

530
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
with various topics.

531
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,200
Sounds good, Director.

532
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,200
I think your plan

533
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,040
is excellent.

534
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,520
Aligns with Mr. Lin's vision of the whole

535
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,400
being greater than the sum of its parts, right?

536
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,160
So, if everyone's

537
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,080
on board,

538
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,240
shall we set the theme for

539
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,040
the first episode

540
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,160
as "Besties"?

541
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,280
What do you all think?

542
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,000
I think it's great.

543
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,040
And you?

544
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,680
No problem.

545
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,480
The ops team provides full backup.

546
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,480
I'm in.

547
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,640
Zhang Ran?

548
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,440
Personally, I have no issue.

549
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,640
I just want to clarify

550
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,840
the boundaries for this topic.

551
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,000
How edgy can we get?

552
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,920
As edgy as possible.

553
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,760
It must be buzzworthy.

554
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,240
But we must also cater to

555
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,920
the general audience's taste.

556
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,520
If there are no further

557
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,480
objections,

558
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,440
let's proceed with this direction.

559
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,640
Director,

560
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,440
I have an idea.

561
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,920
I've been thinking

562
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,320
about how to be

563
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,520
contentious and

564
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,800
attention-grabbing.

565
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,400
Could my co-host,

566
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,680
Xiaojian, play my "bestie"?

567
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,040
Well, he's a

568
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,520
comedy blogger,

569
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,360
so his style would actually

570
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,080
complement Zhang Ran's.

571
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,080
My on-screen

572
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,960
persona

573
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,640
is more poised, while

574
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,200
the two of them can

575
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
bounce off each other.

576
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,720
Is that okay?

577
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,280
Yes.

578
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,680
Guys.

579
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,040
I'll try out for you.

580
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,800
Another reason is,

581
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,440
I'd like to give our

582
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,440
newcomers some exposure.

583
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,680
Consider it

584
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,960
a bit of a selfish request.

585
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,520
I think it works.

586
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,520
Thoughts?

587
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,080
As long as it delivers,

588
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,160
I don't mind.

589
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
It's up to you,

590
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,320
the leads.

591
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,560
So, you mean

592
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,800
Xiaojian would be

593
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,560
your "bestie"?

594
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,040
Yeah.

595
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,720
Then wouldn't I have to

596
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,840
find a new "bestie"?

597
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,560
Yes.

598
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,840
The theme is "Besties".

599
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,160
You'll be needing one.

600
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,000
Director, let me explain.

601
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,480
Zhang Ran

602
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,600
lived abroad for a long time.

603
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,960
Her close friends are likely all overseas.

604
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,240
They probably can't make it here.

605
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,160
True, but I could

606
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,040
try...

607
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,200
It's fine. I'll think about it.

608
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,320
I think it

609
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,240
doesn't have to be

610
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,600
a real best friend.

611
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,040
Anyone that can vibe with you

612
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,000
and create

613
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,640
good TV, will work.

614
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,720
A real one'd be ideal,

615
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,360
no doubt.

616
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,040
You're so likable.

617
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,200
Surely you can find

618
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,240
someone.

619
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,920
You have a point.

620
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,960
I... I do have a

621
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,120
colleague from my

622
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,640
TV hosting days.

623
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,400
I could ask her

624
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,720
if she's interested.

625
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,800
What kind of host?

626
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,040
I'm concerned a traditional

627
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,520
TV station host

628
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,240
might not mesh with

629
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,080
our show's younger,

630
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,600
more internet-savvy vibe.

631
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,800
But Zhang Ran here

632
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,480
was a host too, right?

633
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,400
Yes, I hosted a finance show.

634
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,480
It's okay, Zhang Ran.

635
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,040
Figure it out later.

636
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,400
No problem, will do.

637
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,600
Okay.

638
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,240
So, the framework

639
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,080
for our show

640
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,200
is basically set.

641
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,880
Let's go with it.

642
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,080
Give it our best!

643
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,640
Yes! Let's go!

644
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,400
Let's do this.

645
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,200
Thanks, Director.

646
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,040
Thank you.

647
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,640
Hey, what about your cousin?

648
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
She's in town, right?

649
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,840
Could we

650
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,680
invite her over?

651
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
She's not an influencer,

652
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,480
has a story, and you're family.

653
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,200
She's got her own problems

654
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,040
weighing her down right now.

655
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,040
Let's not bother her.

656
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,280
Besides, there's a ten-year gap.

657
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,400
We're not even that close.

658
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,520
Not as close as you and I.

659
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,440
Anran snagged Xiaojian,

660
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,680
so the "guy bestie" angle

661
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,560
is taken.

662
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,120
We could've done that.

663
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,680
This "dual female lead" thing

664
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,080
is just for show.

665
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,840
We're just the cameo.

666
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,720
This is how it's gonna be from now on.

667
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,920
We get their leftovers.

668
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,400
So we better

669
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,360
get used to it.

670
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,200
What do we do, then?

671
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,440
Actually,

672
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,000
any streamer will do.

673
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,480
Look, it's variety show.

674
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,080
Write a script, stir up some drama,

675
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,200
and boom—you've got clicks.

676
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,120
Right?

677
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,440
This industry is such a cesspool.

678
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,720
Look at what it has done

679
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,360
to my good old lad Liu Bo.

680
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,040
Is that a compliment

681
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,960
or mockery?

682
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,040
Clearly, that's a

683
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,760
mockery.

684
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,600
Okay.

685
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,680
Good grief.

686
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,240
Listen, I...

687
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,720
Stop it.

688
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,760
That's not what she meant.

689
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,040
♪Where oh where is my bestie?♪

690
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,800
♪Where can they be?♪

691
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,440
♪They are...♪

692
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,400
We're so useless at this.

693
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,320
Should I just have

694
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,560
Fu Yudong throw on a wig?

695
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:23,960
Good.

696
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,040
A toast, everyone?

697
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,040
Hold on, Mr. Xing.

698
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,000
May I have the

699
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,400
honor of toasting Mr. Li alone first?

700
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,960
By all means.

701
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,720
Mr. Li.

702
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,880
It just dawned on me now.

703
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,880
I used to be

704
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,760
this frog in a well.

705
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,200
Just as you said,

706
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,960
your vision is up here,

707
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,080
mine was down here.

708
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,880
A far cry from yours.

709
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
Nah. We're all here.

710
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,080
I am truly, truly in awe.

711
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,680
Alright, a penalty drink for me.

712
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,120
You don't...

713
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,360
I'll join you for that one.

714
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,320
I got it. Let me.

715
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,360
No.

716
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,040
I'm having one with Michael.

717
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,920
Cheers.

718
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,200
Thanks.

719
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,240
Thank you, Mr. Li.

720
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,440
We're off to a flying start.

721
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,760
Mr. Li?

722
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,920
Now we need to

723
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,840
ace the pilot and lock down

724
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,720
Lady Wan's sponsorship fee.

725
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,760
Double down on that.

726
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,720
Our top priority right now

727
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,600
is to make a big splash with the launch.

728
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,760
There'll be challenges, sure.

729
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:16,960
But

730
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,960
you know what?

731
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,560
Leave it to me.

732
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,560
Now that's what I'm talking about!

733
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,200
Right?

734
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
Let me top you up.

735
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,920
No shop talk when we're drunk.

736
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,480
Who's drunk? I'm fine.

737
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,080
Come on, bottoms up!

738
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,120
I'm on it.

739
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:32,840
He can drink.

740
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,080
Yudong, I saw a fortune teller

741
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,920
the other day, you know?

742
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,560
Said this is my year to shine.

743
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,320
Isn't that the status quo?

744
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:42,880
Watch your tongue.

745
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,400
Mr. Li is our good luck charm.

746
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,480
Isn't him, Mr. Xing?

747
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,320
Forget those psychics. I'll do it.

748
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,720
Give me the cash instead.

749
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,480
Deal.

750
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,880
Here.

751
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,120
Come on.

752
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,960
Mr. Fu.

753
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,960
Cheers.

754
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,400
Alright, down the hatch!

755
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,800
Guess I'll be

756
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,720
under the table soon.

757
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,760
Another bottle.

758
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,840
Sure thing.

759
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,320
No problem.

760
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,080
Waiter!

761
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,920
We'll take another bottle.

762
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,720
[Right away, sir.]

763
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,080
This way, Mr. Xing.

764
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,320
All taken care of.

765
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,200
Listen,

766
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,840
the buzz tonight is just right.

767
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,600
Take care, Mr. Xing.

768
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,160
Alright.

769
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,600
Goodnight, Mr. Xing.

770
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,440
Take care.

771
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,960
Bye. Easy does it, now.

772
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,880
Watch your step.

773
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,760
Don't worry.

774
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,840
I'll see Mr. Xing home.

775
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,840
Bye, Mr. Fu, Mr. Li.

776
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,920
See you, Michael.

777
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,000
Bye.

778
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,920
Come on, I'll get you home.

779
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,160
I got a designated driver. It's alright.

780
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,160
I told you to take it easy.

781
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,160
You wouldn't listen.

782
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,720
I was drinking 'cause I'm happy.

783
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,720
As if.

784
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,520
Those scams

785
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,320
tried to set you up.

786
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,280
Couldn't you tell?

787
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,480
Let them.

788
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,440
Let 'em try.

789
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,880
How far can they get?

790
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,760
You and me together,

791
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,960
we'll clear

792
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,240
any hurdle they set.

793
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,840
No sweat.

794
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,600
Rest assured, bro.

795
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:02,880
Smile for me.

796
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,960
You've been glum all day.

797
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,720
Come on, smile.

798
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,480
Bug off.

799
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,000
Smile. Come on.

800
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,200
Give me a smile.

801
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,120
Get those dirty hands

802
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
of yours off my face.

803
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,440
I'll pinch you with that claw!

804
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,600
Wow. That's a claw!

805
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,640
Thought

806
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,280
it was a human leg.

807
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,720
Real deal.

808
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,800
Hands off!

809
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,840
You'll knock it over.

810
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,120
Remember how we used to be?

811
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,280
A couple of doormats.

812
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,040
But starting now,

813
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,560
we're these two giant claws.

814
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,240
Seriously.

815
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,160
Unstoppable. A pincer movement.

816
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,040
We'll be rolling in dough! Rolling in it!

817
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,600
Money, money, money!

818
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,400
Move!

819
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,080
Take me home.

820
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,000
Let's go home, you and me.

821
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,360
Psycho.

822
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,240
♪We're going back♪

823
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,120
♪To the sea...♪

824
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,920
When I make it big,

825
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,200
I'll make a movie about us

826
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
legendary upstarters,

827
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,400
called "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea".

828
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,040
Open wide! Here I come!

829
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,120
Crabs walk sideways, man.

830
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,000
Sideways!

831
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,520
They don't walk straight, dude...

832
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,760
Apes walk straight.

833
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,400
How much have you had?

834
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,560
Today we landed

835
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,360
Lady Wan.

836
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,560
You should've seen

837
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,920
Xing Kai and Michael's faces.

838
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,680
That felt classic.

839
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,240
We showed them.

840
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,040
Stop frowning.

841
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Tell me I did good.

842
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,640
You're the best, honey.

843
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,280
The very best.

844
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,840
Trust me, babe.

845
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,560
One day,

846
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,520
I'll become the man

847
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,480
you truly...

848
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,080
I believe you. I do.

849
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Shh, that's enough.

850
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,000
Here, let me wipe your face.

851
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,080
You're home.

852
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,440
Still up?

853
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,320
Yeah.

854
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,520
Sorry about the stink. Had a few drinks.

855
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,520
So,

856
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,840
Daoqi landed a deal

857
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,760
with Lady Wan.

858
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,360
We all went out tonight

859
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,120
to celebrate.

860
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,640
That's great. Good for you.

861
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,240
You're cooking with gas.

862
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,480
Thanks.

863
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,480
Sure.

864
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,320
Your phone.

865
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,280
Hello?

866
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,360
He seemed okay

867
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,200
when I left him.

868
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,040
Okay.

869
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,800
Who was it?

870
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,560
Cheng Man.

871
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,640
Said Daoqi had too much to drink.

872
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,880
Asked me to keep an eye on him.

873
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,360
We should have her over sometime.

874
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,560
Let's get together more.

875
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,960
I thought you didn't like her.

876
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,120
You and Daoqi are partners.

877
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,080
You're in this deep.

878
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,040
Perhaps you'll soon

879
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,600
become a big-shot duo.

880
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,080
As the wives, we should

881
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,600
probably get to know each other.

882
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,720
Maybe I could learn from her

883
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,200
about being more supportive.

884
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,120
We'll see.

885
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,440
You've got a lot on your plate.

886
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,840
I'm hopping in the shower.

887
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,680
This has been broken for ages.

888
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,600
Fixed.

889
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,920
Go get some rest.

890
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,199
Come here.

891
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,960
Good job. That's it.

892
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,320
They're literally feasting!

893
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,159
We only get staff slop.

894
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,000
They get as much fruit as they want.

895
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,000
Save some for me, buddies.

896
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,239
Start by misting it down.

897
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,239
Get it nice and clean.

898
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,360
That's good. Okay.

899
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,199
Then take the squeegee

900
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,080
and give it a pass.

901
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,680
If the turtle tries to

902
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,320
eat something nasty,

903
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,280
let me know.

904
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,800
On it right now.

905
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,320
Don't let it swallow, then.

906
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,200
It's no good for them.

907
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,080
Will it bite me?

908
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,800
No. Just don't go near its head.

909
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,000
That kangaroo in the back?

910
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,440
Give it some space

911
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,120
when you're

912
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,000
working around.

913
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,680
This one's tame.

914
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,400
That one's got a temper.

915
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,000
Alright.

916
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,400
That's all from last week.

917
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,520
Same old issues.

918
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,440
Let me make this clear.

919
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,720
"Own your responsibilities" isn't just a slogan.

920
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,880
We have protocols.

921
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:06,880
Also...

922
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,400
Ge Kaiyang. Are you with me?

923
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,600
You're on the night shift starting today.

924
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,960
5 PM

925
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,000
to 5 AM.

926
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,840
Alright?

927
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,840
Supposed to be Zhang, who

928
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,720
just became a father

929
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,400
and has to be home.

930
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,800
Others, either older,

931
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,040
or have kids with

932
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,040
big exams coming up.

933
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,840
They can't cover it.

934
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,880
You're young, energetic,

935
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,240
and still in training.

936
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,040
Working different shifts

937
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,000
helps with your growth.

938
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,600
You can fit in better

939
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,880
with the team too.

940
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,600
Here you are.

941
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,400
Eyes off. It's mine.

942
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,200
What are you doing over there?

943
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,360
Just shove that cot

944
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,040
in the gap.

945
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,280
Idiot.

946
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,240
The middle one's yours.

947
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,000
Upper one.

948
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,760
What are you gawking at?

949
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,160
Dumbass.

950
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,840
Why are you all alone?

951
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,920
Everyone else has somewhere to crash.

952
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,320
Why don't you?

953
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,240
Getting picked on,

954
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:48,920
just like me?

955
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,520
Let me see if I can get this off.

956
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,800
Does it hurt?

957
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,160
I'm sorry.

958
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,560
I can't help you.

959
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
They picked on me.

960
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,320
I didn't speak up.

961
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,040
When I'm away,

962
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,240
Happy will be with you, Grandma.

963
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,640
Don't worry about me.

964
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,920
I've been talking to animals a lot lately.

965
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,920
They are simpler than people.
