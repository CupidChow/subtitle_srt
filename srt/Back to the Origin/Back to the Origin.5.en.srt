1
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,240
I think

2
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,800
you should just let her try.

3
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,000
Or she won't

4
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,160
be satisfied.

5
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,880
If it doesn't work out,

6
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,880
you two can always come back.

7
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,800
What's the point of trying

8
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,680
if you already know how it'll turn out?

9
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,759
How do you know it'll be exactly

10
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,520
what you think if you don't let her try?

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,680
At least

12
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,960
there's still hope, right?

13
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,880
Hope just makes it worse.

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,040
Look at you.

15
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,760
If you hadn't won

16
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,560
that award for your film,

17
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,640
would you have been so stubborn

18
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,320
and ended up like this?

19
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,280
Sorry.

20
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,400
At least I won an award.

21
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,520
Have you?

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,079
That's not the point.

23
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:20,600
Right?

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,880
Actually, I've thought about it.

25
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,240
If I could do it all over again,

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,720
knowing it would end this way,

27
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,120
would I still have given it my all

28
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,920
to filmmaking?

29
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,920
Even if I had to borrow money to do it?

30
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm telling you, I would.

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,760
Because at that time,

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,160
at that age, with that kind of spirit,

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,320
I felt like I could control

34
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,400
everything.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,079
I really loved

36
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,520
that ambitious side of myself.

37
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,320
Every morning I woke up

38
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,960
with a clear goal.

39
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,280
Not like now.

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,680
Not that now is bad.

41
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,240
You know.

42
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,080
Being here with you,

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,160
fishing leisurely.

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,320
It's nice too.

45
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,520
I think it's too much trouble.

46
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,160
What isn't?

47
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,960
Us fishing here right now,

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,520
isn't that a form of trouble?

49
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,480
You think

50
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,720
we're fishing just to eat fish?

51
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:16,520
Well?

52
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,400
Can't we just buy some fish?

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,400
Or do we like fish that much?

54
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,840
No, right?

55
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,760
Where's the fun in life without a little struggle?

56
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,760
Don't you have

57
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,640
any wishes you want to fulfill,

58
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,720
or things you really want to do?

59
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,600
When I was a kid, I really wanted

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,600
to get away from my dad.

61
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,920
So I came to Canada.

62
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
And now I'm going back.

63
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,120
No wonder you think that way.

64
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,520
Okay, let's talk about now.

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,560
What about now?

66
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Is there anything

67
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,800
you really want to do right now?

68
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,080
Right now,

69
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,320
I just hope to

70
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,839
hold my family close.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,320
Okay.

72
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,079
Your family.

73
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,320
Then you have to

74
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,120
think carefully

75
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,720
how exactly

76
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,120
can you hold

77
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,960
your family close?

78
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,200
Hey,

79
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,000
why do I

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,480
never get a bite?

81
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,640
What's going on?

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,120
Why?

83
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,520
My bait's

84
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,080
all gone.

85
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,320
You need to focus.

86
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,200
Just now, the fish

87
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,280
nibbled your line several times.

88
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,240
You missed it.

89
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,920
Really?

90
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,600
Too busy lecturing me about life.

91
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,040
You know what?

92
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,440
Right now,

93
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,960
you might not want to hear this,

94
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,800
but you'll understand someday.

95
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,000
These new neighborhoods are so remote.

96
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,400
It's nowhere near as convenient as our place.

97
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
Where are we?

98
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,720
Gotta transfer again?

99
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,000
- Which bus now?
- Forget it.

100
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,400
Let's not bother with another bus.

101
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,240
Let's get a taxi.

102
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,280
Go ahead.

103
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,480
Need to register?

104
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,280
- Real-name verification?
- Such a pain.

105
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,159
Honey, one's coming.

106
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,040
Taxi.

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,680
Get in the car first.

108
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,280
Okay?

109
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,680
This one's probably free.

110
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,640
[Welcome aboard Lucheng Taxi.]

111
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,040
Hello, Mr. Guo.

112
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,200
[Hello, Cheng Man.]

113
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,840
[I asked the store staff]

114
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,080
[to deliver]

115
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,920
[that sake.]

116
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
[It should arrive soon.]

117
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,320
[Wish you and your friends]

118
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,120
[enjoy your drink.]

119
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,480
Thanks so much.

120
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,920
It's just that your sake

121
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,000
is really too good.

122
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,800
I was going to ask a friend to order it,

123
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,160
but ended up troubling you.

124
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,880
[No trouble at all.]

125
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,120
[No need to ask a friend.]

126
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,280
[Just tell me if you like it.]

127
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,640
[Next time you want some,]

128
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,520
[just come to my store.]

129
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,560
Okay, sure.

130
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
That's very kind of you.

131
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,720
Mr. Guo,

132
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,600
when you have time

133
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,520
I'll treat you to a meal to thank you.

134
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,640
[Sure.]

135
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,680
Thanks. Bye.

136
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,880
[Okay, bye.]

137
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,320
Who was that?

138
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,760
A regular. Sending us some drinks.

139
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,880
You are

140
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,280
so popular.

141
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,159
Report!

142
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,440
Change complete. Awaiting instructions.

143
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,200
No shorts when guests come.

144
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,240
Change it.

145
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,960
Yes.

146
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,920
Got it.

147
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,360
Then what should I wear?

148
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,840
Something more formal.

149
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,520
How do I

150
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,000
even define "formal"?

151
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,760
At least wear something with a collar.

152
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,320
At least?

153
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,440
With a collar?

154
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,600
You two.

155
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,680
What are you up to?

156
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,160
We're visiting a friend.

157
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,600
The unit number?

158
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,760
Building 23, Unit 3.

159
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,120
The resident's name?

160
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:37,640
Li Daoqi.

161
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,400
Li Daoqi.

162
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,200
Are you sure?

163
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,560
Not right.

164
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,280
Cheng Man.

165
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,159
Right.

166
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,840
Excuse me, how do we get to Building 23?

167
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,840
That way.

168
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,240
Go straight to the end.

169
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,320
Then turn left.

170
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,360
You'll see a small path.

171
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,840
Follow that path all the way.

172
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,960
Then turn right.

173
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,320
You'll see a small lake.

174
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,960
Follow the lake to the end.

175
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,680
Then turn left.

176
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,760
It's a bit far.

177
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:04,880
Thank you.

178
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,440
It's nothing.

179
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,880
Straight.

180
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,720
To the end, turn right.

181
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,160
To the end...

182
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,360
To the end, turn right...

183
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,040
Turn left...

184
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,880
There's a lake.

185
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,080
-He said to turn right.
-No, left.

186
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,200
No, first go to the end

187
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,800
and turn right first.

188
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,440
Turn left!

189
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,760
The man just said turn left!

190
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,720
Where are you going?

191
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,320
Didn't we just turn left?

192
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,720
We didn't...

193
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,360
We've been going straight.

194
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,560
Just call him.

195
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,960
How can we find it like this?

196
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,200
Everything looks the same.

197
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,919
It's like a maze.

198
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,760
Call him, just call him.

199
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,720
Yeah,

200
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,120
I turned left.

201
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,760
I...

202
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,360
All buildings look identical here.

203
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,480
Can't you just come out

204
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,320
and get us?

205
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,200
Hello?

206
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,560
What did he say?

207
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,280
He said we should find it ourselves.

208
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:56,960
Ourselves?

209
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,600
If we could find it, why would we be calling?

210
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,560
Let me check the navigation app.

211
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,320
Everything looks exactly the same.

212
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,680
Nobody around to ask.

213
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,920
Kids there, go ask them.

214
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,080
Kids? Are you serious?

215
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,560
I'm checking the navigation app.

216
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,240
Just go ask!

217
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,960
I won't.

218
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,360
Okay.

219
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,160
Rock, paper, scissors... Loser goes.

220
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,400
Excuse me,

221
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,320
could you tell us

222
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,640
how to get to Building 23?

223
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,920
-There. -Over there.

224
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:20,920
What?

225
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,720
Look.

226
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,840
Where do you think it could be?

227
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,280
The GPS says it's over there.

228
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,560
Thank you.

229
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,360
Let's go.

230
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,240
Why?

231
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,040
We definitely haven't been this way.

232
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,880
We're here.

233
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,160
The dot on the map isn't moving.

234
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:35,960
Go forward.

235
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,120
No, it's not moving.

236
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,440
-It's not...
-It moved.

237
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,520
No, it didn't.

238
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,400
Why is it jumping all over the place?

239
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:41,760
Look,

240
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,320
it doesn't even show

241
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
where we are now.

242
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,160
You're just

243
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,400
going in circles, Fu Yudong.

244
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,520
Someone's over there, I'll ask.

245
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,160
Wait here.

246
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:52,720
Excuse me.

247
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,280
What building is this?

248
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,800
26

249
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,920
Just go straight, right?

250
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,720
Thanks.

251
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,720
Fu Yudong! Over here!

252
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,480
Hurry!

253
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,600
Over here!

254
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,600
Coming, coming!

255
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,320
Excuse me,

256
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,840
is this Building 23, Unit 3?

257
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,520
Yes.

258
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,200
Hello, we're...

259
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,600
Wasn't it sake?

260
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,560
Why is it Icewine?

261
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,560
Did they mix it up?

262
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,520
Never mind, you probably don't know.

263
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,520
Here, thanks.

264
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Are they here?

265
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,000
No, it's the wine delivery guy.

266
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,040
I think

267
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
I'm near your place.

268
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,000
Can you come pick me up?

269
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,480
Honey!

270
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,440
Coming.

271
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,040
Look who's here!

272
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,120
Come out, say hello to my wife.

273
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,360
Okay.

274
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,280
Make yourself at home.

275
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,440
Have some appetizers first.

276
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,160
The main course will be ready soon.

277
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,400
Have some water.

278
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:53,880
No, thanks.

279
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,920
I already got this drink.

280
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,160
Help yourselves.

281
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,200
Sorry about that.

282
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,440
My friend said

283
00:10:59,480 --> 00:10:59,960
he'd send us

284
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,200
some wine,

285
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,240
so I assumed...

286
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,160
Just a misunderstanding.

287
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,920
My mistake, my apologies.

288
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,160
No worries.

289
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,880
It's fine, really.

290
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,400
Don't trouble yourself.

291
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,760
We haven't seen each other

292
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,520
in so long.

293
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,960
Just sitting here and chatting

294
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,840
is what's important.

295
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,920
Exactly, catching up.

296
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,720
Okay, thank you.

297
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,440
Thanks.

298
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,360
Where's your son?

299
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,160
He's in class.

300
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,360
Class?

301
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,960
I thought he

302
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,520
wasn't old enough for school yet.

303
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,960
That's the deal with kids in China, right?

304
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,640
People say if a kid

305
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,160
learns 1,500 English words,

306
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,960
it's enough to get by in Canada,

307
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,080
but not even close in China.

308
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,240
Why?

309
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,800
The competition is insane!

310
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,720
Actually, back home,

311
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,880
it's not all like that.

312
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,960
We didn't sign him up

313
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,400
for academic classes.

314
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,880
Just painting and pottery.

315
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
We just want him to have

316
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,120
some artistic exposure from a young age.

317
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,720
No language classes either.

318
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,240
No rush.

319
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,360
No rush at all.

320
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,040
I agree.

321
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,160
Kids should

322
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,640
just be happy.

323
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't put too much pressure on them.

324
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,040
Zhang Ran said

325
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,880
she grew up

326
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
learning English

327
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,080
and was really good at it.

328
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,160
But when she moved to Canada,

329
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,440
she realized everyone spoke English,

330
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,280
so it was basically useless.

331
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,440
I love

332
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,400
your yard.

333
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,800
Did you hire someone to take care of it?

334
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,680
My wife

335
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,920
is in charge of the gardening.

336
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,800
I take care of it myself.

337
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,000
I've been

338
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,120
staying home lately

339
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,000
with nothing better to do,

340
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,320
so I started fiddling with the garden.

341
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,040
And this is how it turned out.

342
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,360
To be honest,

343
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,800
I've lived in Canada for years,

344
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,000
seen countless yards,

345
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,000
especially Chinese families'.

346
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,360
Yours is

347
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,640
one of a kind.

348
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,160
Really?

349
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,720
Yeah.

350
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,040
What about you, Zhang Ran?

351
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,920
Do you like gardening?

352
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,160
We could exchange tips.

353
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,840
I'm not into flowers and plants much.

354
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,800
I might be a bit allergic.

355
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,040
I'll get you a mask.

356
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
No, wait!

357
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,000
You're allergic?

358
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,480
Allergic to what?

359
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,200
Allergic to you.

360
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,720
That's love.

361
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,200
Then you're screwed.

362
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,400
She's allergic to me.

363
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,400
So now you just

364
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,720
take care of the yard all day?

365
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,240
Did she quit her job?

366
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:52,880
Retired.

367
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,440
Gloriously retired.

368
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:54,800
Not really.

369
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,920
After Nian was born,

370
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,400
I stepped back from the front lines.

371
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,360
Anyway, the team is on track now.

372
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,960
I just attend meetings occasionally

373
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,400
and meet important clients.

374
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,840
Semi-retired, you could say.

375
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:05,960
What did

376
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
you do, Man?

377
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,000
Retired so young.

378
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,160
Insurance broker.

379
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,360
Selling insurance?

380
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,720
That's a tough job.

381
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,240
I have a few friends

382
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,200
in insurance on WeChat,

383
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,520
they're under so much pressure.

384
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,680
Being an insurance salesperson and

385
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,760
an insurance are two very different things.

386
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,120
Oh really?

387
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,720
An insurance broker

388
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
is a professional broker for insurance.

389
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,840
Oh,

390
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
I get it now.

391
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,000
Your wife is brilliant.

392
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,560
Don't listen to his nonsense.

393
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,720
That's not a wrong way to put it.

394
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,120
But insurance brokers

395
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,440
only handles large corporate clients.

396
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,520
Still a difference.

397
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,240
I just got into the industry early,

398
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:37,960
rode the wave

399
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,520
during the boom over a decade ago.

400
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,680
When I met my wife,

401
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,600
she was one of those "gold-collar" elites

402
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,160
at a top investment bank

403
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,080
in Hong Kong's Central.

404
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,800
And she graduated from

405
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,720
Royal University of London.

406
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,840
A top student, absolutely.

407
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,280
Your Royal College of Toronto is,

408
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,720
you know,

409
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,240
not quite up to hers.

410
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,240
Now I just

411
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,440
look up to my wife.

412
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:57,960
Total admiration.

413
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,960
Man, you've been working

414
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,800
for quite a long time.

415
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,640
Let me see.

416
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,280
10 years in insurance,

417
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
plus a few years retired.

418
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,560
How old are you?

419
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,520
She was born in the Year of the Horse.

420
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,640
1978, 45 years old.

421
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,760
Six years older than me.

422
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,720
Oh my.

423
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,720
How can you reveal

424
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,640
a woman's age like that?

425
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,120
I never would've guessed.

426
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,640
You've maintained yourself so well.

427
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,200
Seriously, amazing.

428
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,160
I told you,

429
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,240
they're a May-December romance.

430
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,840
Aren't you two here to catch up?

431
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,000
Why keep talking about me?

432
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,280
Talk about yourselves.

433
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,320
We have nothing to talk about.

434
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:32,800
Oh right.

435
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,360
So, how

436
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,240
did the proposal

437
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,120
actually go down?

438
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,560
You sent me

439
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,520
lots of messages back then.

440
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,400
Plan A, Plan B,

441
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,040
Plan C,

442
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,440
Plan D, E, F, G, H...

443
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,560
I ended up using Plan I.

444
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,160
Let me tell you,

445
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,360
when it comes to romance,

446
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,200
I personally think

447
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,800
I've peaked.

448
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
I learned a magic trick.

449
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,280
Gonna show you today.

450
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,440
This trick is called "Switcheroo".

451
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,640
Piece of cake.

452
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,880
Just like that.

453
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,880
Now, one of these three cups

454
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,160
has something

455
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,640
under it.

456
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
Guess the right cup,

457
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,400
I pick up

458
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,360
the tab.

459
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
What if I guess wrong?

460
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,280
We go Dutch.

461
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,280
Go on, guess.

462
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,040
Choose carefully.

463
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,840
Going Dutch on this meal is gonna be expensive.

464
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,600
No clue.

465
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,320
This one?

466
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,360
Flip over and see.

467
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,880
Three, two, one.

468
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
What is this?

469
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,560
Well...

470
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,320
I bought a ring.

471
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,680
I was thinking, if you don't have

472
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,400
anything else going on,

473
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,960
maybe you could marry me?

474
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,760
Please?

475
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,520
How did you know

476
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,840
I'd pick this one?

477
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,040
Wait, two more?

478
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,000
Gotta cover all bases.

479
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,760
I bought three.

480
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,760
Pick whichever you like.

481
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,160
Styles are a bit different.

482
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,560
I'll return the other two

483
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,880
tomorrow morning.

484
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
You can return it?

485
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,200
No?

486
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,600
Probably not.

487
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,120
Li Daoqi.

488
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,920
That's a problem.

489
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:00,960
Li Daoqi.

490
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,880
You're the master of romance. Seriously.

491
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,640
If Fu Yudong had

492
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,599
had one-tenth of your skill,

493
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,359
I'd be satisfied.

494
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,440
Mostly it's just your good looks.

495
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,839
Right, didn't you say

496
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,680
you had some good news?

497
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,520
Tell us about it.

498
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,440
My sake finally arrived.

499
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,359
Let me go get it.

500
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,520
Don't wait for me.

501
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,359
Tell them now.

502
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:20,800
Nope,

503
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,880
I'll wait for you to come back.

504
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,680
Just tell them.

505
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,400
I won't, I'll wait for you.

506
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,680
Thanks, thanks.

507
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,360
Okay, go on.

508
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:33,920
Honey,

509
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,800
could you bring a few cups?

510
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,720
They are right next to you.

511
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,160
Today,

512
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,080
we have a double celebration.

513
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,160
First, Yudong and his wife

514
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,480
have returned home in glory.

515
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,800
From now on, we two can live

516
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,480
like a pot to its lid,

517
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
always together!

518
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,040
Stop messing with me.

519
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,320
Returned in glory? Come on.

520
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,160
Tell us the second one.

521
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,360
The second one.

522
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,480
That's the big one.

523
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,920
I'm getting a promotion.

524
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,360
Senior Manager.

525
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,960
Are you sure?

526
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,640
Any day now.

527
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,720
I told you,

528
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,600
Li Daoqi, I knew you could do it!

529
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,080
Gold shines wherever it goes.

530
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,800
Sake's here.

531
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,520
Drink this.

532
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
Come on.

533
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,240
Here, drink this.

534
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,000
Drink this.

535
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,680
That's great news! Congratulations!

536
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,400
Here.

537
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,680
You're a winner in life, Li Daoqi!

538
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,160
Okay, thanks.

539
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,600
You have it all now.

540
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,320
Here.

541
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:21,640
Here.

542
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,160
Hello, I'm Zhang Ran, graduated from

543
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,560
the English Department of Lucheng University.

544
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,400
I worked at Lucheng TV Station

545
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,920
as a bilingual host.

546
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,480
Looking forward to working with you.

547
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,720
Okay.

548
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,400
Just put it here then.

549
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,120
You can go now.

550
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,080
Hello, can I help you?

551
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,240
Hello, I'm Zhang Ran.

552
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,240
I have an appointment with Qian Dan

553
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,200
at 2 PM today.

554
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,640
Let me contact Ms. Qian for you.

555
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,120
Okay.

556
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,760
Please sign in first.

557
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,520
Okay, no problem.

558
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,760
Hello, Ms. Qian.

559
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,520
There's a lady at reception who says

560
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,760
she has a 2 PM meeting with you.

561
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,520
Her name is...

562
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,840
Zhang Ran.

563
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,920
Zhang Ran.

564
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,120
Okay, okay, okay.

565
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,520
I'll leave it here.

566
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,760
Please wait here for a moment.

567
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,600
Okay, thank you.

568
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,040
How many times

569
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,760
do I have to say it?

570
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,000
Once something is decided in a meeting,

571
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,120
it's final. Got it?

572
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,120
Zhang Ran.

573
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,400
Qian... Qian Dan.

574
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,280
Yes, sorry

575
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,960
to keep you waiting.

576
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
It's fine, I just arrived.

577
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,680
Nice to meet you.

578
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
You just got back yesterday, right?

579
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,520
Yes, just got back.

580
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,080
Did you get over the jet lag?

581
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,520
It's okay.

582
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,600
I don't really get jet lag.

583
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,920
So efficient.

584
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Perfect for our company.

585
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:51,840
Come on, Zhang Ran.

586
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,240
Let me give you a quick tour of

587
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,360
Tide Media.

588
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,040
The smallest live stream room.

589
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,520
We call this room

590
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
the "Nursery".

591
00:19:59,520 --> 00:19:59,960
See?

592
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,280
The streamers here have fewer than

593
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,360
100,000 followers.

594
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,960
It's basically a training ground

595
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,600
for beginners.

596
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,520
Got it.

597
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah.

598
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,560
It's by appointment only.

599
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,680
Each room has a time limit

600
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,960
for live streaming.

601
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,120
You can book them online.

602
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,440
Come, check this out.

603
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,560
These themed studios

604
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,920
are for streamers with over

605
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,240
300,000 followers.

606
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,760
They're also by appointment, but

607
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,480
we can change the background

608
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,960
to fit the streamer's needs at any time.

609
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,040
Generally speaking,

610
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,960
the streamers here

611
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,400
have relatively stable

612
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,280
fan bases.

613
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,520
Got it.

614
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,240
Got it.

615
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,480
Their streams go for

616
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,760
at least four to six hours.

617
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,320
Sometimes a single stream

618
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,440
can exceed ten hours.

619
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,200
Alright, family, come to my stream

620
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,520
and shop for clothes with confidence!

621
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,400
See?

622
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,480
This is our most efficient

623
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,320
sportswear streamer.

624
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,680
That took some real effort.

625
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
The meeting room I booked

626
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,520
is already due,

627
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,560
but why's someone still in there?

628
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,600
Just a moment.

629
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,960
Our company is always strict

630
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,280
about time efficiency.

631
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:57,920
Ms. Qian.

632
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,080
Your time is up.

633
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,120
Why haven't you finished yet?

634
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Almost done. Just need another twenty minutes.

635
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Having a retrospective meeting here.

636
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,080
Almost...

637
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,840
You have five minutes.

638
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,960
Gotta wait five minutes.

639
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,160
I'll show you around a bit more.

640
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,000
Sure, sure.

641
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,320
Careful.

642
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,520
We're still live,

643
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,360
we can't cut the stream.

644
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,440
This is a new livestream format

645
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,720
we developed,

646
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,760
set right here in our company.

647
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,520
Over here is our meeting room.

648
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,760
They're picking products for the

649
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,440
special stream the day after tomorrow.

650
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,320
And this is

651
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,040
a mid-size streaming zone.

652
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,520
We call it the Hive.

653
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,040
The Hive.

654
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,320
Right. The idea is

655
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,520
our streamers are like worker bees,

656
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,280
working hard to make money

657
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,440
for the company.

658
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,080
Got it.

659
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,360
To stream in this area,

660
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,480
you need over

661
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,320
100 thousand followers.

662
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,400
They're in

663
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,360
a growth phase,

664
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,920
so we give them more fine-tuned support

665
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
to break through the plateau

666
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,520
and boost followers,

667
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,000
engagement and conversion.

668
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,400
Dan.

669
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,360
Perfect timing, let me introduce you.

670
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,680
This is our boss,

671
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,400
Lin Chang.

672
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,120
Lin Chang.

673
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,360
Hi, I'm Zhang Ran.

674
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,800
You look so young! Are you from the 90s?

675
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,360
New face.

676
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,240
Total newbie.

677
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,120
She's here to meet us today.

678
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,240
Yeah, I used to

679
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
host shows

680
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,520
at Lucheng City TV,

681
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,440
but that was many years ago.

682
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
Nice to meet you.

683
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,520
Nice to meet you too.

684
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,200
I'm Lin Chang.

685
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,840
Lin Chang.

686
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,920
Welcome

687
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,000
to the family.

688
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,800
Thank you.

689
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,680
I'll be in your care.

690
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,880
If you need anything, come to my office.

691
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,120
Okay, no problem.

692
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,360
Our boss is really young.

693
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:16,800
Yeah.

694
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,520
Ms. Qian,

695
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,480
there's a

696
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,960
talent-streamer audition this afternoon.

697
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,360
Rou's friend.

698
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,560
Please look out for her.

699
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,480
Sure, no problem.

700
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,680
He looks so young.

701
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,320
He is.

702
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,040
He's also really fun

703
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,360
and super talented.

704
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,000
Come on,

705
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,560
I'll keep showing you

706
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,320
around the Hive.

707
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:35,720
Okay.

708
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
New followers

709
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,120
and live viewers are shown

710
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,960
in real time on the LED screens.

711
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,560
Li Qian, your numbers are dropping.

712
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,360
Guys, hang on a sec,

713
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:43,960
we'll be right...

714
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,560
See?

715
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,240
If their followers drop below

716
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,360
100 thousand,

717
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,280
they have to move back

718
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,800
to the training studio we saw earlier

719
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,120
and start over.

720
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,560
Right.

721
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,480
Look at this one.

722
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,160
His recent numbers

723
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,200
are bad.

724
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,560
The content's stale.

725
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
It's hard to keep fans.

726
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,600
At this rate,

727
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,440
he'll be out soon.

728
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,200
Only two likes?

729
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,320
I kind of want to give him one.

730
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,160
Turn around.

731
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,920
This is Tide Media's

732
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,680
master control screen.

733
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,520
All the streamers' live data

734
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,760
scrolls here.

735
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,240
We can see

736
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,120
everyone's performance anytime;

737
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,400
- it's all open and transparent.
- Got it.

738
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,560
This is our

739
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,680
top female streamer's lounge

740
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,880
and studio.

741
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,000
Tide Media's No.1 girl, Lin Anran.

742
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,200
You must know her.

743
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,120
Yeah.

744
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,000
She's gorgeous.

745
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:28,960
Sorry,

746
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,720
I need to take this.

747
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,760
No worries.

748
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,400
Hello?

749
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,760
[The contract cannot be changed,]

750
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,320
[okay?]

751
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,120
[Payment terms are not up for discussion.]

752
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,160
[Stop wasting my time.]

753
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,960
You know Lin Anran, don't you?

754
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,800
Of course.

755
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,040
So don't stress.

756
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,000
Even she

757
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,120
started in the training studio

758
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,480
and worked her way up here.

759
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,360
Understood.

760
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,960
- Hi.
- Dan.

761
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,280
You look stunning.

762
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,440
Stunning? I'm a total mess

763
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,360
and swamped!

764
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,120
Going live soon?

765
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,400
Yeah, yeah,

766
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,080
starting in ten minutes.

767
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,560
Go, go.

768
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,040
Okay.

769
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,080
Anran.

770
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,360
Jesus.

771
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,280
You look amazing today.

772
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,360
I'll send you a little gift,

773
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,560
hope you go full firepower tonight.

774
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,680
Full firepower.

775
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,560
All right, go crush it.

776
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,240
I'll head out.

777
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:06,920
Okay.

778
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,560
Dan.

779
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,680
No need. Knowing Anran

780
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,160
has you covered.

781
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:10,880
Come on,

782
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,760
Zhang Ran,

783
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,920
this is our

784
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,280
famous "Bro Erge".

785
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,240
Bro Erge is the one with glasses?

786
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:16,800
No,

787
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,920
the one with glasses

788
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,040
is his assistant.

789
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,600
"Bro Erge" is about to have lunch.

790
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,320
He's the No.1

791
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,400
pet-content creator

792
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,080
right now.

793
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,760
Come, over here.

794
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,560
This is our makeup room,

795
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,680
shared for

796
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,480
everyone.

797
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:32,920
Got it.

798
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,400
Any streamer can book a slot

799
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,200
to do their makeup here.

800
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,840
Okay.

801
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,920
Ms. Dan.

802
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,840
Hi.

803
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,760
Nice, very creative.

804
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,080
Yeah.

805
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,880
Impressive.

806
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,840
Dan, I actually did some homework

807
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,120
before I came

808
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,360
and prepped

809
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,080
a bunch of materials for finance shows.

810
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,200
But after

811
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,280
this tour,

812
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,720
I feel like that might

813
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,680
not be very useful here.

814
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,640
It's fine. You're serious about this,

815
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,640
that's good.

816
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,840
I really did watch your show

817
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,640
back then,

818
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,040
but now,

819
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
the channels for entertainment

820
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,480
have totally shifted.

821
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,080
Right.

822
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,680
So I need you

823
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,000
to be mentally prepared

824
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,760
to start from scratch.

825
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,040
My old show

826
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,520
actually had pretty decent influence.

827
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,440
And after that,

828
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,480
I did a current-affairs lifestyle show

829
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,600
for two years.

830
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,200
In a place like Lucheng City,

831
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,560
I wouldn't say

832
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,160
everyone knows my name,

833
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,040
but when people see me,

834
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,840
they usually think,

835
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,000
"She looks familiar."

836
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,200
But that was then.

837
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,760
Let's talk about now, okay?

838
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,560
Right now, it's all about data.

839
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,280
Everything

840
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,720
lives or dies by numbers.

841
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,160
Do you know

842
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,520
the Qiandu search index

843
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,560
for the No.1

844
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,480
female streamer in the business,

845
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,440
Lady Wan?

846
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,320
No.

847
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,680
25,089.

848
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,240
Do you know our company's No.1 girl,

849
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,680
Lin Anran's index?

850
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,720
13,521.

851
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,320
Do you know what Zhang Ran is at?

852
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,240
How much?

853
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,680
In 2011,

854
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,280
when you were still hosting

855
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,720
at the TV station,

856
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,760
your peak

857
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,360
was 3,089.

858
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,160
Your average that year

859
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,760
was 380.6.

860
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,680
Today,

861
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,480
right this second,

862
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,280
it's 30.

863
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,880
Which means

864
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,040
that on today's internet,

865
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,800
"Zhang Ran" equals a nobody.

866
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,720
Got it.

867
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,960
I know

868
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,400
these numbers

869
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
are hard to swallow.

870
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,160
I brought you back

871
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,560
from overseas.

872
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,600
I'm definitely not here

873
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,840
to tear you down.

874
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,200
But I have to

875
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,360
be honest with you.

876
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,600
Zhang Ran, I really had to

877
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,840
push for you when we

878
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,080
discussed your contract.

879
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,880
I got a lot of pushback,

880
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,360
but I believe in you.

881
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,880
Like you said,

882
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,200
you've got a foundation.

883
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,480
I believe

884
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,320
you can become a top-tier streamer.

885
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,800
Dan, how about this:

886
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,720
young people

887
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,200
might not be

888
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,720
that into finance shows.

889
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,280
What if we do

890
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,600
overseas-lifestyle content instead?

891
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,640
I mean, I do have that advantage,

892
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
since I've just

893
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,800
come back from abroad.

894
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,280
I could share

895
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,800
what I've eaten,

896
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,880
what I've seen,

897
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,440
fun places,

898
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,480
cool stuff,

899
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,080
be an

900
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,920
overseas-lifestyle creator.

901
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,560
Do you think that's possible?

902
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,000
Do you know

903
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,120
why we actually want to sign you?

904
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,880
You said

905
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,080
you watched my show,

906
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,520
so you're one of my fans.

907
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,320
I thought maybe

908
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,760
it was my skills,

909
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,240
or

910
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,600
my on-camera experience.

911
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,360
And there

912
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,840
was that meme sticker of me...

913
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,360
Finally, you've hit it.

914
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,000
We're signing you

915
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,640
because of that meme,

916
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,440
and only because of that meme.

917
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,200
At Tide Media,

918
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,160
we incubate lots of new streamers

919
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,440
every year.

920
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,840
We've built a very

921
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
systematic training program.

922
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,240
As long as

923
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,200
you stick with us,

924
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,960
you'll level up at light speed.

925
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,760
This is

926
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,240
our rookie training area.

927
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,200
We put everyone on the same floor

928
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,480
as the CEO

929
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,920
and our top streamers

930
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,400
to create

931
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,600
a stronger

932
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,720
atmosphere,

933
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,720
so everyone pushes themselves.

934
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,680
We treat all streamers

935
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,800
the same.

936
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,000
It's all data-driven,

937
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,680
fair, open, transparent.

938
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,280
Every bit of effort and progress

939
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,320
is rewarded immediately.

940
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,280
Lin Anran is just

941
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,480
the first star streamer

942
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,720
we built.

943
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,120
There will be a second,

944
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,160
a third.

945
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,600
What we can promise is:

946
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,200
once you join Tide Media,

947
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,800
the path up is wide open.

948
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,240
Look over here,

949
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,280
this is shade 152.

950
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,720
The girl in white

951
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,840
is wearing

952
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,280
152 today.

953
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,200
It makes her skin

954
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,640
look super, super fair.

955
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,200
Blow everyone

956
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,400
a little kiss.

957
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,080
I want it, I want it.

958
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,800
You want it?

959
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,080
Okay, ready,

960
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,440
three, two, one.

961
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,560
With all the stress people face,

962
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,400
the "Desperate Shopper" persona

963
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,840
is

964
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,800
really appealing.

965
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,080
Think about it when you get home.

966
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,480
I'll send you

967
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,600
an e-copy of the contract.

968
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
Go through it,

969
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,640
and give me an answer within a week.

970
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,480
Okay, no problem.

971
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,760
Thank you for today.

972
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,200
Sure.

973
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,840
I'll head back then.

974
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,560
Okay, bye.

975
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:19,960
Bye.

976
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,640
Ms. Liao, right?

977
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
I'm Qian Dan.

978
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,120
Sorry

979
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,080
to keep you waiting. Come in,

980
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I've been dying to meet you.

981
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,520
Did you sleep okay last night?

982
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,440
Let me show you,

983
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,920
this is one of our

984
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,200
small streaming studios.

985
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,520
You don't need to walk me out.

986
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,160
Get back.

987
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,840
Why would I go back?

988
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,080
My car's right at the gate.

989
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,400
I'll call a driver to take you home.

990
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,920
That's too much trouble.

991
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,200
I already booked a car online.

992
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,920
What did you book a car for?

993
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,240
Don't.

994
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,600
My car's right there,

995
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,960
I'll just get a driver.

996
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,520
Look,

997
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,960
it'll be here any second.

998
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,000
Okay, no wonder you've got a PhD,

999
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,640
you've already

1000
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,840
figured out the ride-hailing apps.

1001
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,000
Seamless transition.

1002
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,920
Impressed, huh?

1003
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,840
Not bad.

1004
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,960
I'm off.

1005
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,360
Take it slow.

1006
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,680
Let's go play soccer sometime.

1007
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,120
Write me a letter.

1008
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,680
You got it.

1009
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,800
Can I change the destination?

1010
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,120
Not going to the sugar factory anymore?

1011
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,080
Can we go to Lucheng University?

1012
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,320
You booked the car on your phone,

1013
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,000
you have to change the address

1014
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
on your phone.

1015
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,320
How? I'm not great with this.

1016
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,800
Check in your order details.

1017
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,960
Found it?

1018
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,800
You can start heading that way.

1019
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,600
I should have it changed

1020
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,920
in a second.

1021
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,400
All right.

1022
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,080
You're back.

1023
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,920
Here, have some water.

1024
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Thanks, thank you.

1025
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,880
Don't be so polite.

1026
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,600
When did you get back?

1027
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,360
You didn't say a word in advance.

1028
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,400
I could've asked Daoqi to pick you up.

1029
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,679
We just got back yesterday.

1030
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,920
Well,

1031
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,080
I went over

1032
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,520
to Daoqi's place at noon.

1033
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,560
They're doing pretty well.

1034
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,480
Yeah, yeah,

1035
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,120
Daoqi's doing great.

1036
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,280
He often brings the kids over to see us.

1037
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,760
Well,

1038
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,280
I'll go make dinner.

1039
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,040
You're eating here tonight.

1040
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,639
I'll even go buy a fish.

1041
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,040
No need.

1042
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,840
Just wait for me, wait here.

1043
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,760
Really, you don't have to.

1044
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,400
Just stay and eat, it'll be quick.

1045
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,080
Have a good chat with your dad.

1046
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,080
I'm really not staying for dinner.

1047
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
Just wait, I'll be quick.

1048
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,600
Slow down!

1049
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,120
She's always like that,

1050
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,560
rushing around.

1051
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,560
Yudong,

1052
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,520
look, she even poured you water.

1053
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,080
Come on, have some.

1054
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,720
How long

1055
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,200
are you planning to stay this time?

1056
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,560
Not sure yet.

1057
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,760
Depends.

1058
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,080
Are you

1059
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,520
still working that security job?

1060
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,680
Yeah, still at it.

1061
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,960
Three days on, one day off.

1062
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,280
Easy work.

1063
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,080
Otherwise

1064
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,360
I'd be bored at home.

1065
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,240
I'm too old to just sit around all day.

1066
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,920
This time you came back,

1067
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,520
your wife, Zhang Ran...

1068
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,080
She's fine,

1069
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,640
she's doing good.

1070
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,760
I should get going.

1071
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,720
I... Are you...

1072
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,360
are you keeping well?

1073
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,000
Yeah, I'm fine.

1074
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,560
Okay, I'm heading out then.

1075
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,920
Yudong, don't go.

1076
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,200
She went out to buy groceries.

1077
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,480
Thank her for me.

1078
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,720
Just stay and eat, you...

1079
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,520
What are you looking at?

1080
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,280
Who's Zhu Danwei?

1081
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,320
Who?

1082
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,600
Zhu Danwei.

1083
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,440
"There's no perfect ending.

1084
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,840
I'll always miss you."

1085
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,880
Does this person still miss you now?

1086
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,040
Guess so.

1087
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,720
And he wrote

1088
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,800
his first impression

1089
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,440
was that you were hard to approach.

1090
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,000
Hahaha.

1091
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:56,960
Yeah?

1092
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:57,920
Close that.

1093
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,960
Let me tell you about

1094
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,800
the company I went to today.

1095
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,440
It blew my mind.

1096
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,400
The moment I walked in,

1097
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,880
Qian Dan took me around.

1098
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,880
The place is huge,

1099
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,480
like a maze.

1100
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,560
Every streamer

1101
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,880
is in a little cubicle.

1102
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,240
All glass, transparent,

1103
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,240
everyone outside can see in.

1104
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,200
She took me

1105
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,440
from one entrance

1106
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,000
and we just kept walking and walking.

1107
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,000
I swear, it was eye-opening,

1108
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,840
really,

1109
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,720
you can't even picture it.

1110
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,040
Super grand.

1111
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,720
She said

1112
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,960
those glass rooms

1113
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,920
are called the Hive,

1114
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,000
and those streamers

1115
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,720
really are like worker bees,

1116
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,040
buzzing around,

1117
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,040
busy non-stop.

1118
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,240
I was stunned.

1119
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,480
Every type of person you can think of.

1120
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,520
There was this girl

1121
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,640
with horror-movie makeup,

1122
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,240
her whole face covered in fake blood,

1123
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,320
singing and dancing in there.

1124
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,280
Scared me half to death.

1125
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,280
The others

1126
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,720
just walked in circles

1127
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,720
as they streamed.

1128
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,080
Let me show you this photo.

1129
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,920
It really shocked me.

1130
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,960
I thought something had happened to her.

1131
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,680
See?

1132
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,040
She's lying there, asleep.

1133
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,960
There's a bucket next to her.

1134
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,360
When she's thirsty,

1135
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,160
she pulls a tube

1136
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,000
over to herself

1137
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,920
and just sips

1138
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,040
like this.

1139
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,240
I watched her

1140
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,200
pull the blanket up

1141
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,280
and instantly start snoring.

1142
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,960
How exhausted must she be?

1143
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,040
Look,

1144
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,440
look at this one.

1145
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,120
What are you scrolling there?

1146
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,520
I recorded it on purpose

1147
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,320
to show you later.

1148
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,320
I won't deny it,

1149
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,840
there really was a golden age

1150
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,320
for overseas returnees.

1151
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,360
But

1152
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,400
in this era,

1153
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,160
whether you studied abroad or not

1154
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
doesn't matter that much anymore.

1155
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,320
What employers need has changed.

1156
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,400
If you put my resume

1157
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,640
into today's market,

1158
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,640
I honestly wouldn't be competitive.

1159
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,840
Don't sell yourself short.

1160
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,360
You, not competitive?

1161
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,880
No, I'm just being honest.

1162
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,200
I really did ride the wave

1163
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,040
of my times,

1164
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,040
and I have to admit that.

1165
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,840
But Yudong,

1166
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,160
just so you know,

1167
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,160
things are different now.

1168
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,640
I'm mentally prepared.

1169
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:52,760
My wife says

1170
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,040
she's not willing to just give up.

1171
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,280
She wants

1172
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,320
to come back and take a shot.

1173
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,400
If that's how she feels,

1174
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,040
then I have to be there for her.

1175
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,960
But there is a cost

1176
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,520
to all this trial and error.

1177
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,440
Our situation's different.

1178
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,800
I was doing renovation work

1179
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,000
in Canada, remember?

1180
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,920
Worst case,

1181
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,320
I just go back and do what I did before.

1182
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,120
Don't be a downer.

1183
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,280
They just got back.

1184
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,160
I'm not,

1185
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,600
I'm just telling the truth.

1186
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,960
You have no idea,

1187
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,360
blue-collar work overseas

1188
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,280
makes really good money,

1189
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,320
sometimes more than white-collar,

1190
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,880
and the schedule's more flexible.

1191
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,440
But you still had to come back.

1192
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,640
He has a PhD

1193
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,960
from a top university.

1194
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,200
Doing renovation work abroad

1195
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,560
is such a waste of his talent.

1196
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
So pitiful.

1197
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,560
Fu Yudong.

1198
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,040
Fu Yudong?

1199
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
It's really tough.

1200
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,400
You used to be

1201
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,560
a well-known TV host,

1202
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,040
and now you have to do things like this.

1203
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,200
So what?

1204
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,120
I can start over.

1205
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,080
I know I can pull it off.

1206
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,360
It's just too hard on you.

1207
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,080
It's fine, really.

1208
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,080
Can we maybe not do this?

1209
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,160
I won't push myself that hard.

1210
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,160
Are you sleepy?

1211
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,600
Maybe my jet lag still isn't fixed.

1212
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,200
I'm going to sleep.

1213
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,920
Don't worry,

1214
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,200
this is really what I'm good at.

1215
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,680
The gap between me and them

1216
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,720
is like earth and sky.

1217
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,120
This is their master control wall.

1218
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,280
If I do well one day,

1219
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,560
I'll get my picture up here.

1220
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,120
Look at this dog,

1221
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,760
worth more than we are.

1222
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,280
Even has a little bow tie.

1223
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,520
Look at him eat.

1224
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,680
His name's "Bro Erge".

1225
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,480
This one's Lin Anran,

1226
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,560
I secretly snapped it

1227
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
outside her door.

1228
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,040
I totally get

1229
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,560
where both of you are coming from.

1230
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,120
Li Daoqi

1231
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,360
is the best brother

1232
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,560
I've ever had.

1233
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,360
Everything he says is for my own good.

1234
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,440
That's why he pushes me.

1235
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,440
And you're my favorite sister-in-law.

1236
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,360
You'd never

1237
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,240
mean any harm.

1238
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,840
Before I left Canada,

1239
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,160
I put everything

1240
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
into storage.

1241
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,160
I left really early that morning,

1242
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,560
before sunrise.

1243
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,280
I drove past a stretch of woods,

1244
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,480
and just as I came out of

1245
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,600
the last bend,

1246
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,480
the sun popped up

1247
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,240
right in front of me.

1248
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,720
That's when it hit me:

1249
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,400
the next time I saw the sunrise,

1250
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,080
I'd already be back in China.

1251
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,360
And that's when I realized:

1252
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,640
I hadn't even thought about

1253
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,840
what I was going to do.

1254
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,960
Zhang Ran wants to chase her dream.

1255
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,120
I have to have her back.

1256
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,040
But with what?

1257
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,080
How can I support her?

1258
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,000
It's just...

1259
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,560
I haven't been back in so many years.

1260
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,040
Now that I'm here,

1261
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,880
everything

1262
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,440
feels too fast. I feel like...

1263
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,320
I can't keep up with anything.

1264
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,200
I feel a bit lost.

1265
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,720
With me here, don't be lost.

1266
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,120
And if you are, don't be scared.

1267
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:26,600
Really.

1268
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,480
Don't be afraid of being lost.

1269
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,000
A toast to being lost.

1270
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,640
To a bright future.

1271
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,160
To being lost.

1272
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,800
To being lost.

1273
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,520
To being lost.

1274
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,160
You feel sad?

1275
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,200
I'm okay.

1276
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,280
Don't feel sad.
