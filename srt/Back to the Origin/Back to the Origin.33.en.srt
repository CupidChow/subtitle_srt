1
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,560
Xiaohe's on board.

2
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,360
She'll remove

3
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,720
the post tomorrow

4
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,840
and issue a statement.

5
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,720
Once

6
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,079
that's done

7
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,120
and we clean things up

8
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,040
PR-wise,

9
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,440
we can put this behind us.

10
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,000
We should

11
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,280
head in now.

12
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,440
You don't get it,

13
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,920
this isn't going away.

14
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,680
I'm being followed.

15
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,000
Right there,

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,920
hiding,

17
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
watching.

18
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,720
They found

19
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
my place.

20
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,880
Everyone has it...

21
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,680
It's all over the internet.

22
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,440
Here,

23
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,320
here,

24
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,840
everywhere...

25
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,320
here...

26
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,720
- All over...
- Easy.

27
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,480
Just breathe.

28
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,520
It's OK.

29
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
Trust me,

30
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,320
It'll die down soon.

31
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,360
It's OK.

32
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,400
It's OK.

33
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,640
I've got you.

34
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,079
After the livestream tonight,

35
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,920
I'll drive you home.

36
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,320
Promise.

37
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,800
Drive me home, really?

38
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,320
I will.

39
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:54,680
You mean it?

40
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,360
I do.

41
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,040
I'll stay with you.

42
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,720
We can't cancel it.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,400
This is her first show since

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,080
she peaked.

45
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,680
The sponsors are all here.

46
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,480
I barely

47
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,640
convinced them to stay.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,560
It's non-negotiable.

49
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,240
She's completely

50
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
falling apart!

51
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,079
[She can't take]

52
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,240
[any more pressure.]

53
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,600
[Those trolls]

54
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,480
[and hate comments]

55
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,800
[are eating her alive.]

56
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,920
[She's totally checked out!]

57
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,640
[She is]

58
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,920
[our talent,]

59
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,400
[we need to have her back!]

60
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,360
[If she goes live like this,]

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,880
[it'll be a train wreck,]

62
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,920
and our reputation

63
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,480
will tank!

64
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,159
Stay with her.

65
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,720
Keep her in check.

66
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,800
If we cancel it,

67
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,640
we'll be in debt forever

68
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,760
with these penalties.

69
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,760
Anran,

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,880
you've been crushing it.

71
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,160
We've overcome

72
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,480
so many challenges together.

73
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,680
My trust

74
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,640
in you is absolute,

75
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,920
far beyond

76
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,080
what I have in myself.

77
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,240
This is just

78
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,920
a minor hurdle from fate.

79
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,960
Clear this,

80
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,920
and you'll reach Lady Wan's level.

81
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,080
What's gonna happen

82
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,360
if I bail on this?

83
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,920
I think you already know.

84
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,440
Time for some magic!

85
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,680
Watch one become five!

86
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,480
Spicy!

87
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,720
Sawadika!

88
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,760
Time to win big!

89
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,120

folks!

100
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,640
Link one is limited to

101
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,400

Here's

104
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,120
everyone's favorite,

105
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,240
perfect for

106
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,360
snacking straight

107
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,120
from the pack!

108
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,800
C'mon,

109
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,080
let's give it a try!

110
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,600
Yeah,

111
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,840
since they're

112
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,320
baked

113
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,520
instead of fried,

114
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,840
you can just munch on them.

115
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,880
But add water,

116
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,400
and you'll

117
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,600
get this whole flavor experience.

118
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah, water takes it

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,480
to the next level.

120
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
Let's grab some water

121
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
and a bowl.

122
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,200
We'll see

123
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,080
how amazing

124
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,280
these taste,

125
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,840
yeah?

126
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,760
Let's

127
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,000
prep it,

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,480
and

129
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,760
Anran'll give it a try.

130
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,640
Sounds good?

131
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,280
You can just snack it dry!

132
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,080
Hey...

133
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,800
[Delete them now!]

134
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,000
[On it!]

135
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,120
[Hey, the bowl...]

136
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,400
[One sec, folks!]

137
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,760
[Let me open this up...]

138
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,360
Hey, Anran...

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,400
That's the

140
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,280
old package...

141
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,440
[Got the munchies, huh?]

142
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,520
[Sure, eat it dry...]

143
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,320
[but...]

144
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,520
[Anran? Anran...]

145
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,040
Mr. Lin,

146
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,000
someone's taking

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,080
her home.

148
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,920
She won't be

149
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,280
alone tonight.

150
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,920
The sponsors...

151
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,040
How are you gonna

152
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,680
handle this disaster?

153
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,680
So...

154
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,800
I told you to

155
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,120
keep her in check.

156
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,040
Well?

157
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,360
You're running things

158
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,480
around here.

159
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,920
We're going public!

160
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,640
I made it clear

161
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,080
how crucial this live was,

162
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
and you

163
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,000
blew it all up!

164
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,600
Let me go...

165
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,840
I spent years building this

166
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,520
from scratch,

167
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,200
supporting everyone here,

168
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,680
and you

169
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,680
managed to tank it in days...

170
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,200
I tanked it?

171
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,400
Lin Chang,

172
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,360
cut to the chase.

173
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,440
Want me to quit

174
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,360
and be

175
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,320
your scapegoat?

176
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,400
Been thinking

177
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,520
firing you would

178
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,480
show accountability,

179
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,680
but I just can't PULL THE TRIGGER!

180
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,160
Stop imitating me!

181
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,240
Just can't bring myself to it!

182
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,040
I imitate you, so what?

183
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,440
Try talk normal!

184
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,560
You're slow

185
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,480
and clumsy with words!

186
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,320
Everyone here

187
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,600
mocks how you talk!

188
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,160
Hey,

189
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,200
we should hire

190
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,000
a streamer to mimic you!

191
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,440
Your incompetence

192
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,080
and ego

193
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,600
wrecked everything!

194
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,560
Now you're playing

195
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,400
the blame game!

196
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,480
Be a man!

197
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,520
Outrageous!

198
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,920
Get out!

199
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,440
Dream on about your IPO!

200
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,440
Everything's toast,

201
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,160
what good is a scapegoat now?

202
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,760
OUT! GET OUT!

203
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,920
You're screwed!

204
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,920
OUT!

205
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,920
Go see a doctor!

206
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,080
[Mr. Lin, what is it?]

207
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,840
Zhang Ran,

208
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,840
have you heard

209
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,320
what happened to Anran?

210
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,800
[Just got filled in.]

211
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,280
I feel terrible.

212
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,760
First you, now her.

213
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,560
[It's eating me up.]

214
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,080
Don't beat yourself up.

215
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,480
It's not on you.

216
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,040
[I've been thinking hard.]

217
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,520
I put too much faith in Qian Dan.

218
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,920
[She threw you under the bus]

219
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,360
[thinking it would save Anran,]

220
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,920
[but]

221
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,680
[it ruined both of you.]

222
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,200
You're all

223
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,040
family to me.

224
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,560
I've always seen you

225
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,960
as my children.

226
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,120
[But Qian Dan]

227
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,760
[only saw numbers and profits.]

228
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,360
She never got it.

229
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,960
I never

230
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,800
managed to change

231
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,040
her perspective.

232
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,560
That's my failure.

233
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,160
Honestly,

234
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,480
I understand

235
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,120
Ms. Qian's position,

236
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,880
yeah...

237
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,440
[I can't understand it.]

238
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,920
[She's gone now.]

239
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,920
[When crisis hit,]

240
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,640
she didn't protect

241
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,840
either of you.

242
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,240
Real talk,

243
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,320
after you deleted your account,

244
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,840
I couldn't sleep for days.

245
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,160
trying to find a way to help,

246
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,640
but you impressed me,

247
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,880
[fighting your way]

248
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,400
[back up alone.]

249
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,320
Nah,

250
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,360
my new account's

251
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,280
barely making it.

252
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,160
Not even

253
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,640
half my old following.

254
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,280
Zhang Ran,

255
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,600
your resilience is remarkable.

256
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,640
You've earned

257
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,320
every bit of your success.

258
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,840
Would you return

259
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,760
and help me out?

260
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,160
You're my only hope now.

261
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,000
I...

262
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,480
[If something's holding you back...]

263
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,000
No, no,

264
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,280
that's not it.

265
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,200
Just...

266
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,120
[wasn't expecting this.]

267
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,440
[Kinda surprised.]

268
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,280
Mind if I...

269
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,000
think it over?

270
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,520
Need to process this.

271
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,400
Perfect!

272
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Can't wait to

273
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,160
have you back!

274
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,560
Hi.

275
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,120
Hello,

276
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,240
is this Lin Anran's place?

277
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,160
May I ask who you are?

278
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,320
I'm her friend,

279
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,760
coming to visit.

280
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,720
This is for her.

281
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,080
OK, just a sec.

282
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,960
Alright.

283
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,720
Come on in.

284
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,720
Heard

285
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,560
lots of people quit.

286
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,680
Everyone thinks

287
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,040
they did you wrong.

288
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,200
Can we...

289
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,880
avoid company talk?

290
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,480
OK.

291
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,160
Take a sip.

292
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,760
Yeah.

293
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,200
Sweet, right?

294
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,400
It's good.

295
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,680
Zhang Ran,

296
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,280
you're

297
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,040
the first coworker to visit.

298
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,480
Though honestly,

299
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,720
this place ain't feel like home.

300
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,600
The housekeeper's here

301
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,240
more than I am.

302
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,040
Anran,

303
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,320
your courtyard's really nice.

304
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,120
While you're resting,

305
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,600
should make

306
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,520
the most of it.

307
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,320
Sunlight is healing.

308
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,240
Look,

309
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,040
that's

310
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,000
a red plumeria tree.

311
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,520
Ever seen one?

312
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,560
Yeah.

313
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,080
You have?

314
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,120
Yeah.

315
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,400
Never saw one before.

316
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,080
Can't even name

317
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,320
half the plants in my yard.

318
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,600
There are so many,

319
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,880
all unknown to me.

320
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,960
Gotta get to

321
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,200
know them now.

322
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,080
Remember

323
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,360
I told you

324
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,040
followers were the real friends?

325
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,520
I was wrong.

326
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,040
Lost all my followers,

327
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,040
but found a true friend instead.

328
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,400
Me too.

329
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,760
This true friend

330
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,880
should visit more.

331
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,320
Anran,

332
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,480
just wanted to check on you.

333
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,640
Glad you're OK.

334
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,839
I'll head out.

335
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,920
Take it easy.

336
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:13,880
Zhang Ran,

337
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,520
I'm grateful.

338
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,079
Take care.

339
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,160
See you.

340
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,880
[Cost price, wild-caught.]

341
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,480
[I'll have some.]

342
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,120
[Weigh it right, yeah?]

343
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,880
[Sure!]

344
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,320
[54, ma'am.]

345
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,040
[OK.]

346
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,840
[Alrighty.]

347
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
[OK.]

348
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,120
Anything else?

349
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,120
Got snails.

350
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,120
Looks good.

351
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,000
Here's 16 back.

352
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,280
See you soon, ma'am!

353
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:41,960
Thanks!

354
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,600
Here's the money.

355
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,280
OK, one sec.

356
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Hey, Zhang Ran!

357
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,280
Let me get you some crabs.

358
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,840
No, thanks,

359
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,640
don't bother.

360
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,600
OK.

361
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,760
Hey, what's up?

362
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,560
Finish up first,

363
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,800
just want a quick chat.

364
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,960
Yeah, sure.

365
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,960
Let's move over there,

366
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,720
smells better.

367
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,760
Just letting you know.

368
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,720
Company wants me back.

369
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,360
Still thinking it through.

370
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,320
Wanted your take on it.

371
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,680
That's great.

372
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,600
But

373
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,920
it's your call.

374
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,080
Can't decide

375
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,920
this one for you,

376
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,520
right?

377
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,440
I came hoping

378
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,480
you'd go back

379
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,000
with me.

380
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,560
It'd put my mind at ease.

381
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,320
But watching

382
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,280
you work,

383
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,240
seeing how content you are...

384
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,120
It's a personal call indeed.

385
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,240
Truth is,

386
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,400
I'm surprised

387
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,840
how much I love this.

388
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,800
That old job?

389
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,720
Wasn't clicking.

390
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,680
Hated it.

391
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,480
Felt like hard work

392
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,520
meant nothing.

393
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,800
Feel you.

394
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,480
This is different.

395
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,000
Work hard, see results.

396
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,160
After what went down last time,

397
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,200
still

398
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,440
bugs me though.

399
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,960
I deleted the App, too.

400
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,680
But

401
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,720
you're special.

402
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,200
You know your path.

403
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,960
Just do what feels

404
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,440
right,

405
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,680
y'know?

406
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:19,840
Got it.

407
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,640
Keep doing

408
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,120
what makes you happy.

409
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,120
Will do.

410
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,440
If someday, big if,

411
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,680
you change your mind,

412
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,880
you're always welcome.

413
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,000
Thanks.

414
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,200
Since you're all set,

415
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
here, something sweet.

416
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,400
Got this from an old lady

417
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:42,960
this morning.

418
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,800
Let this pop

419
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,240
bring you good fortune!

420
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Take care, Bo.

421
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,080
Keep in touch.

422
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,720
OK.

423
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,000
Goodbye then.

424
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,240
OK.

425
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:00,960
Hey.

426
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,760
Rock it!

427
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,320
Yeah.

428
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,320
Mr. Lin!

429
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,200
Thanks!

430
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,040
Welcome home.

431
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,960
Thanks, Boss!

432
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,320
I'm...ah, flattered...

433
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,520
Alright.

434
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,680
Welcome home, Ran!

435
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
Hi, guys!

436
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,200
Ran, welcome home!

437
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,280
Welcome home!

438
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,040
Been a while.

439
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,440
Hey, hi!

440
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,360
Welcome back!

441
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,000
Hey, hey!

442
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,920
Welcome back!

443
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Whoa!

444
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,120
Hi everyone!

445
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,120
Long time no see.

446
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,680
Hello, hello!

447
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,760
Where to?

448
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,160
Ran, welcome home!

449
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,680
Thank you so much!

450
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Welcome home!

451
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,200
Thanks guys!

452
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,040
Let's do it!

453
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,080
Do it!

454
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,440
You're the most captain-like person

455
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,960
I know.

456
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,200
Not sure how long

457
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,040
I can keep playing captain.

458
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,800
The real storm's arrived.

459
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,480
Without Anran,

460
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,920
we've lost substantial business.

461
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,520
Wanna help me

462
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,600
run this ship?

463
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,920
Not built for that.

464
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,880
You've got this!

465
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,240
Since you brought me back,

466
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,680
you've got my full support!

467
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,920
Rough times

468
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,680
reveal true allies!

469
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,280
Zhang Ran,

470
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,440
I got it all sorted out.

471
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,000
First thing we gotta do

472
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,000
is to build your new image

473
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,600
on what you've

474
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,280
already got.

475
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,160
Keep your old fans,

476
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,240
grab new ones.

477
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,600
Most importantly,

478
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,640
finding your

479
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,120
selling niche.

480
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,920
Clearer the niche,

481
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,120
better the money.

482
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,560
Check this out.

483
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,560
That's a lot!

484
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,680
I listed all the

485
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,200
trending personas.

486
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,160
Take a look.

487
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,880
First up: rich pretty girl.

488
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,600
Rich pretty girl...

489
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,880
Nah...

490
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,840
Their followers

491
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,200
want

492
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,720
that lifestyle.

493
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,360
Got it.

494
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,240
So it sells well.

495
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,200
I was comedy before.

496
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,760
It doesn't really work.

497
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,040
True.

498
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,720
Check out option two.

499
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,160
OK.

500
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,200
Perfect mom.

501
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,040
Chinese folks are crazy about kids.

502
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,800
They'll be frugal themselves

503
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,320
but spend big on kids.

504
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,880
Yeah,

505
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,800
but I've got no kids.

506
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,920
Make one!

507
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,720
Ugh...

508
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,600
That's not...

509
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
something that...

510
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,760
happens instantly...

511
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,960
When they're older,

512
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,680
you can do education stuff,

513
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,680
then have another,

514
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,680
maybe three!

515
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,000
Kids aren't my thing...

516
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,680
How come?

517
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,080
I can't do it.

518
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,200
You can't?

519
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,760
Or your husband can't?

520
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,960
No, not physical inability...

521
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,040
moral inability.

522
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,360
Having a kid just

523
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,680
to sell stuff...

524
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,440
Er,

525
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,600
not fair to the kid,

526
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,120
you know?

527
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,760
So what?

528
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,720
Kid's not doing the selling,

529
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,320
you're selling 'cause

530
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,480
you're a mom.

531
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,240
Yeah well...

532
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,720
you've reworded it,

533
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,160
but it's still the same deal.

534
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,160
Just think it over.

535
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,720
Fine.

536
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,200
Now for option three,

537
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,080
angry wife.

538
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,240
Oh yeah, I know these.

539
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,920
Seen these creators.

540
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,600
Ranting about husbands

541
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,800
and in-laws.

542
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,080
Some women

543
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,520
feel stuck,

544
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,720
we speak

545
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,240
for them online.

546
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,480
Already promised him

547
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,560
I'd lay off these.

548
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,440
Poor guy's got

549
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,640
a breaking point.

550
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,880
Skip it for now.

551
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,960
How about this?

552
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,440
"Strong independent woman,"

553
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,120
might work for me.

554
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,200
That was

555
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,000
meant for Lin Anran.

556
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,440
She was gonna be

557
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,280
a mix of types one and four.

558
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:19,960
Got it,

559
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,680
rich pretty strong woman.

560
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,320
But you'd do it better.

561
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,560
You've got that comeback story.

562
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,600
Your journey's gone viral.

563
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,560
Let's do that then.

564
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,280
But there's a catch...

565
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,160
What?

566
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,400
You're married.

567
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,160
Can't even hide it.

568
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,600
Wait, so marriage

569
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,120
cancels out

570
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
being a strong woman?

571
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,280
What's the logic?

572
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,720
Seriously no go?

573
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,320
With all these,

574
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,960
I'm stuck with either having kids

575
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
or husband-bashing.

576
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,240
That's it?

577
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,280
You can consider one of these two.

578
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,680
Man...

579
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,840
both are challenging.

580
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,120
Got your point.

581
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,160
Let me sleep on it.

582
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,040
Think it through.

583
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,680
Yeah, I will.

584
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,640
I'll do my utmost

585
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,840
to make you

586
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,120
our next top star.

587
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,040
Cool, I'll do my best.

588
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,200
OK.

589
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,520
Can I get

590
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,920
a copy of that?

591
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,120
Everything's ready for you.

592
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,120
Boss,

593
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,960
true captain material!

594
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,880
I'll text you later.

595
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,600
Alright!

596
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,840
OK.

597
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,520
Fu Yudong!

598
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,960
At tomorrow's meeting,

599
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,200
discuss item three

600
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
with Lady Wan.

601
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,080
[Legal's concerns]

602
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,960
[seem valid.]

603
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,440
[Lady Wan's]

604
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,240
[signing the contract]

605
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,360
[with us tomorrow.]

606
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,600
[Li Daoqi and I...]

607
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,520
Something came up.

608
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,520
Holler at you later.

609
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,560
[Ready for bed, handsome?]

610
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,360
Taking tomorrow off.

611
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,360
Where to?

612
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
Need protection

613
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,120
for what we're about to do!

614
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,040
No protection needed,

615
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,240
get to it!

616
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,960
But you said

617
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,880
safe periods aren't safe.

618
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,920
Who cares,

619
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,120
c'mon!

620
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,280
But your career's...

621
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,320
just taking off.

622
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,200
If you get pregnant...

623
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,280
won't that ruin it?

624
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,560
You'll blame me later.

625
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,360
Pregnancy is fine.

626
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,080
Lin Chang told me

627
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,080
if I get pregnant,

628
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,880
I'll pivot to Baby & Maternity.

629
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,440
There's more money there.

630
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,400
Help me make this happen!

631
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,480
What's up?

632
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,800
What's wrong?

633
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,560
Just using me

634
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,400
as a tool, huh?

635
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,560
I told you before,

636
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,600
don't wanna be your content

637
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,040
or your tool.

638
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,840
Like you

639
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,240
don't use me for content?

640
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,520
AIN'T YOU MR. PERFECT HUSBAND?

641
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,600
Hey, Doctor Fu,

642
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,800
do I have sensitive skin?

643
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,720
Ever made

644
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,840
any products for me?

645
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,680
I didn't go for

646
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,040
the angry wife,

647
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,440
that's me

648
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,840
being nice.

649
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,520
You in or not?

650
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,280
Hey, hey,

651
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,000
hey!

652
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,440
Kitchen's

653
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,200
my bed tonight.

654
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,480
I won't make more tools.

655
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,280
More?

656
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,560
Someone's being cocky!

657
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,080
[Li Daoqi, continue!]

658
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,320
I'm right here!

659
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,080
Come when you're ready,

660
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,960
tiger.

661
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,240
[All good now,]

662
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,080
[continue.]

663
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,040
Ungrateful

664
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:05,840
bastard.

665
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
[Yeah, tomorrow.]

666
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,960
[Just tell her]

667
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,040
[at the meeting.]

668
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,200
Those vases are nice.

669
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,640
Can I grab those too?

670
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,240
Sorry sir,

671
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,320
not for sale.

672
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,800
Ah, too bad.

673
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,640
Um, sir,

674
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,120
this card was declined.

675
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,760
Could you...

676
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,760
Probably

677
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,040
the phone messed it up.

678
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,840
It's good.

679
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,440
Alright.

680
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,360
Here.

681
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
One moment please.

682
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,440
No hurry.

683
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,480
Skip the receipt.

684
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,320
OK.

685
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:56,920
Alright.

686
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,760
Take care!

687
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,040
Thanks, you too!

688
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,440
Grand opening!

689
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,840
Money flowing!

690
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,640
Please.

691
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,720
Welcome!

692
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,840
Got a meeting,

693
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,680
gotta run.

694
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,320
Get going then.

695
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,160
Xinying!

696
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,720
Hey!

697
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,160
I love the malatang.

698
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,520
Hope your business rocks!

699
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,640
Thanks!

700
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,720
Got a meeting, gotta go,

701
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,760
I've already

702
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,080
paid up.

703
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,680
C'mon, stick around a bit?

704
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,880
I'll swing by again soon!

705
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,480
He's busy.

706
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,360
Yeah, my jacket...

707
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,640
Yeah, take it.

708
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,520
Almost forgot.

709
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,840
[Here's your order.]

710
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,000
[Just ask if you need anything.]

711
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,760
Xinying,

712
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
take a breather with us.

713
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,200
How's it? Good?

714
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,160
Yummy!

715
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,720
Got

716
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,360
special sauce recipe.

717
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,000
Did you create

718
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,960
this sauce yourself?

719
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,520
She did it.

720
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,520
We thought it was

721
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,960
a secret recipe passed down!

722
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
It's incredible!

723
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,320
You're funny.

724
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,000
Enjoy!

725
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,640
Did you

726
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,000
work in restaurants before,

727
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,760
or

728
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
study cooking?

729
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,360
She studied finance overseas.

730
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,000
My cousin here

731
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,720
always wanted

732
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,840
to make malatang.

733
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,120
Living the dream now, huh?

734
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,840
It's good.

735
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,120
Back when I was overseas,

736
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,840
auntie,

737
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,880
I was dying for malatang.

738
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,640
Couldn't find any good ones.

739
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,880
When I was little,

740
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,400
I only ate the plain ones,

741
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,600
no kick to it.

742
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,240
Then abroad,

743
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,840
I went crazy with the spices,

744
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
like my way of

745
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,560
dealing with homesickness.

746
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,920
Hey, the gift?

747
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,240
I'll grab it.

748
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,360
Balcony.

749
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,960
Seriously, you...

750
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,280
Hold on.

751
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,760
Your mom shipped this

752
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,000
to us.

753
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,640
She couldn't make it back.

754
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,080
It's for you!

755
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,440
From Mom?

756
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,240
What is it?

757
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,800
Take a look!

758
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,600
What is it?

759
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,760
A kitty!

760
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,320
Lucky cat!

761
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,160
To great business!

762
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,320
Ailing is thoughtful.

763
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,040
Yeah.

764
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,680
A fitting gift.

765
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,320
Adorable.

766
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,080
Mom's really looking out for me.

767
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,480
Of course, she is,

768
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,520
silly!

769
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,640
What's up with

770
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,400
the flowers?

771
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,640
For you.

772
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,040
Thanks.

773
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,600
Nian,

774
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,720
full yet?

775
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,080
Yep.

776
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,400
Go play, kiddo.

777
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,000
Go!

778
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,640
Why flowers?

779
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,760
Just saw them at the shop.

780
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,280
Looked pretty,

781
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:43,960
so I grabbed them.

782
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,560
Didn't expect

783
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,320
you back so early.

784
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,120
Want some noodles?

785
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,000
Nah, sit down.

786
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,080
sit, sit.

787
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,760
Listen, hon,

788
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,720
I've been doing some thinking.

789
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,440
About that

790
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,160
school thing for Nian,

791
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,680
should've

792
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,120
talked to you first.

793
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,400
My bad, really.

794
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,000
I must apologize.

795
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,040
It's OK,

796
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,840
you did it for him.

797
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,480
Though

798
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,800
that school wasn't really...

799
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,840
Yeah,

800
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,840
water under the bridge now.

801
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,040
From here on out,

802
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,040
anything

803
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,840
about Nian,

804
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,159
you call the shots.

805
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,480
Whatever you say goes!

806
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,239
Thanks.

807
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,080
That's that.

808
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,639
Moving on.

809
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,199
Sure.

810
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,320
Hey, got some good news.

811
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,600
What's up?

812
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,520
I scored a deal

813
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,639
with Lady Wan

814
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,719
for the holiday.

815
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,000
She's gonna livestream for us.

816
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,520
No way!

817
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,280
Cool, huh?

818
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,280
Awesome! Congrats!

819
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,080
But here's the thing,

820
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,000
her sales numbers

821
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,080
are crazy high.

822
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,480
Our inventory

823
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,640
can't keep up,

824
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,240
plus all these platform fees

825
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:02,920
and stuff.

826
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,480
It's putting us

827
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,400
in a tight spot.

828
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,480
Our cash flow's

829
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
tight,

830
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
so maybe

831
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,360
we'll have to...

832
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,520
Better get

833
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,840
your team on that.

834
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,880
Just talked about it at the meeting.

835
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,000
Everyone's supposed to

836
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,080
come up with ideas.

837
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,640
Been thinking about it

838
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,400
on the way,

839
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,920
trying to figure something out...

840
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,720
Well,

841
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,480
no more work talk

842
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,680
at home.

843
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,240
Sure.

844
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,600
Yeah.

845
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,360
Curry rice,

846
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,880
nice.

847
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,480
Yeah,

848
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,520
that insurance

849
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,760
you got,

850
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,800
how many years was it for?

851
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,720
50 years.

852
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,880
50 years?

853
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,240
Thought it was like 200 years.

854
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,960
You're really...

855
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,920
planning ahead...

856
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,320
Look, Daoqi.

857
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,200
Starting from scratch

858
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,240
and getting

859
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,960
your company to

860
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,960
partner with

861
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,520
big league influencers,

862
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,560
that's amazing.

863
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,720
Proud of you!

864
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,360
As your wife,

865
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,040
I'll absolutely help

866
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,280
when you're

867
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,080
truly stuck.

868
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,560
I'm your

869
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,520
last line of defense.

870
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,400
But you can't just

871
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,280
run to me

872
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,480
whenever things

873
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
get tough.

874
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,720
How will you ever learn to

875
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,040
run a business that way?

876
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,920
That's not gonna work.

877
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,560
Hey, I didn't always

878
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,720
run to you...

879
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,320
Nah, you didn't.

880
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,360
Never said you did.

881
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,160
You thought

882
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,960
I was trying to tap into our funds

883
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,000
for the business?

884
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,760
No way!

885
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,240
You'd never do that!

886
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,320
How could I?

887
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,640
I'd never.

888
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,000
Exactly, you wouldn't.

889
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,920
Must be your imagination.

890
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
Oh, silly me.

891
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,760
Way off base.

892
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,520
Totally wouldn't.

893
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,040
Right, my bad.

894
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,800
Right.

895
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,600
Want those noodles?

896
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,640
Y...yeah.

897
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,560
The instant kind?

898
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,280
Those ones.

899
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,800
Egg on top?

900
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,560
Over hard.

901
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,280
Two dogs?

902
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,920
Yup.

903
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,120
On it.

904
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,520
Cool.

905
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,360
Okey dokey.

906
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,320
That insurance stuff,

907
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,360
just wanted

908
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,760
some financial tips, y'know?

909
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,800
Fine,

910
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,080
I'll give you

911
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,120
some financial tips later.

912
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,760
I'm not trying to

913
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,160
be difficult here,

914
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,920
but business-wise,

915
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,360
this plan

916
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,120
just

917
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,440
doesn't work.

918
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,240
Let's be real,

919
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,120
getting on

920
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,080
these big influencers' shows

921
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,440
is just burning money for exposure.

922
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,600
Who's gonna

923
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,160
cover the inventory deposits

924
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,760
and handle

925
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,600
all the

926
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,600
returns?

927
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,840
And she wants

928
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,280
the lowest price,

929
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,240
that totally wrecks

930
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,600
our pricing.

931
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,840
Let me be straight,

932
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm not on board.

933
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,600
We're a new brand.

934
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,360
Being new is exactly

935
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,240
why we need

936
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,600
this chance,

937
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,520
right?

938
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,760
What did Mr. Xing

939
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,640
teach us?

940
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,080
In this game,

941
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,880
nothing matters more than:

942
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,600
BRAND, BRAND, BRAND!

943
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,120
And what makes a brand?

944
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,040
Marketing, man!

945
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,480
Lady Wan's 11.11 live

946
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,800
is like prime-time

947
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,400
national TV ads in the 90s!

948
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,360
How can we just

949
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,680
pass this up?

950
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,680
Here's the deal:

951
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,720
either we follow Mr. Li,

952
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,320
or we split.

953
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,600
Everyone's got a point.

954
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,080
Business

955
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,960
is risky, sure,

956
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,280
but we gotta

957
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,400
manage those risks.

958
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
This company's

959
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,480
a joint venture between us.

960
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,440
Since you boys

961
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,600
are

962
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,000
pumped

963
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,720
about this event.

964
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,200
I'll put in more cash.

965
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
But you'll

966
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,480
have to step up

967
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,760
with more too.

968
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,640
Yeah,

969
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,400
sure.

970
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,160
Seriously,

971
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,720
you looked pretty boss

972
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,920
back there.

973
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,440
But wasn't it

974
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,760
too harsh?

975
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,880
You honestly don't see it?

976
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,800
Those two

977
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
were setting you up.

978
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,200
Not even their first time.

979
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,040
I had to

980
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,240
make a stand,

981
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,360
had to force their hand!

982
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,320
Feels like my hand

983
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,520
got forced.

984
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,720
Was shaking my head,

985
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,800
didn't you see?

986
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,080
Thought you meant "don't chicken out."

987
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,800
Wanted you to stay quiet.

988
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,960
In that situation,

989
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,200
silence would be the best move!

990
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,040
Yeah yeah, got it.

991
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,320
No sweat.

992
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So what now?

993
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,440
We'll find a way.

994
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,440
You were hotter than him back there.

995
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,720
Who's that?

996
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,520
Roberto Baggio.

997
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,560
Don't you know him?
