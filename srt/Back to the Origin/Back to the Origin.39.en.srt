1
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
Mr. Xing.

2
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,480
How many were there with him

3
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,720
for dinner yesterday?

4
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,960
I wasn't there.

5
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,480
I don't know

6
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,800
the exact number.

7
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,079
Who else has he been seeing lately?

8
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,400
Lately...

9
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,240
I know about work contacts,

10
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
but his personal life,

11
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,240
private affairs,

12
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,720
so to speak,

13
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,920
I'm not in the loop.

14
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,440
Any idea whom

15
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,200
he was with last?

16
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,480
Whom he was with last...

17
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,960
[Where's the crisis]

18
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,120
[management plan?]

19
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,760
[What am I]

20
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,760
[paying you morons for?]

21
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,280
Officer, to be honest,

22
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,040
I was totally

23
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,960
taken aback by this tragedy, too.

24
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,720
I was in shock and heartsick.

25
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,040
But,

26
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,600
I've always known better

27
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,760
than to pry into

28
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,200
his private stuffs.

29
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,079
As far as work goes,

30
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,160
I've emptied the bag to you.

31
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,280
Did he ever

32
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,440
seem not himself lately?

33
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,280
Not that I remember.

34
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,079
Just yesterday we were

35
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,120
having a blast together.

36
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,680
Who knew today...

37
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,079
There's a high-level meeting at the station.

38
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,360
I'm here to go through the preliminary.

39
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,720
Ms. Zhang,

40
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,160
would you like something to drink?

41
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,240
Yes, please.

42
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,920
Let me repeat the question.

43
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,560
Alright.

44
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,480
How specific can you go

45
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,080
about this accident?

46
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,920
I... was

47
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,720
in a car on my way home

48
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,000
when the police called.

49
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,200
I was in the back seat...

50
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,120
I was... I was in the car.

51
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,560
Then I came over.

52
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,800
I was supposed to be

53
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,080
on my way home,

54
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,159
But once I...

55
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,280
got the call,

56
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,720
I came straight here.

57
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,600
Okay, so you came

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,880
after we gave you

59
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,360
a call.

60
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes.

61
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,159
Have you and Li Daoqi,

62
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,400
the deceased,

63
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,840
been in touch lately?

64
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,080
No... not much lately.

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,880
He was a close friend of ours.

66
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,840
We were close.

67
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,200
We hung out a lot.

68
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,760
When did you last speak?

69
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,880
He called me,

70
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,320
the night before last.

71
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,360
What did he say?

72
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,520
He asked me for a costume.

73
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,120
One that

74
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,520
makes you real goofy,

75
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,640
like a frog.

76
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,600
I didn't give it to him.

77
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,440
Night before last...

78
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,440
Night before last.

79
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,880
Okay.

80
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,520
He was

81
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,800
at my... at my place.

82
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,840
I'm sure he was

83
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,640
when he called.

84
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,840
Because my husband was

85
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,960
presumably with him.

86
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,560
He was probably hearing.

87
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,440
I'm sure he was.

88
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,280
So Li Daoqi was

89
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,000
at your place with your husband.

90
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,480
Yes.

91
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,720
He said they were watching

92
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,680
the football game.

93
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,480
Bought some scratch cards.

94
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,920
Something like that.

95
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,280
That's... that's what he told me.

96
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,360
Okay.

97
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
So your husband

98
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,760
and Li Daoqi were

99
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,800
business partners, right?

100
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,640
More than just partners.

101
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,200
They've been

102
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,720
best friends since they were kids.

103
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,000
Then my husband went overseas,

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,680
but they stayed close.

105
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,080
They became half brothers.

106
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,720
In a word,

107
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,080
our family tree is complicated.

108
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
My husband's father

109
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,000
and Daoqi's mother

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,040
later got married,

111
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,760
which has

112
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,880
turned friendship

113
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,120
into real brotherhood.

114
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,040
Yudong loved him dearly.

115
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,360
So much so that I got

116
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,040
jealous.

117
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,920
We once had a huge fight

118
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,760
just because I thought he was

119
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,080
choosing him over me.

120
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,280
Last question,

121
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,840
bear with me.

122
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,960
On the phone,

123
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,760
or face to face,

124
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,400
did he ever say anything

125
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,640
about hurting himself?

126
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,440
Any signs of that?

127
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
Absolutely not.

128
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,320
He called because

129
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,200
things between

130
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,800
my husband and I

131
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,400
have been rocky.

132
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,600
He was trying to

133
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,840
fix our relationship.

134
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,600
He called to tell me

135
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,680
reality TV is all fake,

136
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,160
real life is what matters,

137
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,880
and asked for the costume.

138
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,000
That was all.

139
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,600
So he was mediating

140
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,120
your marital issues?

141
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,120
Yes.

142
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,120
Daoqi had been keen

143
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,280
to help us work things out.

144
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,720
I...

145
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,120
I should've

146
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,720
given him that costume.

147
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,080
Oh, how could I reject him...

148
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,200
How could I...

149
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,840
Your husband kept insisting

150
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,600
that Daoqi's death was his fault.

151
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,040
What's your take on that?

152
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,120
Understood.

153
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,160
So much for today.

154
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,960
Mr. Fu, when did you leave

155
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,000
Yingmei Center that day?

156
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,000
Can you recall?

157
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,840
Around midnight.

158
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,880
I remember

159
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,000
the lights there

160
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,240
had just gone out.

161
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,840
Did you take a taxi?

162
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,000
Do you have a receipt?

163
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,880
No.

164
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,760
I hailed a ride.

165
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,200
Here's the trip history.

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,760
From what I gather,

167
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,880
you two

168
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,920
were very close.

169
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,200
My dad married his mom.

170
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,640
He grew up with a single mom.

171
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,360
So did I.

172
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,200
We were in college together.

173
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,680
No less family

174
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,040
than friends.

175
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,280
[We used to be neighbors.]

176
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,120
[His dad died young.]

177
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,400
[His mom raised him alone.]

178
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,440
[It was tough back then.]

179
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,200
[Got bullied a lot.]

180
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,760
Stop it! Leave him alone!

181
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,560
[It's okay. You're safe now.]

182
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,560
[Stop hitting him, you brats!]

183
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,880
Yudong.

184
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,360
Then my mother died too.

185
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,160
We had the same scar.

186
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,760
My dad's been very weird.

187
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,400
How so?

188
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,280
Dropped by your place way too often.

189
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,160
What's it

190
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,000
to do with you?

191
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Hey, remember

192
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,680
my crush

193
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,440
from your

194
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,960
department?

195
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Turns out she's

196
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,640
seeing one of my own seniors.

197
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,360
Didn't she use to go for younger guys?

198
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,360
Since when

199
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,880
was the May-December thing back in style?

200
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,160
Hey, wait up!

201
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,560
I'm not done.

202
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,240
The wheel of fortune turns.

203
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,240
When will it be my turn?

204
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,440
Look, Yudong,

205
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,400
we should stay out of

206
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,160
our parents' business.

207
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,240
They're grown-ups,

208
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:43,960
you know?

209
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,200
They'll have to sort it out.

210
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,440
I'm just working out.

211
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,240
None of their business.

212
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,640
This isn't a workout.

213
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,840
That's self-sabotaging.

214
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,040
You're

215
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,520
running yourself into the ground.

216
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,480
Look at you,

217
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,000
what's the point in burning these

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,480
calories

219
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,160
when you know you're buying me

220
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,560
a decent meal right after?

221
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,480
Speak for yourself.

222
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,440
Dude,

223
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,400
you've always been very slack

224
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,120
in treating me

225
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,880
to the fancy meal that I deserve.

226
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,080
Get off me.

227
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,440
What if I won't?

228
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,440
Sort me out, huh?

229
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,240
Dude, what...

230
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,800
I'm gonna... a leg for a leg!

231
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,320
This is stupid.

232
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,040
So stupid!

233
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,600
Now I'm on top.

234
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,480
Hey...

235
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,560
Pass it!

236
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,560
Should've taken the shot yourself.

237
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,880
When you had the ball,

238
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,720
you shoot.

239
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,360
I'm the assist king.

240
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,400
I'm a team player.

241
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
That's my motto.

242
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,920
You know?

243
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,440
Internet cafe tonight?

244
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,760
My treat.

245
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,840
Can't. Lab work.

246
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,640
Is it worth all this playing janitor

247
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,520
for the lab rats,

248
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,480
just for a

249
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,560
darn letter of rec?

250
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,720
That's crude.

251
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,960
Let me tell you,

252
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,040
getting to scoop poop at Prof. Chen's lab

253
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,600
is a

254
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,640
dream gig for us.

255
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,360
Plus,

256
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,960
don't tell my dad

257
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,200
about me going overseas.

258
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,400
Got it.

259
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,480
Or your mom.

260
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,000
So

261
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,440
what are you gonna

262
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,600
bribe me with

263
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,800
to keep my mouth shut?

264
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,720
How about

265
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,920
bringing you some

266
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,920
choice rat droppings from the lab?

267
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,160
Good nibble.

268
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,080
You'll love it.

269
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,200
What?

270
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,560
He's going abroad!

271
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,720
I don't care.

272
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,680
I don't even know them.

273
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,360
Yell all you want.

274
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,560
You're making yourself stupid.

275
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,040
Keep yelling.

276
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,760
Scream your lungs out.

277
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,360
He's going abroad!

278
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,080
One more thing.

279
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,960
In your personal opinion,

280
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,800
what happened to Daoqi?

281
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,680
He wouldn't do this.

282
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,760
Look at it.

283
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,920
Stuck in this cage forever,

284
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,840
it's depressed.

285
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,600
It wouldn't move.

286
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,000
Hey, hands off.

287
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
What, is it venomous?

288
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,400
They might

289
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,560
turn into Splinter from TMNT

290
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,680
and whack you with a stick.

291
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,480
What happens to these

292
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,200
little buddies

293
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,520
when you're done with them?

294
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,720
How should I know?

295
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,680
I don't keep them.

296
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,120
All set. Let's bounce.

297
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,800
- Bye.
- Grab some food.

298
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Bye, buddies.

299
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,560
Later.

300
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,320
What to eat?

301
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:01,920
Whatever.

302
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,880
Your call.

303
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,760
Buy me satay noodles.

304
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,720
New place by the gate.

305
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,280
Sure.

306
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,400
You suggested it, you pay.

307
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,360
Man, I waited for you forever.

308
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,320
At least buy me food.

309
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,080
I'm broke.

310
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,600
Scrooge!

311
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,200
[He was]

312
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,840
[a really kind soul.]

313
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,560
[He'd feel sorry]

314
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,240
[for a lab rat.]

315
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,160
[So he decided]

316
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,160
[to set it free.]

317
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:33,880
[Luckily,]

318
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,800
[I caught him]

319
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,520
[before he left the lab.]

320
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,360
[Otherwise,]

321
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,320
[it could've been demerits.]

322
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
[Someone like that...]

323
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,120
[I don't believe he killed himself.]

324
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,360
♪Little eggshell, oh so small,♪

325
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,120
♪please, oh, please, don't you cry.♪

326
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,320
♪Come along with me now,♪

327
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,560
♪into my home we'll go.♪

328
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,000
I think he must have

329
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,920
slipped by accident.

330
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,520
He'd had so much to drink.

331
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,280
If I had stayed...

332
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,760
Alright.

333
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,800
That's all for now.

334
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:47,880
Thank you.

335
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,880
I called you. You didn't pick up.

336
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,440
Phone died.

337
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,119
Did you go in and look?

338
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,200
Cheng Man did.

339
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,320
Thanks for your help.

340
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,800
That should be everything.

341
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,840
We'll be in touch

342
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,960
if there are new leads.

343
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,880
The hospital has already notified them.

344
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,480
You should coordinate directly with

345
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,640
the funeral home.

346
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:39,960
Sorry for your loss.

347
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,960
Thank you.

348
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,560
Farther and Mom went back.

349
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,760
We'll talk about

350
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,160
the company stuff

351
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,080
in a couple of days.

352
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,320
For now, please

353
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,800
keep things under control.

354
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,880
I need to go back.

355
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,840
Nian's waiting for me.

356
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,560
Let us see you off.

357
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,520
Yudong can call you a car.

358
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,400
No need, I drove here.

359
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,880
Man, Yudong isn't good with words.

360
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,880
I know, I know.

361
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,240
Would Daoqi be disappointed

362
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,400
seeing me like this?

363
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,000
Should I cry like you

364
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,160
instead?

365
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
I gotta go.

366
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,640
Honey.

367
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,000
Cheers.

368
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,400
Yudong,

369
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,040
I've figured it out.

370
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,960
Buddha is so good to us.

371
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,240
Think about it.

372
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,760
Buddha has so much

373
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,560
to deal with every day,

374
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,360
but he took time out

375
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,840
to play this joke on us.

376
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,640
He must really love us.

377
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
I'd rather

378
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,960
he never thinks of us

379
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,760
at all.

380
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,160
Come on.

381
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,120
Don't be so negative.

382
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
Even Tang Sangzang

383
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,400
went through 81 tribulations

384
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,000
to get the scriptures.

385
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,800
You remember that story?

386
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,760
In the end, there's one tribulation short.

387
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,360
They were on the giant turtle's back

388
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,280
when it flipped over.

389
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,320
All the scriptures fell in the water.

390
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,000
They scrambled to

391
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,800
fish them out and dried them

392
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,520
on rocks.

393
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,040
When they turned the pages,

394
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,440
a corner went missing.

395
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,240
Even Tang Sangzang was a little upset.

396
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,200
But Sun Wukong,

397
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,000
the Victorious Fighting Buddha,

398
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,720
said nothing in this world

399
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,280
is ever truly perfect.

400
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,360
Even a monkey understood that.

401
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,600
So what are you worried about?

402
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,480
Buddha must have

403
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,560
known that Yudong

404
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,400
and Daoqi

405
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,280
are

406
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,400
about

407
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,600
to succeed.

408
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,280
He said,"Nope,

409
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,600
I gotta throw in one more test."

410
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,400
Then he looks around,

411
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,040
and Lady Wan

412
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,640
got arrested.

413
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,480
She was arrested

414
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,960
just to test us. Can you believe this?

415
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,720
Really,

416
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,800
I feel so guilty.

417
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,560
What did she

418
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,600
do to deserve this?

419
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,200
[It's all to test us.]

420
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,120
As they say,

421
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,600
before Buddha invests a man with great responsibilities,

422
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,080
he first tests his resolve,

423
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,240
exhausts his muscles and bones,

424
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,120
starves his body,

425
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,240
leaves him destitute,

426
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,240
and confounds his every endeavor.

427
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,440
So his patience and endurance are developed,

428
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,560
and his weaknesses are overcome.

429
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,000
From now on, we're about to

430
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,840
become invincible.

431
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,880
Just now in the bathroom,

432
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,120
I suddenly felt

433
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,960
Buddha send me

434
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,640
a brain wave signal.

435
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,720
He said, "Yudong

436
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,000
and Daoqi, listen up.

437
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,920
I have a big mission

438
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,840
for you two.

439
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,480
Don't mess it up."

440
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,640
[W-Who's talking to me?]

441
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,280
[It scared]

442
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,720
[the hell out of me.]

443
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,480
Buddha!

444
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,040
We got your

445
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,080
message!

446
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,280
What is this big mission?

447
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,840
It's fine.

448
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,840
It's fine.

449
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,480
[Yudong.]

450
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,400
[Yudong,]

451
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,280
[Buddha can't hear]

452
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,400
[your shouting.]

453
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,440
[Listen,]

454
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,800
[today's a good day.]

455
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,720
[We should celebrate.]

456
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,600
I mean it.

457
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,760
We should get some firecrackers going.

458
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,720
We got balloons.

459
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,680
[Before Buddha invests a man with great responsibilities,]

460
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,960
[he first tries his resolve,]

461
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,240
[exhausts his muscles and bones,]

462
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,240
[starves his body,]

463
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,280
[leaves him destitute,]

464
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,960
[and confounds his every endeavor.]

465
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,840
[So his patience and endurance are developed,]

466
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,200
[and his weaknesses are overcome.]

467
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,440
[Before Buddha invests a man with great responsibilities,]

468
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,760
[he first tries his resolve, exhausts his muscles and bones,]

469
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,360
[starves his body,]

470
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,880
[leaves him destitute,]

471
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,240
[and confounds his every endeavor.]

472
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,760
[So his patience and endurance are developed,]

473
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,000
[and his weaknesses are overcome.]

474
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,840
[Buddha,]

475
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,640
a toast to you.

476
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,440
Enough.

477
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,720
You're drunk.

478
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,880
Go home.

479
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,400
Yudong, I used to think

480
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,680
we'd finally made it.

481
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,360
Turns out

482
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,960
we're still losers.

483
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,160
[Aren't you afraid of heights?]

484
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,120
[Get down.]

485
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,400
Yudong,

486
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,560
sorry.

487
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,480
I'm sorry.

488
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,800
I'm so sorry.

489
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,960
Between us?

490
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,840
No need for apologies.

491
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,520
Since we were kids, we've

492
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,200
cleaned up each other's messes.

493
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,520
There's nothing to be sorry about.

494
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,280
Whatever happens,

495
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,920
I've got your back.

496
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,960
Go home, get some sleep.

497
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,280
We need to handle

498
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,320
a lot of things tomorrow.

499
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:34,800
Let's go.

500
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,160
Go home and have a rest.

501
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,240
We'll deal with it tomorrow.

502
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,000
[Go.]

503
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,680
Why are these steps so high?

504
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
Why are you standing there?

505
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,440
I've got a call.

506
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,200
Could be my mom

507
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,320
or your dad.

508
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,280
I should call back.

509
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,800
Call them until you're home.

510
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,160
Wanna say a few words to your dad?

511
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,080
Come on.

512
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,800
No.

513
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,720
Just say something.

514
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,560
I'm not talking to him.

515
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,640
Why is this door trapping me?

516
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,680
Crouch.

517
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,360
Just crouch.

518
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,760
Alright.

519
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,480
Go back soon.

520
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,760
See you tomorrow, Yudong.

521
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,280
See you tomorrow.

522
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
[Why did you come up here?]

523
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,440
[This area's off-limits.]

524
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,240
I'm just taking a look.

525
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,000
Two minutes.

526
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,720
Thank you.

527
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,960
[Someone fell from here a few days ago.]

528
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,040
[It's dangerous. Just get down.]

529
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,560
Ms. Cheng?

530
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,360
Ms. Cheng?

531
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,680
Sorry,

532
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,320
I'd like to know

533
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,040
what happened that day.

534
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,000
Do you remember?

535
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,040
I was on my phone

536
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,600
and saw the news about Lady Wan.

537
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,480
I knew something

538
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,560
went wrong.

539
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,840
So I called him right away.

540
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,840
I called so many times

541
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,400
and sent so many messages.

542
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,320
No answer.

543
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,840
I was so worried

544
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,720
about him,

545
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,360
and then

546
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,080
I called

547
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,440
his office.

548
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,040
His

549
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,320
assistant picked up

550
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,080
and said he was inside.

551
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,480
I heard his voice,

552
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,880
and I

553
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,040
felt so relieved.

554
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,160
I asked him

555
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,480
if he'd seen the news.

556
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,040
He said yes.

557
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,840
He said it was fine.

558
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,400
I told him

559
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,160
it had nothing to do with him.

560
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,560
It was a black swan event,

561
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,000
and he shouldn't overthink it.

562
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,320
Then he said the same thing

563
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,520
he told me

564
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,880
when we first met.

565
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,400
What seems like the end of the world today

566
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,480
will be just a joke in ten years.

567
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,760
He said

568
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,560
the same words

569
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,920
when we first met.

570
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,400
I've never forgotten that.

571
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,640
[I'm here now.]

572
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,000
Where's the coral you mentioned?

573
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,680
Just rocks everywhere.

574
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:10,720
Am

575
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,040
I crazy? Jumping into the sea?

576
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,440
Do you know how cold the water is?

577
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,280
[It doesn't look like cold,]

578
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,160
[but go in and try it yourself.]

579
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,360
[You won't last a minute.]

580
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,920
[The water's cold as ice.]

581
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,920
I'm fine.

582
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,480
What would I be upset about?

583
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,600
I'm totally fine.

584
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,320
Just don't take yourself

585
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,240
too seriously,

586
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:27,920
and don't take

587
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,320
others too seriously either.

588
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,920
Things that seem like

589
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,320
the sky is falling now

590
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,040
will just be a joke ten years later.

591
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,520
Really.

592
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,320
What's that saying again...

593
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,880
Thank you.

594
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,160
I'll hang up now.

595
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,440
I even made a special trip

596
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,680
to Victoria Harbour.

597
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,440
Honestly?

598
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,280
Not as impressive as Lucheng Pier.

599
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,560
No way.

600
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,400
I'm serious.

601
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,040
All those Central district buildings

602
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,480
look huge in movies, right?

603
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,440
Yeah, all those skyscrapers.

604
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,320
No, no, no.

605
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,440
Not really.

606
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,720
They're not high at all.

607
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,920
They look like

608
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,120
those miniature city models

609
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,760
at our Lucheng World Park.

610
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,600
You must be kidding.

611
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,560
I'm not.

612
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,760
This, this.

613
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,400
Right.

614
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,040
Most importantly,

615
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,040
I have to thank Ms. Yan

616
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,560
for making this outfit for me.

617
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,200
- Really.
- Oh, you're welcome.

618
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,640
It's amazing.

619
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,880
Custom-made

620
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,400
for me.

621
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,000
With this outfit on,

622
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,560
you're definitely going to succeed.

623
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,680
Definitely. For sure.

624
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,880
How did your interview go?

625
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,520
Way too smooth.

626
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,440
Think about it,

627
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,680
the moment I walked in

628
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,040
dressed in this outfit, they froze.

629
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,840
When I talked,

630
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,360
the interviewer

631
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,480
was impressed.

632
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,520
He wouldn't let me go

633
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,120
and said, red-eyed,

634
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,920
you should start working today.

635
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,160
I refused and asked him

636
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,880
to stop pulling

637
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,760
and let me go.

638
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,920
[So that's why I'm mad.]

639
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,320
[They gave him the job and he declined.]

640
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,160
No, I can't take the job.

641
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,040
[What a waste.]

642
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,280
No.

643
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:42,600
[Exactly.]

644
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,880
My mom's here.

645
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,960
If I go to Hong Kong,

646
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,680
what about her?

647
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,760
Your mom? She's got Fu.

648
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,800
[That's right.]

649
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,520
[Why would she need you to take care of her?]

650
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,040
[Exactly.]

651
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,880
There's a saying

652
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,760
in the classics,

653
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,760
when Mr. Fu is around, don't travel far.

654
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,520
It's "When your parents are alive, don't travel far."

655
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,480
Hi, mom.

656
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm fine.

657
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,200
I just wanted to check

658
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,080
if you're still up this late.

659
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,760
I'm your sleep supervisor,

660
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,160
Daoqi.

661
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,720
Look at the time.

662
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,160
This is the latest

663
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,040
time you should be awake,

664
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,720
okay?

665
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,680
No

666
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,920
staying up past this anymore.

667
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,960
Where's Fu?

668
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,040
Look,

669
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,920
you should learn from him.

670
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,520
Early to bed, early to rise.

671
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,760
It's getting cold.

672
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,440
Put on more clothes when you go outside.

673
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,840
Don't worry.

674
00:37:59,160 --> 00:37:59,800
Good night.

675
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:23,960
[Ms. Cheng,]

676
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,800
[the deceased had]

677
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,880
[separated his personal]

678
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,760
[and family finances]

679
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,880
[from the debt weeks ago.]

680
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,160
[His only concern]

681
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,880
[was you and your child.]

682
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,560
Standing high gives you a better view.

683
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,000
Those gathering from the sea,

684
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,400
wish you a full harvest!
