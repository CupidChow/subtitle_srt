1
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,120
Play.

2
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,600
Xinying, you know there's a girl

3
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,640
who got into a really amazing school

4
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,240
called Harvard.

5
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,520
When you grow up,

6
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,600
don't you want to go to Harvard?

7
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,919
Then we have to

8
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,120
train your willpower,

9
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,520
okay?

10
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,680
Do it with Mommy.

11
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,640
Hold out your hand.

12
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,400
Put an ice cube in it.

13
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes, now squeeze.

14
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,079
That hand, squeeze it.

15
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,079
Count for yourself.

16
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
See how long you can last.

17
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,520
One,

18
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,120
two,

19
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,000
three.

20
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,040
Tell yourself,

21
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,160
I'm not afraid,

22
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,960
it's not cold.

23
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,000
Say it.

24
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Say I'm not afraid of the cold.

25
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,560
Why are you so useless?

26
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,160
Pick it up.

27
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:51,600
Hurry.

28
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,400
Hurry up.

29
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,160
Be good, pick it up.

30
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,440
That ice cube.

31
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,760
Can't even do this one little thing.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,840
Hold it,

33
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,600
you hear me?

34
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,280
No whining.

35
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,000
One,

36
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,120
two.

37
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,280
In your head,

38
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,360
say "I'm not afraid of the cold."

39
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,160
Say it: I'm not afraid of the cold.

40
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,120
Say it.

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,840
[Ailing,]

42
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,720
[it's me.]

43
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,680
[Ailing, are you home?]

44
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
[It's Feng.]

45
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,480
[Ailing,]

46
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,880
[it's Feng.]

47
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,160
Coming, coming.

48
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,920
Feng.

49
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,640
Are you feeling okay?

50
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,399
I'm fine.

51
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,760
Really, I'm fine.

52
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,200
Good.

53
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Do you want to come in?

54
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,240
No, no.

55
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,640
It's about that thing from last time.

56
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,640
My son

57
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,040
just called.

58
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,080
He wants to renovate early.

59
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,520
He'll be too busy later.

60
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,200
So,

61
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,400
I have to come over again.

62
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,960
Right, right,

63
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,400
I've kept it in mind.

64
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,880
It's just we really have too much

65
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,400
going on at home

66
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,360
lately.

67
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,720
How about

68
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,920
you give me two more days?

69
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,240
You know

70
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,200
what my son's like.

71
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,520
You can't argue with him.

72
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,040
It's all for the kids, right?

73
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,159
Let's understand each other.

74
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,240
Just hurry it up.

75
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,040
I'll get going.

76
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,240
Take care of yourself.

77
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,600
Okay.

78
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,000
Who isn't doing it for the kids, huh?

79
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:43,960
Come on.

80
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:44,840
Get in.

81
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,440
Sir, the number's 2156.

82
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,000
Got it.

83
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,080
There are tissues on the back seat.

84
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,640
Thanks.

85
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,040
Son, you okay?

86
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,520
I'm fine.

87
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,080
Sometimes

88
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,440
you don't feel it right away.

89
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,880
Whenever you do,

90
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,120
you tell me.

91
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
Please fasten your seat belt.

92
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,480
We're heading out.

93
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,240
Okay.

94
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,120
It protected nothing.

95
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,520
Sir,

96
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,400
could you go a bit faster?

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,920
My delivery's about to time out.

98
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,960
You should swing by a hospital first.

99
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,800
No, I'm fine.

100
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Just drop me at the intersection

101
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,360
up ahead on Jianshe Road.

102
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,440
What happened?

103
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,280
I fell.

104
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,760
Bike's wrecked too.

105
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,760
I called the client to explain,

106
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,960
but he just wouldn't hear it.

107
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,600
Said I'm scamming him,

108
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,360
said if I'm late he'll complain.

109
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,080
If I get a complaint,

110
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,040
they'll dock my pay.

111
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,160
You see,

112
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,680
honestly,

113
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,600
in rain this heavy,

114
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,400
you can't get a cab anywhere.

115
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,080
If I wasn't desperate to deliver,

116
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,080
I'd never splurge on a ride.

117
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,080
I'm raising this kid alone,

118
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,160
I can't leave him home alone,

119
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,920
so I bring him along on runs.

120
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,560
I just don't get it.

121
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,080
Why is life this hard?

122
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,160
I really feel like

123
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,640
I'm already doing my best.

124
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,120
Ailing,

125
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,160
I'm dropping some things off.

126
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,320
If you're not home

127
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,360
I'll leave them at your door,

128
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,560
so you can take them in later.

129
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,200
Hurry up.

130
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,320
Give me a small one.

131
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,600
There's only room for one more.

132
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,600
Ailing.

133
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:30,880
Sister.

134
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,240
Where are you going?

135
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,360
Why are you here?

136
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,440
To bring you some things.

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,960
Where are you off to?

138
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,520
We're...

139
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,159
- Going out.
- Moving.

140
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,760
You sold your home ten years ago?

141
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,880
If I hadn't run into you today,

142
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
were you planning to keep this

143
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,200
from me for another 10 or 20 years,

144
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,560
or your whole life?

145
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,480
You clearly don't see me

146
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,080
as your sister.

147
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,960
Back when you were at teachers' college,

148
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,480
you came to me about everything.

149
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,400
Exams, graduation,

150
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,360
boyfriends.

151
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
Back then

152
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
you weren't financially independent,

153
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,640
felt you lived off me, right?

154
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,600
You can fly on your own now

155
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
and I'm retired,

156
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
so I can't help much anymore.

157
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,080
Selling the flat's a big thing,

158
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,600
and you wouldn't even consult me?

159
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,560
You don't even have a place

160
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,240
that's truly your own.

161
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,480
How did your life end up

162
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
like this?

163
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,240
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,040
I shouldn't scold you now.

165
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,520
Don't cry.

166
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,400
Please.

167
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,320
If Mom could see you like this,

168
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,600
she'd blame me.

169
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,280
I'm sorry.

170
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,120
I haven't been paying attention to you.

171
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,800
Where've you been?

172
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,280
I tried to find you this morning

173
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,200
but you were swamped.

174
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,640
Went looking for you this afternoon

175
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,480
and you were gone again.

176
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,280
Let me ask you,

177
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,480
why did you tell Zhang Ran

178
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,560
about me and Fu Yongjun?

179
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,600
Now everyone's awkward.

180
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,280
From now on,

181
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,880
don't

182
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
tell her family stuff, okay?

183
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,240
I saw you at the Chinese supermarket

184
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,920
last week.

185
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
You had two kids with you.

186
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,240
Then why didn't you call out to me?

187
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,040
I didn't want to bother you.

188
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,240
Nonsense.

189
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,120
I noticed your daughter

190
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,320
looks just like you.

191
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,640
Yeah.

192
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,040
You've never heard that?

193
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,160
Daughters take after their dads,

194
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,160
sons take after their moms.

195
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,320
But my girl's temper

196
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,320
is more like her mother.

197
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,560
She doesn't talk much,

198
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,840
a bit icy.

199
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,760
You're not much of a talker either.

200
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,200
Oh, come on.

201
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,800
I think I can chatter

202
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
- non-stop.
- Since when?

203
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,960
Depends who I'm with, I guess.

204
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,160
Sometimes

205
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,920
you see certain people

206
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,840
and you just can't think of

207
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,760
a single word to say.

208
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,280
Back when my wife and I

209
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,320
were home,

210
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,280
we'd each

211
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,920
curl up with a book,

212
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,480
sit in

213
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,440
our own corners

214
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,880
all afternoon

215
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,280
without saying a word.

216
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,240
But just knowing

217
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,800
someone else is in the room with you,

218
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,040
that feels pretty good.

219
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,440
A cup of coffee, a book,

220
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,000
and a whole day like that,

221
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,080
sounds perfect.

222
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,800
But when she

223
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,480
asked for a divorce,

224
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,040
she said

225
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,120
she wanted a life

226
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,320
with real everyday warmth.

227
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,040
A life where you can actually argue.

228
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,400
She likes arguing?

229
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,720
It's not what you think.

230
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,040
Sometimes arguing

231
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,480
is just another way of talking.

232
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,080
What I mean is that

233
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,080
if two people can still fight,

234
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,000
nothing truly huge has broken yet.

235
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,000
When you can't even fight anymore,

236
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,920
that's when things are really bad.

237
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,320
You're that hot-and-sour noodles girl,

238
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,640
right?

239
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,520
I ordered in your live stream.

240
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,920
Thanks.

241
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,480
Online you're so loud and bouncy.

242
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,080
In real life you're pretty quiet.

243
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,760
Because you don't know me yet.

244
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,000
It's so late

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,920
and you're still on the road?

246
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,400
Once I drop you off, I'm done.

247
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,440
Wife and kid are waiting at home.

248
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,800
Coming.

249
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,080
Coming.

250
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,640
No, no, don't jump.

251
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,920
Here's your express delivery.

252
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,520
Thanks.

253
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,600
Weather's bad today.

254
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,840
Sorry I'm late.

255
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,840
What happened to your face?

256
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,840
Took a spill.

257
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,560
Stop.

258
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,200
Sorry,

259
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,920
making you run deliveries

260
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,160
in this kind of rain.

261
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,680
It's my job.

262
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,400
Well,

263
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,680
it's tough running parcels.

264
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,120
Could you give us a good review?

265
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,800
Sure.

266
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,600
Great, thanks.

267
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,800
Thanks.

268
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,200
Okay, we'll get going.

269
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,120
Wait.

270
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,560
Hang on.

271
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,920
No, that's not necessary.

272
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,359
Thank you so much.

273
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,200
You don't have to.

274
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,800
Thank you.

275
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,520
Here, kiddo, have some water.

276
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,560
I'll open it for you.

277
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,280
What should you say?

278
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,040
Thank you.

279
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,119
You're welcome.

280
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,440
Come on, let's go.

281
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,119
Sir,

282
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,359
you look even better in person.

283
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,160
Okay, we're off.

284
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,640
I'll press it for you.

285
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,200
No need.

286
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,920
This might go a bit faster.

287
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,920
Tough job you've got.

288
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,880
Yeah.

289
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,920
Your leg

290
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,480
seems badly hurt...

291
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,040
It's fine.

292
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,240
It's nothing.

293
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,280
We'll head out.

294
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,720
You should see the doctor.

295
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,360
Okay.

296
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,360
Zhang Jianbin?

297
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,200
Zhang Jianbin?

298
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
What are you doing?

299
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,600
How do I get this friend request

300
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,040
approved faster?

301
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,880
You've got to wait for her to accept.

302
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,840
I don't want to wait,

303
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,480
I want to

304
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,720
find that brat now.

305
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,040
There's no shortcut.

306
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,480
All you can do is to wait.

307
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,560
Glued to your phone all day,

308
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,080
I thought you're capable.

309
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,320
You're nothing, really.

310
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,960
[Hi, Mom.]

311
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,040
Didn't you say you and Lu Xinying

312
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,280
were getting along great?

313
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,320
Did you know

314
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,760
your aunt and uncle

315
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,280
are homeless now?

316
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,320
Useless.

317
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,400
Just like your father,

318
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,120
who can only make things worse.

319
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,000
Utterly useless.

320
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,680
[Can you not]

321
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,400
[blow up first thing in the morning?]

322
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,640
Send me her number.

323
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,640
Now.

324
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,280
I'm back home.

325
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,720
How am I supposed to remember that?

326
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:25,840
I...

327
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,760
Who even memorizes

328
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,840
phone numbers these days?

329
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,480
You're ridiculous.

330
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,320
What do you want it for?

331
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,960
I just need it.

332
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,560
Look,

333
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,280
just send her a WeChat,

334
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,280
tell her to accept my friend request.

335
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,520
I already explained

336
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
everything to her, crystal clear.

337
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,200
I'll pull up the screenshots for you.

338
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:47,920
I...

339
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,200
Stop nagging me, please.

340
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,280
Whatever you want to say,

341
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,960
I've already said it to her,

342
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,520
okay?

343
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,480
Just wait,

344
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,600
I'll forward it to you.

345
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,800
Don't hang up.

346
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,760
See?

347
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,000
What did I tell you?

348
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Isn't everything spelled out?

349
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,040
Any problem with that?

350
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,320
Super clear, right?

351
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,520
So there.

352
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,680
Tell her

353
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,720
to go check on her mother.

354
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
You're so unbelievable.

355
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,960
I'm already drowning in work

356
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,800
and I still have to... Hold up,

357
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,600
I've got another call coming in.

358
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,160
One sec.

359
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,760
Hello, Liu Bo?

360
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,600
[You finally picked up.]

361
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,280
[Get to the office, quick.]

362
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,040
[Mr. Chang]

363
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,000
[is heading out later,]

364
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
[so he moved]

365
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,680
[the meeting up.]

366
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,360
[You're about to miss it.]

367
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,080
Okay, okay.

368
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,720
[Hurry.]

369
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,400
Got it, I know, I know.

370
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,520
Okay, sure.

371
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,280
[Can you make it in 20 minutes?]

372
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,600
Twenty minutes is plenty.

373
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,440
I'll be there.

374
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,560
Just you wait.

375
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,880
I'll sprint in nineteen,

376
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,080
you'll see.

377
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,760
On my way.

378
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,040
I'm on my way.

379
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,880
Zhang Ran?

380
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
Where's my

381
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,080
blue striped tie?

382
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,160
Zhang Ran?

383
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,680
Zhang Ran?

384
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,680
You're staying there forever?

385
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,040
My sister and brother-in-law

386
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,960
literally have nowhere to live.

387
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,400
They...

388
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,440
They can stay with us.

389
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
They can't stay here forever.

390
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,200
With a new place,

391
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,160
you've got to keep the decor bright.

392
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,240
Sir,

393
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,160
the paint on the two sides of this wall

394
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,280
looks a bit different.

395
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,200
You'll need to match it

396
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,080
to the color card properly.

397
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,280
Okay, sure.

398
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,160
It shouldn't look patchy...

399
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,240
Xinying, what are you doing here?

400
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,800
Did you

401
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,520
leave something behind?

402
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,480
Come on,

403
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,920
let's talk inside.

404
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,960
Don't let the paint splatter on you.

405
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,320
Come.

406
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,960
This is my son's wedding flat.

407
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,520
We're redoing it for him.

408
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,000
When I was cleaning,

409
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,360
I saw how neatly your parents

410
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,400
had packed up.

411
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,840
They shouldn't have left anything.

412
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,440
Wedding flat? What do you mean?

413
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,320
Your parents

414
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,640
sold this place to me ten years ago.

415
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,320
They said you were going abroad

416
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,320
and needed to buy a place over there,

417
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,440
so...

418
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,160
They didn't tell you?

419
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,480
But they've been living here

420
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,200
this whole time.

421
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,280
They rented it

422
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,200
back from me.

423
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,160
So basically,

424
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,440
they hid all of this from you.

425
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:08,720
Come here,

426
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,360
you little rascal.

427
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,560
Don't move.

428
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,280
Well, let me see.

429
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,160
Step out.

430
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,480
Let's see.

431
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,800
One meter twenty-six.

432
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,120
You know

433
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,000
how much food you've eaten

434
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,120
to get there?

435
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,040
What have you been sneaking on the side?

436
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,360
How tall do you think

437
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,320
you'll grow?

438
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
As tall as you.

439
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,080
That tall?

440
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,240
Time flies, doesn't it?

441
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,080
Those six years

442
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,920
I spent in Canada with Xinying

443
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,040
feel like

444
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,480
they were just yesterday.

445
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,280
Those six years?

446
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,280
From the day you had Xinying till now

447
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,080
doesn't feel that long to me either.

448
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,360
But seriously, sis,

449
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,760
during my postpartum period,

450
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,600
thank you for

451
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,480
taking such good care of me.

452
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,400
Did I hear that right?

453
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:36,920
Have you forgotten

454
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,360
how many times you've made me cry?

455
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,240
So bad.

456
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,600
Who else would I even mess with?

457
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,280
You're my own sister!

458
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,080
And you think you're right?

459
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,080
Think about it,

460
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,160
we're almost twelve years apart,

461
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,560
but can talk about anything.

462
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,400
Whenever I talk to you,

463
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,240
every word comes from the heart.

464
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,880
But Xinying

465
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,840
and Ran...

466
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,520
Do you think either

467
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,120
of those two

468
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,200
has ever told us the truth?

469
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,240
Kids these days…

470
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,760
Who knows.

471
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,480
Hard to figure out.

472
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,040
What?

473
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,680
I just saw you

474
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,040
putting the bad parts inside too.

475
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,360
Look at you!

476
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,680
Isn't that wasteful?

477
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,600
It's not that.

478
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,600
You could've left them out first.

479
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,440
Just pick them

480
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,200
out again

481
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,400
after washing.

482
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,760
That's all it took.

483
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,080
I'm trying to help you,

484
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,200
and all I get is blame.

485
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,360
See?

486
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,960
You were saying stuff

487
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,120
that moved me a little,

488
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,120
and now you're at it again.

489
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,200
You're never satisfied.

490
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,960
Don't throw the bad parts inside.

491
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,680
Put them over here.

492
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,800
Seriously, how is Jianbin

493
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,880
supposed to live with you?

494
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,280
He'd thank his lucky stars.

495
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,200
Really.

496
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,000
Have some soup. I made it for you.

497
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,440
I'm full.

498
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,760
Eat some meat.

499
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,360
Fat helps keep healthy.

500
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,920
Here, take this lean piece.

501
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,680
I'm really done, Jianbin.

502
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,280
I'm full.

503
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,720
She can serve herself.

504
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,360
Just let her be.

505
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,640
Here you are.

506
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,640
Start showing your love

507
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,680
right in front of my sister?

508
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,440
You're never

509
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,400
this nice normally.

510
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,400
This is what I get for being nice.

511
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,960
Fine, I'll eat it.

512
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,360
I'm done.

513
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,600
Take your time.

514
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,160
No need to clean up.

515
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,240
I'll do it later.

516
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,760
It's fine.

517
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,040
Lu Ming

518
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,400
drives a cab every day,

519
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,960
and often works into early hours.

520
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,000
Quite hard.

521
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:47,960
Ailing,

522
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,200
you gotta tell Lu Ming

523
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,600
not to work so hard.

524
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,360
Drowsy driving easily leads to accidents.

525
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,160
It's good he's out working.

526
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,560
Better than annoying me at home.

527
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,880
Tell him to come home early today.

528
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,320
Let's have dinner together.

529
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,920
He never eats well when he's out.

530
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,320
Get Lu Ming over here.

531
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,160
We can have a drink together.

532
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,040
A drink? You'd be the happy one.

533
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,840
How can he work after drinking?

534
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,920
Then forget it.

535
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,560
Exactly. Why work after drinking?

536
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,520
Just chill.

537
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,360
Work hard, play hard.

538
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,920
Have some soup.

539
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,280
Nah, it's chicken soup.

540
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:32,880
No, no, no.

541
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,720
Just call him.

542
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,360
See what time he'll be home.

543
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,360
I won't.

544
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,560
He's not a child.

545
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,120
When it's time,

546
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,440
he knows to come back for dinner.

547
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,840
He's not the same as before.

548
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,320
Stop nagging him all the time.

549
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,840
Show him more care.

550
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,320
It's not easy being a cab driver.

551
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,440
We're working our

552
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,600
asses off every day.

553
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,160
Do the kids even appreciate it?

554
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,400
That's their business.

555
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,000
Just do your own things well.

556
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,680
TV shows

557
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,640
those old folks

558
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,840
are doing great.

559
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,320
Live your own life.

560
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,880
We shouldn't compare.

561
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,040
Others live well

562
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,880
because they've got the means.

563
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,360
Not like us, barely scraping by,

564
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,400
can't even hold onto a place to live.

565
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,200
Don't bring up the house.

566
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,960
Doesn't the house in Canada count?

567
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,720
You really think

568
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,680
it's only called "having a house"

569
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,560
if you own many here?

570
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,120
Think about it.

571
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,080
It's pretty nice.

572
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,560
You can live down south

573
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,680
or up north whenever you want.

574
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,680
Pretty free and easy.

575
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,960
Just get a job.

576
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,600
So you stop overthinking all day.

577
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,680
I'm not overthinking.

578
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,400
You know,

579
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,280
I've thought this through.

580
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,920
Lu Ming

581
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,600
lost his job

582
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,800
and didn't tell me right away.

583
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,920
Xinying came back from abroad

584
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,720
and didn't tell me either.

585
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,280
But they

586
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,920
were in touch.

587
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,840
Lu Ming didn't tell me

588
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,280
means he still cares about me.

589
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,080
I should listen to you.

590
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,840
I need to show him some care.

591
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,920
Or over time,

592
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,600
I'll push him

593
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,760
closer to Lu Xinying instead.

594
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,920
Am I right?

595
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,440
You're such a smart one.

596
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,440
That's right.

597
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,680
I'm texting him right now

598
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,640
to show

599
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,840
my care for him.

600
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,400
Yes, send it.

601
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,880
Xinying says

602
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,800
she's coming over.

603
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,240
You sure?

604
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,000
When she gets here,

605
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,240
don't nag her, okay?

606
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,480
Hurry! I'm preparing more dishes.

607
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,640
It doesn't work.

608
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,800
Take care of my shirt!

609
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,200
What the hell's going on?

610
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,960
Stop moving.

611
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,600
Keep moving

612
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,560
and you'll burn

613
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,400
out the motor!

614
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,320
I don't care about that.

615
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,760
My shirt's still caught in there!

616
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:32,520
Hey!

617
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,240
Easy.

618
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,880
Slow down!

619
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,200
Come on.

620
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,040
Quick.

621
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,000
Lift the bottom!

622
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,440
What happened?

623
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,600
You broke my wheelchair.

624
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,680
You're paying for it!

625
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,880
No way.

626
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,040
You're paying for my shirt!

627
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,480
My daughter brought

628
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,240
it from overseas.

629
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,880
An expensive one.

630
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,080
It's worth two of your wheelchairs.

631
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,480
This wheelchair came from overseas too.

632
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
Not cheap either.

633
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,280
Watch your mouth!

634
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
As if!

635
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,560
Your wheelchair just

636
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,920
caught my shirt.

637
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,440
Quit messing around.

638
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,080
Pay for my shirt first!

639
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,560
Uncle.

640
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,040
Uncle!

641
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,720
Oh, you're here.

642
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,000
Just here to see my mom about something.

643
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,639
She's upstairs with your aunt.

644
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:14,880
Uh…

645
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,520
Thank you for everything these days.

646
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,239
We're family.

647
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,080
To get you guys

648
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,280
back together,

649
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,000
I've talked a lot to your mom.

650
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:25,560
I know.

651
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,719
I've been thinking many ways,

652
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,800
and even can't sleep at night.

653
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,920
Look how thin my hair's gotten!

654
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,880
Let me tell you...

655
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,199
It's all because of your family's mess.

656
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,840
Uncle, I'm gonna see my mom first.

657
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:36,880
Xinying!

658
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,400
Don't tell your aunt

659
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,719
I'm helping fix the wheelchair.

660
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,719
She'll be pissed.

661
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,440
Take it slow.

662
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,760
Good peppercorns.

663
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,360
The flavor is super strong.

664
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:54,840
Yeah.

665
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,120
Enough?

666
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:57,960
That's enough.

667
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,800
No need to add more?

668
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,560
Nah, it's good.

669
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,760
Don't add too many ingredients.

670
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,440
Alright, alright.

671
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,080
Seal it up.

672
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,040
More water.

673
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,480
Almost ready.

674
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,680
I'll go.

675
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,280
I'll get it. Sit.

676
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,360
I'll get it.

677
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,160
Auntie.

678
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,720
Xinying, come in.

679
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,640
No need to change shoes. It's fine.

680
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,640
We were just talking.

681
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,320
It's all over now.

682
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,360
It's nice

683
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,880
having your mom live here.

684
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,120
The house thing isn't a big deal.

685
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,480
They just want the best for you.

686
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,320
You're here.

687
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,480
Alright.

688
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,280
Have a seat.

689
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,760
Aren't you sitting?

690
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,880
I've got something to do.

691
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,160
Mom…

692
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,040
Ran called me the other day

693
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,320
and told me to come home.

694
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,480
So I went back,

695
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,160
and found out

696
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,480
the house had been sold.

697
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,200
I know how much you and dad

698
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,720
have done for me

699
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,640
since I was little,

700
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,440
sending me abroad to study,

701
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,880
and buying a house there.

702
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,520
I won't let you end up homeless

703
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,760
when you're old.

704
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,000
I really hope

705
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,120
you can have your own life

706
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,440
and live well.

707
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,000
We're happy to do

708
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,880
anything for you.

709
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,640
Actually,

710
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,880
I reflect on myself too.

711
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,080
Nobody's perfect, right?

712
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,240
I think there are some issues

713
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:39,880
that I

714
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,960
need to work on myself.

715
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,440
I won't put much pressure

716
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,280
on you two.

717
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,760
Actually, I'm not

718
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,640
an unreasonable mom.

719
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:51,920
Right?

720
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,800
If you have anything to say,

721
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,680
just tell me.

722
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,520
I'll work on

723
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,040
my own problems.

724
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,640
But mom, I…

725
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,400
Every time I try to talk to you,

726
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,160
you just

727
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,440
push back

728
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,400
and yell at me.

729
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:06,760
And then…

730
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,880
Not every time…

731
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,040
Fine.

732
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,840
The reason I came today is...

733
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,800
to tell you something.

734
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,240
You know

735
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,440
I can't go back to Canada, right?

736
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,120
We really should wrap this up.

737
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,640
Here…

738
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,200
I sold the house

739
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,600
in Canada.

740
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,520
And...

741
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,240
All taxes and fees are paid.

742
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,080
The money is on this card.

743
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,240
I've converted it all to RMB.

744
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,840
If you'll make

745
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,160
any big payments,

746
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,440
just take my ID

747
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,480
and this power of attorney

748
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,440
to the bank.

749
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,120
If they need me in person,

750
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,680
just call me.

751
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
I'll come right away.

752
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,600
Okay?

753
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,720
What do you mean?

754
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,240
Nothing.

755
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,280
I just want

756
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,640
you and dad to have your own life,

757
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,320
and stop

758
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,560
devoting yourselves

759
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,760
to me every day.

760
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,120
You've done it since I was a kid.

761
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,080
So you sold

762
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,720
our house

763
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,080
in Canada?

764
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,720
Did your dad know?

765
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,760
He didn't.

766
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,720
You didn't tell him

767
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,560
and me.

768
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,320
You just

769
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,200
made the decision

770
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,600
and sold it!

771
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
Yeah, I did it.

772
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,760
It's because I want you

773
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,800
to have a good life,

774
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,720
not to stay at other people's houses.

775
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,240
Mom,

776
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,320
please stop running around for me.

777
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,600
Stop obsessing over

778
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,000
this Canada thing.

779
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,120
Let's just breathe for once.

780
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,160
Stop struggling

781
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,040
in that thing.

782
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,640
Okay, mom?

783
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,080
How could you have

784
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,120
the guts to do this?

785
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,040
Did you say even one word to me?

786
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,040
We sold the old house,

787
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,120
bought this one,

788
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,320
and put it in your name.

789
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,720
But literally this house

790
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,880
is years of our hard work.

791
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,160
Again and again,

792
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,040
you hide everything

793
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,200
from me!

794
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,680
Do you even see me as your mom?

795
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,680
Have you thought about me?

796
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,560
You're always forcing me

797
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,840
to do things I don't want to!

798
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,640
What do you want to do?

799
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,560
Tell me!

800
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,840
You just wanna live it up all day!

801
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,600
Never!

802
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,520
All I want

803
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,880
is to live my own life!

804
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:56,920
Let me ask you...

805
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,200
Your own life?

806
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,920
What kind of life?

807
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,720
I don't want to be

808
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,480
- on top like you!
- Can you ever live

809
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,080
with self-respect on your own?

810
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,520
I just don't want

811
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,600
the life you planned for me, okay?!

812
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,400
So I am wrong to

813
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,520
plan your life, huh?

814
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,200
Then am I wrong

815
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,520
to live my own life?

816
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,080
Ever since I was little,

817
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,120
I've just been following the path

818
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,840
you laid out for me.

819
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,720
Piano lessons,

820
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,840
and Canada...

821
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,320
Did you ever ask me

822
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,640
whether I like this?

823
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,040
Listen, Lu Xinying.

824
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,880
You'll

825
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,280
be a mother one day.

826
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,560
What does it mean to be a parent?

827
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,320
What do you like?

828
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,840
Tell me, what do you like?

829
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,240
Kids like to eat,

830
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,200
drink,

831
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,200
sleep,

832
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,160
and have fun.

833
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,920
What if they grow up?

834
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,400
What if you're

835
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,960
middle-aged?

836
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,360
Who's gonna give you your dignity?

837
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,080
Who's gonna give you security?

838
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,840
Do you think I enjoy

839
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,120
living this rootless life?

840
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,160
Mom, I really can't

841
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,080
get through to you.

842
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,880
I can't get through to you either.

843
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,120
All I know is

844
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,760
I gave everything I had

845
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,400
and raised a kid

846
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,360
who argues with me like this.

847
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,240
I'm not arguing with you.

848
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,520
I just want you and dad

849
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,160
to have a real home,

850
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,600
a proper place to live.

851
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,480
I want you two

852
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,320
to live your own life.

853
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,960
Stop worrying about me so much.

854
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,120
I want my own life too!

855
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,040
You used to be my whole life.

856
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,200
And now you make me realize

857
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,920
I'm a complete failure.

858
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,840
Think about it.

859
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,240
What did I ever do wrong?

860
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,400
I keep correcting myself,

861
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,080
again and again.

862
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,520
I'm only making it worse!

863
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,400
Mom, what did I do wrong?

864
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,760
Is it your mom's fault?

865
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,400
Stop worrying about you?

866
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
What else do you want?

867
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,560
Listen up, she's your mom,

868
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,520
and my sister!

869
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,520
You don't care about her, but I do!

870
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,800
How can you treat her like this?

871
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,600
What could you

872
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,160
pay back?

873
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,600
Mom, I'm done talking.

874
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,800
You think it fixes everything?

875
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,840
I put it here.

876
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,120
Mom, whether to buy this house

877
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,120
depends on you.

878
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:14,960
I'm leaving.

879
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,440
Auntie, I'm so sorry.

880
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,400
Is "I'm sorry" enough?

881
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,360
Stop right there!

882
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,280
Take it back.

883
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,600
I didn't raise you all these years

884
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,680
for the money.

885
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,760
Get out!

886
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,320
You bastard!

887
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,560
Bastard!

888
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,520
What a bastard!

889
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,440
Can't believe it.

890
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,400
She makes me feel I'm a failure.

891
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,000
Sis…

892
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,360
I'm okay.

893
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,080
I'm fine.

894
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,120
Did you argue with her?

895
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,320
Get out!

896
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,960
If it were Zhang Ran,

897
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,680
I'd slap her across the face.

898
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,440
Heartless person.

899
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,080
Close the door!

900
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,480
No shame at all?
