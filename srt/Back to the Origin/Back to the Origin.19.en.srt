1
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,200
[Is logistics working well?]

2
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,080
[Absolutely.]

3
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,000
[Maybe give him another call

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,880
[to find it out?]

5
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,360
[Trust me on this one.]

6
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,880
[Rest assured.]

7
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,360
[This is our long-term]

8
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,280
[client.]

9
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,759
[Just]

10
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,280
[facing high shipping rates.]

11
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,600
Brother,

12
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,120
here you are...

13
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,080
It's

14
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,680
from your friend.

15
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,400
[OK.]

16
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,520
And yours.

17
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,640
Mine here.

18
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,840
And...

19
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,240
This is from the family.

20
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,079
Yang,

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,079
this is from us.

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,160
Keep it.

23
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,200
It should cover the funeral costs.

24
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,640
[Which of you]

25
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,880
handles money?

26
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,600
[Yang, you should]

27
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,160
[introduce your girlfriend.]

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,480
Did you meet in Canada

29
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,720
or back home?

30
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,400
Taking Grandma home

31
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,480
for burial tomorrow.

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,200
You guys coming?

33
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,520
Well...

34
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,360
We're really

35
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,960
tied up right now.

36
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,360
[Got this urgent]

37
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,440
[overseas order.]

38
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,280
[And this morning...]

39
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,880
I know.

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,800
[I'll go alone.]

41
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,600
[Alright.]

42
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,800
[Appreciate that.]

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,920
It's good to never see you again.

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,200
[Cheers!]

45
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,560
Hey...

46
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,800
why English all of a suddenly?

47
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,800
[He oughta go.]

48
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,120
[Yeah.]

49
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,720
[His grandma loved him so much]

50
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,960
[when he was young.]

51
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,360
[You were her]

52
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,800
[favorite grandchild.]

53
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,560
[Paying respects]

54
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,120
[is only right.]

55
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:32,960
[Cheers.]

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,079
[Yeah, cheers.]

57
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,760
Hey, good news!

58
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,960
You mom's had

59
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,960
a change of heart thanks to me.

60
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,920
She's fine with your staying here.

61
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,280
[Really?]

62
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,000
Told her

63
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,080
how hard

64
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,000
you're working.

65
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,960
Now

66
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,560
she wants to

67
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,080
treat you.

68
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,840
We're coming

69
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,800
to your office

70
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,400
to take you out for a nice dinner.

71
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,320
[Going to my office now?]

72
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,120
Bad timing?

73
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,800
Got a company event.

74
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,720
They sent me out.

75
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,040
Tied up here.

76
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,800
Rain check?

77
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,800
Sure, sure.

78
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,040
Focus on work.

79
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,840
Carry on.

80
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,120
Bye!

81
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,400
Do I look fat in this?

82
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,720
You look stunning!

83
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,560
My belly...

84
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,360
Turns out

85
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,400
she's busy today.

86
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,160
You're kidding me.

87
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,360
No.

88
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,400
Listen,

89
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,200
let's make it our date.

90
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,880
You got

91
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,440
all dolled up.

92
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,520
Don't

93
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,760
flatter yourself.

94
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,640
Hey,

95
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
we can still

96
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,480
scope out her workplace.

97
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,560
Plus, quality time for us.

98
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,000
C'mon.

99
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,040
Here.

100
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,600
Grab those pastries

101
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,360
from my cabinet.

102
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,640
She's the new kid.

103
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,880
Never hurts to win over

104
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,640
coworkers.

105
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,880
So thoughtful of you.

106
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,960
Should rename you

107
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,920
"Zhou Dao (Considerate)"

108
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,240
Oh, stop it.

109
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,760
Only

110
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,520
solid companies can

111
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,560
afford offices in this district.

112
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,040
Rano?

113
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,159
Looks similar to Ruiyang,

114
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,600
where I

115
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,320
give speeches.

116
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,960
Bet Rano is a copycat.

117
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,600
Maybe,

118
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,680
maybe not. Who knows?

119
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,560
Please wait inside.

120
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,760
OK, thanks.

121
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Over there.

122
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,080
Sweet setup here.

123
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,280
Nice workspace.

124
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,200
What a view!

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,720
Worth coming

126
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,200
just to stand here.

127
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,880
Hi!

128
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,600
Interested in overseas education

129
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,680
for your child?

130
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,600
Just looking.

131
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,760
It's fine!

132
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,000
We're

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,159
the city's

134
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,920
leading

135
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,120
agency for

136
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,760
North America,

137
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,680
Europe, Australia...

138
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,200
No need.

139
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,400
[Our daughter's]

140
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,120
already got her degree

141
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,440
from a top Canadian school.

142
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,200
Whoa.

143
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,080
Actually,

144
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,120
she works here.

145
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,080
Lu XInying.

146
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,080
You're her parents!

147
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,320
A pleasure!

148
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,000
I work with her!

149
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,360
Hi!

150
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,960
Hi!

151
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,400
Wait,

152
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,320
weren't you in the hospital?

153
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,280
She takes three days off

154
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,240
to care for you...

155
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,080
Right,

156
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,360
just got discharged...

157
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,680
Just visiting...

158
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,920
I see...

159
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,840
Well, look around.

160
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,480
Let me know if you need anything.

161
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:21,960
Thanks.

162
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,720
Alright.

163
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,240
You're gorgeous!

164
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,000
I see where she gets her looks!

165
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,800
I'll leave you

166
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,600
to explore.

167
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,640
Just got discharged?

168
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,320
Such a liar.

169
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,480
She gets everything

170
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
clearly from you.

171
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,960
We done here?

172
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,560
Brat!

173
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,560
Liar!

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,280
Self-centered!

175
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,360
She finally

176
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,280
landed a job,

177
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,120
and she's taking it for granted!

178
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
Easy now, relax.

179
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,960
[Upset stomach?]

180
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,880
[Told you]

181
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,440
[we should eat first.]

182
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,320
[You wouldn't listen.]

183
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,320
Stop that!

184
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Don't open them.

185
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,400
They're expensive!

186
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,920
Don't want any.

187
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,960
Fine for gifts

188
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,920
but not for you?

189
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Ridiculous!

190
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,840
I don't want them.

191
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,440
Eat!

192
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,840
Have some

193
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,080
while I make noodles.

194
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,960
Here.

195
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,640
[Ming,]

196
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,080
[found a new place yet?]

197
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,000
Hi,

198
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,760
working on it.

199
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,800
Should

200
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,040
have updates soon.

201
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,000
[My son's wedding is coming.]

202
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,120
[Just checking.]

203
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,440
[No pressure.]

204
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,920
[Take your time.]

205
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,640
What a message!

206
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,000
[Wedding's a big deal. ]

207
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,560
[We'll be quick.]

208
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,640
Sure. Will let you know

209
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,920
[once it's ready.]

210
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,960
Honey,

211
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,160
[what are you doing?]

212
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,880
Making noodles.

213
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,560
Who were you talking to?

214
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,080
It was about

215
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,120
an order.

216
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,560
Better?

217
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,200
I'll get you some hot water.

218
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,160
I put some cold water.

219
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,800
Try it.

220
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,600
Heading out later?

221
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,360
No,

222
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,360
making your noodles.

223
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,400
Quick-fried, okay?

224
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,280
Two eggs.

225
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,920
I'll go prep.

226
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,320
Remember,

227
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,640
stay calm, no outbursts.

228
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,160
Got it.

229
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,120
I'll stay quiet.

230
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,360
Good. Leave it to me.

231
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,280
That's her.

232
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,960
Answer it.

233
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,680
Bag here?

234
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,040
Room's untouched.

235
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,960
Everything's the same.

236
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,760
[Can we talk?]

237
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,960
Sure.

238
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,520
Such chemistry between us.

239
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,480
You knew I'd be

240
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,320
worried sick and

241
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,920
arranged sick leave.

242
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,400
You have not yet

243
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,640
passed the trial period yet.

244
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,880
Weren't you all about

245
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,600
staying in China?

246
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,680
Build a proper life

247
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,560
and work hard?

248
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,360
I've been working on

249
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,120
your mom daily.

250
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,120
She's finally

251
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,560
softening up.

252
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,040
Isn't this

253
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,400
going too far?

254
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,400
C'mon, explain.

255
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,040
A...a friend's

256
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,080
grandmother died.

257
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,160
[I helped for a few days.]

258
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,680
Friend?

259
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,840
Guy or gal?

260
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,680
Guy.

261
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,760
A guy?

262
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,760
You're dating someone?

263
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,360
No, just a friend.

264
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,960
Not even your boyfriend?

265
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,920
Why you get involved

266
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,400
in his family's funeral?

267
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,040
Mom, listen.

268
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,800
His family's in a real mess.

269
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,640
No one's helping him.

270
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,160
He's really having

271
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,400
a hard time.

272
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,120
Oh yeah?

273
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,720
What about showing

274
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,040
some concern for us?

275
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,120
Your dad worked

276
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,560
his ass off for your education!

277
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,600
You snuck back,

278
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,440
he defended you,

279
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
[and said you've matured,]

280
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,560
[become]

281
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,240
[responsible.]

282
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,600
Now you've got a job,

283
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,440
act like it!

284
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,920
You've always

285
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,360
[been this way from day one!]

286
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,680
No commitment to anything!

287
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,240
Piano lessons are

288
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,600
a perfect example!

289
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,920
It cost 20 grand back then for the piano!

290
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,400
That was a year's income

291
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,240
for some.

292
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,000
And for what?

293
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,120
So you could practice

294
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,720
anytime at home

295
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,840
instead of

296
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,880
going all the way

297
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,520
to the piano studio,

298
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,560
barely touching the keys.

299
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
What came of it?

300
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,280
Why are we

301
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,240
talking about piano...

302
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,160
Your dad

303
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,560
drove all over

304
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,960
Lucheng City,

305
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,760
hunting for

306
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,080
the best teachers!

307
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,640
Enough now.

308
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,160
Right?

309
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,000
Hundreds per lesson!

310
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,400
Hundreds!

311
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,080
Alright, alright.

312
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,840
[You...]

313
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,200
[good for nothing]

314
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,280
[little brat!]

315
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,360
[Just]

316
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:57,960
[go back]

317
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,720
[to Canada!]

318
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,360
[Let me talk to her...]

319
00:16:59,360 --> 00:16:59,800
[Don't push me!]

320
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,720
[Let me handle this.]

321
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,880
Calm down, calm down.

322
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,000
Your mom's

323
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,800
just worried.

324
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,200
She wants the best for you.

325
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,680
That's why she brought up

326
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,599
the piano...

327
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:31,960
Dad,

328
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,600
I tried so hard

329
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,360
[with the piano!]

330
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,560
Six whole years.

331
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,640
Three hours every day!

332
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,800
I swear.

333
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,360
I'd even dream about music sheets!

334
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,920
But I just couldn't get it.

335
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,920
I'm not talented.

336
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,040
What could I do?

337
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,920
I worked hard

338
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,160
in Canada too,

339
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,720
and got my degree!

340
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,720
Mom keeps bringing up

341
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,160
how

342
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,880
expensive my education was.

343
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,040
I know all that,

344
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,480
Dad!

345
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,160
I just...took two days off...

346
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,240
Alright, alright.

347
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,000
She's always

348
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,600
like this!

349
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,960
Please talk to her.

350
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,600
Ask her to stop

351
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,520
pushing me?

352
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,600
[Pushing you?]

353
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,840
[You heard]

354
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,400
[what she's saying?]

355
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,240
Heaven knows...

356
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,840
We gave you everything

357
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,120
we possibly could!

358
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,840
And we never

359
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,960
asked for anything back

360
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,360
despite all our sacrifices!

361
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,640
We don't even expect you

362
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,320
to care for us in our old age.

363
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,840
Mom just wants you

364
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,440
to have a good life,

365
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,120
a good future!

366
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,360
Am I wrong

367
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,600
for that?

368
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,200
[Mom, you did nothing wrong.]

369
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,880
It's...it's all my fault,

370
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,600
OK?

371
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,520
Dad!

372
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,520
I...I've

373
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,640
said enough.

374
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,400
I don't...

375
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,520
I'm done talking...

376
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,240
I'm leaving.

377
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,160
I can't explain it right.

378
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,760
Mom, listen to me,

379
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,480
[failure]

380
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,520
[doesn't mean]

381
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,840
[no effort at all.]

382
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,040
[Just because]

383
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,160
[I'm not exceptional]

384
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,920
doesn't mean

385
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,760
all your

386
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,920
years of sacrifice

387
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,320
were for nothing.

388
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
It's not like that!

389
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,480
[What a brat,]

390
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
[talking like that!]

391
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,960
Stop right there!

392
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,920
Alright, alright,

393
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,000
let her go.

394
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,480
Come back!

395
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,360
Enough, let her go.

396
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,240
It's raining...

397
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,560
Enough.

398
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,480
Stop, Lu Xinying!

399
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,160
Hey,

400
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,640
come on,

401
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,400
everyone's too

402
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,240
worked up.

403
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,200
I hardly said anything!

404
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,120
OK, OK.

405
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,680
What did I do wrong?

406
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,720
You've done nothing wrong.

407
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,720
My fault.

408
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,320
I messed up from the start.

409
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,960
I was speaking in your shoes, too!

410
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,920
Yeah, I know.

411
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,000
Calm down, OK?

412
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,360
There, there,

413
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,040
relax.

414
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,800
We must toast our Ace,

415
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,760
Ms. Lin Anran!

416
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,600
Here's to your new show

417
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,840
crushing it

418
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,160
[and your career]

419
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,040
blowing up!

420
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,680
Mr. Lin and Ms. Qian,

421
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,600
thanks!

422
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,160
You're crushing it!

423
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,400
The platform needed sponsors,

424
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,480
[and you secured them]

425
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,880
[yourself.]

426
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,360
You're one of a kind!

427
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,760
My gratitude to you, Mr. Lin.

428
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,800
Platform picked me

429
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,720
because of your effort.

430
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,960
You're the real MVP!

431
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,000
You guys

432
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,520
are the dream team.

433
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,920
Exactly!

434
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,480
Let's drink

435
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,800
to our

436
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
[brilliant partnership!]

437
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,600
Hold up.

438
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,320
I've

439
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,600
got something

440
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,760
on my mind.

441
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,920
Go ahead,

442
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,040
we're like family here.

443
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,320
Well then,

444
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,600
my followers, sales,

445
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,720
and business deals

446
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,720
have been growing

447
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,520
these past six months.

448
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,680
Think we could

449
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,960
talk about

450
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,040
bumping up my cut?

451
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,920
Anran,

452
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,840
we just signed for

453
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,640
five years last year.

454
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,240
Plus, you've already

455
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,200
made way more

456
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,800
than other

457
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,000
top streamers.

458
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,640
Hey, she's earned it.

459
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,520
True.

460
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,400
Anran,

461
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,480
you're Tide Media's

462
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,160
greatest asset.

463
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,120
From now on,

464
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,760
let's run this ship

465
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,760
together!

466
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,240
We'll chart a course toward

467
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,240
a bright future!

468
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,320
This

469
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,680
sounds promising,

470
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,600
better not be all talk.

471
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,200
I'll drink to that!

472
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,520
Ms. Qian,

473
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,640
take a photo for us.

474
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,600
I gotta post this!

475
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,720
1, 2, 3!

476
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,360
Anran,

477
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
everyone's

478
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,440
waiting in your live

479
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,640
to party with you.

480
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,120
Xiaojian got a

481
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,400
massive cake!

482
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,200
Ms. Qian...

483
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,640
Look, boss,

484
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,160
do yourself a favor

485
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,840
and check Lin Anran's contract again.

486
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,880
Give her a bigger cut

487
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,440
and we're

488
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,880
shooting ourselves in the foot.

489
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,880
Ms. Qian,

490
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,840
top dogs don't

491
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,600
stay on top forever,

492
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,560
and underdogs

493
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,320
don't always stay down.

494
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,040
Congrats, Anran!

495
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,640
Thanks guys!

496
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,440
Congrats!

497
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,400
Thank you all!

498
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,640
Real success

499
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,480
is when

500
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,480
the numbers

501
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,960
keep climbing.

502
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,960
Once you've peaked,

503
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,800
it's all downhill,

504
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,840
and that's when it really hurts.

505
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,840
I promised her leadership,

506
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,720
not better terms.

507
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,880
Mr. Lin,

508
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,920
our newbies

509
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,320
are killing it.

510
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,800
Beauty and fitness

511
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,200
are rock solid,

512
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,880
just like tech

513
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,960
predicted.

514
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,080
Some comedy creators

515
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,480
are really taking off.

516
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,520
Zhang Ran's already number seven.

517
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,720
The "Desperate Personal Shopper"?

518
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,440
Yeah,

519
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,120
former

520
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,360
TV presenter.

521
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,200
Ms. Qian,

522
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,080
do you think Zhang Ran

523
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,240
and Lady Tiger

524
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,240
would click?

525
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,400
For sure.

526
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,160
Done deal then!

527
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,360
Check these likes,

528
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,240
the comments, views...

529
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,760
This is called mega-influencer.

530
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,080
She's top three

531
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,800
on Little White Sail's comedy list.

532
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,320
Girl's got game!

533
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,280
Gotta step up our game.

534
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,880
The collab with Lady Tiger gonna be

535
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,640
your ticket

536
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,480
to the big leagues!

537
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,440
Be humble.

538
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,560
This level

539
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,000
takes serious work.

540
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,680
We got this!

541
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,000
Tough journey.

542
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,120
Need stress snacks.

543
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,640
We're totally in this together!

544
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,440
Dude, seriously?

545
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,960
I said get changed.

546
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,120
This is what you chose?

547
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,400
How was I supposed

548
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,240
to know about this

549
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,200
random dinner?

550
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,840
And what's wrong with this?

551
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,480
You said to be formal,

552
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,560
I literally graduated in this.

553
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,760
Super formal!

554
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,680
You can't

555
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,080
rock the same suit forever.

556
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,400
It's practically

557
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,560
a museum piece.

558
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,720
People distress jeans,

559
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,400
not suits!

560
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,880
Come on,

561
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:32,880
let me get you

562
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,720
new ones in a few days.

563
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,160
Nah.

564
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,560
Company's paying.

565
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,080
Still your money.

566
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,640
Makes me

567
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,640
feel awful.

568
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Like I'm walking around

569
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,720
with pieces

570
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,960
of your house

571
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,160
on my back.

572
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,040
Too much pressure.

573
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,760
No thanks!

574
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,920
That's quite

575
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,720
the metaphor.

576
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,280
But you're our front man now,

577
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,560
got it?

578
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,000
Looking sharp

579
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,480
is literally

580
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,560
part of your job.

581
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,760
Funny job.

582
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,480
I'm just hanging around all day

583
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,480
with zero

584
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,520
actual work.

585
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,600
Hey, today's work, isn't it?

586
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,800
Stuffing your face's work?

587
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,720
This isn't just dinner, dude.

588
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,480
It's networking.

589
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,720
You're an exec now,

590
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,960
y'know?

591
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,320
Real business

592
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,120
happens at the dinner table,

593
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,280
not in meetings.

594
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,120
Learn the game!

595
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,240
Business...

596
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,640
Who makes deals

597
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,400
drunk?

598
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,960
That's when

599
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,880
all the good deals happen!

600
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,000
It doesn't make sense.

601
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,360
Wearing my house, funny!

602
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,320
Trust me,

603
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,560
a Canadian PhD

604
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,600
is next level!

605
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,720
Mr. Li, Mr. Fu, please.

606
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,760
Mr. Xing.

607
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,840
About time!

608
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,360
Come on.

609
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,480
Sit.

610
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,600
They are

611
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
cosmetics industry's

612
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,440
rising stars,

613
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,280
CEO,

614
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,240
Mr. Fu Yudong!

615
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,680
Good evening.

616
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,480
And President Mr. Li Daoqi!

617
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,480
Real up-and-comers here.

618
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,520
Gents, look out for these two!

619
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,000
You got it!

620
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,080
Mr. Chen from Wishstar Capital.

621
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,560
Mr. Chen.

622
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,000
And Mr. Wang of Flora Partners.

623
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,520
- Mr. Wang.
- A pleasure.

624
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,120
Get to know each other!

625
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,680
Let's shake on it!

626
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,600
Great to meet you.

627
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,760
Pleasure!

628
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,960
Hey there!

629
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,560
Nice to meet you!

630
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,040
Welcome aboard!

631
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,240
Alright.

632
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,360
People do crossed-arm toasts,

633
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,000
this is the first time

634
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,480
I've seen crossed-arm handshakes!

635
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,160
Crossed-arm toast?

636
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,640
Never heard of it!

637
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,280
Why don't you

638
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,120
show us

639
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,040
with Mr. Chen?

640
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,640
Let me see how it's done?

641
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,280
Stop it, Mr. Xing!

642
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,720
I'm skipping

643
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,840
your next party!

644
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,960
Can't let that happen!

645
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,440
Stick with us

646
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,360
decent guys instead.

647
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:04,920
You?

648
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,280
A decent guy?  Since when?

649
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,480
Always been!

650
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,160
OK, Mr. Chen.

651
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,440
Just don't forget

652
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,520
your promise!

653
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,480
You got it!

654
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,240
So

655
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
which one of you

656
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,960
is our Canadian PhD?

657
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:22,800
Mr. Fu!

658
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,600
Uh, that's...me.

659
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,440
I'm Fu Yudong.

660
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,400
Dr. Fu!

661
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,560
Right, right, my bad.

662
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,800
Your brand's

663
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,640
"Dr. Fu", right?

664
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,040
Yeah.

665
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,160
Guys,

666
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,000
I love making friends

667
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,640
with smart folks.

668
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,400
Mr. Xing's description of you

669
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,240
caught my interest,

670
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,520
so I asked him

671
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,800
to arrange this.

672
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,120
Let me

673
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,280
introduce the crew.

674
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,480
Painter from the Fine Arts Academy,

675
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:47,960
Lili.

676
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,920
Nice to see you.

677
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,960
Principal dancer at the Lucheng Ballet,

678
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,320
Qingqing.

679
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,920
Hello, hello.

680
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,760
And Feifei,

681
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,200
curator of our Arts Center.

682
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,440
All top talents!

683
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,880
Time for a toast.

684
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,000
C'mon, everyone.

685
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,840
C'mon.

686
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,280
Pour it up!

687
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,720
Fill those glasses!

688
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,920
I'll stick with wine.

689
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,240
Go for the liquor.

690
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,400
So sorry!

691
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,320
Not much of a drinker.

692
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,600
Sorry, liquor's not my thing.

693
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,560
Such a character,

694
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,360
our Dr. Fu!

695
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,280
Let's go!

696
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,520
Cheers, guys!

697
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,640
Down it goes!

698
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,920
Got plenty of wine too!

699
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,520
Awesome!

700
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,400
C'mon, get comfy!

701
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,280
Now,

702
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,640
let's hear

703
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,880
what Mr. Chen's got to say!

704
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,880
Hey

705
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,400
Dr. Fu,

706
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,160
red wine

707
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,160
all night?

708
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
No way!

709
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,440
Switch to the hard stuff!

710
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,320
Wine's the hardest

711
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,880
I can do.

712
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,280
He's not a drinker.

713
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,920
Oh yeah?

714
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,920
I'll take it.

715
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,160
To you!

716
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,240
Now you're talking!

717
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,240
Drink up!

718
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:55,960
Sure!

719
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,520
Great!

720
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,320
Next time, it's liquor for you!

721
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,600
Yeah, definitely!

722
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,080
You good?

723
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:02,880
You sure?

724
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,040
When's that crossed-arm toast?

725
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,720
C'mon, knock it off!

726
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
Bathroom break.

727
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,560
You're being honest!

728
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,440
Down it! All the way!

729
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,640
Watch me!

730
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,640
More, more!

731
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,880
Already?

732
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,920
He's a drinker!

733
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
C'mon!

734
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,800
Keep it coming.

735
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,560
Mr. Chen.

736
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,480
Alright.

737
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,960
Mr. Wang,

738
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,520
maybe ease up?

739
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,960
Gotta drink!

740
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,960
Where'd you run off to?

741
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,560
Sorry,

742
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,240
bathroom.

743
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,400
Did you drink?

744
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,320
Fine, I'll drink!

745
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,840
Know what this is for?

746
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,400
Just for wiping.

747
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,600
Nah,

748
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,200
I'll show you a trick.

749
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,240
Still

750
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,800
waiting on

751
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,280
that crossed-arm drink!

752
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,600
Drop it already!

753
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,640
Sorry everyone,

754
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,040
I'm late.

755
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,520
Ms. Yu!

756
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,800
our star singer's

757
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,680
finally here!

758
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,600
Wasted!

759
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,360
So this is?

760
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,520
I'm good.

761
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,679
I'm Mr. Xing's friend,

762
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,440
teach opera at the music institute.

763
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,840
The food won't cut it!

764
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,760
Waiter!

765
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,679
Mr. Yu, order anything you like.

766
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,880
I already ate.

767
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:16,440
OK.

768
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:16,840
I'll

769
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,920
make it up

770
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,159
to you all,

771
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,199
let me belt one out.

772
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:20,920
Sweet!

773
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,000
She's amazing!

774
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,800
I'll perform a section

775
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,840
from an opera.

776
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:29,880
What's up?

777
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,719
This ain't what you said.

778
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,679
More like a party

779
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,800
than business.

780
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
We're late to the game,

781
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,880
bet

782
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,199
they sorted it earlier.

783
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,040
Just keep smiling.

784
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,120
Should've taken it easy!

785
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,280
Here,

786
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,240
rinse.

787
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,520
Are you OK, Mr. Li?

788
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,360
Better?

789
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,320
Just finished puking.

790
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,880
Much better now that it's out.

791
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:54,760
OK.

792
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,680
All good, no worries.

793
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,800
Ready to go?

794
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,640
Driver's almost here.

795
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,600
Driver's coming?

796
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,040
Yeah.

797
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,520
Let's roll!

798
00:35:59,720 --> 00:35:59,880
OK.

799
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,080
Take it easy!

800
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
I'm fine. Don't help.

801
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,040
I'm good.

802
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,480
Watch this straight line!

803
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,040
See that line there?

804
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,760
I can

805
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,800
walk it!

806
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,280
Keep it down!

807
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,680
Almost home!

808
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,080
Get back inside!

809
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,640
Stop being crazy,

810
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,440
Jesse's laughing at you!

811
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,320
Got it all

812
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,320
on video!

813
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,320
Saving it for

814
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,520
when he's a big shot!

815
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,680
Watch it!

816
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,240
Steps here!

817
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,640
Steps ahead,

818
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,880
lift your feet!

819
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,760
Careful, that's it!

820
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,920
Keep going!

821
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,280
You OK?

822
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,640
He's totally wasted.

823
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,760
So sorry!

824
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,560
No worries.

825
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,480
Couldn't stop him.

826
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,600
You're kind enough

827
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,760
to bring him home.

828
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,400
Feel awful.

829
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,080
- C'mon!
- Easy!

830
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,240
- OK.
- Careful!

831
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,800
Must've been some party

832
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,400
to get this drunk?

833
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,960
Our investor

834
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,040
took us to

835
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,680
this dinner thing.

836
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,320
Bunch of

837
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,560
strangers,

838
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,760
some fund guy,

839
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,600
and

840
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,160
an investment boss.

841
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,040
Might be

842
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,120
future partners.

843
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,600
I'm singing off-key.

844
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,520
Jesse's turn.

845
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,920
Went singing too?

846
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,840
No,

847
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,360
some music teacher

848
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,240
showed up

849
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,320
mid-dinner.

850
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,080
She did all

851
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,160
the singing.

852
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
It's pretty late.

853
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,920
I gotta go.

854
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,720
Yeah, yeah.

855
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,480
Here's the car key.

856
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,040
Thank you so much!

857
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,920
You know the exit, right?

858
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,400
Yeah,

859
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,360
call me if you need anything!

860
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:00,840
OK.

861
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,440
Take care of him.

862
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,400
Thanks!

863
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,200
No problem.

864
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,880
Feel awful,

865
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,920
really awful.

866
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,840
I want...

867
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,400
some water

868
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,600
but gotta pee too.

869
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,960
It's weird.

870
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,960
Got me all confused.

871
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,680
If someone

872
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,320
has to

873
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,440
work...

874
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,480
Up and at 'em!

875
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,760
Fu Yudong!

876
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,400
Fu Yudong!

877
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,960
Time to get up!

878
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,440
I'm going!

879
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,640
Wake up!

880
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,360
C'mon!

881
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,200
Move it!

882
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,160
One quick move!

883
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,240
3, 2, 1!

884
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,000
Man, you're heavy!

885
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,800
Hey,

886
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,680
massage time!

887
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,720
Giving you a massage!

888
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:15,840
Missing my

889
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,360
work hours...

890
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,440
Will you get up?

891
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,640
Fine, I'm gone!

892
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,520
On your own now!

893
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,920
No business progress yet,

894
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,240
drinking's coming along great!
