1
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,560
[Given the current situation,]

2
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,600
[unmarried]

3
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,640
[women like us]

4
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,640
[should remember:]

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,360
[Your children have their own blessings,]

6
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,600
[and you have yours.]

7
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,960
[Often, you'll find]

8
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,640
[hard work doesn't pay off.]

9
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
[But not trying will]

10
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,120
[make you comfortable.]

11
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,720
Do you often

12
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,520
hear them

13
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,360
urging you:

14
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,120
Go for it!

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,200
Try a little harder!

16
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,920
This era is always

17
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,360
pushing you, and even

18
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,000
intimidating you,

19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,800
leaving you afraid to stop.

20
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,480
Once you stop, you'll...

21
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,600
Once you stop, you'll...

22
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,640
I'm not asking for water.

23
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,640
What's following?

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,520
Did I hire you to shake up the old world?

25
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,600
[Pause to...]

26
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,000
[Pause to reflect, then set sail once more.]

27
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,560
So there's nothing

28
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,480
wrong with relaxation.

29
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,000
Pills.

30
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,360
Where's my pillbox?

31
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,720
In the office.

32
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,840
I'll go get it.

33
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,240
Why are you

34
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,280
always so forgetful?

35
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,280
[I've noticed that]

36
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,240
[since]

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,000
[Zhang Ran's popularity surged,]

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,680
[Anran has become increasingly]

39
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,840
[terrifying, sensitive,]

40
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,000
[and strange.]

41
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:20,880
[The slightest]

42
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,280
[mistake on my part]

43
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,920
[would infuriate her.]

44
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,800
[She might]

45
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,600
[be too anxious.]

46
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,360
[Now she weighs herself]

47
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,200
[twice as often,]

48
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,400
[and switches countless bathroom scales.]

49
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,480
[Even her usual]

50
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,360
[anti-anxiety medication]

51
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,160
[has been doubled.]

52
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,320
[Not just her,]

53
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,960
[even I'm about to break down.]

54
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,760
Don't you

55
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,200
think this room is really noisy?

56
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,440
The buzz of the current never stops.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,800
Xiaohe, turn off the lights.

58
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,320
Unplug the power cords.

59
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,720
This air conditioner is way too loud.

60
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,400
Anran, this is the central air conditioning system.

61
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,160
I can't just turn off this one.

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,280
It's killing me!

63
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,240
I wish I could take it off.

64
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,760
Anran, why not grab a bite?

65
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,400
You haven't had a proper meal in ages.

66
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,920
Vitamin pills cannot sustain you forever.

67
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,440
I'm not talking

68
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,320
about meals.

69
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,320
I'm talking about the AC!

70
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,840
It's too noisy!

71
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,200
I'll get a ladder

72
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,960
to take it down.

73
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,920
Just hang it here.

74
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,360
Okay.

75
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,280
Yeah?

76
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,440
Ma'am, try on this earpiece.

77
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,120
Lower the camera.

78
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,680
What's this for?

79
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,640
The director will communicate with you.

80
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,880
Okay. Thank you.

81
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,400
It's okay.

82
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,480
Alright.

83
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,400
Is this okay?

84
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:06,880
Yeah.

85
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,480
No problem.

86
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,480
Relax.

87
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,680
I'm a bit nervous.

88
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,760
It's been so long since...

89
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,160
Go.

90
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,400
Okay.

91
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,160
Okay.

92
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,560
Xiaohe.

93
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,120
Remind me if I

94
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,920
forget my lines.

95
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,200
Okay.

96
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,240
Welcome to

97
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,520
Girl Besties.

98
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,680
Hello, I'm Lin Anran.

99
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,120
Hello,

100
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,760
I'm a live streamer, Zhang Ran.

101
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,000
It's an honor to be here.

102
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,440
Today's topic is:

103
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,160
Hustle or Chill?

104
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,200
Hustling

105
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,920
leads to success.

106
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,040
In this era of internal competition,

107
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,880
we're bound to hustle.

108
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,720
Therefore, in this era,

109
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,680
we must...

110
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,280
Director, I'm sorry.

111
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm a bit nervous.

112
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,880
It's fine.

113
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
Just keep going.

114
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,600
We'll edit it.

115
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,120
We should have grown

116
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,640
against the wind of competition.

117
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,000
But it's caused by a vicious

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,600
cycle, which we

119
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,680
have no choice but to accept.

120
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,800
The reason for such severe

121
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
internal competition

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,159
is that today's young people...

123
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,640
Today's young people...

124
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,680
It's okay to check it.

125
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,760
Xiaohe, give me the script.

126
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,880
Sorry, Director.

127
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,680
I need to check it.

128
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,120
It's okay.

129
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,960
Just relax.

130
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,600
You don't have to follow it word for word.

131
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
It's okay to start over.

132
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,720
Alright.

133
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,760
Your lines are difficult.

134
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,720
Take it easy.

135
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,320
Is it okay?

136
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,440
Yeah.

137
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,040
Three, two, one, action!

138
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,120
In this era of internal competition,

139
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,080
most people choose to rise to the challenge.

140
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,320
But beyond grinding

141
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,400
and skating by,

142
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,520
some young people

143
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,560
choose to give up entirely.

144
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,360
Some people lack

145
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,320
the means to compete, yet they refuse to quit,

146
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,600
so they

147
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
end up anxious.

148
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
Since the environment

149
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,240
has already caused anxiety,

150
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,920
why choose

151
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,880
internal competition?

152
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,040
They'd better stop

153
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,080
to lie down.

154
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,560
Relax and encourage themselves

155
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,040
to feel better.

156
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,240
Give themselves a hug.

157
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,480
Accept themselves, right?

158
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,960
I'd like to share my perspective.

159
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,040
Many people,

160
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,280
including my family,

161
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,200
don't understand me.

162
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,200
I used to work at

163
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,400
a television station.

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,400
I looked intelligent

165
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,280
and proper.

166
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
They asked me

167
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,920
why I returned to become

168
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,120
an influencer, a comedian,

169
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,520
making funny faces and dressing up

170
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,560
to entertain netizens.

171
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,120
I chose to become

172
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,760
an influencer,

173
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,960
so I'd

174
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,440
giving it my all.

175
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,280
I didn't care about the outcome,

176
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,919
because this is

177
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,840
what I want to do.

178
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,840
At present,

179
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,799
the outcome

180
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,159
seems quite satisfactory.

181
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,120
When I put in the effort

182
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,120
and achieve

183
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,040
good results,

184
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,560
I can feel a sense of accomplishment.

185
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,000
So, there's nothing

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,400
wrong with hard work itself.

187
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,120
When I first

188
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,560
started this job,

189
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,160
my supervisor

190
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,920
told me

191
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,040
my Qiandu search index

192
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,720
was only

193
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,200
thirty.

194
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,080
But today,

195
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,600
my search index

196
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,160
is definitely

197
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,440
more than thirty.

198
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,280
Through

199
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,520
hard work, I have created

200
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,160
my own value and gained

201
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,440
a sense of accomplishment.

202
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,880
[Isn't]

203
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,520
[that a good]

204
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
[thing?]

205
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,400
Hi, Zhang Ran.

206
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,080
You know my name?

207
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,040
I often use your memes.

208
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,360
They're funny.

209
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,000
You've been following me.

210
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,520
What can I do for you?

211
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,800
Nothing much.

212
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,760
I just want to ask for your advice.

213
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,360
I've just started to be an influencer.

214
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,200
My advice?

215
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,080
Yes.

216
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,240
Actually, I've

217
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,320
seen your TV show before.

218
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,720
It's really insightful.

219
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,400
It's long time ago.

220
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,800
Yeah.

221
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,800
Back then,

222
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,960
I was selling clothes.

223
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,760
That was about ten years ago.

224
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,280
Later, you married a wealthy man

225
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
and moved abroad.

226
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,600
I thought,

227
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,480
this host

228
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,320
was quite distinctive.

229
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,480
But now, you're not

230
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,120
doing hosting anymore.

231
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,320
You choose to be an influencer.

232
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,080
I find you quite interesting.

233
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
You're quite adaptable.

234
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,680
Yeah.

235
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,440
Fine. Since you ask for my advice,

236
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,560
I'll give it to you.

237
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,760
The company hired you,

238
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,280
because your video of

239
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,080
Desperate Personal Shopper went viral.

240
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,520
This is now

241
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,360
your trademark.

242
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
People ask for

243
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,840
what they want

244
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,400
based on this trademark.

245
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,560
Do you know what

246
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,680
your followers ask for?

247
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,840
Me playing the fool.

248
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,520
Exactly.

249
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,960
I'm just wondering if,

250
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,880
besides playing

251
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,200
the fool, I can create

252
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,280
something meaningful

253
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,680
like I used to.

254
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,840
Another piece of advice.

255
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,480
Yes?

256
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,120
Only traffic

257
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,000
is your true friend.

258
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,680
Larger traffic

259
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,360
means more clout.

260
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,640
Thank you.

261
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,080
You're welcome.

262
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,600
I hope to see you again

263
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,640
at next annual meeting.

264
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:28,800
Okay.

265
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,960
[I believe each of us]

266
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,040
[has the script]

267
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,400
[of our own life.]

268
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,640
What's wrong

269
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,560
with being

270
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,000
the protagonist

271
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
in this script?

272
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,520
Better than playing supporting

273
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,280
role to others.

274
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,760
This is my personal opinion.

275
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,840
You said you want to be the protagonist.

276
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,680
So, you're

277
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,240
saying supporting

278
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
roles don't matter?

279
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,640
What's wrong

280
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,520
with ordinary people

281
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,920
like me playing supporting

282
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,520
roles?

283
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,240
Anran, who do you think

284
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,480
represents the ordinary person

285
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,040
more between the two of us?

286
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,960
Isn't that obvious?

287
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,480
You have no chance

288
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,520
to compete with me

289
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,080
to present

290
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
real ordinary folks.

291
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,720
You are not ordinary!

292
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,040
Keep asking

293
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,240
about who's ordinary.

294
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,440
I don't want to argue

295
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,680
who's more ordinary.

296
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,840
But the truth is: you've never been ordinary.

297
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,440
You used to be a host

298
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,680
on the financial news channel,

299
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,240
intelligent, dignified

300
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,680
and knowledgeable.

301
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,080
But everyone

302
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,480
knows how I got here.

303
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,480
Compared to you,

304
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,280
I'm the one who's a real ordinary person.

305
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,200
Now you've stepped into

306
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,520
the world of influencer.

307
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,200
You can deign to

308
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,160
play the fool

309
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,880
and be turned

310
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,320
into memes.

311
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,440
You don't even care

312
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,280
about personal privacy.

313
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,760
Isn't that

314
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,960
too competitive of you?

315
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,840
That's too much.

316
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,680
It's hard to believe.

317
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,360
Is that necessary?

318
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,880
Give Zhang Ran a close-up.

319
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,120
I can understand

320
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,120
your doubts about this.

321
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
You wouldn't go that far.

322
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,080
You wouldn't deign to.

323
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,560
With your status,

324
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,600
you can get

325
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,840
everything you want

326
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,000
without lifting a finger.

327
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
This is reality.

328
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,040
But I'm not you.

329
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,480
I'm plain-looking. I'm from an ordinary family.

330
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,320
My family

331
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,080
cannot help me with my career.

332
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,400
I don't have the luck

333
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,560
to get rich easily.

334
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,480
So I have to work

335
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,000
exceptionally hard for my future.

336
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,720
Fine.

337
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,240
Keep asking.

338
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,520
Read the comment on the video:

339
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,680
[Pander to the crowd. Shameless.]

340
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,280
[You need to push her.]

341
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,480
What?

342
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,760
Okay. I'll keep asking.

343
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,600
There's a comment on your video:

344
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,200
"Pander to the crowd. Shameless."

345
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,760
You claim you're ordinary

346
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,080
and your success is

347
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,480
all due to your shamelessness.

348
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,240
Does achieving goals mean

349
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,640
abandoning all principles?

350
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,240
Or are you saying

351
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,680
that ordinary people

352
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
should be shameless like you?

353
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,120
Ordinary people should be shameless?

354
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,760
Of course not!

355
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,120
I didn't mean that.

356
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,720
Speaking of which,

357
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
what is their

358
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,120
definition of shamelessness?

359
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,200
Is exposing

360
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,080
my privacy shameless?

361
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,000
I prefer to call it

362
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,760
sincerity.

363
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,040
I share valid and authentic

364
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,400
information with everyone.

365
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,360
What's wrong with that?

366
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,400
So you'll keep

367
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
going like this, disregarding

368
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,120
your and

369
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,080
your family's privacy?

370
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,120
Well,

371
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,440
at least I won't tell you

372
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,640
my underwear size.

373
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,040
Yeah?

374
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,600
I agree with you that

375
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,920
ordinary people should have no shame.

376
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,480
Doesn't your success

377
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,080
prove just that?

378
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,640
That is your opinion.

379
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,760
I choose to be competitive, but it doesn't

380
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,360
mean I don't care about privacy.

381
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:41,880
I decide

382
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,920
what to disclose.

383
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,080
This is my own choice.

384
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:44,840
I hope

385
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,960
I can be

386
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,000
the kind of person

387
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,320
who, at the end

388
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,280
of my life,

389
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,320
has no regrets.

390
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,200
So what you're saying is,

391
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,680
you're going to keep hustling

392
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,160
until the day you drop,

393
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,560
right?

394
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,520
There's still a long time.

395
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,200
I don't know what

396
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,680
the future

397
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,440
holds, but for now,

398
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,560
I choose to keep going.

399
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,680
Okay. We're done for the day.

400
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,400
Thank you.

401
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:02,960
Good.

402
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,920
Thank you, Director.

403
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,560
Thank you.

404
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,760
Thank you.

405
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,600
Ran, you did

406
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,440
an excellent job!

407
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:09,960
Keep it down.

408
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,960
That was stepping

409
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,600
outside the box.

410
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,680
Director.

411
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,080
Zhang Ran, you did pretty well.

412
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,560
Thank you.

413
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,920
Was I just

414
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,520
being too competitive?

415
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,920
It's alright.

416
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,000
We can still make edits.

417
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,120
Don't worry.

418
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,720
Leave it to us.

419
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,760
Okay. Thank you, Director.

420
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,720
Thank you, Director.

421
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,560
By the way,

422
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,880
are you married?

423
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,640
Yes.

424
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,360
Fortunately,

425
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,640
Anran is unmarried.

426
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,760
The next theme

427
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,720
could be marriage,

428
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,520
like, whether or not to get married.

429
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,440
How do you think?

430
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,400
Okay. Fine by me.

431
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,200
I'll keep working.

432
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,080
See you next time.

433
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,840
Okay. Thank you.

434
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,160
Thank you, Director.

435
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,880
Thank you. Good bye.

436
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,280
Let's dance!

437
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:51,720
Dan,

438
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,920
we have confirmed with Peace TV

439
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,240
that the show will go live at 10.

440
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,640
Get ready.

441
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,560
Okay.

442
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,760
I've already

443
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,440
arranged for

444
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,720
bullet screen, video cut, and other

445
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,760
forms of opinion control.

446
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,000
What are you waiting for?

447
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,960
Let's get started!

448
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Ready.

449
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,880
Log in.

450
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,680
I'll do it.

451
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,600
We are

452
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,360
already logged in.

453
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,160
Yeah.

454
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,760
Okay.

455
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,040
Ready.

456
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,280
[In your view, in order]

457
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,120
[to be better, should ordinary]

458
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,560
[people be shameless]

459
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,040
[like you?]

460
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,800
[Ordinary people should be shameless.]

461
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,960
At the time, we thought

462
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,200
that's a powerful line.

463
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,320
So they put it at the beginning.

464
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,800
Yeah?

465
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,960
Yes. This statement

466
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,720
is like a bomb.

467
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,280
Yeah?

468
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,520
I bet they're definitely

469
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,640
trying to use it for marketing.

470
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,920
No! That's rhetorical!

471
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,840
It can't be out of context!

472
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,760
Weren't you there too?

473
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,480
The full version is definitely coming later.

474
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,240
This is a teaser.

475
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,720
Just a trailer.

476
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,440
Really?

477
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,080
Definitely.

478
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,520
But it's a bit odd.

479
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,640
It'll go viral.

480
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,920
It has reached tenth place

481
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,120
on the trend.

482
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,440
We also promoted it

483
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,400
on social media.

484
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,920
Twenty minutes

485
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,720
until the broadcast.

486
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,080
The followers have surpassed 100,000.

487
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,720
Our goal today is to enter

488
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,440
the traffic pool of million.

489
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,760
Once aired,

490
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,000
we can achieve the goal.

491
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,920
All thanks to Zhang Ran's

492
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
topic of "ordinary people

493
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,400
have no shame".

494
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,839
[Should they abandon principles?]

495
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,480
[Are you saying that]

496
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,960
[they should be shameless]

497
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,440
[like you?]

498
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,200
[Regular people should be shameless.]

499
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,119
[So that makes it okay]

500
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,359
[for you to keep grinding like this]

501
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,119
[and trashing your own]

502
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,040
[and your family's privacy?]

503
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,079
[There are levels to privacy.]

504
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,400
[It's not like I'm telling everyone]

505
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,600
[what size underwear I wear,]

506
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:28,960
[right?]

507
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,400
[But your success today]

508
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,280
[kind of proves my point, doesn't it?]

509
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,640
[That's your take.]

510
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,960
[I choose to hustle.]

511
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,720
[In my eyes,]

512
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,400
[it's not that everything can be said.]

513
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:37,880
[What gets shared]

514
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,920
[is up to me.]

515
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,040
[I'm the one doing the grinding,]

516
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,000
[so I want to...]

517
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,320
What are you two doing? What?

518
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,480
Anran, our show

519
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,240
just hit the trending list.

520
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:44,960
Seriously?

521
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,640
No. 12 on the entertainment chart.

522
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,240
Just that one topic?

523
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,440
I've got wrinkles.

524
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,200
Forehead lines,

525
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,160
smile lines, dark circles.

526
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,960
My styling looks awful.

527
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,960
My fans are going to dump me.

528
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,440
The full episode's been up an hour.

529
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,560
Views are solid,

530
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,080
but the vibe is off.

531
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,960
Some people are clipping Zhang Ran's

532
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,880
comments out of context.

533
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,000
Do you

534
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,720
want me to step in?

535
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,160
Then kill that topic.

536
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,960
Pull it off the hot search.

537
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,520
The trending isn't ours.

538
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,080
It's from the show's team.

539
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,360
I'll take care of it.

540
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,240
Ms. Qian,

541
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,920
are the two short video clips

542
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,200
for Lin Anran ready?

543
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,160
Sorted ages ago.

544
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,520
Next, on behalf

545
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,480
of our work group,

546
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,760
I'll walk you through

547
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,800
the marketing plan

548
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,960
for the new product launch.

549
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,800
First,

550
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,920
we want to do an offline

551
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,680
multi-brand store activation,

552
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,680
mainly

553
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,320
a launch event

554
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,080
built around...

555
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,320
Sorry, I have to jump in.

556
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,160
Why is it still all offline?

557
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,640
We've talked about this

558
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,680
several times:

559
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,400
this rejuvenating cream

560
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,480
is Lady Wan's star product

561
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,120
for the Double 11 livestream.

562
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,560
And here you are giving away

563
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,840
buy-one-get-one,

564
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,800
lucky draws, spin-the-wheel prizes.

565
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,520
And you've booked

566
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,080
a bunch of little celebs

567
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,880
to sing and dance.

568
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,640
What's the point?

569
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,480
It's so tacky.

570
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,920
Then what are you suggesting, Mr. Li?

571
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,720
I'm saying

572
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,840
we spend money where it counts.

573
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,080
I'm not against offline,

574
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,280
but we need

575
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,440
something clever,

576
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,480
something imaginative.

577
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,240
Since we're doing it,

578
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,920
we should aim

579
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,760
for an event

580
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,440
with hot-search potential.

581
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,320
You get me?

582
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,680
Aim for the hot search.

583
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,320
Well, maybe you're not

584
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,760
very familiar with current

585
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,640
traffic-buying prices.

586
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:13,920
Alex,

587
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,840
why don't you explain...

588
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,680
I don't need an explanation.

589
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,320
I don't need to know the rates,

590
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,400
and I'm not talking about

591
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,000
buying traffic.

592
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,920
I'm saying

593
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,920
we put our heads together,

594
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,680
figure out how

595
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,200
to get it trending organically.

596
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,680
Trending on its own.

597
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,240
Mr. Li, right now

598
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:35,920
any kind

599
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,760
of marketing

600
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,560
that hits the hot search

601
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,800
follows a fairly fixed process.

602
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,560
If we...

603
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,960
People make things happen.

604
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,000
We wanted into Lady Wan's livestream,

605
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,240
and everyone said it was impossible.

606
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,400
But we pushed

607
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,320
and we got in, didn't we?

608
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,840
Don't be so rigid.

609
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,920
We need something unexpected.

610
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,880
Why don't we dig into it today?

611
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,600
Someone cast your screen.

612
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,680
No, not that, kill that.

613
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,880
Put the

614
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,560
trending list up.

615
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,600
Let's study it

616
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,080
and brainstorm, okay?

617
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,600
We'll look at them one by one.

618
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,480
I'll do it.

619
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,080
Go ahead.

620
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,520
Let's see how other people get up there.

621
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,600
Did they pay?

622
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
If they did, how?

623
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,200
If they didn't, then how?

624
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,680
- Got it.
- Make it bigger.

625
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,520
I'm half-blind with astigmatism.

626
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:16,800
Okay.

627
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,960
Look at the first one:

628
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,080
"Who's Zhang Ran?"

629
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,040
Zhang Ran...

630
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,840
Zhang Ran is... is...

631
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,600
What kind of trending topic is this?

632
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
She's an influencer.

633
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,400
Said the wrong thing on a talk show

634
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,040
and now she's getting roasted.

635
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,400
So hitting the hot search

636
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,560
isn't always a good thing.

637
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,080
Mr. Fu?

638
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,240
Why'd he walk out?

639
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,120
It's fine.

640
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,040
It's... It's fine.

641
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,640
Have a seat. He, uh,

642
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,320
his stomach's been acting up

643
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,240
these two days.

644
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,920
Just went to the restroom.

645
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,280
Let's...

646
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,640
Let's just go back to

647
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,280
what you were presenting.

648
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,760
Okay.

649
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,480
Turn it off.

650
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,080
Let's keep talking about

651
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,120
the offline event.

652
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,360
Go on.

653
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,960
Be mindful of personal privacy.

654
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,760
The show butchered the edit.

655
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,280
This is malicious editing.

656
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,280
That's not

657
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,480
what my sister meant at all.

658
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,400
They ripped her words out of context

659
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,160
and twisted everything.

660
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,440
She says

661
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,520
"ordinary people should be shameless"

662
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,920
and that's going to get her dragged.

663
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,120
Ran,

664
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,880
the "Who's Zhang Ran" hashtag

665
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,400
just jumped eight spots

666
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,080
in under two minutes.

667
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,680
Loads of people just flooded

668
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,920
into our Little White Sail account.

669
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,880
They're all flaming us.

670
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,920
Leave it. I'll handle it.

671
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,920
This is insane.

672
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
Let's delete some comments.

673
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,600
We're throttling the barrage on screen,

674
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,760
but it'll take a bit.

675
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,280
Sorry, I didn't knock.

676
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,080
Could you help me please?

677
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,560
Did you just watch the stream?

678
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,560
My live room's

679
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,440
suddenly packed

680
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,200
and everyone's attacking me.

681
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,400
Let me explain

682
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,120
what actually happened.

683
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,800
When I said that line

684
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,560
on the show,

685
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,200
I was throwing the question back.

686
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,560
I said a lot of things before that,

687
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,200
and I never said,

688
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,960
"Ordinary people should be shameless",

689
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,760
not like that.

690
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,800
I said more after it too,

691
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,200
a whole bunch of context,

692
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,680
but they

693
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,280
cut all

694
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,240
of that out

695
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,160
and kept just that one line.

696
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,320
Now it looks like

697
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,600
I only said

698
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,880
"ordinary people should be shameless",

699
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,360
like that's my core belief.

700
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,600
That's not what I meant at all.

701
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,640
Please, you have to believe me.

702
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,240
Help me.

703
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,640
Zhang Ran, come here.

704
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,520
Sit, sit.

705
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,360
Please. calm down.

706
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,680
We believe you,

707
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,840
of course we believe you.

708
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,520
It really wasn't like that.

709
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,920
You weren't there that day.

710
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,560
Bo and the others can vouch for me.

711
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,320
I didn't mean it that way,

712
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,560
I was joking.

713
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,880
After Lin Anran finished talking,

714
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,560
I came in

715
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,080
with that line as a joke.

716
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,400
It was part of a whole bit,

717
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,440
not just that one sentence.

718
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,680
They chopped out that single line

719
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,400
and threw it online.

720
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,920
That's the problem.

721
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,800
The worst ones

722
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,160
are the keyboard warriors.

723
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,520
Yeah, yeah.

724
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,640
We're already locking down

725
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,960
the comments on the barrage.

726
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,960
Give it a minute.

727
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,240
Bo can't delete fast enough.

728
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,080
It's all abuse.

729
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,600
Every single one is cursing me.

730
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,760
I've got more people on it now.

731
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,880
Trust me, okay? Trust me.

732
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,680
When we

733
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,520
were taping,

734
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,840
the show told us we weren't allowed

735
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,880
to record on our phones,

736
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,320
so I told Bo,

737
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,560
"Fine, we'll do

738
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,240
whatever they say

739
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,160
and cooperate."

740
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,200
And now

741
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,560
they cut it like this.

742
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,400
If I'd recorded it,

743
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,320
I'd have proof.

744
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,680
I could show everyone

745
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,160
I didn't say it like that,

746
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,520
right?

747
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,120
So what do I do now?

748
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,840
What do I do?

749
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,520
Ms. Qian,

750
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,600
this isn't right.

751
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,720
Just so their show can blow up,

752
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,400
they don't care about my artist?

753
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,640
You're right, this is on the show.

754
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,760
It's definitely on them.

755
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,960
Don't worry.

756
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,200
We'll figure something out.

757
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,000
We are absolutely

758
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,960
on your side.

759
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,160
Zhang Ran,

760
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,320
don't panic.

761
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,280
We've been

762
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,200
in constant contact with them.

763
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,680
Yes.

764
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,480
Thank you, boss.

765
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,160
Thank you.

766
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,800
So what do we do now?

767
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
Everything's under control.

768
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,120
You have to trust us.

769
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,040
I do.

770
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,040
I...

771
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,240
Go home and get some rest first.

772
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,320
Okay.

773
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,040
I trust the company.

774
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,200
I trust you. Thank you, boss.

775
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,360
When you get back,

776
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,040
turn your phone off.

777
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:19,600
Okay.

778
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
We are

779
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,720
your strongest backing.

780
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,080
Thank you, boss.

781
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,880
See Ran out.

782
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
What do you think about this?

783
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,960
She still can't carry it.

784
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,040
I don't think

785
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,440
she did anything seriously wrong.

786
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,480
We should back her.

787
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,000
Isn't it obvious?

788
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,480
The show set us up.

789
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,680
This is straight-up

790
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,920
malicious editing.

791
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,920
I think we should

792
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,480
issue a statement, now.

793
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,680
Then what about Lin Anran's videos?

794
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,320
Maybe...

795
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,680
maybe we

796
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,800
go to the show,

797
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,800
ask for

798
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,960
the full uncut footage.

799
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,280
Then we

800
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,080
quietly leak

801
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,240
the full version somewhere.

802
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,560
That might calm

803
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,960
some of the backlash

804
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,760
and it could

805
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,320
even flip the narrative in our favor.

806
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,120
Ms. Qian, you're missing the point.

807
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,320
The traffic has already snowballed.

808
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,920
A runaway horse

809
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
doesn't go

810
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,960
where we tell it to.

811
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,360
If the full episode

812
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,480
leaks,

813
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,720
sure, Zhang Ran might look less guilty,

814
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,520
but Lin Anran could

815
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,240
end up in serious trouble.

816
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,880
What she said

817
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,200
is the real landmine.

818
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,000
If you put that out,

819
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,560
Tide Media goes down with her.

820
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,520
We really have to sacrifice the pawn?

821
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,400
What would you suggest then?

822
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,120
In that case,

823
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,400
we can only

824
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,880
lock Zhang Ran's account.

825
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,680
I'll handle it.

826
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,160
Director,

827
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,920
this first episode is a hit.

828
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,080
A real splash.

829
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,280
Zhang Ran, go home

830
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,360
and take a break.

831
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Turn off your phone.

832
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,760
Don't look at anything.

833
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,880
Ignore everything online.

834
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,200
Just rest.

835
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,520
Zhang Ran?

836
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,280
Zhang Ran?

837
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,320
Let's stop watching, okay?

838
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,280
Turn it off.

839
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,680
It's a crappy job anyway.

840
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,920
If we don't want to do it, we don't.

841
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,360
Online, nobody

842
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,680
really cares about anyone.

843
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,280
The people praising you today will be

844
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,280
the same ones hurling abuse tomorrow.

845
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,760
Listen to me, let's walk away.

846
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,640
Go back to a normal life, okay?

847
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,960
It's okay.

848
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,200
Whatever happens,

849
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,880
you've got me. I'm here.

850
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,520
Come here.

851
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,680
Tiger, you might be

852
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,680
king of the jungle,

853
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,640
but even kings end up in cages

854
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,400
one day.

855
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,960
Happy with your poop-scooper?

856
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,320
You lot work days,

857
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,840
and I work nights.

858
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,280
My shift is cleaning up after you.

859
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,080
[Guys, can you believe this?]

860
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:18,920
[I can't]

861
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,199
[with these influencers anymore.]

862
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,199
[Just saw one on a show,]

863
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,320
[first thing out of her mouth was:]

864
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,920
["Ordinary people should be shameless]

865
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,080
[and grovel to the rich."]

866
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,199
Dinner's ready.

867
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,080
[I got full-body goosebumps.]

868
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,040
[Like,]

869
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,360
[what's wrong with ordinary people?]

870
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,280
[We earn]

871
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,199
[with our own hands.]

872
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,280
[The breakfast lady's]

873
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,520
[up at 3 a.m.,]

874
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,239
[the guys on site]

875
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,520
[work under the blazing sun.]

876
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,360
[Aren't they all earning money]

877
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,320
[with their heads held high?]

878
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,679
Exactly, she's so right.

879
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,560
You full?

880
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,239
Come eat.

881
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,560
I'm watching this video.

882
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,920
She's making a lot of sense.

883
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,880
Everyone online's

884
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,120
tearing into some influencer.

885
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,920
Why are they cursing her?

886
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,679
Something like, ordinary people

887
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,840
shouldn't care about their pride,

888
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,200
should give up their dignity

889
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,520
and grovel to rich people.

890
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,920
"Grovel", you know what that means?

891
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,640
It's what

892
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,960
young people say now.

893
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,040
What's wrong with young people's values

894
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,920
these days?

895
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,480
Didn't anyone

896
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,800
raise them?

897
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,640
Let me see.

898
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,360
This one.

899
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,520
Look.

900
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,560
Fran, the peacock's gone.

901
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,080
The peacock's gone?

902
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,320
[Impressive,]

903
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,640
[you even managed to lose a peacock.]

904
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,640
Can you not worry about how I lost it?

905
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,760
Since you're with Xinying,

906
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,240
have her check the warehouse next door.

907
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,080
[Okay, relax.]

908
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,480
[It won't get far in this short a time.]

909
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,440
Right.

910
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,160
You look outside the park,

911
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,360
I'll search inside,

912
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,280
okay?

913
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,320
You really managed to lose

914
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,520
a peacock in the middle of the night.

915
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,680
Where are we supposed to find it now?

916
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,280
Ge Kaiyang, I say we just

917
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,880
find a way to buy another one,

918
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,280
yeah?

919
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,880
Please, come back.

920
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,880
If you're gone, I'm done.

921
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,400
Do a peacock call.

922
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,760
You two,

923
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,880
get over to my live location.

924
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,800
I see it.

925
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,080
Got it, on my way.

926
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,840
I told you

927
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,360
it wasn't over here.

928
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,400
I've searched this whole spot.

929
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,120
Coming.

930
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,680
Mom,

931
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:05,880
Dad, come in.

932
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,840
Where's Zhang Ran?

933
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,720
In her room.

934
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,240
I knew you were unreliable.

935
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:19,960
All day long

936
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,440
it's you

937
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,000
people's fault.

938
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,400
How is it my fault again?

939
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,120
Always watching videos on your phone.

940
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,560
That's you lot, isn't it?

941
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,920
Mom, she didn't even eat dinner.

942
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,440
I made some congee. Maybe you...

943
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,120
I'll go.

944
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,160
Careful, it's hot.

945
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:45,680
Ran,

946
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,480
have some congee.

947
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,480
I don't want it, Mom. You have it.

948
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,080
You need a full stomach to sleep well.

949
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,320
I'm not hungry. Just leave me alone.

950
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,960
You drink it.

951
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,440
Then...

952
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,240
call me when you want to eat, okay?

953
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,080
Still on your phone.

954
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,000
She didn't drink any of it?

955
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,360
These people are awful.

956
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,240
[Boss,]

957
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,320
[I might be]

958
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:29,840
[late tonight.]

959
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,920
[Something's happened with Zhang Ran.]

960
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,960
[She's getting dogpiled online.]

961
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,880
[I'm going to check on Yudong first.]

962
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,040
[Maybe you should look into]

963
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,240
[what's going on too,]

964
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,280
[see if it's worth giving her a call.]

965
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,400
[Up to you.]

966
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,040
I just saw it here,

967
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,400
in this patch.

968
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,120
There's nothing here.

969
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,800
saw its tail,

970
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,560
then whoosh, gone.

971
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,640
You sure you didn't just see a cat?

972
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,720
You sound like you've been stepped on.

973
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,920
Ge Kaiyang, maybe we stop.

974
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,640
Just buy one and be done with it?

975
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,400
No.

976
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,880
This isn't just losing a peacock.

977
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,280
I've treated it like family.

978
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,720
I'll find it.

979
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,480
Ge Kaiyang,

980
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,080
we still chasing it?

981
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:54,960
Yeah.

982
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,200
If we don't, I'll stick you in a cage.

983
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,560
We still wouldn't be

984
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,960
able to fan our tails.

985
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,480
Fine, keep chasing.

986
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,880
[First time I've realized]

987
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,240
[peacocks can fly this high.]

988
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,080
[This high?]

989
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,960
[It's still a bird.]

990
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,320
[Aren't you scared, flying that high?]

991
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,040
[Sure.]

992
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,840
[Scared, but you still want to fly.]
