1
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,759
Ma'am, should you or I

2
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,640
take Nian to

3
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,160
extracurricular class today?

4
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,120
After deliberation, I still don't think

5
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,920
fake wife scheme

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,920
would work.

7
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,120
Me, neither.

8
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,440
Lady Wan said

9
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,280
that there must be a 'wife',

10
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,039
but it cannot be Zhang Ran.

11
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,600
What should I do?

12
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,760
I told her that this will

13
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,600
be the last time they pretend

14
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,320
to be a couple in live stream.

15
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,640
She promised.

16
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,880
Can't you see how much

17
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,760
this will affect

18
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
their marriage?

19
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,920
The actors

20
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,520
playing couple also have

21
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,000
their own real-life partners.

22
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,200
You're hilarious.

23
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,680
In this scheme,

24
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,360
they're just acting

25
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,160
as a

26
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,280
so-called couple.

27
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,040
Yudong told me

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,560
that Zhang Ran accepts it.

29
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,320
You can call her

30
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,360
and see for yourself.

31
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:44,960
Shall I call for you?

32
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
That's nonsense.

33
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,920
Did she have any other choice?

34
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,040
How could that be nonsense?

35
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,800
Everyone else is fine with it.

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,400
Why

37
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,960
are you still making a fuss?

38
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,200
What? Make a fuss?

39
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,320
Aren't you?

40
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,080
I'm so sorry.

41
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,400
I shouldn't, okay?

42
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,840
I won't care about

43
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,880
your business anymore.

44
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,160
Do whatever you want.

45
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,640
Okay?

46
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,400
I'm so sorry.

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,840
You won't hear anything from me.

48
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,240
That's it.

49
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,760
I'll take Nian to extracurricular class.

50
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,800
I already told you yesterday that

51
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,840
today's class is canceled.

52
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,360
You never seem to

53
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,320
care about these.

54
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,520
I thought you're scared of heights.

55
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,920
Why do you keep

56
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,840
going up here?

57
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,720
I'm adjusting to

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,480
our current altitude.

59
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
After checking the batch

60
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,760
of goods for Lady Wan,

61
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,600
I find myself

62
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
standing higher

63
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,200
and seeing farther now.

64
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,200
Arguments with Cheng Man

65
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,600
used to leave me low for days.

66
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,960
Now I shrug it off right away.

67
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
You two had a fight?

68
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,280
Just a spat.

69
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,160
She's a good wife,

70
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,920
way better than Zhang Ran.

71
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,320
What? Do you have

72
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,120
any grievances against

73
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,720
your real wife?

74
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,200
Get lost.

75
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,560
What happened?

76
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,440
Nothing.

77
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,760
C'mon, tell me.

78
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,800
Don't want to say.

79
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,120
Then I'll

80
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,760
call her myself.

81
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,720
Enough.

82
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,720
I've taken the brunt myself.

83
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,320
You don't

84
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,280
want to get yelled at by her.

85
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,480
Did something bad happen?

86
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,600
No.

87
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,240
Anyway, get the work sorted out.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,920
Everything will be fine.

89
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,640
Yudong.

90
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,880
Looks like your horizons

91
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,520
have also broadened.

92
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,200
Who in the world

93
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,360
can control our destiny?

94
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,440
Of course, it's ourselves!

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,480
Zhang Ran,

96
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,480
let me introduce.

97
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,320
This is the

98
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,680
owner and director of the production

99
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,120
company of our online show.

100
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,400
Nice to meet you, sir.

101
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,120
Glad to meet you.

102
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,560
Well,

103
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,840
let me introduce

104
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,760
our project.

105
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,600
We are a new video

106
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,760
production company.

107
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,840
This will be our first

108
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,159
variety show video.

109
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,000
We only

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,440
invited renowned guests.

111
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,240
Now, we need

112
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,920
a well-known streamer

113
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,800
to inject

114
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,880
some vitality

115
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,440
into the show.

116
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,760
We actually like

117
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,840
your online

118
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,680
persona and

119
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,920
live streaming style.

120
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,400
So,

121
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,560
I reached out to Mr. Lin,

122
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,920
and I'd like to invite you

123
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,600
to join us.

124
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,000
I wonder if you're interested.

125
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,880
First, thank you for your invitation.

126
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,320
But I don't know

127
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,880
what to do on a reality

128
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,560
show.

129
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,720
I've never been

130
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,880
on a show like this before.

131
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,000
It's simple.

132
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,280
Just play up your usual

133
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,040
desperate persona

134
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,800
with exaggerated,

135
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,760
comedic actions.

136
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,520
That'll be fine.

137
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,880
Like the class clown, right?

138
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,720
You can put it that way.

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,520
Zhang Ran.

140
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,960
This show features

141
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,360
movie star, singer, and even

142
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,680
multi-talented entertainers.

143
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,600
You are

144
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,000
the representative of influencers.

145
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,040
Everyone has their role

146
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,240
to play.

147
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,240
But...

148
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,800
Ran doesn't

149
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,880
rely on gimmicks for attention.

150
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,080
She's positioned

151
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,120
as an independent woman.

152
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,159
If what you're looking for is reasonable,

153
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,400
we'd be very open

154
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,960
to collaborating.

155
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,120
Well, okay.

156
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,720
Fine by me.

157
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,760
That'd be great!

158
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,440
Would you

159
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,800
like to review the process

160
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,880
and the proposed direction

161
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,240
for your role?

162
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,040
Sure.

163
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,560
Okay?

164
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,280
Thank you once again.

165
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,680
I look forward to working with you.

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,680
Thank you.

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,840
When did you come back?

168
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,640
Just now.

169
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
I'll head to the office.

170
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,200
I'll be in Lady Wan's

171
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,360
live stream room.

172
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,360
Li Daoqi and I

173
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,880
rented a room near the company

174
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,000
for convenience.

175
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,880
Okay.

176
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,240
And you can get to know

177
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,160
your fake wife better.

178
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,600
What do you mean?

179
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,320
Nothing.

180
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
Anyway,

181
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,800
I've been booked for a variety show.

182
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,680
The filming starts tomorrow.

183
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,360
I'll stay there.

184
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,600
What's that?

185
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,400
Fine.

186
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,640
I'll know it from your live stream.

187
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,840
I'm used to it anyway.

188
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,760
Fu Yudong,

189
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,640
do you think

190
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,960
we can keep going

191
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,040
like this?

192
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,120
What do you think?

193
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,280
I'm exhausted.

194
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,040
Me too.

195
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,960
Don't forget

196
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,120
to change into your slippers.

197
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,520
It's live time.

198
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,920
Busy with work,

199
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,160
so I won't be

200
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,800
coming home tonight.

201
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,600
Good luck.

202
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,040
Wait.

203
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,520
You know...

204
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,440
Well,

205
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,120
we'll talk tomorrow.

206
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,280
Bye.

207
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,880

208
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,640
You must cooperate

209
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,040
with the production team.

210
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,040
I know.

211
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,400
I'll do whatever they tell me to.

212
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,200
You can say whatever you want.

213
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,000
They'll edit it anyway.

Hello, sir.

I came

222
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,000
with a surprise for you.

223
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,000
The show

224
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,360
will focus

225
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,080
all the spotlight on you.

226
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,520
It will be spectacular.

227
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,840
The ratings are counting on you!

228
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Am I worth it? There are

229
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,000
so many celebrities.

230
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,600
No problem. Trust me.

231
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,200

Thank you so much.

236
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,960
When we

237
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,000

238
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,440

240
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,360
Of course I will.

241
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,840
Deal. I'm off

242
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,600
to a script meeting.

243
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,320
I'll leave

244
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,000
you to it.

245
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,360
Okay.

246
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,680
All good?

247
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,600
See you.

248
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,160
Okay.

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,600
Good bye.

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,200
Good bye.

Good bye.

252
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,200
It is my responsibility to cooperate.

253
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,840
Why did he stress that?

254
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,480
Just do it.

255
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,320
Yes, I will.

256
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,720

Nice to meet you!

272
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,200
I really like you.

273
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,440
Yeah?

274
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,600
I've liked almost every

275
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
one of your videos.

276
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:49,960
Thank you.

277
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,760
I also love

278
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,880

279
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,360
Thanks.

280
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Have you seen my act?

281
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,320
Yeah. I've seen it

282
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,240
on my phone.

283
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,280
About your, uh...

284
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,320
It's okay.

285
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,840
I have a movie coming out soon.

286
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,440
If you have time, please take a look.

287
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,200
Okay.

288
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,440
We'll buy tickets to learn from you.

289
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,120
No, I'll treat you.

290
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,680
Take a break.

291
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,600
Stop recording.

295
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,920
That's how it is.

296
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,400
I'm currently on the rise,

297
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,040
and this is

298
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,760
my first time participating

299
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,000
in such an important show.

300
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,280
If there's anything

301
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,320
I do that's gone too far

302
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,040
or that you're not satisfied with

303
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,560
during our interaction,

304
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,360
just let me know.

305
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,520
I'll make adjustments.

306
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,800
It's alright.

307
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,040
It's my first time too.

308
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,040
Yeah?

309
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,200
To be honest,

310
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,480
the other guests are older.

311
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,560
We're the younger ones here.

312
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,360
So, during the recording,

313
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,200
we can try to

314
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,800
interact as much as possible.

315
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,160

320
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,520

321

Okay. Thanks.

334
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,760
That's way too polite.

336
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,760

345
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,000
Back then,

346
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,200
we met

347
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,480
by chance.

348
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,240
He gave up his career

349
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,120

350
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,880

You mean I've always been this old?

396
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,320
No, never.

397
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,080
You've always been this elegant.

398
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,360
It's just small talk.

399
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,560
Oh, this is

400
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,680
your roommate, Zhang Ran.

401
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,640
Hello.

402
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,240
I'm Zhang Ran.

403
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,600
She's a...

404
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,480
We're going to be roommates.

405
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,600
She is famous for her

406
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,400
meme faces.

407
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
I'm kind of an influencer now,

408
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,280
creating short videos and live streaming.

409
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,720
I also create some

410
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,520
to share my life.

411
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,920
That's a good hobby of yours.

412
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,600
But I do this

413
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,040
for work.

414
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,960
Do it for a living.

415
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,040
Yeah.

416
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,320
Making a living off memes

417
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,480
isn't easy.

418
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,160
Is that a full-time job?

419
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,000
That's enough.

420
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,640
I'm just asking.

421
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,640
Is he your partner?

422
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,880
No, he's my boss.

423
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,040
Nice to meet you.

424
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,640
Does your company

425
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,680
provide health

426
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
insurance for you?

427
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,960
Stop asking!

428
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,640
I'll go bring

429
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,360
those suitcases

430
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:20,840
inside.

431
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,200
It's heavy.

432
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,600
I'll take it myself.

433
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,280
It's okay.

434
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,720
I'll take it.

435
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,080
I've been working out.

436
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,440
I can do it.

437
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:25,920
Let me help.

438
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,480
I can do it.

439
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:26,880
He didn't

440
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,640
help when we arrived.

441
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,760
Why didn't you take

442
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,400
our luggage when we arrived?

443
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,960
Guangfa,

444
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,160
you arrived before me.

445
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,960
Tell Haoran

446
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,760
to begin the pairing task.

447
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,480
Yes, sir.

448
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:38,840
Action!

449
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,480
Is this task just for the two of us?

450
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,320
What about the others?

451
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,800
They need to

452
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,640
tidy up the room.

453
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,440
We should

454
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,520
get the ingredients.

455
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,920
I can also show you around.

456
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,840
Okay. Let's go then.

457
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,200
Yep.

458
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,240
I got an umbrella.

459
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,800
I don't need it.

460
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,080
It's too hot. I'll hold it for you.

461
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,160
No. I can bask in the sun.

462
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,520
I don't get enough sun exposure.

463
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,800
Sunlight helps to produce vitamin D.

464
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm okay with it.

465
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,400
Well, Ran.

466
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,600
When I arrived,

467
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,960
I took a photo

468
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,760
with this sign

469
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,840
it turned out really well.

470
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,440
I'll take

471
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,520
some photos of you too,

472
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,400
so you can use them

473
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,080
for your videos.

474
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,840
Shouldn't we go get the ingredients?

475
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,040
It won't take long.

476
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:10,600
Okay.

477
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,760
Here, Ran.

478
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,040
Here?

479
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:15,680
Yes.

480
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,320
This is truly stunning.

481
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,320
The clouds feel close.

482
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,680
Ran, change your pose.

483
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,960
One photo is enough.

484
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,760
We can do it after we're back.

485
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,440
Hurry go.

486
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
Or we won't

487
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,800
have dinner.

488
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,400
Okay.

489
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,840
Do you want water? I brought some.

490
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,160
No, I've already had some.

491
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,320
Look.

492
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,120
You can keep it for yourself.

493
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,840
I don't see the romance.

494
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,800
Camera B,

495
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,760
pay attention to

496
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,720
Zhang Ran's reaction.

497
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,680
If it's not satisfactory,

498
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,920
quit the close-up of her face

499
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,280
and switch to filming

500
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,080
scenes where the two

501
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,880
might appear intimate.

502
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,200
What's following?

503
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,960
Did you give them the props?

504
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,600
Yes.

505
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,600
Thanks.

506
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,120
Are you hungry?

507
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:58,920
I...

508
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,520
They gave me

509
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,880
potato chips.

510
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,320
They say this is delicious.

511
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,360
It's for kids.

512
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,080
Do not litter.

513
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,360
It is not environmentally friendly.

514
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,760
I didn't know.

515
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,160
This is from the

516
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,640
film crew.

517
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,040
Is that your idea?

518
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,040
No.

519
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,400
Yours?

520
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,080
No.

521
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,160
No, don't

522
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,920
put your hand

523
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,480
there.

524
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:27,760
I'm okay.

525
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,320
You have great chemistry.

526
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
No wonder you carried her suitcase.

527
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,800
As the saying goes, a team of both

528
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,640
men and women is more...

529
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,280
Efficient!

530
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,440
Guangfa, take this.

531
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,560
Light it up

532
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,200
in a moment.

533
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,280
Is this a romance reality show?

534
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,040
Romance.

535
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
I'll just go ahead then.

536
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,080
Okay.

537
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,160
I'll try this.

538
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,160
I'll get some.

539
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
I'll serve you the soup.

540
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,720
I'll do it myself.

541
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,760
Let me do it for you.

542
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,000
Here.

543
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,880
The soup.

544
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,680
Who made the chicken wings?

545
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,360
Squash and egg soup.

546
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,800
I did.

547
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,880
It's pretty good.

548
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,240
You're too humble.

549
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,120
This is really tasty.

550
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,800
Haoran,

551
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,880
my assistant just told me

552
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,840
your movie crossed the billion-yuan mark

553
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,000
at the box office today.

554
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,040
I only had a cameo

555
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,720
in that movie.

556
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,960
It's also an honor.

557
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,480
Thanks.

558
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,320
Isn't being an influencer

559
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,920
exhausting too?

560
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,760
There is no rest time.

561
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,720
No, it's much

562
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,160
easier than commuting

563
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,760
to work.

564
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,040
She doesn't have to

565
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,760
commute or work

566
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,200
overtime at night.

567
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:16,880
She can

568
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,440
get up

569
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,240
whenever she wants.

570
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,320
This job isn't easy.

571
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,200
She has to write jokes.

572
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,920
Well, think back.

573
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,120
Didn't you need to practice

574
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,400
singing every morning?

575
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,000
Indeed.

576
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,600
What about her?

577
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,720
She doesn't have to get up

578
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,480
early to practice making memes.

579
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,720
But she has to make new faces

580
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,560
everyday.

581
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,640
Easier than going to work.

582
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,240
She uses simple facial

583
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,200
features to create

584
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,800
so many expressions.

585
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,720
But I...

586
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,360
Not that many.

587
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,760
One set can earn her

588
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,720
enough money, really.

589
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,960
I know a chubby kid

590
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,160
who's just like that.

591
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,600
Yeah.

592
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,200
It's not that easy, I tell you.

593
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,360
She has to write scripts

594
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,240
every day.

595
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,120
And the film crew...

596
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,200
Look at her boss there.

597
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,760
He's been recording

598
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,400
the whole dinner.

599
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,200
Who knows if he's playing

600
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,760
with his phone?

601
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,160
He doesn't even

602
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,120
have time to eat.

603
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,680
Not everyone is like you,

604
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,600
becoming famous

605
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,280
after just a few videos.

606
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,600
Zhang Ran, Ms. Wei hasn't seen

607
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,440
your expressions

608
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,400
of your memes in flesh.

609
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,280
Go ahead and show us.

610
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,600
Embarrassed?

611
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,880
Don't get me involved!

612
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,960
Fine. I want to see it.

613
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,480
Unbelievable.

614
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,120
Those are candid shots.

615
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,000
It won't work if I do it intentionally.

616
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,360
If that weren't the case,

617
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
everyone could be famous.

618
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,080
How reserved!

619
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,120
She's being reserved.

620
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,560
Yeah.

621
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,960
Don't be too hard on her.

622
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,830
I... I didn't.

623
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,510
How about my loofah soup?

624
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,400
Not bad, huh?

625
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,030
Loofah soup?

626
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,640
I'm taking another slurp.

627
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,720
Ran, I don't quite belong here

628
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,830
if not for you.

629
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,200
I... didn't put my foot in my mouth, did I?

630
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,640
I got it.

631
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,350
Don't worry.

632
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,830
Who made this?

633
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,880
You haven't touched much.

634
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,070
No, I have. I ate...

635
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,880
most of a bowl.

636
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,400
Have some more yourself.

637
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,750
I'm good, really.

638
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,310
I'm good.

639
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,030
Seriously, buddy.

640
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,550
Thanks for the food.

641
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,310
Thanks.

642
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,550
No small feat.

643
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,640
For sure.

644
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,750
No more, thanks.

645
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,550
Just take a bite.

646
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,480
No, I'm stuffed.

647
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,200
Maybe this instead?

648
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,000
This is my dish.

649
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,920
This is good.

650
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:55,880
Have some more.

651
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,480
You two finish those off.

652
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,880
Yeah, it's superb.

653
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,550
Anyone else?

654
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,200
Want some soup?

655
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,790
Let me get you.

656
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,680
Oh, I'm good.

657
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,160
Fantastic.

658
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,270
Well? How is it?

659
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,000
You bet.

660
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,350
I got it.

661
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,880
Ran, right?

662
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:06,880
Yeah.

663
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,880
You married?

664
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,400
I am.

665
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,920
How old are you?

666
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,240
I'm... thirty-six.

667
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:12,920
[Thirty-six.]

668
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,880
[Any kids?]

669
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,350
Don't put this part in.

670
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,640
[Gen-Y, huh?]

671
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,110
I prefer Gen-Ys.

672
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,200
At least grilling her with the right

673
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,680
questions.

674
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,070
I... I'll go powder my nose.

675
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,070
Why not go

676
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,640
this way?

677
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,830
It's a tight squeeze over there.

678
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,480
I'm fine.

679
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,070
Take care.

680
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,920
Spin the chopstick.

681
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Let's see who's on dish duty.

682
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,400
I'll do it.

683
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,830
I got it.

684
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,640
"Stop it, naughty."

685
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,680
Let's pause for a second.

686
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,960
We need to pick up some audio.

687
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,480
Thanks.

688
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:45,880
Hold on a moment.

689
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:47,790
Go.

690
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,790
Okay?

691
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,240
"Stop it, naughty."

692
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,440
Any chance to put more feeling into it?

693
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,310
But I never

694
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,590
said it in the first place.

695
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,920
Will the lip-sync work?

696
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,480
Don't worry about it.

697
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,030
We've got great shots already.

698
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,480
Need a bit more audio to

699
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,640
hype it up some more.

700
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,920
Haoran's done his part.

701
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,070
We'll just drop you in.

702
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,000
Isn't this supposed to be

703
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,510
a chill reality show,

704
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,550
instead of a dating show?

705
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,400
Why must we fake chemistry?

706
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,590
Zhang Ran.

707
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,790
This is a story point from the director.

708
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,510
Let's just play along.

709
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,160
Look how late it is.

710
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,160
Let's wrap this up quickly

711
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,550
for everyone's good.

712
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,000
Alright.

713
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:44,680
"N... naughty."

714
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,070
G... got it.

715
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,200
Good. Let's resume.

716
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
[About the show,]

717
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,310
[we're fully on board.]

718
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,350
Look, is there any chance

719
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,960
we can bump Ran's fee up a bit?

720
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,240
I'm afraid

721
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,680
she's already getting the top rate

722
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,830
in her category.

723
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,880
Really?

724
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,160
Definitely.

725
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,880
But have you considered

726
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,880
that precisely 'cause she rose

727
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,550
to fame as an influencer,

728
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,720
she can

729
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,270
pull off shots

730
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,440
that other performers

731
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,720
might shy away from?

732
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,160
That's the whole point

733
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,590
of having her, innit?

734
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,880
You mean she'll be

735
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,550
cooperative with anything?

736
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,680
Okay.

737
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:46,790
Alright.

738
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,070
I'll see what I can do

739
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,350
and keep you informed.

740
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,030
[Here, cheers.]

741
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,000
[Cheers.]

742
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,640
[Haoran.]

743
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,510
[You really]

744
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,240
[put in the work today.]

745
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,070
[Just doing my job.]

746
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,510
[Zhang Ran takes herself]

747
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,830
[way too seriously.]

748
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,680
[We agreed]

749
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
[upon this]

750
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,920
[CP marketing, didn't we?]

751
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:15,350
[Right.]

752
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,440
[Took all the trouble]

753
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,400
[dropping cues.]

754
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,200
[I... I said,]

755
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,240
["Hey, May I"]

756
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,160
["get that for you?"]

757
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,680
["Allow me."]

758
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,750
[She just]

759
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,750
[missed it all.]

760
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,720
[No idea what she's up to.]

761
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,920
[Let's be real.]

762
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,510
[I'm... not unattractive,]

763
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,270
[shipping-wise.]

764
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,790
[I probably have a bigger follower count.]

765
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,070
True...

766
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,680
Honestly...

767
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,270
Way bigger.

768
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,400
And she's acting all high and mighty?

769
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,750
[Look,]

770
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,240
[she has absolutely no clue]

771
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,240
[where her place is.]

772
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah,

773
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,750
clueless.

774
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,830
Plus, tonight...

775
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,070
I almost forgot.

776
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,350
She blurted out

777
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,960
she's married.

778
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:51,960
[Who'd fanserve]

779
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,750
[with a married woman?]

780
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:53,640
[That's...]

781
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,160
[Hey, calm down.]

782
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,200
[No idea what her deal is.]

783
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,440
[I mean, a married woman]

784
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,830
[pushing this "divorced, empowered" image.]

785
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,200
[That's classic]

786
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,240
[influencer thing.]

787
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,720
[So I assume she]

788
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,440
[knows]

789
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,160
[how it works.]

790
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,830
[It'll be fine.]

791
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,160
[Maybe]

792
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,590
[she doesn't want to play the card]

793
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,880
[right out of the gate.]

794
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,510
[I'll talk to her manager]

795
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,000
[to ensure]

796
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,590
[we're on the same page.]

797
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,200
[Just stick to the]

798
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,920
[script for now.]

799
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
[Worst case scenario,]

800
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,960
[if she doesn't play along,]

801
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,640
[we'll still do it our way.]

802
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,000
[This show is]

803
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,070
[supposed to be the]

804
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,350
[opening salvo for]

805
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,030
[our startup.]

806
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,680
[Stay patient.]

807
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,510
[I'm not an idiot.]

808
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,590
[It's fancy here.]

809
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,790
[If not for work,]

810
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,350
[it's actually a]

811
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,350
[nice place to chill.]

812
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,550
[Go easy on the drinks.]

813
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,680
[You don't wanna over-hydrate.]

814
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,110
[I'm more of a]

815
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,270
[drinker now.]

816
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,350
[You are?]

817
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,310
[I can handle]

818
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,960
[twice]

819
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,510
[as much as last time.]

820
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,790
Taking a break, gentlemen?

821
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,160
You scared me.

822
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,790
Mr. Lin, come have a seat.

823
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,030
Here.

824
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,510
Please.

825
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,350
Over there.

826
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,480
So...

827
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,750
Mr. Lin, I know we've spoken

828
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,550
many a time,

829
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,350
but I feel impelled to have another

830
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,720
quick word.

831
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,920
Fire away, Director.

832
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,440
Actually,

833
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,310
I'll give

834
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,350
the floor to Haoran.

835
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,160
You see...

836
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,070
I assume you noticed

837
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,830
Ran's reactions today, right?

838
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,880
Let's just say

839
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,030
she's utterly

840
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,240
off-script.

841
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,680
If she keeps this up,

842
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,110
I can't seem to play my part.

843
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,790
And the entire CP promo

844
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,550
is impossible.

845
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,400
I might as well

846
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,880
play the "pathetic admirer".

847
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,590
I mean, what else?

848
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,510
Right?

849
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,960
Allow me to suggest otherwise.

850
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,110
The script is perfect, no doubt.

851
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,720
I have lectured

852
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,350
Zhang Ran just now.

853
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,160
She should

854
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,310
know her place.

855
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,350
What did I just say?

856
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,550
You gave her a lesson?

857
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,440
Nah.

858
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,680
None of the kind.

859
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,270
We were

860
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,310
just chatting away.

861
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,590
Brought it up in passing.

862
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:15,960
Yes.

863
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,480
Rest assured, Director.

864
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,880
Zhang Ran should feel grateful

865
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,920
she gets to co-star with you.

866
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,270
Nah. It's mutual.

867
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,400
Sorry for the trouble.

868
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,790
All for the show.

869
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,510
You're right.

870
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,590
Ran's got a packed schedule lately.

871
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,110
Currently on

872
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,790
"Life in the Slow Lane".

873
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,680
[That rings a bell.]

874
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,200
[Is Mr. Bao in?]

875
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,000
Ms. Wei, as well.

876
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,640
Mr. Jin, too.

877
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,550
[Speaking of,]

878
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,110
[can you get Ms. Wei's]

879
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,070
[autograph for me?]

880
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,070
[I'm her biggest fan.]

881
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,510
Till next episode.

882
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,830
First,

883
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,720
about the ad.

884
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Ran's getting a bit

885
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,000
burned out lately.

886
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,790
I'll ask her if

887
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,880
she's up to it first.

888
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,880
Ran, I can totally picture

889
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,920
you shining like a diamond.

890
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,720
Ran.

891
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
Keep up! You can do this!

892
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,110
You're just one step away

893
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,240
from the finish line.

894
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,030
Morning, Ran.

895
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,270
Making fire?

896
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,160
Let me do it.

897
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,270
No. Just...

898
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:10,720
Allow me...

899
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
Stay away from me!

900
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,640
What is it? Are you mad at me?

901
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,030
Didn't we agree on

902
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,070
open conversation

903
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,920
if I ever

904
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,720
made a mistake?

905
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,000
Take your mic off.

906
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,720
A word.

907
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,030
I... don't think so.

908
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,550
We can't do that on set.

909
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,680
They're still filming.

910
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,720
So you don't mind them knowing

911
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,720
how you badmouthed me?

912
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
I thought people your age

913
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,270
know better than eavesdrop.

914
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,200
What's wrong with my age?

915
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,310
Plus, define "eavesdropping".

916
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,030
If anything,

917
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,160
at least find a proper "eave"!

918
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,350
Oh, you're clever, aren't you?

919
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,880
What did I do to

920
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,400
deserve

921
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,030
all this dirt?

922
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,680
Oh, so you think

923
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,590
I'm enjoying it?

924
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,200
That was in the JD.

925
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,200
Wake up, idiot!

926
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,000
Dude, you're dreadfully hollow.

927
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,270
Where did that gentleman go?

928
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:55,920
Eh?

929
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
Once mic off

930
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,110
mask off!

931
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,110
Listen up: from now on,

932
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,750
with or without camera,

933
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,480
don't talk to me.

934
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,790
Alright? Deal?

935
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,000
I wish I didn't have to.

936
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,270
But

937
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,480
go ask your boss.

938
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,160
What do you mean?

939
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,590
Go figure.

940
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,030
Acting

941
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,240
all innocent.

942
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,400
I'm not acting!

943
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,000
What a baby.

944
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,240
Who's leaving again?

945
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,720
Bro Erge?

946
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,070
What else have you got to report?

947
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,440
Your homemade recipe?

948
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,960
I am your boss,

949
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,030
not your lawyer!

950
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,000
Stop crying.

951
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,240
Okay, cut it.

952
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,680
I know

953
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,270
you've been under much pressure.

954
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,920
Without Qian Dan around,

955
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,000
you're rudderless.

956
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,000
Just listen up first.

957
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,960
Zhang Ran,

958
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,240
come here.

959
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,160
I'll talk to you later.

960
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:06,790
Mr. Lin.

961
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,350
Director wants you

962
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,200
and Wang Haoran

963
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,920
to make breakfast

964
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,270
after you woke up.

965
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,640
No idea how.

966
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,590
Have a seat first.

967
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,680
I'm fine this way.

968
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,160
How come you suddenly

969
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,400
forget how to cook?

970
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,440
Do you have an idea how many would

971
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,510
kill to dine with Wang Haoran?

972
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,750
Count your blessings.

973
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,720
Are you saying that

974
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,830
he's too good to be

975
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,550
shipped along with me.

976
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,350
Correct?

977
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,960
That's not what I mean.

978
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,000
I'm saying you're our top talent.

979
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,750
Mr. Lin, is this really necessary?

980
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,030
We're under a lot of pressure right now.

981
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,200
Even Bro Erge has left.

982
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,920
Look...

983
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,510
I don't like him.

984
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,510
And he clearly doesn't like me.

985
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,070
Now you want us to fake chemistry,

986
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,640
so we both

987
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,200
have to

988
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,960
scare up fondness

989
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,880
out of nowhere.

990
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,070
The audience can

991
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,960
spot that from a mile away.

992
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,670
Phony. I can't do it.

993
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,760
Isn't everyone phony these days?

994
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,760
Haven't you ever lied to your parents?

995
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,190
Your husband?

996
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,670
Your friends?

997
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,960
If you can keep up the act,

998
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,070
that's your skill.

999
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,480
Who cares what's real or fake?

1000
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,760
[Zhang Ran.]

1001
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,360
[Deep down, you know,]

1002
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,230
[the only "real" things]

1003
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,550
[are the ones that you can]

1004
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,360
[hold onto.]

1005
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,630
[Everything else is just smoke and mirrors.]

1006
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,590
[Yudong.]

1007
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,320
[No pajamas of the kind you mentioned.]

1008
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,800
But this one fits me perfectly.

1009
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:57,800
Gift it to me.

1010
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,480
Are you nuts? Take it off!

1011
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,000
That's for Zhang Ran's live streams.

1012
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,760
Take it off now!

1013
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,030
Don't ruin it.

1014
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,710
This is hers?

1015
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:08,920
Kinda oversize.

1016
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,190
Two-zero, Yudong!

1017
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,480
Why didn't you tell me?

1018
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,360
Alright.

1019
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,150
Dope.

1020
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,510
When did they score?

1021
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,550
If the score stays till

1022
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,440
the second half,

1023
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,590
I win 400 yuan.

1024
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,550
Wasn't it 120?

1025
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:25,880
400.

1026
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,760
Alright. This robe...

1027
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,440
I have to have it.

1028
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,150
This is my lucky charm.

1029
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,000
Call Zhang Ran.

1030
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,190
Ask her if I can have it.

1031
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,630
You want it, you call.

1032
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,400
Where's your phone?

1033
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,400
My phone's dead.

1034
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,110
Hurry up.

1035
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,070
I said, it's dead.

1036
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,110
Fine, I'll do it.

1037
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,510
Don't you dare.

1038
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,320
It's late. Don't bother her.

1039
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,110
Use mine.

1040
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,150
Chop-chop.

1041
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,800
I can't press the

1042
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,550
buttons in this!

1043
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,190
Figure it out.

1044
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,000
Asshole.

1045
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,320
You're getting on my nerves.

1046
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,030
Got an idea.

1047
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,190
[Hello? Li Daoqi?]

1048
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:07,960
Hello.

1049
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,590
Zhang Ran, is that you?

1050
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:12,760
[You two still up?]

1051
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,510
We're watching the game.

1052
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,190
I have four pieces of good news for you.

1053
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,550
[That many?]

1054
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,630
First one.

1055
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:23,800
Just now,

1056
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,110
I...

1057
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,760
won a sports bet!

1058
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,280
First half just ended. 400 yuan!

1059
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,360
I never win bets on the first half.

1060
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,230
But right here, right now,

1061
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,320
I won 400!

1062
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,230
Second:

1063
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,920
Yudong just won 60 yuan

1064
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,110
on a scratch-off!

1065
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,400
After we

1066
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,000
spent 300 on 'em.

1067
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,840
But still,

1068
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,190
record-breaking.

1069
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,670
You see,

1070
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,190
when underdogs like us

1071
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,230
got our table turned,

1072
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,800
it means your place

1073
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,840
is blessed.

1074
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,360
And you're absolutely the lucky star.

1075
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,230
I mean it.

1076
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,320
Yudong must've saved the

1077
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,840
universe

1078
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,190
to end up being with you.

1079
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,480
He's lucky to have you.

1080
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,150
Really.

1081
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,150
[If you guys win when I'm not home,]

1082
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,000
[then I shouldn't be back at all,]

1083
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,360
[should I?]

1084
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,440
Third.

1085
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,880
It suddenly

1086
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,670
occurred to me

1087
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,590
that the root cause

1088
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,840
of your problems

1089
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,190
is... me.

1090
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,670
Actually...

1091
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,320
I've been meaning

1092
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,920
to apologize.

1093
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,360
Zhang Ran.

1094
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,280
You know...

1095
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,710
How do I put this?

1096
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,920
Starting the company, and the...

1097
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,880
live streaming stuff...

1098
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,760
Yudong wasn't really on board.

1099
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,480
I'm the one

1100
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,070
who dragged him into it.

1101
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,480
He's loyal to a fault.

1102
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,360
Probably had a hard time saying no.

1103
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,960
I knew that, but...

1104
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,760
maybe I was just selfish.

1105
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,510
So sometimes when you two

1106
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,960
had issues over this,

1107
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,320
I do feel guilty.

1108
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,670
I'm sorry, Zhang Ran.

1109
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:18,920
I owe you an apology.

1110
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,590
[Li Daoqi.]

1111
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,760
[What's between Yudong and me]

1112
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,360
[isn't anyone else's fault.]

1113
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,880
[It's about the two us.]

1114
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,880
[You don't have to say sorry.]

1115
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,510
[Even if it wasn't you,]

1116
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,400
[there's always gonna]

1117
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,280
[be some other friend]

1118
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,000
[that would come to him]

1119
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,840
[and he'd do it all the same.]

1120
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,110
[At this point in his life,]

1121
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,670
[he's supposed to be doing it.]

1122
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,320
[He also wanna do this himself.]

1123
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,590
[So it's not your problem.]

1124
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,800
[Just like me.]

1125
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,550
[At this point in my life,]

1126
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,710
[these are my choices, too.]

1127
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,800
[There's no right or wrong here.]

1128
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,150
[Fu Yudong's right.]

1129
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,000
[And so am I.]

1130
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,230
[Let's just let things be.]

1131
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,440
[What else can we do?]

1132
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,110
[We've already come this far.]

1133
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,630
You know what?

1134
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,110
It's...

1135
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,920
Back when Yudong was in Canada,

1136
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,150
he called me and...

1137
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,880
I don't know

1138
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,880
where he's calling from,

1139
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,360
he said he saw you

1140
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,510
carrying a bunch of

1141
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,400
shopping bags.

1142
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,760
He said at that moment, he felt...

1143
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,960
that you deserve

1144
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,070
a better life.

1145
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,760
He said...

1146
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,280
he wants to

1147
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,280
help you in

1148
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,230
being the happiest person on earth.

1149
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,670
I think when he makes decisions,

1150
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,670
like you said,

1151
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,590
maybe half of it

1152
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,590
is for himself.

1153
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,670
But the other half?

1154
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,280
It might be him

1155
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,960
trying to make it happen for you, too.

1156
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,190
[Li Daoqi.]

1157
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,760
[I have never...]

1158
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,670
[I have never, ever doubted]

1159
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,480
[Fu Yudong's love.]

1160
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,230
[But honestly...]

1161
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,030
[I don't know]

1162
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,150
[how we got here.]

1163
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,880
[Trust me, I wonder why.]

1164
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,070
[But I'm at a loss.]

1165
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,670
[Sometimes...]

1166
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,630
[Never mind.]

1167
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,760
Say it.

1168
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,590
[I'm in the dark, too.]

1169
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,000
Name is power.

1170
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,630
Just say it.

1171
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,510
[You guys enjoy the game.]

1172
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,320
[It's fine. I can handle it.]

1173
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,230
[I just need some time.]

1174
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,150
Sometimes, you just shouldn't overthink.

1175
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:28,960
Really.

1176
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,110
I find

1177
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,400
it strange, too.

1178
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,280
People get together

1179
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,320
so that they can be closer

1180
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,280
to each other.

1181
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,920
But when they do,

1182
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,440
they somehow drift apart.

1183
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,480
But here's something to watch out for.

1184
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,280
Don't drift too far.

1185
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,280
Or, it's hard to come back.

1186
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:45,880
You...

1187
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,960
[I used to think]

1188
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,590
[it's okay if one of us]

1189
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,880
[walks slightly faster.]

1190
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,480
[The faster one]

1191
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,760
[could just wait for the slower one.]

1192
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,280
[The slower one]

1193
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,670
[could just try to catch up.]

1194
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,070
[You'd just help each other along]

1195
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,110
[and keep moving forward.]

1196
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,070
[But in reality,]

1197
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,800
[it's really hard to do that.]

1198
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,510
[Because you can't even tell]

1199
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,400
[who's ahead and who's behind.]

1200
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,630
[It's... weird.]

1201
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,030
I've got a plan.

1202
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,630
There is a way out.

1203
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,630
[Have some rest.]

1204
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,400
Anyway, maybe you can

1205
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,070
both take a step back.

1206
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,070
Yudong told me

1207
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,630
you're doing a reality show.

1208
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,510
I think even the 'realest' show

1209
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,400
is still fake.

1210
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,150
Sincerity,

1211
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,550
more often than not,

1212
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,030
is right beside you.

1213
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,590
[Isn't there any fakeness in real life?]

1214
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,230
[Even the fakest reality show]

1215
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,440
[has moments of truth.]

1216
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,760
[What's real, what's fake...]

1217
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,150
[Who can really tell, right?]

1218
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:54,590
I agree with you.

1219
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,360
Good point.

1220
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,360
[I'm dozing off at your voice.]

1221
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,440
[Just go to sleep.]

1222
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,190
And the fourth thing.

1223
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:01,670
[Tell me.]

1224
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,400
The most important thing.

1225
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,550
I found this amazing "turtle robe"

1226
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,480
at your place.

1227
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,800
It fits me perfectly.

1228
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,920
Can I have it?

1229
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,800
I heard it's yours.

1230
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,960
[The green one?]

1231
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,030
[Oversize one?]

1232
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,590
That's the one.

1233
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,550
[No way, Li Daoqi.]

1234
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,360
[It's borrowed. I have to return it.]

1235
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,230
[Just... don't]

1236
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,480
[get anything on it,]

1237
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,960
[and put it back where you found it!]

1238
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,000
[I'm hanging up.]

1239
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,510
[Get some rest. Bye.]

1240
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:29,510
Bye.

1241
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,190
You two...

1242
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,480
This is complicated.
