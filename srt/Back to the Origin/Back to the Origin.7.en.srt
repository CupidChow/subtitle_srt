1
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,720
This back of yours

2
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,720
just won't quit.

3
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,039
You'd better be careful,

4
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,759
you're not 20 anymore!

5
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,840
It's just age catching up.

6
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,840
Quit talking like that.

7
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,160
Your subordinates'

8
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,920
gonna think

9
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,520
they can walk all over you.

10
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,000
Right there in the lower back,

11
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,920
yeah, that's it!

12
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,880
Better now?

13
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,080
Stop being a couch potato.

14
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,480
Get some exercise.

15
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,760
All done?

16
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,079
Ain't enough for you?

17
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,520
Hey, I've noticed

18
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,040
something off about Xinying.

19
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,240
What's up?

20
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,600
She keeps

21
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,640
cutting my calls

22
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,840
short.

23
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,480
I think she might

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,360
have a boyfriend?

25
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,920
She's at that age,

26
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
dating, marriage,

27
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,440
it's all par for the course.

28
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,520
You don't get it. It's wild out overseas.

29
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,960
I'm fine if she's

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,640
dating for marriage,

31
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,040
but what if she's fooling around...

32
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,680
Whoa, whoa,

33
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,360
cut her some slack, will you?

34
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,800
I just need to keep her in line.

35
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,840
Xinying,

36
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,880
Mom's been thinking...

37
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,360
Why'd you quit?

38
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,440
Talking to her makes me

39
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,560
nervous now.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,520
You know,

41
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,000
one wrong move

42
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,280
and she'll flip out.

43
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,040
You lucked out

44
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,960
missing

45
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,079
her teen years abroad, nightmare!

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,840
How do I even start the conversation?

47
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,560
Don't start it.

48
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,680
So carefree...

49
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,760
The patch's kicking in!

50
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,920
Li Nian's showing good progress

51
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,760
in his cognition, movement,

52
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,600
and hormone levels

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,720
these past

54
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,560
three months.

55
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
But he's still behind

56
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,960
other kids at his age

57
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,320
intellectually.

58
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,920
About your husband's

59
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,079
question on

60
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,840
kindergarten,

61
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,160
looking at his progress,

62
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,200
you might wanna give it a shot.

63
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,480
Think I'll hold off.

64
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,000
He came early

65
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,560
and needs more time.

66
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,800
Maybe when he's bigger.

67
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,840
Makes sense.

68
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,200
You've been through the wringer

69
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,280
since day one.

70
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,280
It's tough.

71
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,079
You can

72
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,399
check the report on your phone.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,680
Let me know

74
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,360
if anything's not clear.

75
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,920
My eyes are acting up,

76
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,200
maybe from

77
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,840
all the screen time.

78
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,120
Thought I might need glasses.

79
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,200
Give these a shot.

80
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,440
Wow, what a difference!

81
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,720
Not nearsighted,

82
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,880
you're getting old eyes.

83
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,080
Nearsightedness

84
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,240
is for the kids.

85
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,280
Our age?

86
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,200
It's reading glasses and glaucoma territory.

87
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,159
My eyes are aging?

88
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,120
How old are you?

89
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,480
45.

90
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,960
Totally normal.

91
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,080
Most women your age

92
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,520
are hitting menopause.

93
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,120
How's your monthly cycle?

94
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,800
266,

95
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,360
274,

96
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,080
275,

97
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,320
269,

98
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,920
270...

99
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,040
Mom,

100
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,840
what are they doing?

101
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,480
Drive carefully, Daoqi.

102
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,280
Take it easy.

103
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,280
I'll...I'll stay put.

104
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,600
OK, get some rest.

105
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,960
Spray away!

106
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,400
Had a few drinks and

107
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,760
scared she'll catch you?

108
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,320
No,

109
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,760
my checkup showed

110
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,760
a fatty liver,

111
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,920
so Cheng Man's gone into

112
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,320
full health-police mode.

113
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,080
Yeah, right.

114
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,360
You're wrapped around her finger.

115
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,280
Not wrapped,

116
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,640
just showing respect for women.

117
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,840
That's your excellent parenting

118
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
showing through, Mom.

119
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,280
-Such a sweet talker. -Gotta go!

120
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,040
Wait up!

121
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,680
What now?

122
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,480
Here.

123
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,640
Why dump the leftovers on me?

124
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,800
Not leftovers!

125
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,920
I cooked

126
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,640
your favorites

127
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,880
specially for you.

128
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,840
Braised pork!

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,720
Put it in the fridge.

130
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,240
What gives?

131
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,120
No can do!

132
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,159
If she catches me

133
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,520
with braised pork, I'll be braised.

134
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,440
Put it in the fridge.

135
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,400
I'll sneak back for it later.

136
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,000
Peace out!

137
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,280
Halt!

138
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,200
Trying to crush me?

139
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,040
Sure, she's right

140
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,880
about your health,

141
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,640
but we

142
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,400
need to talk.

143
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,440
When's Nian

144
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,520
getting into kindergarten?

145
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,200
Can't keep him home forever!

146
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,000
Huh? Sorry, wasn't listening.

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,040
What was that?

148
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,480
You little punk!

149
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Forget it, Mom. I got this!

150
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:56,920
Later!

151
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,760
Playing stupid again.

152
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,600
There goes my cooking.

153
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,880
All set?

154
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,560
Yep, go for it.

155
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,480
OK,

156
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,000
keep an eye on the shot.

157
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,040
Hey everyone!

158
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,440
Zhang Ran here,

159
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,000
your city explorer.

160
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,080
Check out

161
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,760
this beauty behind me,

162
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,800
the Lucheng Bridge,

163
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,760
our city's crown jewel.

164
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,320
It's way more than just

165
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,560
steel and concrete,

166
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,400
it's packed with

167
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,800
memories

168
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,240
for all of us locals.

169
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,600
Back in the day,

170
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,880
I'd zip across

171
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,480
on my bike.

172
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,080
Now here I am

173
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,760
getting older by the minute.

174
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
But this beauty?

175
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,480
Still looking as fresh as ever,

176
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,200
spanning this river.

177
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,880
So, if...

178
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,120
you all...

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,240
Let's take it from the top.

180
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,760
One, two, three,

181
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,960
action!

182
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,400
Hey everyone!

183
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,120
I'm your city explorer,

184
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,680
Zhang Ran.

185
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,440
Check out this bridge

186
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,120
behind me,

187
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,160
the Lucheng Bridge,

188
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,400
it's our whole...

189
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,040
I swear I'm gonna kick you!

190
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,080
This bridge behind me,

191
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,040
the Lucheng Bridge,

192
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,520
is the pride of

193
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,800
our city...

194
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,840
Dad...

195
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,800
Dad!

196
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,320
What are you doing up?

197
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,040
Bathroom run.

198
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,840
What's cooking?

199
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,880
Gimme, gimme that.

200
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,720
Hot, hot!

201
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,320
Let me...

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,640
Go...

203
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,280
Man, so good!

204
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,680
Had liver surgery,

205
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,280
not doing great.

206
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,320
Last checkup was rough.

207
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,720
My wife's banned me from meat.

208
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,960
This stays between us,

209
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,120
OK?

210
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,720
Dad,

211
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,880
gotta watch your health.

212
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,480
C'mon,

213
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,360
what's life worth

214
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
if everything's

215
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,280
off-limits?

216
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,720
Where's the fun in that?

217
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,880
We've got good genes,

218
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,120
My grandpa made it to 98,

219
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,400
was actually

220
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,080
bored of living!

221
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,320
His secret

222
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,200
of longevity?

223
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,920
Did what he wanted,

224
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,520
ate what he wanted.

225
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,080
Hold back and

226
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,000
that's when you get sick.

227
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,720
Am I right or am I right?

228
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,880
Yeah, kinda...

229
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,600
They say

230
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,400
your cravings tell you

231
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,240
what your body needs.

232
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,120
Now you're talking!

233
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,840
Kid,

234
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,400
you're stuck like me,

235
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,680
wives running our lives

236
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,880
with all these rules.

237
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,920
Poor thing...

238
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,640
I'm OK...hey, stop!

239
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,880
Last two pieces.

240
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,280
Lemme get a nice fatty piece.

241
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,160
Dying for some fat.

242
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,000
Just one! One piece!

243
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,240
Keep that wrap intact,

244
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,360
gotta cover it up again.

245
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
I'll restore it precisely.

246
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,440
Yeah.

247
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,640
Zhang Ran isn't that controlling.

248
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,600
Not controlling?

249
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,320
Her presence is enough, right?

250
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,680
Wanna know

251
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,600
what she was crazy about as a kid?

252
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,240
Tigers.

253
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,960
You two

254
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,480
are indeed

255
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,040
a perfect match!

256
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,440
I mean,

257
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,640
all the other little girls

258
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,600
were into dolls,

259
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,000
toy cars,

260
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,560
flowers, whatever.

261
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,080
She was fixated on tigers.

262
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,680
Big tigers, baby tigers.

263
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,480
Even got a tiger head

264
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,760
on her pencil box!

265
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,960
Tigers are awesome,

266
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,840
strong and fierce.

267
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,400
Yep, she's

268
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,040
her mom's daughter in that respect!

269
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,240
Having a bossy lady

270
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,640
ain't so bad.

271
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,280
Think about everything she's been through,

272
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,120
you know some of the stuff.

273
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,440
If she'd been

274
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,400
some pushover,

275
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,480
imagine how she'd have gotten burned.

276
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,840
We'd never

277
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,440
stop worrying!

278
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,640
Yummy!

279
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,800
Look, kid,

280
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,160
here's what I've learned

281
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
at my age,

282
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,880
A wife who keeps you in check is a gift!

283
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,720
If a guy

284
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,680
wants real freedom,

285
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,640
he's gotta let someone else

286
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,880
handle the tough stuff,

287
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,760
let her do the worrying.

288
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,960
That's my guide to life

289
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,640
right there!

290
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,240
That's the gospel truth!

291
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,360
Here, try the lean piece.

292
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,280
I'm stuffed, really.

293
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,160
Down the hatch then.

294
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,760
Help yourself.

295
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,560
What kind of fix is this?

296
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,920
Water's going everywhere!

297
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,720
I stuck some waterproof tape

298
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,680
on it...

299
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,520
Tape? Really?

300
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,760
Since when does

301
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,720
anyone fix pipes with only tape?

302
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,920
Well, so what

303
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,880
if it's leaking now?

304
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,680
Maybe it'll stop on its own!

305
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,440
And Zhang Ran, asked for

306
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,640
her help this morning,

307
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,440
but she bolted without even looking.

308
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,920
And you, with this mess.

309
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,560
Both of you,

310
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,800
completely useless!

311
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,560
Dad...

312
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,120
Mom...

313
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,480
Mom, next time

314
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,080
this happens,

315
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,200
don't use the sink right away.

316
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,240
Let the pipes

317
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,360
drain first,

318
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,280
otherwise

319
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,440
the leak will

320
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,600
wreck the cabinets.

321
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,600
Also, use some

322
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,320
mild acidic drain cleaner

323
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,000
now and then,

324
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,080
keeps the pipes

325
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,720
lasting longer.

326
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,520
This stuff here, right?

327
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,160
Yeah, that's it!

328
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,600
OK,

329
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,160
lemme grab my phone

330
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,120
and record you

331
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,800
saying all that again.

332
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,280
Don't bother, I'm around.

333
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,160
Just let me know

334
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,120
if it acts up again.

335
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,160
Was I yelling

336
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,000
too loud in the morning?

337
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,240
Did I wake you?

338
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,640
Nah,

339
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,120
just jet lag.

340
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Keep dozing off

341
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,480
and waking up.

342
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,240
Phew, this trash reeks,

343
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,800
gotta get it out!

344
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,640
Sure, I'll dump it now!

345
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,560
Not you,

346
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,680
I mean your dad.

347
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,480
Zhang Jianbin!

348
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,120
Take this trash out!

349
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,600
Zhang Jianbin!

350
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,280
It's fine, I'll handle it.

351
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,360
Not in the bathroom?

352
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,720
Where'd he sneak off to?

353
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,360
Wait, don't!

354
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,200
You'll get your hands all gross.

355
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,320
Just let me tie it up.

356
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:51,880
It stinks so bad!

357
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,680
Let me, let me!

358
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,480
I've got this.

359
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,000
I'll toss it out.

360
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,600
Your dad, work appears, he disappears!

361
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,360
I can do that...

362
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,200
Watch out

363
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,000
for the metal bits,

364
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,400
don't get cut.

365
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,760
I deal with this stuff all the time.

366
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,800
Fine.

367
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,320
Cool.

368
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,600
I'll put it on

369
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,360
the balcony.

370
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:13,880
Gimme.

371
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,320
I'll dump the trash!

372
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
Just gonna change quick.

373
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,680
Better wash your hands too.

374
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,360
On it.

375
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,720
Hang in there, pal.

376
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,120
Dad!

377
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,040
Mom's been looking for you.

378
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,040
What are you doing here?

379
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,080
Uncle Li's in a fix.

380
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,720
Jianbin,

381
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,360
couldn't get a wink last night.

382
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,040
Got this busted socket.

383
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,960
Repair guy says

384
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,000
they gotta tear up

385
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,040
the wall.

386
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,960
Just finished renovating the place,

387
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,160
this'll mess up

388
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,280
everything!

389
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:53,840
Right...

390
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,000
Got him not to smash the wall,

391
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,200
but man,

392
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,160
his mouth never stopped.

393
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,520
Drove me nuts!

394
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,400
So did he fix it or what?

395
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,760
Here's the thing, nope!

396
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,440
Couldn't even take a shower last night.

397
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah.

398
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,240
That's nothing,

399
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,040
but it could kill you

400
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,000
if it shorts out!

401
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,960
What now?

402
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,120
Uncle Li, lemme give it a shot.

403
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,600
Might be able to sort it out.

404
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,680
Just old wiring

405
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,200
with some loose connections.

406
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,040
Lucky,

407
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,440
they used flex wire before.

408
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,880
I can still make it work.

409
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,920
If it had

410
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,400
burned any more,

411
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,640
you'd be in real trouble,

412
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,920
would've had to tear the wall apart

413
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,840
and redo everything.

414
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,560
I found a wobbly terminal

415
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
too, and

416
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,600
tightened it up.

417
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,040
Should keep going for a while.

418
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,640
Kid, you're a genius!

419
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,040
Fixed it

420
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,480
just like that!

421
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,240
That's my PhD boy!

422
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,280
This little

423
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:50,960
circuit box?

424
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,560
Nothing to him!

425
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,040
Gonna give that guy a one-star review.

426
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,160
Where'd you find that guy anyway?

427
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,680
Total scammer!

428
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,560
My daughter

429
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,240
found him online,

430
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,400
a platform

431
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,680
called "ProFix."

432
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,920
Says it's

433
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,880
the hottest thing now,

434
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,320
users everywhere!

435
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,640
Hey, kid, beats sitting around

436
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,240
at home,

437
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,600
you should do this!

438
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,680
Dad...

439
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,560
Sit, sit,

440
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,440
just saying,

441
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,520
Uncle Li's got

442
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,800
a good heart,

443
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,560
just doesn't think before he talks.

444
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,000
Guy could turn a compliment

445
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,520
into an insult.

446
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,080
I mean, seriously,

447
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,200
suggesting a foreign PhD like you

448
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,480
should be

449
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,120
a handyman?

450
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,640
Talk about wasting talents!

451
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,120
Don't sweat it, Dad.

452
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,680
I'm just killing time anyway,

453
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,320
feels good to help fix

454
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,240
people's problems.

455
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:04,920
No way!

456
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,640
A PhD's a PhD!

457
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,560
Better unemployed than undignified!

458
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,240
Ms. Qian, we're still good

459
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,400
with what we agreed on, right?

460
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,680
I can pick

461
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,320
my own direction?

462
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,440
Yeah,

463
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,360
but I really think

464
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,880
you should go with our strategy,

465
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,440
the whole

466
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,720
"Desperate Personal Shopper" character.

467
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,680
I want to try

468
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,120
my own ideas.

469
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,920
I mean,

470
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,960
I worked in TV,

471
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,200
[I know the whole deal,]

472
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,520
[from picking topics to production.]

473
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,160
[Maybe learn what being]

474
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,360
[a streamer's about.]

475
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,200
[You've been overseas]

476
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,960
[for ages.]

477
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,680
[Things work pretty differently]

478
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,600
[here now.]

479
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,440
Hey!

480
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,600
Check this out.

481
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,200
What's up?

482
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,800
Is this funny to you?

483
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,600
Is it?

484
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,240
I just don't get

485
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,600
why this stuff blows up.

486
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,400
Why?

487
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,840
It's that big?

488
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,720
Huge.

489
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,080
Hey, it's a crazy world.

490
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,040
Gotta make room for

491
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,520
all kinds of stuff.

492
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,280
There's gotta be something to it.

493
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,800
Don't think it's funny either, huh?

494
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,200
Don't get it at all.

495
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,040
How's this trash

496
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,080
going viral?

497
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,880
Should I try making these?

498
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,200
No joke!

499
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,120
Gotta think it through.

500
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,640
Hey, why'd he close

501
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,000
my window of dream?

502
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,520
That fake cutesy voice!

503
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,120
So over-the-top,

504
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,680
Even worse than the last one.

505
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,280
The one you liked

506
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,560
has 3,000 followers.

507
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,720
This one's got a million.

508
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,040
Never said I liked her.

509
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,440
Just thought she was normal,

510
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,320
better than

511
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,040
this squeaky,

512
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,360
fake voice thing.

513
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,840
What's her deal anyway...

514
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
[Hi everyone,]

515
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,960
[Yuan Yuan here from]

516
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,800
["Today's Financial Interview."]

517
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,400
[Last time, we heard]

518
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
[business leaders'...]

519
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,320
Yuan Yuan, huh...

520
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,640
Who's this?

521
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
What's she yapping about?

522
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,000
Your voice is far superior.

523
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,520
Everything's so different now.

524
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,480
Back in our day,

525
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,720
you needed real skills

526
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,960
to keep viewers

527
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,920
watching.

528
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,400
Now...

529
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,080
I'm totally lost about

530
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,840
what audience like.

531
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,200
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

532
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,800
When I went back to the company,

533
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,400
the manager told me

534
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,520
I have to post three videos a week.

535
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,960
Once the fanbase

536
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,200
stabilizes,

537
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,280
I can switch to one a week.

538
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,680
And after I hit 50 thousand followers

539
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,480
can I get brand deals.

540
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,080
I thought coming back

541
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,600
I'd be back on track right away.

542
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,400
I didn't expect this many steps.

543
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,520
It's just a one-year contract.

544
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,760
Why are there so many conditions?

545
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,200
Well, the company's investing in me.

546
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,040
They're allowed

547
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
to set some terms, right?

548
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,560
I know

549
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,200
you really value this chance,

550
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,280
but don't run yourself

551
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,240
into the ground.

552
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,320
Don't carry that much pressure.

553
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Worst case,

554
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,240
after a year we go back to Canada.

555
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,560
I know.

556
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,120
I'll give it a real shot.

557
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,000
If it doesn't work, we'll talk then.

558
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,440
Like I always say:

559
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,280
"Nothing is hard, if you just quit."

560
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,280
If it doesn't work out, we just drop it.

561
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,520
You've got me.

562
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,480
Listen to you, so tough.

563
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,680
I should throw you out.

564
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,840
I'm serious.

565
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,400
You don't believe me?

566
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,720
Phone on charge. Sleep.

567
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,320
With me here, what are you afraid of?

568
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,200
Lights out.

569
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,280
This pillow is way too flat.

570
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,440
I'll buy another one for you.

571
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,000
Get you one as tall as a pyramid.

572
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,680
Since we came back,

573
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,200
we still haven't gone to see your dad.

574
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,520
We should visit your dad

575
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,640
and Li Daoqi's mom soon

576
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,880
to bring them the cod-liver oil.

577
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,520
I already went.

578
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,200
Something this big

579
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,280
and you went by yourself, without...

580
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,760
It's not a big deal.

581
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,840
There's not that much

582
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,960
for me to say to them.

583
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,280
I stayed 10 minutes

584
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:37,880
and left.

585
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,320
You've got enough on your plate.

586
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,840
Don't worry about this.

587
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,360
Sleep.

588
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,800
One, two, three.

589
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,680
Does it have to be three years?

590
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,880
Of course.

591
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,480
That's the timeline

592
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,840
we need to recover costs and

593
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,320
develop the account.

594
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,280
Don't worry,

595
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,240
you won't find

596
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,880
another company in this business

597
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,360
with terms

598
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,560
as kind as ours.

599
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,400
And after three years,

600
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:21,960
we can sit back down

601
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,200
and adjust

602
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,520
your revenue split

603
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,680
and percentages based on

604
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,760
how things are going.

605
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,920
Nobody's getting shortchanged.

606
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,520
Can't I just sign for one year?

607
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,480
For a total newbie,

608
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,800
standard contracts

609
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,040
start at three years.

610
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,680
No company

611
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,240
would invest that much effort

612
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,160
in a short-term deal.

613
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,240
[Boss,]

614
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,640
[mom's getting]

615
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,400
[really persistent]

616
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,640
[about Nian's kindergarten.]

617
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,000
[I can't keep this up much longer.]

618
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,840
So first,

619
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,760
you need

620
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,080
to follow this

621
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,760
official account.

622
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,640
Once you follow it,

623
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,600
we'll do

624
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,640
a quick real-name verification.

625
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,680
You need that

626
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,480
before you can

627
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,360
buy tickets.

628
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:10,720
Could I

629
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,880
see your ID, please?

630
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,160
We'll just get you verified.

631
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,600
Sir?

632
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:15,960
Sir,

633
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,920
your ID,

634
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,280
please?

635
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,560
[It's just scanning a code, isn't it?]

636
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,120
[What's taking so long?]

637
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,200
[How can scanning a code be this slow?]

638
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,920
You don't need all these cards.

639
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,520
Here, let me help you.

640
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,760
We follow

641
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,680
the account first.

642
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,400
Then we

643
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,720
do a quick face scan.

644
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,560
Just look at the screen.

645
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,760
[Grandma, I don't want to eat this.]

646
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,400
[Being picky is bad for you.]

647
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,360
You'll never grow tall.

648
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,480
When your parents come back

649
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,800
and see you short and skinny,

650
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,520
they'll blame me.

651
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,000
When are my mom and dad

652
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,600
coming back?

653
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,800
How should I know?

654
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,800
["Have kids to guard your old age",]

655
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,640
[all nonsense.]

656
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,080
[You can't count on any of them.]

657
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,840
[I saw it with my own two eyes.]

658
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,320
[This old lady's eyes are just fine.]

659
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,880
[I was wondering]

660
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,760
[why my pigeons stopped eating.]

661
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,880
[Turns out your cat scared them.]

662
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,840
[You really]

663
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,000
[don't mean well.]

664
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,080
[My blue cat]

665
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,200
[is here to catch mice.]

666
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,480
[It has nothing]

667
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,520
[to do with your pigeons.]

668
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,360
[I'm telling you,]

669
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,960
[you're the one who doesn't mean well.]

670
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,920
[All these years]

671
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,080
[your pigeons have been]

672
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,040
[crapping everywhere.]

673
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,880
[Everyone in the alley's sick of it.]

674
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,720
[Do you know what it means]

675
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,320
when a pigeon poops on your clothes?

676
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,760
That's "luck from the sky".

677
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,280
I...

678
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,560
That's my pigeons

679
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,080
sending money to your house.

680
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,480
You don't know

681
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,640
how to be grateful.

682
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,640
Sooner or later, karma's coming for you.

683
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,240
I'm getting karma?

684
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,560
You're the one who'll get karma.

685
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,400
[How many years have you been here?]

686
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,560
[Has anyone come to see you?]

687
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,760
[You're an old lady all by yourself.]

688
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,680
[Who visits you, huh?]

689
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,280
[You...]

690
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
I'm an old lady alone?

691
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,400
You're insulting me.

692
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,320
I'm not insulting you.

693
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:48,880
Go on.

694
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:49,920
You'll regret this.

695
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,480
What are you doing?

696
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,560
Go on, insult me.

697
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,560
If you dare touch my pigeons...

698
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,760
Let's just talk, okay?

699
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,960
You called me an old woman all alone.

700
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,000
How am I alone, exactly?

701
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I really will tear all this down today,

702
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,800
I'm telling you.

703
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,400
What?

704
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,440
You wouldn't dare!

705
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,560
And who are you?

706
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,880
He's my grandson.

707
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,880
So what if he is?

708
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,080
Shoo.

709
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
What are you doing?

710
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,480
This dog of yours isn't worth anything.

711
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,440
And it's picky as hell.

712
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,800
Your parents spoiled it rotten.

713
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,520
Miss me?

714
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,360
Good.

715
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,960
If it were worth money,

716
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,880
they'd just treat it as an asset.

717
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,760
What do you eat?

718
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,640
What does he eat?

719
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,080
He won't eat this brand.

720
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,480
This is the cheapest one.

721
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,400
Having food is already good enough.

722
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,600
If he won't eat, he can go hungry.

723
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,760
Hey, come on, seriously?

724
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,800
Has the money arrived yet?

725
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,199
I went to the bank this morning,

726
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,480
nothing in the account yet.

727
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,360
Which room am I in?

728
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,000
You?

729
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,679
Same room as before.

730
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,600
The one you grew up in.

731
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:23,920
The quilt's probably a bit damp

732
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,280
after all this time.

733
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,800
Remember to take it up to the roof

734
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,400
and let it dry when the weather's nice.

735
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,400
I tried calling the house,

736
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,040
couldn't get through.

737
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,440
Bad signal.

738
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,080
Oh, please. It's a landline.

739
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,159
Is the phone broken?

740
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,239
No, I bought it only five years ago,

741
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,280
it's practically new.

742
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,199
I'm going out to get pigeon feed.

743
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,800
The phone line's not plugged in right.

744
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,800
What am I supposed to eat?

745
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,040
Cook for yourself.

746
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,640
Happy.

747
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,160
Come here.

748
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,080
Come here.

749
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,200
You're heavy.

750
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:45,800
[Hello?]

751
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,600
Hello?

752
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,200
[Kaiyang? Finally.]

753
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:49,880
Second Uncle.

754
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,600
[You came back]

755
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,720
[and didn't even tell me]

756
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,320
[so I could pick you up at the airport.]

757
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,280
[Where are you staying?]

758
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,240
At Grandma's.

759
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,640
[Good.]

760
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,760
[Since]

761
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,160
[you're back,]

762
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,080
[we elders should]

763
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,640
[throw you a welcome meal tomorrow.]

764
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,120
I'm meeting a lawyer tomorrow.

765
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,240
[Seeing a lawyer]

766
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,080
[doesn't take all day.]

767
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,240
[Let's do lunch tomorrow.]

768
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,080
[I'll call Third Uncle]

769
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,200
[and your aunt,]

770
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,200
[we'll all get together]

771
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,480
[and welcome you home properly.]

772
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,520
Got it.

773
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,960
[We'll go to the one and only]

774
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,160
[Michelin restaurant in Lucheng City.]

775
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,280
[I'll send you the address later.]

776
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,320
[Oh, and just come by yourself.]

777
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,360
In Canada,

778
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,400
if the two of us sat down like this

779
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,360
for a bowl of malatang like today,

780
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,240
guess how much it would cost.

781
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,440
How much?

782
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,920
60 Canadian dollars.

783
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,680
Over 300 RMB.

784
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,880
For malatang!

785
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,800
Daylight robbery, right?

786
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,200
That bad?

787
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,520
Yeah, China's still the best.

788
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,280
Of course.

789
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,800
So now that you're back,

790
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,240
what about the apartment

791
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,120
your parents bought you in Canada?

792
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,720
Just going to leave it empty?

793
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,480
I rented it out.

794
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,600
Rented it out?

795
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,240
Can't just let it sit there.

796
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:00,960
I rented it to a classmate

797
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,480
who's still in Canada,

798
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,880
so at least we're not losing money.

799
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,640
My ticket home this time

800
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,320
was basically paid for with the rent.

801
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,720
Smart, huh?

802
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,960
Not bad.

803
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,800
You're the clever one,

804
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,520
business mind and all.

805
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,680
But I can't touch

806
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,760
any of that rent.

807
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,120
I'm keeping it all for my parents.

808
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,720
I just borrowed a tiny bit.

809
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,200
I don't need to hear

810
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,800
any more of your humble bragging.

811
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,120
Don't get all sarcastic on me.

812
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,920
How am I being sarcastic?

813
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,560
A place here and a place overseas

814
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,640
and you're still not satisfied?

815
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,040
What about

816
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,440
all that money you lost

817
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,640
on that fake guarantor thing?

818
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,520
What are you going to do about that?

819
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,800
You're not just

820
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,720
writing it off, are you?

821
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,400
Don't get me started.

822
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,680
I'm pretty sure those guarantor fees

823
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,480
are gone.

824
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,720
But I think

825
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,760
I might get the lawyer fees

826
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,400
back.

827
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,280
If I really push.

828
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
After I came back,

829
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,960
I found

830
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,040
that Canadian lawyer

831
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,040
who scammed me

832
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,720
on a website.

833
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,000
Let me show you

834
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,200
his picture.

835
00:37:59,200 --> 00:37:59,840
This guy.

836
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,920
Doesn't his face

837
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,000
just scream scammer?

838
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,280
I found his firm,

839
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,840
some place called

840
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,240
Qizheng Law Firm.

841
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,360
I've decided

842
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,720
I'm going to stake out his office.

843
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,200
He conned me, I'll con him right back.

844
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,360
I'll pretend to be a new client,

845
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,880
make up a fake name,

846
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,440
go in and discuss a case

847
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,320
and lure him out.

848
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,720
I will get

849
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,480
that money back.

850
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,720
You've really changed.

851
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,520
You're nothing

852
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,480
like you were before.

853
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,720
Cheers to that.

854
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,560
But I

855
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,920
really am curious,

856
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,240
are you seriously

857
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
not going to tell your parents?

858
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,320
Once I find that lawyer

859
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,400
and prove I was scammed,

860
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,320
then I might still get back to Canada.

861
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,480
I need to fix the mess I made first.

862
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,440
I'll have something to say to them.

863
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,120
I'm here to see him.

864
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,320
What about him?

865
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,200
I want to hire him.

866
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,880
Mr. Kuang?

867
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,040
Yes, he's one

868
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,920
of our firm's lawyers.

869
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,600
But he's usually abroad,

870
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,280
not in Lucheng City.

871
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,760
And he's currently on vacation.

872
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,160
If you'd like,

873
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:58,960
I can recommend

874
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,040
a few other

875
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,880
excellent lawyers.

876
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,840
How does that sound?

877
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,160
No, no.

878
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,080
I only trust this Mr. Kuang.

879
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,640
A friend recommended him,

880
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,640
said he's amazing.

881
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,240
I...

882
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,240
Could you

883
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,600
book a slot for me with him?

884
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,520
Of course.

885
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,080
Let me take down your details first.

886
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,480
How should I address you?

887
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,800
My surname is Chen.

888
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,560
Chen,

889
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,640
okay.

890
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,200
Well,

891
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
Ms. Chen.

892
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,080
I should remind you,

893
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,840
Mr. Kuang charges

894
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,240
by the hour for consultations.

895
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,200
Fine.

896
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,320
So when's the earliest

897
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,920
you could get me in?

898
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
Let me check.

899
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:35,960
Okay.

900
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,360
Sorry,

901
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,800
you can't look at this file.

902
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,360
Let me see...

903
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,360
The soonest slot

904
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,880
with Mr. Kuang is

905
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,280
three months from now.

906
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,440
Will that work?

907
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,920
That's no good.

908
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,680
My case is really urgent.

909
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,200
Can't you squeeze me in?

910
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,640
I really can't.

911
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,160
I have to schedule strictly

912
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,640
according to the lawyers' calendars.

913
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,800
So when he's on vacation,

914
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,360
he never comes into the office, right?

915
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,000
Oh, he does.

916
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,520
He's vacationing next door.

917
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,520
In that room.

918
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,040
We bought tons of sand for him,

919
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,120
set up a big TV

920
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,520
that plays looping beach videos

921
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,320
with waves

922
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,760
and seagulls.

923
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,960
Of course not.

924
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,760
Who goes into work on holidays, right?

925
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,600
I'm kidding.

926
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,400
You're pretty funny.

927
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,120
We don't get many people here,

928
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,360
so I just chat with you for fun.

929
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,000
Anything else I can help you with?

930
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,080
Yeah,

931
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,160
could you...

932
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,200
could you find me

933
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,160
one of Mr. Kuang's

934
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,840
business cards?

935
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,440
Sure,

936
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,320
there should be some.

937
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,400
I'll take a look.

938
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,120
Thanks.

939
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,080
Not many people

940
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,960
still use business cards these days.

941
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,080
Ah, here we go.

942
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,360
Have a look.

943
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,160
Thank you.

944
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,000
The number on there

945
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,520
is actually this front desk phone.

946
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,000
It'll still be me picking up.

947
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,280
Got it.

948
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,560
Okay,

949
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,960
if I need anything I'll call you.

950
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,520
Great. Call me if you want to chat.

951
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,400
Wait,

952
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,800
I still need to log your phone number.

953
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,800
We didn't finish

954
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,480
the intake process.

955
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,160
No need.

956
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,960
Go enjoy the beach.

957
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,000
It's just

958
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,120
our standard procedure here.

959
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,640
I'll leave your name out.

960
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,120
She's here to chat with me.

961
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,000
Hello.

962
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,840
Who are you looking for?

963
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,840
Mr. Luo.

964
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,120
He's in a meeting.

965
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,480
Why don't you wait in the lounge

966
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,240
for a bit?

967
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,280
I'll take you.

968
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,880
Okay.

969
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,240
Would you like something to drink?

970
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,040
I'm good.

971
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,240
Water, tea, coffee?

972
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:55,960
Thank you.

973
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,400
Mr. Luo,

974
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,680
your client is already in the lounge.

975
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,160
Sorry,

976
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,640
sorry to keep you waiting.

977
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,920
I had a pretrial this morning,

978
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,400
so it ran a little long.

979
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:28,960
Sit.

980
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,040
I'll keep it brief.

981
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,000
Your parents have now decided

982
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,920
to have me represent

983
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,840
both of them.

984
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,520
The case

985
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,760
is still in the investigation stage,

986
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,400
and I've already applied for bail.

987
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,160
The total is seven million.

988
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,280
Your family probably

989
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,200
can't put that together right now.

990
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,560
But it's fine.

991
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,440
Even if you could, there's no need.

992
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,000
We'll need that money for other things.

993
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,960
How many years will they get?

994
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,720
Sorry?

995
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,600
How long are they looking at?

996
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,600
Based on similar cases,

997
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,800
we're talking roughly 10

998
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,720
to 20 years.

999
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,960
But your parents' case

1000
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,320
is actually quite straightforward.

1001
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,640
The charge is illegal fundraising.

1002
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,880
With illegal fundraising,

1003
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,840
that brings in the issue of returning

1004
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,280
the money and compensating the victims.

1005
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,440
Our strategy is to at least wait

1006
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,240
until the case is with the prosecutor.

1007
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,120
In this period,

1008
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:12,880
you may get calls asking you

1009
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,160
to return money or pay compensation.

1010
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
You don't need to take those calls.

1011
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,240
For now,

1012
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,600
your main job is

1013
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,680
to contact relatives and friends

1014
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,480
and see how much you can raise.

1015
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,160
Oh, and your family still has

1016
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,680
some debts that haven't been collected.

1017
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,800
Go after those.

1018
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,600
They'll get a lighter sentence that way.

1019
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,480
Any other questions?

1020
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,400
If not, I'll leave you here for now.

1021
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,680
Do you know my parents personally?

1022
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,800
No.

1023
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:36,880
Look,

1024
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:37,800
I'm well aware

1025
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,240
your parents are important clients

1026
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,600
of our firm,

1027
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,520
but you may not know

1028
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,360
all the details.

1029
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,040
How about this:

1030
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,800
let me explain

1031
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,840
while we're here.

1032
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,640
The fee you paid earlier only

1033
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,960
covers the investigation stage.

1034
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,120
If you want

1035
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,320
to continue with me after that,

1036
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,680
we're talking about

1037
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,840
an additional six-figure fee.

1038
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,000
So...

1039
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,520
I know.

1040
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,920
You mentioned it on the phone.

1041
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,000
Once the transfer goes through,

1042
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,880
I'll pay.

1043
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,640
No problem.

1044
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,160
One more thing:

1045
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,640
if that transfer

1046
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,880
has any link

1047
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,760
to Zhirong Garment Group,

1048
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,200
the money may be clawed back later.

1049
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,600
It's my own money.

1050
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,480
All right then.

1051
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,560
Right.

1052
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,360
I'll get back to work.

1053
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,240
Call me anytime.

1054
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,400
[Your online meeting has been booked.]

1055
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:30,880
[Okay.]

1056
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,440
[Well,]

1057
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,440
[does he need to register?]

1058
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,080
[Yes, register him.]

1059
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,680
[And we bill him by the hour too?]

1060
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,120
[Of course.]
