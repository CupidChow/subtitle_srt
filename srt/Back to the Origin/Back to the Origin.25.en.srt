1
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,000
Can't you see I need help?

2
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:53,960
Coming.

3
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,960
Don't you pretend not to see.

4
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,880
Unbelievable.

5
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,440
[Someone asked]

6
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,640
[how to face]

7
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,360
[one's life.]

8
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,880
[Your home has]

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,240
[already given you the answers.]

10
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,720
[The roof says]

11
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,160
[to look up and forward.]

12
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,560
[The air conditioner says to keep cool.]

13
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,600
[The clock says to treasure every moment.]

14
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,200
[And guess who utters]

15
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
[the wisest words of all?]

16
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,600
[It's the toilet.]

17
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,640
[It says,]

18
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,480
[you need to let it go.]

19
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,760
[Did you get that?]

20
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,000
That makes perfect sense.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,320
Keep cool

22
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,840
and let it go.

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,320
This is golden words.

24
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,480
Well,

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,720
I wish Ailing had seen

26
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,720
this video sooner.

27
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,680
Speaking of Ailing,

28
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,000
I haven't heard from her

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,079
since she left this morning.

30
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,040
I need to give her a call. Hold it.

31
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,720
Where's my phone?

32
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,960
You can use mine.

33
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,040
Where should I put this to dry?

34
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,280
Is that even

35
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,520
a question?

36
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,600
Outside.

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,120
[Dear guests]

38
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,240
[and parents,]

39
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,800
[good afternoon.]

Ma'am.

You need to

Register her.

59
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,920
Mrs. Zhou?

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,400
What brings you here?

61
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,480
May I help you?

62
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,400
Today's seminar focuses on studying in the UK.

63
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,840
I'll help you

64
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,640
find a seat.

65
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,880
Or would you like to share on stage?

66
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,480
That'd be great!

67
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,040
Then please go up and share

68
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,560
your story.

69
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,200
Excuse me.

70

Hold on a second.

71
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,360
Dear parents.

72
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,040
We are honored to have

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,440

her success story.

77
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,560
Welcome!

78
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,560
Mrs. Zhou.

79
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,480
Welcome!

80
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
Should I share?

81
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,959
Yes.

82
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,120
Your success story.

83
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,840
The word "parent" is simple,

84
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,280
but the responsibilities

85
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,880
it entails

86
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,280
are anything but.

87
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,240
We need to play different roles

88
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,920
in our children's lives.

89
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,840
We are

90
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,520
their guiding light in their lives.

91
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,640
You need to

92
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,440
strengthen

93
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,760
your willpower.

94
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,840
Clutch this ice cube

95
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,520
tightly in your palm.

96
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,360
Tell yourself you're not afraid of the cold.

97
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,520
You're not afraid of the cold.

98
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,440
The horizons we set as parents

99
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,240
determine

100
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,000
our children's starting point

101
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,520
and anchor their life's journey.

102
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,440
I knew it.

103
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,040
You've never stuck with

104
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,280
anything since you were a kid.

105
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,880
Learning piano

106
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,120
is the best example.

107
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,480
Back then, so many people didn't even

108
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,080
make 20,000 yuan a year, but I still

109
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,520
spent 20,000 yuan to buy you a piano.

110
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,000
Your father and I gave

111
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,200
everything we had for you.

112
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
I sold the apartment in Canada,

113
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,800
because

114
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,080
I want you and Dad

115
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,360
to have your own life.

116
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,080
You don't

117
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,600
have to keep

118
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,720
sacrificing for me.

119
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,520
You've sold

120
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,159
our apartment

121
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,600
in Canada?

122
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,880
Second,

123
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,680
we should be

124
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,240
their safety net.

125
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,640
My daughter studied in Canada

126
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,880
for six years,

127
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,640
and I accompanied her for six years.

128
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,920
Because I want to tell her,

129
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,680
her mother is

130
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,240
where her home lies.

131
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,280
What's going on?

132
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,080
It's okay.

133
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,960
We're going back.

134
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,080
Third,

135
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,880
we must become

136
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,640
their friends.

137
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,160
My daughter and I have no secrets.

138
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,520
You keep hiding everything

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,240
from your own mother

140
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,360
over and over again.

141
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,880
Do you still think of me as your mother?

142
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,440
I'm also very happy that

143
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,680
she's so thoughtful

144
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,800
and appreciative of my efforts.

145
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,560
Did I do wrong in arranging

146
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,800
your life with all my heart?

147
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,159
Mom, I've spent twenty years

148
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,120
of my life obeying

149
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,720
your arrangements.

150
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,240
I have never

151
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,640
accused you.

152
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,400
I followed

153
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,159
your every instruction.

154
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,600
You're not the only one

155
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,080
who's given everything,

156
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,800
okay?

157
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,640
But you've seen

158
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,280
the outcome now.

159
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,200
We're both unhappy, right?

160
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,520
I want to live my own life.

161
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,000
What life?

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,240
The life I love.

163
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,760
I also wanted to have my own life.

164
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,560
You were my whole life.

165
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,800
But you tell me

166
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,440
that I have failed.

167
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,200
My story to share?

168
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,680
My story of failure?

169
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,560
Mrs. Zhou, what are you doing?

170
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,800
Mrs. Zhou!

171
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,400
My success

172
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,120
is an illusion!

173
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,840
What are you doing?

174
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,320
You!

175
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,120
Do you really believe...

176
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,159
Mrs. Zhou!

177
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,120
...what you say on stage?

178
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,600
Have you asked your children

179
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,640
what they want?

180
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,440
what their dreams are?

181
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,240
Pause the seminar.

182
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,840
Did you ask them what their dreams are?

183
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,640
Dismissed!

184
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,200
What's your problem?

185
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,680
No.

186
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,360
Stop daydreaming.

187
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,520
[It's not true.]

188
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,120
[No.]

189
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,960
[Don't listen to her.]

190
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
[Don't listen to her.]

191
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,840
[What's your problem?]

192
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,200
How useless!

193
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,760
This is my final warning!

194
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,720
Shame on you!

195
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,120
This is my final warning!

196
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,840
Please leave.

197
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,840
No, it's not like that.

198
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
[Please have a seat.]

199
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,760
[Please have a seat.]

200
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,040
[Let me explain.]

201
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,800
[Mrs. Zhou may have]

202
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,120
[encountered some setbacks.]

203
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,880
[We can't help her with that.]

204
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,320
Keep an eye on her.

205
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,840
She can't do this again.

206
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,720
You're right.

207
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,560
I'm truly sorry

208
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,200
for the trouble.

209
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,760
Thank you.

210
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,000
You should be thankful

211
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,280
they won't sue you for damages.

212
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,360
Thank you so much.

213
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,520
I apologize for the trouble.

214
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,440
It's okay.

215
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,880
Well, then.

216
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,760
Thank you.

217
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,920
I'm really sorry.

218
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,560
Take care of her.

219
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,040
Alright, we'll be heading out now.

220
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,880
[Officer, you may contact me]

221
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
[for any follow-up]

222
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,000
[anytime.]

223
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,000
Jianbin.

224
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,200
Aiying.

225
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,680
I've picked her up.

226
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,920
She's with me now.

227
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,480
Don't worry.

228
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
She's doing okay.

229
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,720
Don't worry.

230
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,120
I'll take a break from work

231
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,920
to stay home with her.

232
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,840
Thanks, but we'd better not put you out.

233
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,480
And...

234
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,120
I... yes.

235
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,280
Okay. Don't worry, Aiying.

236
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,480
I'll hang up.

237
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,480
See you.

238
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,360
Where are you going

239
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,280
all by yourself?

240
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,320
Let's go home.

241
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,360
Is there still a home?

242
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,400
Everything is fine.

243
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,000
It's okay.

244
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,760
Where do you want to go?

245
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,720
I'll be there with you.

246
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,600
Okay?

247
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,120
Where's the car?

248
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,120
I took it in for repairs.

249
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,840
What can I do for you?

250
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,840
Cancel the household.

251
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,400
Is it your elder's?

252
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,800
Yes.

253
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,080
Do you want to keep her ID card?

254
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:20,840
Yes.

255
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,240
Then,

256
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,280
I'll cut a corner off

257
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,840
the card.

258
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,040
You keep the card

259
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,640
as a keepsake.

260
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,280
Okay. Thank you, officer.

261
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,520
Thank you.

262
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,560
Your dad

263
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,760
bought me

264
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,960
a new apartment.

265
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,400
Do you know why

266
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,000
I refused to live there?

267
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,480
Because of the pigeons?

268
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,320
It isn't entirely because of the pigeons.

269
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,080
The older I get,

270
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,920
the more

271
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,880
I realize

272
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,720
that one

273
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,920
cannot possess too much.

274
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,920
The more you have, the less at ease you feel.

275
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,040
The more you have, the heavier the burden.

276
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,640
Sometimes, it can

277
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,040
make you forget what's truly important.

278
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,040
The walls are covered with photos,

279
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,400
yet none show

280
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,720
clearly the faces of those dearest.

281
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
Life should be

282
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,800
less burdened,

283
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,000
freer

284
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,400
and simpler.

285
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,240
Look at these pigeons.

286
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,760
How carefree they are!

287
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,760
Animals are much easier

288
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,400
to communicate with than people.

289
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,359
[I've recorded your words. Maybe I can compile]

290
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,000
[a collection of]

291
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,920
[Huang Shufen's Quotations.]

292
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,680
[You little punk!]

293
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,280
Your grandma's hospitalized?

294
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,720
Is she feeling better?

295
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,000
She's an interesting old lady.

296
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,440
She raised

297
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,640
so many pigeons all by herself.

298
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,560
She even got a dog

299
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,760
a while back.

300
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,960
That's my dog.

301
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
I'll still keep the pigeons

302
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,600
and the dog.

303
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,240
I'll keep this place clean.

304
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,080
[Okay.]

305
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,240
[I'm just asking]

306
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,280
[on behalf of the neighbors.]

307
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,720
I've taken care of your funeral

308
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,000
and kept

309
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,160
your ID card.

310
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,960
I also fed the pigeons.

311
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,960
Only one thing left:

312
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,520
I need to tell my dad.

313
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,800
But I don't know how to tell him.

314
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,040
We've only met a few times.

315
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,760
Should I go?

316
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,280
Kaiyang, take off your cap, so I can see you

317
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,560
clearly.

318
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,200
Still remembered to come by?

319
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,880
You've got a heart after all.

320
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,680
Have you seen your mom?

321
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,680
How is she?

322
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,720
She's doing fine.

323
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,440
Don't look at me like that.

324
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,840
I'm your father.

325
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,240
I know

326
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
what you're thinking.

327
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,680
All these years,

328
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,840
I've single-handedly

329
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,840
kept this

330
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,080
entire business

331
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,120
and the family running.

332
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,840
But I went astray

333
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,240
and have been punished.

334
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,280
I accept

335
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,600
this outcome.

336
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Your two uncles

337
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,160
are

338
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,400
good-for-nothing losers.

339
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,800
Your aunt

340
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,400
is even worse.

341
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
She's a bully at home.

342
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,120
In the past,

343
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,640
whenever

344
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,120
they ran into trouble in their business,

345
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,520
they could only

346
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,760
count on me to fix it.

347
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,120
But now

348
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,200
they're on their own.

349
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,360
Tell them

350
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,560
to solve their

351
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,800
own problems.

352
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,680
And, remember,

353
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,080
if you get into trouble,

354
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,400
don't count on them.

355
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,680
They're too weak

356
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,160
to help you.

357
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,040
You should also visit your mom.

358
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,040
The prison we're transferring to

359
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,000
is very far away.

360
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,160
Besides you,

361
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,960
the one I worry about the most

362
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,680
is your grandma.

363
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,040
But I can't

364
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,840
look after her for now.

365
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,320
You've grown up.

366
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,840
Don't forget

367
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,840
you were raised by your grandma.

368
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,760
Grandma...

369
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,440
What?

370
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,120
She's gone.

371
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,360
What? Say that again?

372
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,080
What?

373
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,520
Grandma is gone.

374
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,640
I kept vigil for her.

375
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,800
I'm here just to tell you this.

376
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
[Walking out the door,]

377
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,480
[I bid farewell to my former self.]

378
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,760
[I once had so much]

379
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,240
[but didn't cherish it.]

380
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,680
[Now,]

381
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
[I have only myself.]

382
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,440
[Grandma was right.]

383
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,440
[Animals are easier to communicate with than people.]

384
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,520
This is Ruinuo Study Abroad Agency.

385
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,680
Tangtang's mom?

386
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,600
Yes. May I help you?

387
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,880
Well,

388
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,120
I have submitted

389
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,200
all the materials you gave me.

390
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,280
But the school needs

391
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,640
supplementary materials about

392
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,400
the student's special talents.

393
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,760
How about this?

394
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,280
You can stop by our office

395
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,920
so we can discuss this in detail.

396
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,600
Okay?

397
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,280
Alright. It's okay.

398
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,560
Sir, the car's fixed.

399
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,320
Come take a look.

400
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,760
If it's okay, please sign here.

401
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,480
Here.

402
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,880
Zhang.

403
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,400
You're back.

404
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,000
Where did you go?

405
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,560
Everywhere but

406
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,080
the Himalayas.

407
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,240
[Young folks know how to live it up.]

408
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,240
[It's not about young and old.]

409
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,720
[Help me check the circuit.]

410
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,120
I'm going to Mount Everest.

411
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,480
Stop dreaming.

412
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,920
Not before you finish the G318.

413
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,560
Don't burst my bubble.

414
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,640
Did I?

415
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,800
Quit halfway.

416
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,360
Zhang, right over there.

417
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,680
Is this the circuit board?

418
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,240
Yes.

419
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,880
Let me take a look.

420
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,120
Right. I told you something

421
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,600
wasn't taken off.

422
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,160
Put it on the table.

423
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,000
So, Mr. Lin,

424
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,360
your recommendation letter

425
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,760
is very good overall.

426
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,760
It's just that a few parts

427
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,360
sound a bit like Chinglish.

428
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,400
It reads like

429
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,240
it was machine-translated.

430
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,800
[What do you mean?]

431
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,800
[You mean my English isn't good enough?]

432
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,560
No. I just think

433
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,560
it's a bit unnatural.

434
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,560
[Unnatural?]

435
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,600
[I've written many recommendation letters.]

436
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,640
[First time an agent]

437
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,800
[dares to correct my English!]

438
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,200
[What they value]

439
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,600
[is the weight of]

440
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,080
[a professor's personal recommendation.]

441
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,120
[Do you understand?]

442
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,360
Mr. Lin, please don't misunderstand.

443
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,880
That's absolutely not what I meant.

444
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,480
It's just that

445
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,360
the admissions committee

446
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,480
for Qian's target school

447
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,920
is particular about grammar.

448
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
And I want to

449
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,000
get all my clients admitted.

450
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,240
I'm under pressure too.

451
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,120
[Stop!]

452
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,560
[I say a few words and you start crying?]

453
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,760
[I can't stand you young people]

454
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,920
[who go abroad funded]

455
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,640
[by your families]

456
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,760
[and think you're]

457
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,480
[so great.]

458
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,520
[Don't think just because your family]

459
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,360
[sent you abroad for a bit]

460
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,800
[you're actually something!]

461
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
[To put it bluntly,]

462
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,600
[people like you]

463
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,120
[are just leeching off your parents!]

464
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,840
[What right do you have]

465
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,120
[to question a professor's]

466
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,040
[writing style?]

467
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,080
[Since you're so confident,]

468
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,400
[find someone else]

469
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,840
[to write the recommendation letter!]

470
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,080
Xinying,

471
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,920
his attitude

472
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,720
was actually quite mild.

473
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,520
We've dealt with much worse.

474
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,800
We're used to it.

475
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,000
You'll get used to it too.

476
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,240
You can't even get a car by yourself.

477
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,960
On such a hot day,

478
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,320
you had to drag me along.

479
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,320
We're here.

480
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,880
Right here.

481
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:50,960
What?

482
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,800
I... I meant to

483
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,960
give you a surprise.

484
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,840
But I feel

485
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,800
I should apologize first.

486
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,200
I acted before telling you.

487
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,320
It's just...

488
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,360
What do you mean?

489
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,640
I sold our old car

490
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,360
and bought this one.

491
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,240
Are you crazy?

492
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,360
I thought we were picking up the car?

493
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,720
This is the car.

494
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,280
You're not joking, are you?

495
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,880
I'm not.

496
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,200
Fine.

497
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,440
From now on,

498
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,720
live however you want.

499
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,560
No, no.

500
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,280
Listen to me.

501
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,280
What are you doing?

502
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,040
Just listen...

503
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,320
Listen to me, alright?

504
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,760
Why bother?

505
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,880
I admire you Lus.

506
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,560
Always acting first.

507
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,720
What do you

508
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,560
even take me for?

509
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,040
No, Ailing. Just listen...

510
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,640
You never

511
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,800
discuss anything with me, do you?

512
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,600
No. Listen...

513
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,200
Hear me out.

514
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,120
You just want to make my life difficult.

515
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,400
No. Listen...

516
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,320
Just listen to me, alright?

517
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,160
What do you have to say?

518
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,640
I've been

519
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,600
reflecting a lot lately.

520
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,000
I think it's my fault.

521
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,040
It really is my fault.

522
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,840
I think I've made a mess

523
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,000
of planning our lives.

524
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,160
- You think?
- Right.

525
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,800
You think I can still believe

526
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
anything you say now?

527
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,160
You... You can believe me one more time.

528
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,160
Look,

529
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,520
haven't we always been

530
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,760
trying to live up

531
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,200
to what we think

532
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,760
other people

533
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,480
expect of us?

534
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,480
I haven't!

535
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,480
I have.

536
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,720
Back then they said

537
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,520
foreign companies were good.

538
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,320
So I got a job at a foreign company.

539
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:27,920
And they said

540
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,680
we should send kids abroad.

541
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,360
So we sent our daughter abroad.

542
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,240
For that,

543
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,840
I made you quit your job

544
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,280
to go accompany her.

545
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,440
It's like

546
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,600
we've become

547
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,680
the envy of others.

548
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,680
But only we know

549
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,480
if that's really

550
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,360
the life we wanted,

551
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,000
right?

552
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,240
And

553
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,800
these past few years...

554
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,920
I've been with you...

555
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,800
What...

556
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,640
What's wrong?

557
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,400
What is it? Tell me.

558
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,760
You are the most important person to me.

559
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,920
Now I don't even have time

560
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,640
to hold you in arms.

561
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,360
This... This isn't

562
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,880
the life I want.

563
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,280
When we were young, I promised

564
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,560
I'd take you traveling around the world.

565
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But

566
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,400
look at our passports.

567
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,120
Yours

568
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,320
only has a Canadian stamp.

569
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,920
Well,

570
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,160
we don't even have

571
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,560
shared travel memories.

572
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,800
I feel like such a failure.

573
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,400
I'm sorry.

574
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,880
What's gotten into you today?

575
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,200
I...

576
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,840
I've decided now.

577
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,920
From now on,

578
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,000
let's live for ourselves.

579
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,520
From now on,

580
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,400
no matter where we are,

581
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,600
as long as we're together, that's home.

582
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,600
So I went mad

583
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,840
and you're too?

584
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,640
No. You...

585
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,960
I'm not good with words.

586
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,360
And I'm not very good

587
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,200
at romantic things.

588
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,760
Starting today,

589
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,320
give me another chance

590
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,880
to pursue you, alright?

591
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,840
Alright my foot.

592
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,320
Let's be romantic for once.

593
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,520
Let's take a spontaneous trip.

594
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,720
Shall we go home?

595
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,880
You're out of your mind.

596
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,360
Come here.

597
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,080
Come here.

598
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,520
Can you even cook here?

599
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,360
Yes. You can even use the bathroom.

600
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,920
There's even a washing machine.

601
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,840
You're so full of ideas.

602
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,160
What do you think?

603
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,160
I'm fine.

604
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,200
Let him do it.

605
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:21,960
It's fine.

606
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,240
Put it there.

607
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,000
I'll get it.

608
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,040
Don't move.

609
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,720
Move aside.

610
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,600
Get it up.

611
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,640
Did you get everything?

612
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,360
All set.

613
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,760
Seven suitcases and eight bags.

614
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,920
Think about it. A whole life's worth

615
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,520
is just these dozen bags.

616
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,080
So what if you have more?

617
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,800
You can't take it with you when you die.

618
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,120
Having a few memories is good enough.

619
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,200
Anyway, I've figured it out.

620
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,960
For the rest of our lives,

621
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,840
we'll just do whatever

622
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,480
makes us happy.

623
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,040
Right.

624
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,920
That's the spirit.

625
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,840
Just enjoy yourselves.

626
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,520
If you get tired, come back here.

627
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,520
This will always be your home.

628
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,120
What are you looking at? Give me a hug.

629
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,640
Dear,

630
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,880
take care of yourself.

631
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,080
You too.

632
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,480
Come back when you're tired.

633
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,440
Let me know you're okay.

634
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,080
Sure.

635
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,400
Should I step away?

636
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,679
Step away if you want.

637
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,400
Let me lift you.

638
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,400
You're too weak to lift me.

639
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,199
I can't lift you.

640
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,880
That's about it.

641
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,679
Then let's start

642
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,719
with the recommendation letter.

643
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,719
Let me ask again.

644
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,280
About how much

645
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,159
does the whole process

646
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,480
you just talked about cost?

647
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,400
With living expenses and tuition,

648
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,600
it could easily be

649
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,400
over a million.

650
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,160
But if the child

651
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,280
does well

652
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,880
and gets a scholarship

653
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,160
over there,

654
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,360
it might not cost much.

655
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm not really

656
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,200
counting on scholarships.

657
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,400
As long as we can give her

658
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,440
the best resources

659
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,800
and conditions,

660
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,640
I'm willing to give everything I have.

661
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,160
I'll accept whatever it costs.

662
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,520
May I ask,

663
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,480
will you go with your child?

664
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,720
Of course.

665
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,600
I'm all set to quit my job.

666
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,600
Then the cost

667
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,680
might be about double

668
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,600
what I just mentioned.

669
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:39,880
Mom,

670
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,320
maybe we should just forget it?

671
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,920
That's not for you to worry about.

672
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,840
You just

673
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,320
focus on

674
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,640
studying hard.

675
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,680
[If it really comes to it,]

676
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,840
[I'll sell the house.]

677
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,200
[I'll support you]

678
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:55,960
[no matter what.]

679
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,680
I know you and Dad

680
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,360
put a lot of effort

681
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,160
into raising me.

682
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,800
You sent me abroad to study

683
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,360
and bought a house there.

684
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,560
I just hope

685
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,920
you and Dad can have your own lives.

686
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,560
And

687
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,800
don't...

688
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,000
You've always been sacrificing for me.

689
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,360
And even now...

690
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,320
You've already

691
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,960
sold our house

692
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,400
in Canada, haven't you?

693
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,440
You made

694
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,360
such a big decision

695
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,720
on your own?

696
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,360
Yes, I did.

697
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,960
Because I wanted you

698
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,920
to have a good living environment!

699
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,840
Stop living in other people's houses!

700
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,360
Mom!

701
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,440
Stop running around for me.

702
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,760
Stop being obsessed

703
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,120
with this whole Canada thing.

704
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,280
Let's all just take a breath.

705
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,280
Stop struggling

706
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,280
in that whirlpool!

707
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,760
Alright, Mom?

708
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,040
I feel sad.

709
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,000
And disappointed.

710
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,000
I'm not sad or disappointed because

711
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,920
you couldn't make it

712
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,280
in Canada.

713
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,720
Or because

714
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,040
you couldn't keep

715
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,840
that bank job.

716
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,160
It's just that

717
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,760
I've raised you for so long,

718
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,760
and you still

719
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,080
haven't learned

720
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,160
to face life

721
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,880
with optimism

722
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,000
and positivity.

723
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,480
I was a teacher.

724
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,840
I taught you countless times

725
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,080
how to take tests.

726
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,960
But life

727
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,440
isn't solving a problem.

728
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,440
There's...

729
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,360
There's no standard answer.

730
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,360
I feel

731
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,680
pretty useless.

732
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,040
Sometimes I think

733
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,480
it's a good thing I quit back then.

734
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,920
Otherwise,

735
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,720
I'd just be misleading the students.

736
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:01,880
Alright.

737
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,800
Now you say

738
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
you want independence

739
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,000
and freedom.

740
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,320
Then you need to

741
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,160
ask yourself clearly

742
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,280
if you're ready.

743
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,840
What is independence?

744
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,960
What is freedom?

745
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,920
It means from now on,

746
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,880
no matter what happens

747
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,160
in life,

748
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,440
you have to

749
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,160
face it alone.

750
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,120
I am

751
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,000
a first-time mom.

752
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,720
Every day

753
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,360
I'm figuring things out as I go.

754
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,440
I've felt a lot of helplessness

755
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,120
and confusion.

756
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,240
Actually, with all that's happened

757
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
at home lately,

758
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:53,960
I think

759
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,960
it's been good in a way.

760
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,200
It makes me feel like

761
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,200
these things

762
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,200
aren't such a big deal.

763
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,960
It helps me take things easy.

764
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,000
Sometimes

765
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,720
I secretly

766
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,840
observe your dad.

767
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,480
No matter how bitter he feels inside,

768
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,120
he's always cheerful.

769
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,040
Always forgiving.

770
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,120
He has a tender heart.

771
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,360
I think

772
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,360
I should reflect on myself

773
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,800
and make some changes.

774
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,400
I feel

775
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,200
quite guilty.

776
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,120
I kept saying I wanted to

777
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,760
earn money to support the family

778
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,080
and pay for your education.

779
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
But that's also a way

780
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,600
of shirking responsibility.

781
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,400
Whenever I faced

782
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,560
life's trivialities

783
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,160
or problems

784
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,520
I couldn't solve,

785
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,640
I thought

786
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,760
I should go to work.

787
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,200
Because

788
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,560
compared to those unsolvable problems,

789
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,520
work felt like a break.

790
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,800
Mainly,

791
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,920
besides work, I didn't know

792
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,280
what else I could do.

793
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,440
I wanted so much to take care

794
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,200
of every detail

795
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,480
of your life.

796
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,880
But

797
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,400
I missed

798
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,800
all your important moments.

799
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:39,880
Including

800
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,960
when you needed me most.

801
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,440
But fortunately,

802
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,840
you're not like me,

803
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,040
always going with the flow.

804
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:52,840
Xinying,

805
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,560
new paths are hard.

806
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,000
They'll be tough.

807
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,040
But

808
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,120
there will also be a lot of joy.

809
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,480
That's good.

810
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,920
Take it slow.

811
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,440
Dad.

812
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,080
[Xinying,]

813
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,520
[by the time you hear]

814
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,120
[this voice message,]

815
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,880
[your mom and I will have already set off.]

816
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,080
[You've grown up.]

817
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,480
[Our mission is complete.]

818
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,440
[We used to think]

819
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,200
[you were everything in our lives.]

820
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,960
[Now we realize]

821
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,680
[we can start fresh again.]

822
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,800
[Of course, the future]

823
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,320
[is still a mystery.]

824
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,760
- [It's okay.]
- [It's okay.]

825
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,360
- [We'll embrace whatever awaits ahead.]
- [We'll embrace whatever awaits ahead.]

826
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,800
- [Just like you.]
- [Just like you.]
