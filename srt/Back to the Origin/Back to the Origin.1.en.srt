1
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,200
[Hold it right there.]

2
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,800
[Camera 3, pull back a bit more.]

3
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,920
[Too far, too far.]

4
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
[Come a little closer.]

5
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,520
[On-site director,]

6
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,440
[Remind Zhang Ran to test the audio.]

7
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,120
Would you like something to drink?

8
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,280
No?

9
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,040
Audio test?

10
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,280
One, two, one, two, one, two.

11
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,320
Good day everyone,

12
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,040
I'm Zhang Ran.

13
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,120
Hello, hello.

14
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,199
OK, OK, good.

15
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,680
Quick touch-ups!

16
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,360
Life seems to

17
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,520
always have its own plans.

18
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,000
I thought I would be

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,920
an interpreter.

20
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,720
but now,

21
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,760
an anchor instead.

22
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,600
Which reminds me

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,480
of my favorite lines,

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,120
"life's like a box of chocolates,

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,360
you never know"

26
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,400
what you're gonna get."

27
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,920
"Financial Talk"

28
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,000
rolling in

29
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,920
five,

30
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,000
four,

31
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,240
three,

32
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,160
two,

33
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,680
one...

34
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,440
"Visible and invisible sights."

35
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,560
"Fleeting moments, endless nights."

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,600
"Watch the grass grow,"

37
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,000
"see the snow drift away. Oh yeah!"

38
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,480
All about nailing that

39
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:39,920
"Oh yeah."

40
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,120
Join in,

41
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,040
ready?

42
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,920
Not my thing.

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,520
Just one practice round,

44
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,280
please?

45
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,960
Really not my thing.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Just chime in

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,920
with "oh yeah"

48
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,400
on my cue.

49
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,320
Not happening.

50
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,000
Stay on beat.

51
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,520
C'mon.

52
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,560
Stop being so stubborn.

53
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,320
C'mon, play along.

54
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,160
"Visible and invisible sights."

55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,040
"Fleeting moments, endless nights."

56
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,600
"Watch the grass grow..."

57
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,440
I would like

58
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,480
to be compensated

59
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,200
based on your price match policy.

60
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,800
I bought this here

61
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,920
just three days ago.

62
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,320
Home Depot is now

63
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,400
10% cheaper.

64
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,040
Do you have anything to

65
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,920
prove this price difference?

66
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,680
Yeah, sure.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,560
OK.

68
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,880
Here.

69
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,880
Oh yeah, sure.

70
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,840
I'll fix this for you.

71
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,520
Thank you!

72
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,079
How'd it go?

73
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,240
Got it!

74
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:19,920
Awesome!

75
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,560
They tried the whole

76
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,960
"sold out in Toronto" line.

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,120
Please.

78
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,320
As if I were

79
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,800
some first-timer.

80
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,560
They don't know

81
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,079
I'm the OG bag hunter.

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
Trying to hide it

83
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,520
behind the door?

84
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,200
Amateur move,

85
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,360
spotted it right away!

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,160
This way.

87
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,720
Told them to

88
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,480
cut the act

89
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,400
and sell me the bag.

90
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,120
They tried

91
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,400
to dodge,

92
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,720
but look

93
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,000
who's got it now?

94
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,520
Sounds more like a conquest

95
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,320
than a purchase!

96
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,480
That's the name

97
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,000
of the game:

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,960
strategy and persistence!

99
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,440
But for your

100
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,600
shopping queen

101
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,560
here?

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,160
Just another day in the park for me!

103
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,520
Everything checked off?

104
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,120
Yeah!

105
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,400
Two hours in line,

106
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,120
my legs are screaming!

107
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,200
Tissue.

108
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,320
Get this, that Ping lady,

109
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,080
and the sales girl

110
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,120
go to the same church.

111
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,880
That's her secret

112
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,360
to scoring all the hot bags.

113
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,760
She's got the hookup!

114
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,120
Which Ping?

115
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,640
You know, Ping,

116
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,480
married that

117
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,880
old white prof from your school.

118
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,360
She's teaching East Asian Lit.

119
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,880
Had turkey at their place

120
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,320
last Thanksgiving?

121
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,839
Remember?

122
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,760
You fixed their heating?

123
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,800
Hello? Earth to you.

124
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,520
I'm listening.

125
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,560
Four hours till home.

126
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,640
Should we

127
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
stop for food?

128
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,040
This design's fire.

129
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,880
Never appreciated the print

130
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,800
when I was younger.

131
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,240
My first

132
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,880
TV station bag

133
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,720
had this print.

134
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,400
It was bigger.

135
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,520
Just keep it if you're into it.

136
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,360
Three K?

137
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,840
Are you nuts!

138
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,200
Our top priority is building up

139
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,840
our savings.

140
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,320
Fu Yudong,

141
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,720
stop telling me to

142
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,760
keep everything!

143
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,560
The luxury aroma!

144
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,320
Well done, Zhang Ran.

145
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,480
Nabbing the impossible.

146
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,280
You've still got it.

147
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,160
One more dish

148
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
and we're good to go!

149
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,880
My queen, dinner's up!

150
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,000
Alright!

151
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,440
Client's impossible.

152
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,120
Now whining

153
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,040
about taxes!

154
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,800
Like that's the real problem!

155
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,880
Should've said no upfront.

156
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,720
What now?

157
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,560
Flip it to someone else.

158
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,760
At these prices?

159
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,920
No chance.

160
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,880
Such a pain!

161
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,320
Better return it while I can.

162
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,360
It's gorgeous though.

163
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,520
Perfect for both style and practicality!

164
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,000
Why not

165
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,040
keep it?

166
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
That's insane. Too expensive.

167
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,320
I'll chip in.

168
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,280
Chip in?

169
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
That's half

170
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,040
your monthly salary gone.

171
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,480
Not happening!

172
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,600
It's not wasted

173
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,440
if you enjoy it.

174
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,320
It won't

175
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,400
put food on the table.

176
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,560
Plus,

177
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,400
these are a big deal back in China,

178
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,000
but here?

179
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,120
Nobody gives a damn.

180
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,240
I'm not that

181
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,440
TV anchor anymore.

182
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,720
Money's just a thing—

183
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,000
we'll make more, no big deal.

184
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,920
Look who's dropping rhymes.

185
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,520
Huh?

186
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
Never mind. Not happening.

187
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,160
We're

188
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,440
not broke.

189
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,040
Just keep it if you want

190
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,840
Gotta watch our spending.

191
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,120
Thought we were planning for a baby?

192
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,840
Honey.

193
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,720
Cheers to that!

194
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:37,960
Spot anything different

195
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,080
about dinner?

196
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,320
Extra kick?

197
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,360
Nah.

198
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,200
Larger portion?

199
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,280
Nope.

200
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,159
Healthier stuff?

201
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:47,880
You got it.

202
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,000
My queen!

203
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,560
What's up?

204
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,280
Look this way.

205
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,480
Kind of busy here.

206
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,840
Make it snappy.

207
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,880
Just one quick turn.

208
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,760
Drop the knife!

209
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,520
What's...this?

210
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,400
Open it.

211
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,640
For me?

212
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,200
What an extravagance!

213
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,400
Got a gig.

214
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,320
You crazy spender!

215
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,000
Blowing money like that!

216
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,200
Didn't even run it by me!

217
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,880
Don't need a committee

218
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,040
for everything.

219
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,400
I got this!

220
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,680
Someone's feeling mighty today!

221
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,320
You know it.

222
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,560
No way, for real?

223
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,240
All yours, babe.

224
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,560
Got my circle bag!

225
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,320
Babe, I got my circle bag!

226
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,960
Got my circle bag!

227
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,040
Show me how it looks.

228
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,520
OK.

229
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,240
What'd you think? Good?

230
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,320
Killer!

231
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,600
Yeah? For real?

232
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,120
Amazing!

233
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,360
How's it working?

234
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,240
Tell me!

235
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,120
Don't wear it like a drum!

236
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,640
How much was it?

237
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,120
Let's just say

238
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,440
it was a lucky find.

239
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,240
I appreciate it,

240
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,200
but let's cool it with the big spending.

241
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Not even one like

242
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,159
on my pic.

243
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,039
This circle bag's super rare,

244
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,559
don't they know anything?

245
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,040
Got one!

246
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,520
Stick to bathroom stuff

247
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,640
instead of thumbing ups!

248
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,040
Holy cow!

249
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,880
What now?

250
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,160
Raccoons back?

251
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
Nah, not raccoons.

252
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,840
Nothing.

253
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,480
Saw my like?

254
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,840
Yep.

255
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:20,800
Sweet!

256
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,920
Come on, eat.

257
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,440
Let me finish this first.

258
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,320
What's got you so hooked?

259
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,000
Prettier than me?

260
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,240
Yep, it is.

261
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,720
What's with your head?

262
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,160
Here.

263
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,640
Oil popped

264
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,800
while

265
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:51,960
making eggs.

266
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,800
Slapped some toothpaste on it.

267
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,160
That garlic?

268
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,360
Nah, orange.

269
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,920
Who mixes oranges with noodles?

270
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,800
Tastes awesome.

271
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,280
Orange

272
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,280
then noodles,

273
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,160
makes 'em taste all fruity.

274
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,600
Here.

275
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,120
Kinda.

276
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,560
Oops, my bad.

277
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,400
Fu Yudong,

278
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,040
I'm so divorcing you.

279
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,560
Fu Yudong,

280
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,560
this work?

281
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,720
Fu Yudong,

282
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,880
quit snoozing!

283
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,840
Does this work?

284
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,040
Got that boss vibe?

285
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,840
Looking corporate enough?

286
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,520
79, 80, 81, 82, 83,

287
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,840
84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90,

288
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,880
91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96...

289
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,240
Cut it out!

290
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,760
Can't focus! Kill that noise!

291
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,160
Just speeding you up.

292
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,360
Traffic's

293
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,480
gonna be nuts.

294
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,320
Roads are clear.

295
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,160
Stop lounging,

296
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,440
go fix yourself up.

297
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,360
Hair done properly?

298
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
All set,

299
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,400
ready whenever.

300
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,480
That's done?

301
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,720
What's with those

302
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,520
two strands sticking up?

303
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
It's styled this way!

304
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,200
Jeez!

305
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,640
Doing my face and gotta fix you up too!

306
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,360
Just great.

307
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,080
Leave me be,

308
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,880
just get

309
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
your makeup done.

310
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,960
Let's roll already!

311
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,080
Nope, can't deal with that hair.

312
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,520
Babe,

313
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,040
you're what makes me shine.

314
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,800
No way I'm wearing that.

315
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,560
Just slap it on.

316
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,240
That's a chick's hat.

317
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,760
Nah, it's for everyone.

318
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,640
Pop it on, covers everything up.

319
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,720
Like that.

320
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,840
It's crushing my skull!

321
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,720
Yeah, too tight.

322
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,400
Here.

323
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,800
here's a bigger one.

324
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,920
C'mon, on your head.

325
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,920
Nailed it!

326
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,320
Killer look!

327
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,040
Total cowboy vibes!

328
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,720
Looking

329
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,560
super fine now!

330
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,480
Total hottie, proper gentleman!

331
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,560
Go get the car running,

332
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,600
be down in a sec.

333
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,400
Nah,

334
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,320
hanging here with you.

335
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,160
- Move it.
- Going over there,

336
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
you'll be at this forever.

337
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,320
Last bit, final touch,

338
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,280
three count and I'm good.

339
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,120
Three!

340
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,840
Whatever!

341
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,040
Gotta change.

342
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,880
You're stunning!

343
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,760
What's there to fix!

344
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,640
Which one?

345
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,040
These all suck.

346
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,960
Should sorted it

347
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,720
last night.

348
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,400
I did sort it,

349
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,320
why you saying I didn't?

350
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,360
Cool, she's five mins out.

351
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,360
Stop hugging that jacket,

352
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,040
get it on.

353
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,160
Here, AC's freezing.

354
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,560
Don't want it, it's your look.

355
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,360
Put it on now,

356
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,960
quit carrying it.

357
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,720
If I put it on now,

358
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,440
it'll get wrinkled.

359
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,960
You'll have to wear it anyway.

360
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,680
Yeah,

361
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
it'll be chaos

362
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,720
when she shows up.

363
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,520
Hold up!

364
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,680
Stand up.

365
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,440
What?

366
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,240
Whose suit is this?

367
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,280
Like you don't know,

368
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,160
it's mine.

369
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,480
What's up?

370
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,400
Yours?

371
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,720
Wore this

372
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
at my PhD graduation.

373
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,920
Same tie and everything.

374
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,920
Get that thing off!

375
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,680
C'mon, move it!

376
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,560
What's up?

377
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,160
This thing's

378
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,480
way too big!

379
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,600
You look ridiculous

380
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,640
in that.

381
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,400
Looks like a rental!

382
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,200
You wanted

383
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,440
fancy.

384
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,240
What's wrong with a suit?

385
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,120
Just put it on your arm,

386
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,720
don't put it on.

387
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Shirt's fancy enough.

388
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,400
That works.

389
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,560
Put it there, quick!

390
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,720
On your arm,

391
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,480
yeah, like that.

392
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,680
Forget this too.

393
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,720
My bad,

394
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,520
totally my bad.

395
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,760
First wear it,

396
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,920
then don't wear it...

397
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,840
Yeah yeah,

398
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,640
I messed up, sorry.

399
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:17,880
Hands off,

400
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,720
I got this styled.

401
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,920
No you don't.

402
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,640
No style at all!

403
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,840
Quit messing with it.

404
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,480
Hey, when she

405
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,480
shows up,

406
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,280
just smile,

407
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,920
don't be all stiff.

408
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,600
Gimme a smile.

409
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,160
That's super stiff.

410
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,920
At home

411
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,960
you're such a goofball!

412
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,160
Can you just act normal?

413
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:36,920
Yeah, chill,

414
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,000
I got this.

415
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,400
Ran!

416
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,880
Yuan Yuan!

417
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,600
God, I missed you!

418
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,680
Been ages!

419
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,120
Jeez, how're you still so young!

420
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,160
What's your secret?

421
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
Ya think?

422
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,880
So young, like seriously.

423
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,720
You're looking fab.

424
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,360
Hanging in there.

425
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
Love that bag!

426
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,680
Here, lemme introduce,

427
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,240
my hubby Ethan,

428
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,360
Yuan Yuan.

429
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,920
Nice to meet you.

430
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,160
He's Chinese, Mandarin's fine.

431
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,560
Hi.

432
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,119
Chinese, yeah.

433
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,640
Hi there.

434
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,960
He's got a PhD

435
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,040
from RUT.

436
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,560
How long's it been since you gals met?

437
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,839
Oh, like a century.

438
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,880
Lemme snap a pic.

439
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,400
Nah.

440
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,720
So uh,

441
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,599
should we

442
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,400
go and grab

443
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:21,720
some food?

444
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,560
Yeah yeah,

445
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,640
let's chat on the way.

446
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,839
Gimme my phone.

447
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,560
Wow,

448
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,240
you look taller!

449
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,079
He's such a looker!

450
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,160
Yeah? He's OK.

451
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,480
He's OK.

452
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,200
C'mon, let's move.

453
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,080
There's more.

454
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,080
Didn't order much.

455
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,200
You're rarely here.

456
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,840
Table's

457
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
packed already.

458
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,600
Thanks.

459
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,160
Enjoy.

460
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,880
So, how's

461
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,000
your house hunting?

462
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,000
Ugh,

463
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,360
total letdown, waste of time.

464
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,320
No good, huh?

465
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,280
So I checked it out...

466
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,800
Thanks, dig in.

467
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,760
Eat up.

468
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,400
Prices are super cheap.

469
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,080
A huge house here,

470
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,200
that's just

471
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,720
pocket change for me!

472
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,200
Found two

473
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,720
I kinda liked,

474
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,200
but they're

475
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,280
a bit rough inside.

476
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,280
This is what you get in here.

477
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,240
Yeah?

478
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,600
Yup, gotta redo everything inside.

479
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,400
Buying old houses here

480
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,840
is the smart move.

481
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,560
Fix 'em up,

482
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,320
and you're good whether

483
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,800
you're living in it or investing.

484
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,200
If you end up buying

485
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,160
and need work done...

486
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,040
He knows

487
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,520
these Chinese contractors,

488
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,320
super solid.

489
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,520
If you buy something,

490
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,840
need fixes, just hit him up

491
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,120
for contacts,

492
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,000
right babe?

493
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,560
Prob won't need that.

494
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,560
Inside's whatever,

495
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,800
but man,

496
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,080
opened the door, saw the hood,

497
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,960
way too backwoods!

498
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,640
Then I'm like,

499
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,480
even if I bought it,

500
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,520
would I actually crash here?

501
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,040
Got such a sweet gig, y'know,

502
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,440
can't just ditch it!

503
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:05,960
Ran,

504
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,640
no offense!

505
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,280
None taken.

506
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,760
I'm just basic,

507
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,760
not fancy like

508
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,840
you two brainiacs.

509
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,320
Nah, nah!

510
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,840
You guys can do the whole zen thing,

511
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,520
I need action in my life.

512
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,200
Yeah.

513
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,760
For investing,

514
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,800
you ain't gotta

515
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,760
live in it.

516
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,960
Yeah, ran the numbers,

517
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,560
doesn't stack up

518
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,840
against my places

519
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,200
back home.

520
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,760
Realtor said

521
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,400
these

522
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,520
big houses

523
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,280
are a pain to rent,

524
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,520
rent's cheap too,

525
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,080
then there's property tax

526
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,720
and upkeep costs...

527
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
Gotta think

528
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,560
this through more.

529
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,040
Yeah, house buying's no joke.

530
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,560
Right.

531
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,760
Gotta think it through.

532
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,400
Eat up, guys.

533
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,160
Yeah!

534
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,640
We're actually

535
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,800
looking to move too,

536
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,720
talking it over.

537
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,040
Your place looks amazing,

538
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,640
why move?

539
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,640
Saw it on your posts.

540
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,280
So jealous.

541
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,600
Yeah, want something bigger.

542
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,320
Cool!

543
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,840
That's

544
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
gotta be

545
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,280
a big deal.

546
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,160
Should be easy-peasy

547
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,080
for folks like you, right?

548
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,600
Everyone's gotta

549
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,320
budget,

550
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,200
no matter who they are.

551
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,960
True.

552
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,720
C'mon, eat.

553
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,960
Eat up, babe.

554
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,760
Yeah.

555
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,040
Ran,

556
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,520
haven't seen you

557
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,560
working much lately.

558
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,440
Baby plans?

559
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,000
Actually thinking of

560
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
doing an MBA this year.

561
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,400
I

562
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,440
got super interested

563
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,720
in international trade

564
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
and procurement stuff,

565
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,600
wanna give it a shot.

566
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,320
International procurement's

567
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,040
where the money's at.

568
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,560
Right?

569
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Though it could be treacherous.

570
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,240
Yeah.

571
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,520
Finally figured it out,

572
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,160
at our age,

573
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,040
y'know

574
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,720
it's about making the right choices.

575
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,720
Oh yeah,

576
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,920
you heard Zhou's hanging it up?

577
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,440
Yeah, I know. He mentored me.

578
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,680
So get this,

579
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,120
new boss comes in,

580
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,800
they're begging me to stick around.

581
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,480
But here's the kicker,

582
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,320
there's this

583
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,040
huge internet company

584
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,480
trying to grab me.

585
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
Want to build me

586
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,960
this whole new platform,

587
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,320
run my own show.

588
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,560
I'm kinda

589
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,160
stuck here,

590
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,080
can't make up my mind.

591
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,440
Ran, help a girl out,

592
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
should I bounce

593
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,960
or stick around?

594
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,040
Babe, see how

595
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,200
they fight over the good ones?

596
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,800
She's the example.

597
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,280
You'll crush it wherever you go,

598
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,440
you make everything better.

599
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:11,800
Nah, nah.

600
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,720
You're amazing too.

601
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,280
Yeah.

602
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,920
You're the best.

603
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,520
Oh, Mr. Perfect Husband over here.

604
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,560
You got it.

605
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,000
I seriously look up to Ran.

606
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,960
Look at her,

607
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,960
all zen-like,

608
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,520
living in her own bubble,

609
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,400
no drama.

610
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,160
Not like me,

611
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,640
I'm such a mess.

612
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,080
Yeah.

613
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,720
never satisfied,

614
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,520
always gotta shake things up.

615
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,000
Pretty bad, right?

616
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,120
That's good, actually.

617
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,080
Ran, I mean every single word

618
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,320
right now. Do you believe me?

619
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,000
I do.

620
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,160
If you hadn't

621
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,000
suddenly left.

622
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
How could I ever be

623
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,040
a financial broadcaster?

624
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,920
I wouldn't be here without you.

625
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,520
There's something else.

626
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,880
My memory is terrible these days.

627
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,600
That...

628
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,720
I have a book

629
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
that's about to be published.

630
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,680
"All About Finance."

631
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,360
Once it's out,

632
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,680
I'll send you a copy.

633
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,160
Please give me some feedback.

634
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,720
Definitely. Send it over ASAP.

635
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,160
I wouldn't dare critique it.

636
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,480
But I'll read it carefully.

637
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,800
Allow me to propose a toast.

638
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,280
Sure.

639
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,040
Toast to Ran.

640
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,600
Hold on.

641
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,120
A special toast to Ran.

642
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,320
Let's sit down.

643
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,880
A bit much?

644
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,080
Yes, a bit.

645
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,560
Ran, here's to you.

646
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,720
Thank you for bowing out.

647
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:22,880
For giving me

648
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,160
a life-changing opportunity.

649
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,160
I'll finish it, you do as you please.

650
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,520
You didn't have to.

651
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,000
Good wine.

652
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,920
Thank you.

653
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,440
No worries.

654
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
I think

655
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,400
You should really go back

656
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,800
to visit and look around.

657
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,840
I can arrange everything.

658
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,360
Right?

659
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,520
Sure. When we have time,

660
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,440
we will.

661
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,320
Are you considering?

662
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,840
Yes.

663
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,360
I'll introduce you

664
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,440
to my husband.

665
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
He works in private equity.

666
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,280
How did you meet?

667
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:52,960
You and your husband?

668
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,360
Now that you mention it,

669
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:54,880
it's similar to

670
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,920
the way you met Pierce.

671
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,200
Very similar.

672
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,720
Really?

673
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,160
He came to the station for a show

674
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,000
and then started

675
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,600
pursuing me like crazy.

676
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,280
Of course, his net worth

677
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
is no match to

678
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,720
your Pierce.

679
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,760
But everyone has their strengths.

680
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,320
He's very tolerant.

681
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,640
Leaves me alone.

682
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:11,760
That's good.

683
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,840
Me being...

684
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,640
I talk too much when I drink.

685
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,840
Ethan knew about Pierce?

686
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,720
I did.

687
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,480
You did?

688
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,560
Great. I thought

689
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,320
I misspoke.

690
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,800
It's fine. As a couple,

691
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,000
we have no secrets.

692
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,640
We respect

693
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,480
and trust each other.

694
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,360
When we first met,

695
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,480
we put all our cards on the table.

696
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,000
Right, hubby?

697
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,400
Yes.

698
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,240
That's wonderful.

699
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,760
You two are a match made in heaven.

700
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,000
He treats me well.

701
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,000
Let's eat.

702
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,560
Eat up.

703
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,160
Eat, eat.

704
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,800
Let's eat.

705
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,960
Too much talking.

706
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,880
Why aren't you eating?

707
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,920
I've been eating non-stop.

708
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,480
You're the one talking

709
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,080
and not eating.

710
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,440
Sorry.

711
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,320
When I drink, I ramble

712
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:51,800
a lot.

713
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,840
I'll have some greens.

714
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,560
Here.

715
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,440
We'll drive you.

716
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,080
No, no need.

717
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,000
Let us drive you.

718
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,840
No, listen to me.

719
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,880
It's nearby.

720
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,720
No traffic here.

721
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,560
It's fine, Ran.

722
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,640
You already paid for the meal.

723
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,560
It's just a quick drive.

724
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,200
No, no. Really.

725
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,320
Here's why.

726
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,880
My husband's

727
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,040
friend lives nearby.

728
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,800
Very close.

729
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,320
He wants to buy me a drink.

730
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,880
So I'll just walk over

731
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,360
to help digestion.

732
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,120
It's fine. Don't worry.

733
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,320
Have fun then.

734
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,880
I will.

735
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,440
We're heading off.

736
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:21,760
Okay.

737
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,560
Isn't this your car?

738
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,160
Yes, it is.

739
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,880
I'll get going then.

740
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,320
Listen.

741
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,640
If I come here to retire,

742
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,400
I'm coming to you.

743
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,120
You have to.

744
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,520
If you don't,

745
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,720
I'll be mad at you.

746
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,480
You have to take me in.

747
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,160
Absolutely.

748
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,520
Ethan.

749
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,040
Be careful.

750
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,800
Will do, will do.

751
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,880
Right, you didn't drink.

752
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,960
Take care.

753
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,080
Okay, okay.

754
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,000
Thanks for everything.

755
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,400
Bye.

756
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,840
Bye.

757
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,640
Don't mention it.

758
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,480
Bye bye.

759
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,680
Thank you for bowing out.

760
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,800
For giving me

761
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,960
a life-changing opportunity.

762
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,840
If you hadn't

763
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,760
suddenly left.

764
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,960
How could I ever be

765
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,640
a financial broadcaster?

766
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,600
I wouldn't be here without you.

767
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,320
Now that you mention it,

768
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,200
it's similar to the way you

769
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,840
met Pierce.

770
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,480
Very similar.

771
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,240
He came to the station for a show

772
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,040
and started

773
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,560
pursuing me like crazy.

774
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,800
I seriously look up to Ran.

775
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,040
Look at her,

776
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,720
all zen-like,

777
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,240
living in her own bubble,

778
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,160
no drama.

779
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,960
Not like me,

780
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,360
I'm such a mess.

781
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,520
Whatever I do,

782
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,520
I'm never satisfied,

783
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,280
always gotta shake things up.

784
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,200
Finally figured it out,

785
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,920
at our age,

786
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,840
y'know

787
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,400
it's about making the right choices.

788
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,040
"Visible and invisible sights."

789
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,160
"Fleeting moments, endless nights."

790
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,120
"Watch the grass grow,"

791
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,640
"see the snow drift away. Oh yeah!"

792
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,000
All about nailing that

793
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,600
"Oh yeah."

794
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,760
Join in,

795
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,600
ready?

796
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,440
Not my thing.

797
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,200
Just one practice round,

798
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,000
please?

799
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Really not my thing.

800
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Just chime in

801
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,600
with "oh yeah"

802
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,200
on my cue.

803
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,160
"Visible and invisible sights."

804
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,000
"Fleeting moments, endless nights."

805
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,760
"Watch the grass grow, see the snow drift away."

806
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,000
Really not my thing.

807
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,600
You.

808
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,600
Come on, Fu Yudong.

809
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,920
Just "Oh yeah."

810
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,560
Hurry.

811
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,880
"Visible and invisible sights."

812
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,000
"Fleeting moments, endless nights."

813
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,760
"Watch the grass grow, see the snow drift away."

814
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,600
"Oh yeah."

815
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,240
Oops, I cut it wrong.

816
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
Lunch time!

817
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,680
Come on!

818
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,760
All meat dishes today.

819
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,640
I spent a fortune.

820
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,040
All meat?

821
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
Definitely.

822
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,960
Come on.

823
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,800
Thanks, boss.

824
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,960
It's discounted.

825
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,800
Don't act like it's a favor.

826
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,760
Eat up, back to work.

827
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Still good stuff.

828
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,280
Yeah. Before the client

829
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,720
comes to me

830
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,120
complaining about this and that.

831
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,000
Seriously.

832
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,320
Our team survives on being

833
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,080
hardworking, efficient, and cheap.

834
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:25,600
Yeah.

835
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,240
Also.

836
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,400
I'm off to

837
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,680
a very important meeting.

838
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,440
Wish me luck.

839
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,400
Good luck.

840
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,160
Thanks.

841
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,080
Cheap stuff.

842
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,440
Probably two for one.

843
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,000
Go on. Come on.

844
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,840
Go.

845
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,400
Doctor, you're not eating?

846
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,160
Mind your own business.

847
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,720
He'll eat later.

848
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,400
Have you lost your mind?

849
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,880
That's dangerous!

850
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,960
What are you doing?

851
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,080
Sorry, sorry.

852
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,720
Sorry, boss.

853
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,000
Hurry up, I'm in a rush.

854
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,520
Why are you taking off your belt?

855
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,440
What for?

856
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,640
Boss.

857
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,560
I need to talk to you.

858
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,000
I've been working with you

859
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,360
for such a long time.

860
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,840
But you're still

861
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,360
paying me 16 dollars an hour.

862
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,600
I need a house and start a family.

863
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,080
I really admire you, Dr. Fu.

864
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,280
Really.

865
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,600
But you know

866
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,440
your current wage

867
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
is decent.

868
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,080
Business is tough.

869
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,480
Right?

870
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,600
I have to pay taxes.

871
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,760
And my labor costs

872
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,680
are so high.

873
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,240
All my client resources,

874
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,600
I built them

875
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,920
over 18 years.

876
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,520
If you go out on your own,

877
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,800
you won't even afford food.

878
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,080
Feikun in Chinatown.

879
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,160
He offers

880
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,600
20 dollars an hour.

881
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,600
So what?

882
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,840
He has no jobs.

883
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,840
Even if he offered 200 an hour,

884
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,320
he still has no jobs.

885
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,240
At least with me,

886
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,680
you get 4,000 dollars a month.

887
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,920
Be content, brother.

888
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,320
Besides,

889
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,920
though you know some utilities,

890
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,280
you don't have a license.

891
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,520
Even if you

892
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,840
go outside,

893
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,440
they'll pay you less.

894
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,240
I really

895
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,720
treat you like a brother, like family.

896
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,120
That's why I don't mind.

897
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:34,840
Boss.

898
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,200
I'm Fu, you're Li.

899
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:37,960
In the Hundred Family Surnames

900
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,360
we are pages apart.

901
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,160
I'm not worthy of being your family.

902
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,320
What do you mean?

903
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,920
What I just said.

904
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,360
You didn't

905
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,600
listen at all, did you?

906
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,120
Sir, you don't have an electrician license.

907
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,520
A licensed electrician in Toronto

908
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,120
makes 60 dollars an hour on average.

909
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,120
Me? I'm getting 16.

910
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,840
I don't have a license.

911
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,960
But,

912
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,120
I know

913
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,840
the theoretical foundation well.

914
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,760
I'd even say that

915
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,800
I do a better job

916
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,520
than those electricians.

917
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,600
I saw it the other day.

918
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,480
A client asked you:

919
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,120
"Does anyone

920
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
in this crew,

921
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,520
have an electrician license?"

922
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,800
You showed them my diploma.

923
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,080
You said I'm a Ph.D.

924
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,480
That I do the same work

925
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,640
as a licensed electrician.

926
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,080
How much money did I save you?

927
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,440
I work nine hours a day.

928
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,040
You only pay me

929
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,400
for eight hours.

930
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,240
I never asked

931
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,200
for overtime pay.

932
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,080
Out there,

933
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,680
just for a temp helper.

934
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,920
That's at least

935
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,200
25 dollars an hour.

936
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,440
I do plumbing, electrical and tiling.

937
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,840
If you wanted to find

938
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,480
someone like me,

939
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,440
how much would it cost you?

940
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,080
Over these years,

941
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,080
how much have I saved you?

942
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,160
So, what do you want?

943
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,840
I want a raise.

944
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,720
I can't give you

945
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,240
the 60 dollars of an electrician.

946
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,000
Stop daydreaming.

947
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,240
Per hour.

948
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,640
26 dollars.

949
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,960
Impossible. An hour...how much?

950
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,240
26 dollars.

951
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,680
Listen here, kid.

952
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,960
It's your lucky day.

953
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,840
I'm in a hurry.

954
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,000
26 dollars, deal.

955
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,040
Now please.

956
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,840
Get out.

957
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,840
I'm in a hurry.

958
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,680
Okay?

959
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,440
Alright.

960
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,640
Go.

961
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,160
Ok.

962
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,440
What a weirdo.

963
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,120
Boss.

964
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,920
You can trust me.

965
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,480
I...

966
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,040
Yeah.

967
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,400
Thanks, boss.

968
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
You're welcome!

969
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,040
Done.

970
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,480
Thank you.

971
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,200
No problem.

972
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,400
Let me get you some water.

973
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:05,960
No need.

974
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,720
So polite.

975
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,080
I noticed your house

976
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,840
has some old wiring.

977
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,239
The voltage is unstable.

978
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,239
Does the breaker trip often?

979
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,440
Yes, it trips often.

980
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,280
Would you like

981
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,239
to consider

982
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,199
a full house inspection?

983
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,440
Upgrade to a larger panel.

984
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,760
Like a 200-amp one.

985
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,280
You have an EV.

986
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,440
The EV charger,

987
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,560
according to code,

988
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,880
should have a dedicated circuit.

989
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,600
it'll be safer

990
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,520
in this way.

991
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,199
Even if there's a wiring issue,

992
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,080
it won't affect

993
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,000
your home insurance.

994
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,400
If you're interested,

995
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,440
contact me anytime.

996
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,960
I'm Fu Yudong.

997
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,719
I can provide a few

998
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,239
affordable power solutions.

999
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,440
Depending on your needs.

1000
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,520
Sounds good.

1001
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,120
Let's exchange contacts.

1002
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,000
Yes.

1003
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,480
Do you have WeChat?

1004
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,840
Nice one, kid.

1005
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,360
Once you got your license,

1006
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,280
you started side gigs.

1007
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,640
Why work yourself so hard?

1008
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,240
Weren't you pretty carefree?

1009
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,200
Buying a house.

1010
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,240
Your wife's demand?

1011
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,040
She said we can have kids once we buy a house.

1012
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,720
Your wife...

1013
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,080
Never mind.

1014
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,520
I won't say more.

1015
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,440
Say what you want to say.

1016
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,440
It's fine.

1017
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,040
Let me tell you something.

1018
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,280
That's what she says now.

1019
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,320
Wait till you buy the house.

1020
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,520
I'm taking a leak.

1021
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,880
What do you mean?

1022
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,800
Just wait and see.

1023
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,720
We have two sizes.

1024
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,600
Which one do you want?

1025
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:37,800
Big one.

1026
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,320
Okay, let me wrap it for you.

1027
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,120
Thank you.

1028
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,040
Nice.

1029
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,800
You're in the frame.

1030
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,440
Let me.

1031
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,800
Take a good one.

1032
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,840
I'll punch you.

1033
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,960
When I turn,

1034
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,040
you need to capture it.

1035
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,440
One, two, three, go.

1036
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,960
Great.

1037
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,760
Just like that.

1038
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,040
Good.

1039
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,240
Let me see.

1040
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:28,720
No.

1041
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,440
Show me.

1042
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:29,960
No.

1043
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,520
Let me look.

1044
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,600
No, it's really good.

1045
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,600
Impossible. Show me.

1046
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,240
It's really great.

1047
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:33,560
Come on.

1048
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,600
Why has no one

1049
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,440
liked my Moment yet?

1050
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,280
This bag is rare.

1051
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,680
Do they not get it?

1052
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,280
There's one.

1053
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,320
Fu Yudong, go to your toilet.

1054
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:49,800
Stop messing.

1055
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,760
The third one is

1056
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,280
50% off.

1057
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,560
Basically buy one get one free.

1058
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,320
We can share it.

1059
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,400
No, calories are enemies.

1060
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,640
I'm dieting.

1061
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,560
You're already so thin.

1062
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,440
Why diet?

1063
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:06,880
You don't understand.

1064
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,040
Get a drink then.

1065
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,400
Can't. Need to be dehydrated.

1066
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,360
I need to be thin to win.

1067
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,120
Close your eyes. You won't feel hungry.

1068
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,400
If you don't eat or drink,

1069
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,280
you'll close them forever.

1070
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,960
People will ask why your wife

1071
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,600
is so skinny.

1072
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,920
I'll say she's dieting. How?

1073
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,440
Breathing.

1074
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,240
Order. I'll watch you eat.

1075
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,280
I'm queuing.

1076
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,240
Give me a bite.

1077
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,200
Meds.

1078
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,240
Meds.

1079
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,160
Spit it out.

1080
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,280
Nothing.

1081
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,480
Say it.

1082
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,800
Am I old?

1083
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,120
Is my face sagging?

1084
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,080
Whatever you say.

1085
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,440
What for?

1086
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,240
Lights out. Sleep.

1087
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:37,920
Fu Yudong.

1088
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,840
Doctor, want a lift?

1089
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,520
No thanks.

1090
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,320
My wife is on her way.

1091
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,240
Go on.

1092
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,400
Drive safe.

1093
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,280
Okay, bye.

1094
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,240
Drive safe.

1095
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,000
What's going on?

1096
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,240
I was

1097
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:56,800
standing there,

1098
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,640
and you didn't see me?

1099
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,280
I didn't...I saw you.

1100
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,040
I made a U-turn.

1101
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,000
So when I came

1102
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,800
from the right,

1103
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,560
you don't have to walk

1104
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,360
to get in.

1105
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,040
Sorry, Hubby.

1106
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,800
Kept you waiting.

1107
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,680
Massage tonight.

1108
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,480
Tired?

1109
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,200
Rest a bit.

1110
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,600
Hubby, next week I want to treat

1111
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,040
an old colleague to dinner.

1112
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,240
She's from China.

1113
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,800
I want to book that Cantonese Restaurant.

1114
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,440
Don't you have a coworker

1115
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,320
who knows the

1116
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,520
owner very well?

1117
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,080
Treated her illness?

1118
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,800
Or something?

1119
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,640
Can you ask?

1120
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,600
See if we can get a discount.

1121
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,680
Watch the road.

1122
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,600
I am watching.

1123
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,080
If you sleep now,

1124
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,040
will you sleep tonight?

1125
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,280
One more thing.

1126
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,040
Your boss,

1127
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,080
he has a BMW, right?

1128
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,760
Let's borrow it.

1129
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,240
Why aren't you going back?

1130
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,480
Boss.

1131
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,760
Can I swap my car

1132
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,600
with yours for a bit?

1133
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,360
Why?

1134
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,920
Don't you have a pickup?

1135
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,040
Just one day.

1136
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,200
I have a special occasion.

1137
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,520
You can't...

1138
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,600
Thanks, boss.

1139
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,080
Here.

1140
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,480
Thank you.

1141
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,320
Can you drive it?

1142
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:33,600
Yes.

1143
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,840
Give me your keys.

1144
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,600
91 octane gas.

1145
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,480
Don't get it wrong.

1146
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,000
Thanks, boss.

1147
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,040
Eat a bit more?

1148
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,040
I'm full.

1149
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,480
The cowlick.

1150
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,160
Oh my god.

1151
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,120
Just hanging there.

1152
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,200
It's called style.

1153
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,480
Ran, you're so lucky.

1154
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,480
While living abroad,

1155
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,680
finding a great man like Ethan.

1156
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,240
I think he,

1157
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,320
compared to Pierce,

1158
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,040
is so much better.

1159
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,400
You can say that louder.

1160
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,600
Way better than Pierce!

1161
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,600
What do you mean?

1162
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,320
We're drunk.

1163
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,560
You didn't drink at all.

1164
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,000
Drink up. Have fun.

1165
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,800
So considerate.

1166
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,120
This gesture,

1167
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,080
my husband would never.

1168
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,440
Pouring wine, getting tissues.

1169
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,280
Never.

1170
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,480
Your husband doesn't carry things?

1171
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,080
No.

1172
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,560
No.

1173
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,720
Too heavy?

1174
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,400
You're hilarious.

1175
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,080
Ma'am.

1176
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,560
Here is your bill.

1177
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,200
Okay.

1178
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,560
I really can't.

1179
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,960
A drop left. Don't waste it.

1180
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:39,960
Thanks.

1181
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:40,760
Bottoms up.

1182
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,200
Done eating?

1183
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,720
It was wonderful.

1184
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,640
Couldn't be better.

1185
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,760
Please select the tip amount.

1186
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,840
And enter your PIN.

1187
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:48,640
Okay.

1188
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,840
Our restaurant

1189
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,240
defaults to 30%.

1190
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,320
For other amounts,

1191
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,040
press the option keys.

1192
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,440
Okay. 30% is fine.

1193
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,240
Thank you.

1194
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,000
Do you want these leftovers

1195
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,600
to go?

1196
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,800
No thanks.

1197
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:07,800
Okay.

1198
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,680
I'll ask the valet

1199
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,640
to bring your car around.

1200
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,200
Okay.

1201
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,440
Enjoyed the meal?

1202
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,800
Thanks. You shouldn't have.

1203
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,240
My pleasure.

1204
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,080
My pleasure.

1205
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,720
One last toast.

1206
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,360
Last toast.

1207
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:16,800
Cheers.

1208
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:18,840
Happy.

1209
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,360
Joy.

1210
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:20,800
Here.

1211
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,600
I can't drink.

1212
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,240
Let's go.

1213
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:32,960
Let's go.

1214
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:33,920
Go.

1215
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,920
Thank you for the treat.

1216
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,240
It's nothing.

1217
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:39,680
Let's go.

1218
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,680
I'll treat you when you go back home.

1219
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,880
You better.

1220
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,520
Craving anything specific?

1221
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,480
Anything you miss?

1222
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:49,800
No.

1223
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:50,520
No, nothing.

1224
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,520
We can get everything here.

1225
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,120
Right, right.

1226
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,520
Hubby, a UFO!

1227
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:40,960
Still won't get up?

1228
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,600
Look, top right.

1229
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,120
There's a dragon.

1230
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,880
Every time you tell me to look,

1231
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,640
I do.

1232
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,400
But when I tell you,

1233
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,480
you never fall for it.

1234
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:52,920
Boring.
