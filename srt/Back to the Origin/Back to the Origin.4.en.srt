1
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,160
Ran.

2
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,760
Why do you love tigers?

3
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,440
Zhang Ran.

4
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,200
Zhang Ran.

5
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,760
What?

6
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,880
Shh!

7
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,520
If it weren't for drink,

8
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
you wouldn't wake up.

9
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,640
Leave me alone.

10
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,760
Check out

11
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,560
what I took.

12
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,280
What time is it?

13
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,520
Are we almost there?

14
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,240
Look who it is.

15
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,200
Who?

16
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,840
It's my cousin.

17
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,200
She's up ahead.

18
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,720
Your cousin?

19
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,920
It fell off?

20
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,640
See?

21
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,920
So lively and fresh.

22
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,640
Really lively.

23
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,640
The fresher, the faster.

24
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,920
No matter how fast,

25
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,240
it still ends up in the pot.

26
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,720
These crabs are top-notch.

27
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,560
Just this one's a bit small.

28
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,920
I'll get you a bigger one.

29
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,079
No need, just weigh them.

30
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,520
Okay.

31
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,680
It's fine.

32
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,800
I'll give this one to my husband.

33
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,080
You're too kind.

34
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,680
Big ones are for daughter and son-in-law,

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,480
smaller ones are for Mr. Zhang.

36
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,600
He doesn't appreciate.

37
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,880
What for?

38
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,000
Besides,

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,480
how can he compare to my son-in-law?

40
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,520
My son-in-law

41
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,880
graduated from an "Ivory League".

42
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,160
He's a chemistry PhD.

43
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,320
My husband couldn't even

44
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,760
tell left from right.

45
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,640
Alright.

46
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
These crabs

47
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,280
weigh 4.7 pounds total.

48
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,440
46 yuan per pound.

49
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,520
For you, I'll round it down.

50
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,800
I'll only charge 200

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,800
instead of 215.

52
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,560
No, that's too much off.

53
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,680
Wait, hold on.

54
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,120
Ms. Zhou,

55
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,159
just a moment.

56
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,040
I heard your

57
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,600
famous daughter

58
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,840
is back in China.

59
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,080
Is she returning to the TV station?

60
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,680
She hasn't said.

61
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,760
She doesn't discuss things with me.

62
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,000
She must be going back.

63
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,040
You see...

64
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,840
She has been a famous host.

65
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,720
With all her

66
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
experience abroad,

67
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
the station must have

68
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,200
begged her to return.

69
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,360
Perhaps.

70
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,840
Of all people

71
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,080
in the sugar factory,

72
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,680
I just knew

73
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,320
she was the most talented.

74
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,520
Ms. Zhou,

75
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,480
do you remember Xiaobo?

76
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,400
Our own Liu Bo.

77
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,680
Wasn't he a tour guide?

78
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,720
Don't even start.

79
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,320
His agency went bankrupt.

80
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,480
Now he's just

81
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,320
staying at home.

82
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,200
Can't find

83
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,280
a proper job.

84
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,960
I... I was wondering

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,240
if you could ask

86
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,240
your daughter to talk to the station,

87
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,840
and get Xiaobo

88
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,520
a job there?

89
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,120
Okay.

90
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,520
I'll mention it when she's back.

91
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,760
Our Ran is very kind-hearted.

92
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,680
Always a model student.

93
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,320
Her reports always said

94
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,480
she's cooperative

95
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,159
and helpful.

96
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:36,640
I'll bet.

97
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,760
I'll talk to her.

98
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,760
Thank you!

99
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,480
How much was it?

100
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,600
No, keep the change.

101
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,120
Just... just 200.

102
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,159
That's robbery!

103
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:43,640
It's nothing.

104
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,920
Alright, done.

105
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,120
Thank you.

106
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Here, let me carry that.

107
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,440
No, I'm fine.

108
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,720
Really, it's no problem.

109
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,560
I've got it.

110
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,400

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,720
Henpecked.

197
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,520
Scared of your wife!

198
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,560
Wife-whipped!

199
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,799
Under her thumb!

200
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,880
Run!

201
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,400
Zhang Jianbin, hurry up!

202
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,520
Peel the ginger

203
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
and go tidy up.

204
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,800
The kids will be here soon.

205
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,720
Stop nagging.

206
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,600
Yudong and Ran

207
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,880
aren't strangers.

208
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,960
They're married.

209
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,200
No need for formalities with family.

210
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,680
Yudong

211
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,480
has only visited a few times.

212
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,280
We haven't even met his parents.

213
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,240
No grandchildren yet,

214
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
how is that family?

215
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,760
No more excuses, lazybone.

216
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,240
Look sharp!

217
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,280
Okay.

218
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
Are you working

219
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,000
or your phone is?

220
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,200
I'm peeling ginger!

221
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,760
Your sister says

222
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
fancy bistros nowadays

223
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,880
peel their ginger properly.

224
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,960
But for family meals?

225
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,880
I see no need.

226
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,320
Your sister's too fussy.

227
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,760
Just do what she asked

228
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,280
and stop whining.

229
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,640
You're definitely her sister.

230
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,840
What can I help with?

231
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Any operation

232
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,320
to perform, surgeon?

233
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,040
Step aside.

234
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,840
I've just washed my hands!

235
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,000
Fine, fine.

236
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,280
No tasks for me?

237
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,240
What?

238
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,560
Not needed yet.

239
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,000
Whatever.

240
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,480
Tonight...

241
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,880
Call Lu Ming,

242
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,200
see if he's picked them up.

243
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,920
No need to call.

244
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,960
He'll bring them back when he's done.

245
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,880
Why not take off

246
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,760
your jacket?

247
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,520
It's warm.

248
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,320
I'm fine.

249
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,240
Here, let me.

250
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,080
It is really warm.

251
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,400
Uncle, a bigshot like you

252
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,480
picking us up yourself?

253
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,760
What an honor.

254
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,560
Thank you.

255
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,200
My pleasure.

256
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,360
Parked inside.

257
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,200
Good.

258
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,920
Haven't been back in ten years.

259
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,280
I don't recognize anything.

260
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,160
Your trunk fits a lot.

261
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,840
Will it all fit?

262
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,440
Yes, yes.

263
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,200
Here.

264
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,200
Too many suitcases. One more there.

265
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
That one should go

266
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,360
in the back seat.

267
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay.

268
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,920
Back seat it is.

269
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,880
I'll sit up front then.

270
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,400
Fine.

271
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,440
Uncle, you're so thoughtful.

272
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,560
Cleared the back in advance

273
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,320
for the luggage.

274
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,920
You even folded the front seat.

275
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,680
No problem.

276
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,800
Just adjust it.

277
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,840
Is the cart okay here?

278
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,080
Someone will collect it.

279
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:45,920
Okay.

280
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,400
A bit cramped.

281
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,320
It's fine.

282
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,720
Better now.

283
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,640
This works.

284
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,760
Let's go home.

285
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,960
How long to get home?

286
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,520
Uncle?

287
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,280
About half an hour.

288
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,280
Let's go.

289
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,920
Enough space there?

290
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,400
Plenty.

291
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,240
Very spacious.

292
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,360
Turn up the AC, it's hot.

293
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,360
Here's a tissue.

294
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,080
I'm fine.

295
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,720
Really.

296
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,680
It's okay.

297
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,080
Was this bridge here before?

298
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,920
Built after you left.

299
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,600
Right.

300
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,400
These past years,

301
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,480
the city changed a lot.

302
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,920
Yes, really

303
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,840
changed a lot.

304
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,520
Yudong, are you local?

305
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,480
No.

306
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,080
I went to university here.

307
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,000
What a coincidence

308
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,280
for you to meet abroad!

309
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,760
Yes.

310
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,880
Are your parents

311
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,360
in your hometown or here?

312
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,960
He's in Lucheng City.

313
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,080
That overpass!

314
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,960
If I recall,

315
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,080
my first reporting spot

316
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,720
was right there,

317
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
near that bridge.

318
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,400
That bridge?

319
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,840
During the typhoon, right?

320
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,440
Yes.

321
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,760
Your aunt saw it.

322
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,720
She was worried sick.

323
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,880
Said Xinying should

324
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,880
learn from you.

325
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,720
That dedication!

326
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
Is Xinying doing well?

327
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,520
Yes.

328
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,760
I didn't tell her

329
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,000
I was coming back.

330
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,960
Is she planning to return?

331
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,520
Probably not.

332
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,840
She's working

333
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,920
at a bank now.

334
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,560
And

335
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,280
she just got her work permit

336
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,000
renewed.

337
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,520
Probably can't take time off.

338
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,200
How about you two?

339
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,840
How long are you staying this time?

340
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,720
We're... Actually,

341
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,760
a company here

342
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,600
wants to work with me,

343
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,360
so I come back to

344
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,080
do some research.

345
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,720
You never know...

346
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,720
Go ahead, answer it.

347
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,480
It's alright.

348
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,400
Nah, probably a crank call.

349
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,080
Ignore it.

350
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,680
We'll see what they offer.

351
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,720
So I come back.

352
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,760
And Yudong's free right now,

353
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,920
so he comes with me.

354
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,160
We'll see how it goes...

355
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,160
Just answer it.

356
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,800
Who is it?

357
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,720
Hello?

358
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,800
Mr. Lu?

359
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,400
Why did you hang up?

360
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,440
Sorry, who's this?

361
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,000
I was your passenger

362
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,680
from OCT to the airport.

363
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,880
Can you check if I

364
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,960
left my makeup bag

365
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,200
in your car?

366
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,440
A pink one.

367
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,600
Yes, it's here.

368
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,040
There is one.

369
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,520
Yes.

370
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Can you check

371
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,920
if my ID's inside?

372
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,920
Yes, it's in here.

373
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,600
It's here.

374
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,120
Good.

375
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,080
Could you

376
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,920
bring it to the airport

377
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,520
right now?

378
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,440
Thanks.

379
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,920
Sorry, but

380
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,080
I've already left.

381
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,120
How about this,

382
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,520
you get a temporary ID first,

383
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,720
and I'll mail it

384
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,760
to you later?

385
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,160
Listen,

386
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,520
I'm really in a hurry.

387
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,880
I'll pay you 200 yuan extra

388
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,480
to bring it to me.

389
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,080
It's not about the money.

390
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,720
I'm really

391
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,680
busy right now.

392
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,520
Sorry.

393
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,000
Don't be sorry!

394
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,520
Everything's about money.

395
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,200
What could you possibly be doing?

396
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,400
I booked a premium car.

397
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,960
I paid for premium service!

398
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,520
We're fine.

399
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
Is this your attitude?

400
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,400
We can take a detour.

401
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,920
I'm gonna

402
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,320
report you to the platform!

403
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,400
And my ID...

404
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,120
It's totally fine.

405
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,240
We're not in a hurry.

406
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,120
I don't use temporary one.

407
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,200
Alright, wait a moment.

408
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,080
I can't wait!

409
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,880
Hurry up.

410
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,320
Departures, Gate 9.

411
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,120
Be quick!

412
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,080
It's okay.

413
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,120
I'll just tell Mom

414
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,440
I forgot something at the airport.

415
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,520
Let's turn around.

416
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,240
Sorry, Yudong.

417
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,200
No problem.

418
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,120
Can we turn around

419
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,800
at that bridge?

420
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,520
Yes, next exit.

421
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,800
There's an exit here, yeah?

422
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
[This week we're enjoying]

423
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,560

424

428
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,240
[We have southeasterly breeze.]

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,400
[It is perfect for outdoor]

[activities.]

431
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,720
Okay, got it.

432
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,360
Okay.

433
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,280
You hang up, my hands are full.

434
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,640
Are they here?

435
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,760
Just picked them up.

436
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,000
Stuffs left at the airport,

437
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,920
they're turning back now.

438
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,000
Will be here a bit later.

439
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,000
Are they infants?

440
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,480
How can they still be so forgetful?

441
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,080
What a headache.

442
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,360
Zhang Jianbin?

443
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,920
Zhang Jianbin?

444
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,080
Didn't you ask him

445
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,480
to buy rice wine?

446
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,960
Uh, your ladyship?

447
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,880
I just cleaned up.

448
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,120
Don't make a mess

449
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,640
right after I finished.

450
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,920
I'm not making a mess!

451
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,640
There's no mess.

452
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,080
Everything's on the table.

453
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,720
Keep the shells

454
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,320
of the polly seeds on the table,

455
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,360
in one place, will you?

456
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:32,920
Otherwise...

457
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,840
I'm not eating seeds!

458
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,400
They're pistachios!

459
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,840
You're just like Mom.

460
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,720
Always nagging.

461
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
Why aren't you like Mom?

462
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,320
If you were,

463
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,480
I wouldn't be so tired.

464
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,000
I take after Dad.

465
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,920
Waited on by Mom.

466

478
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,640
Here, uncle.

479
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,560
No, you...

480
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:16,760
Let me...

481
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,360
Take that one.

482
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,200
I've got this.

483
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,680
Don't worry.

484
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,400
Just take that one.

485
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,080
I'll do it.

486
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,520
Let's go, lock it.

487
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Give me one.

488
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,040
I'm fine.

489
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,080
You lead the way.

490
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,480
Give me one.

491
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,760
The bigger one for me.

492
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,520
Stop fighting, hurry up.

493
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,720
Let's go.

494
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Your community is huge.

495
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,360
Give me one.

496
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,240
I can take it!

497
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:36,760
Here.

498
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,680
Ran.

499
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,920
About today...

500
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,600
Well,

501
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,280
I'm starting my own business,

502
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,920
so I need to understand

503
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,080
young people's perspectives.

504
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,520
Stay current.

505
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,520
Really?

506
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,600
Yes, so...

507
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,760
I occasionally drive

508
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,680
for ride-sharing

509
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,600
in my free time.

510
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,160
I see.

511
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,720
It helps me connect

512
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,080
with younger people.

513
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,920
Exactly.

514
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,200
Many people do this abroad.

515
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,600
Yudong and I even took

516
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
those high-end,

517
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,079
luxury Ubers.

518
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,800
Right, Yudong?

519
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,480
Yes.

520
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
When Ran went shopping,

521
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,319
she'd wait in long lines.

522
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,400
To pass time,

523
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,319
I'd drive for Uber

524
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,720
nearby

525
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,359
as well.

526
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,079
Yeah?

527
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,560
The "sharing economy",

528
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:15,920
right?

529
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,240
Yes, exactly.

530
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,079
But about this,

531
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,119
don't tell your aunt

532
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,079
or your parents.

533
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,599
I'm not an idiot, uncle.

534
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,839
Don't want them to worry.

535
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,440
I get it.

536
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,400
Don't worry, uncle.

537
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,119
Mum's the word.

538
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,040
I know nothing.

539
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,080
This community is huge.

540
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,560
Brother-in-law!

541
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,200
Dad!

542
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,560
Ran!

543
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,600
Yudong.

544
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,560
Took a long flight.

545
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,120
Yudong, come.

546
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,400
Dad!

547
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,040
Yudong!

548
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,800
You're

549
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
a bit stouter than on video.

550
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,600
Same as always.

551
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,280
Let's go home.

552
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,880
I've got it.

553
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,480
No, no.

554
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,280
We've got it.

555
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,840
Don't worry about it.

556
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,240
We're fine.

557
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,960
Help him.

558
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,480
We're good.

559
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,360
Help him, I'll take this.

560
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,400
It's not heavy, I can...

561
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,280
Give it to me.

562
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,720
Too much stuff.

563
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,320
Really, it's fine.

564
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,200
Just pull that.

565
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,080
Help him.

566
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,880
Let's go.

567
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,400
Give me one!

568
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,320
Go ahead.

569
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,320
My clothes!

570
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,880
See?

571
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,600
You pull it, Dad.!

572
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,480
I've got it my way.

573
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,840
Give me that one.

574
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,600
No need.

575
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,080
You'll break it.

576
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,160
What did you buy?

577
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,360
Nothing, let's go.

578
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
Go ahead, it's fine.

579
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,160
Mom's home, right?

580
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,280
Yes, turn left here.

581
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,000
Turn left!

582
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,560
Left.

583
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
Almost there.

584
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,520
Yudong!

585
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,080
Here, give me one.

586
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,360
My hands are free.

587
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,960
Take them one by one.

588
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,840
Lu Ming.

589
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,360
Let's have a drink

590
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,280
later.

591
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,800
Sure.

592
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,520
Dad!

593
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Give it to me!

594
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,600
Help your uncle.

595
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,080
I'm fine.

596
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,520
Uncle!

597
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,120
Don't...

598
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,880
Let go!

599
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,640
I've got it!

600
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,400
Give it to him!

601
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:32,920
Okay.

602
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,440
Careful!

603
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,000
Okay.

604
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,520
Yudong!

605
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,800
What's in here?

606
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,920
It's so heavy!

607
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,240
Leave it, I'll get it.

608
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,920
Be right there.

609
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,520
Here.

610
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,600
Easy, watch your back!

611
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,800
Careful!

612
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,480
What?

613
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,440
Why measure so precisely?

614
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,360
It's not medicine.

615
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,320
A little more or less

616
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,400
doesn't matter.

617
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,920
Stop hovering

618
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,400
and nagging!

619
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,200
Just

620
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,320
pour it evenly.

621
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,880
Swirl it around.

622
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,680
My way

623
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,000
spreads it evenly.

624
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,680
Mine works too.

625
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,640
And you're

626
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,800
taking forever!

627
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,160
Have some grapes, aunt.

628
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,600
Grapes, mom.

629
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,560
You're taking forever.

630
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,320
I'm just asking!

631
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,400
Am I stopping you from eating?

632
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,680
Need help? No?

633
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:32,800
Fine.

634
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,520
Dad, uncle,

635
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,360
what are you watching?

636
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,560
A business show.

637
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,560
Used to be your show.

638
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,680
Not good anymore.

639
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,560
Not without me.

640
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,160
Her face

641
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,320
looks weird, see?

642
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
You're cruel, kiddo.

643
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,840
Yudong?

644
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,760
Let's unpack.

645
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,160
We're at her place now, getting

646
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,920
ready for meal.

647
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,040
Maybe in a few days.

648
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,960
Let's see then

649
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,120
if we can set up a meeting.

650
00:19:59,320 --> 00:19:59,840
What?

651
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,480
Let's unpack.

652
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,440
You're not even halfway...

653
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,520
Why are you standing there?

654
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,880
It's fine.

655
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,600
Her uncle picked us up.

656
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,760
We're at her place now,

657
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,640
getting ready for dinner.

658
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,680
Maybe in a few days.

659
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,600
Let's see then if we can

660
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,760
set up a meeting.

661
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,800
Don't wait!

662
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,680
No time like the present.

663
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,640
Tomorrow!

664
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
Perfect timing,

665
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,880
Cheng Man's home too.

666
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,560
Come for lunch

667
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,480
with Ran,

668
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,480
bring some gifts

669
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,520
to my place,

670
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,320
and visit me.

671
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,440
I've got some

672
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,320
great news!

673
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Okay, then tomorrow it is.

674
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,520
You brought this pot back?

675
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,640
When did you get this?

676
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,880
No wonder the suitcase was so heavy!

677
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,720
Oh, right. Mom!

678
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,320
Mom!

679
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,520
The pot you wanted.

680
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,320
What pot?

681
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:47,960
I went with Zhang Ran

682
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,840
and bought it for you.

683
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,520
She paid with her card.

684
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,080
This pot is seriously heavy.

685
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,160
Ran raid for this?

686
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,160
Give it to me.

687
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,880
Customs never lets me bring it.

688
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,960
Says it's over the weight limit.

689
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,040
Let me wash it.

690
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,680
I'll make you

691
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,400
red-braised pork later.

692
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
You're so thoughtful!

693
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,000
So observant!

694
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,520
I'll do it.

695
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,560
Let me do it.

696
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,040
[Ailing, look at this pot.]

697
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,760
[It's just like yours.]

698
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,000
Fu Yudong, where's

699
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,960
that American ginseng?

700
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,160
[Coming.]

701
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,160
[Is it the same as yours?]

702
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,840
What?

703
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,320
[You just like my pot.]

704
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,560
Look over there.

705
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,040
[It's great for cooking, right?]

706
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,920
[But it's not]

707
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,000
[the same brand as ours.]

708
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,960
Count them.

709
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,840
Am I great?

710
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,960
One, two, three, four...

711
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,960
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

712
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,000
Not bad.

713
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,320
So many certificates.

714
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,280
I get that many in one semester.

715
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,280
You can go now.

716
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:32,840
You're done here.

717
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,720
I don't need you anymore.

718
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,240
I mean it.

719
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:34,920
Get going.

720
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,160
But I think you've already

721
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,680
done really well.

722
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,480
Get out of here.

723
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,400
"Best Debater."

724
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,440
"Best Writer."

725
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,520
"Best..."

726
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,800
[Why have you been best debater so many times?]

727
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,000
[Mom, let me do it.]

728
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,680
[This pot doesn't need]

729
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,240
[to be seasoned, right?]

730
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,080
[Needed.]

731
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,920
[Definitely needed.]

732
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,760
[For real?]

733
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,480
[Of course.]

734
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,920
Imported ones still need seasoning?

735
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,480
[Yes.]

736
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,560
[It's a clay pot?]

737
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,200
Not a clay pot.

738
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,880
This exact one.

739
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,200
Just like Ailing has.

740
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,760
Ours doesn't need seasoning.

741
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,280
Silly tiger.

742
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,520
Clay pots need seasoning.

743
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,000
This one doesn't.

744
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,880
This one...

745
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,680
Ailing said meat cooked in this is so delicious.

746
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,520
Pierce likes

747
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,640
this hairstyle.

748
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,200
In front of Pierce,

749
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,080
can I have this hairstyle?

750
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,120
Looks like a silly girl.

751
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,920
I'd definitely need full makeup.

752
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,280
At least you know you're silly.

753
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,200
You ungrateful brat...

754
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,840
You just leave me like this.

755
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,280
Such a big TV station,

756
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,960
how can't they keep you?

757
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,240
I just told you the day before yesterday.

758
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,080
I can't say it

759
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,280
every single day.

760
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,640
I don't like

761
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,680
the competitive environment.

762
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,360
Besides,

763
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,040
in this new era, you need long-term vision.

764
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,160
You've got to fight tooth and nail

765
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,560
just to grab some scraps.

766
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,640
What's the point?

767
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,160
Just because you don't like it and you're leaving me.

768
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,960
That's called a job for life.

769
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,520
I don't know about that.

770
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
Pierce said

771
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,080
in the era of globalization

772
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,920
what matters is global influence.

773
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,800
Someone like me who speaks English

774
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,160
and is good at communicating

775
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,920
would definitely thrive in Canada.

776
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,720
Who knows,

777
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,480
maybe I'll become

778
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,920
an internationally influential host.

779
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,320
I'll bring honor to the family.

780
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,120
It's not that simple.

781
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,000
Let me try first.

782
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,840
Worst case scenario,

783
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
even if I don't succeed,

784
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,440
can't I just

785
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,320
be a housewife at home?

786
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,080
Pierce has it all there,

787
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,160
place, wheels, status.

788
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,480
Most importantly, he's handsome.

789
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Like that matters.

790
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
He has no manners.

791
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,200
If you marry a Chinese guy,

792
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,840
he'll be

793
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,080
over at our place all the time.

794
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,520
He's Western.

795
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,560
He doesn't care about that.

796
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,800
Who cares?

797
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,760
The problem is the distance.

798
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,240
What if something happens?

799
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,720
Your family won't be there for you.

800
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,280
What if he bullies you?

801
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,840
It won't happen and there're laws.

802
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,640
Who could

803
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,080
possibly bully me?

804
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,440
You don't want

805
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,320
these cases anymore?

806
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,080
That one...

807
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,080
Such an expensive bag,

808
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,040
how could you just stuff it in there?

809
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,000
If you don't mind it,

810
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,480
take it out and use it.

811
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,400
I'll buy you a new one

812
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,040
and a good one.

813
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,360
Don't waste money.

814
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,280
You must be crazy.

815
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,080
These cases...

816
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,600
Don't put it that high.

817
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,640
Just stack them here.

818
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,880
Okay, put them there.

819
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,960
Stop nagging me.

820
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,080
I still need

821
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,040
to unpack the cabinet.

822
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,240
I'll take this one.

823
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,760
I'll take this one.

824
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,840
Can you bring something useful?

825
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,400
Don't be so childish.

826
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,920
When are you gonna grow up?

827
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,200
Hello, I'm Zhang Ran.

828
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,080
I just got my degree in English

829
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,960
from Lucheng University this year.

830
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,520
Before that, at the campus job fair,

831
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,480
I signed an agreement with you.

832
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,200
I'm here

833
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,320
to report for duty.

834
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,880
Hi, Miss Lin,

835
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm Zhang Ran,

836
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,080
a graduate in English

837
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,080
from Lucheng University.

838
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,720
Now working in the News Editing Room

839
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,280
on international news compilation.

840
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,600
Just came to say hello.

841
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,560
Good position and great talent.

842
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,560
[I'm off early today. Any fun plans?]

843
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,760
[Why'd you step on my shoe?]

844
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,880
Today...

845
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,000
I think today is Ting's birthday.

846
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Let's go inside.

847
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,880
Who is that?

848
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,360
The famous host, Miss Lin.

849
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,160
What a coincidence.

850
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,120
[I was just talking about you]

851
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,040
[with these young girls.]

852
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,160
Look at Wang.

853
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,720
Take a good look.

854
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,960
Familiar, right?

855
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,480
Isn't she just like you

856
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,520
when you first joined the station?

857
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,000
Just like the next Lin Fei.

858
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,520
What a coincidence.

859
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,280
I was just talking about Zhang Ran too.

860
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,520
She's on international news compilation.

861
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,640
That's where

862
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,440
two deputy directors came from.

863
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,760
When I first started hosting,

864
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,440
Mr. Zhou were doing that job.

865
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,280
Mr. Zhou, you're amazing.

866
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,120
Fei,

867
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,240
I've always heard from Mr. Zhou.

868
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,840
You've moved to an office job.

869
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,000
Why come back to the front lines?

870
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,800
You think being

871
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,320
a reporter is easy?

872
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,160
I joined the TV station

873
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,440
because I wanted to be a host.

874
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,200
I have Level A Mandarin certification.

875
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,480
I even got my host qualification certificate.

876
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,440
I can do it.

877
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,440
I think...

878
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,320
[Mr. Zhou,]

879
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,600
Since Ran brought it up,

880
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
let her have a shot.

881
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,440
Aren't we supposed

882
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,840
to give youngsters a chance?

883
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,480
[Did you schedule it?]

884
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,360
[No.]

885
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,920
[Don't worry. I'll help you set it up later.]

886
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,360
Okay.

887
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,040
Zhang Ran,

888
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,640
reporting is really tough.

889
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,080
Early mornings, late nights,

890
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,400
out in wind and rain,

891
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,800
barely eating, drinking, or sleeping well.

892
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,720
Can you handle it?

893
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,240
I can.

894
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,880
Hello everyone, I'm Zhang Ran.

895
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,960
I'm now at the coastal park.

896
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,360
We're currently about

897
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,720
100 kilometers from

898
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,520
the typhoon's center.

899
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,360
[Just now on our way here,]

900
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
[we saw many]

901
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,360
[shop signs]

902
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,640
[already blown down.]

903
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,680
[Already blown...]

904
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,760
Everyone,

905
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,000
stay home

906
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,960
unless you really have to go out...

907
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,440
Some people say

908
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,320
you're working so hard

909
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,120
just to

910
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,720
become a financial news host.

911
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,280
If I were you, I wouldn't even care.

912
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,480
Having ambition

913
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,800
isn't a bad thing at all.

914
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,200
New bag?

915
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:06,960
Yeah.

916
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,840
Saved up for a long time to buy it.

917
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,080
It really suits you.

918
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,040
I'm heading out now.

919
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,800
Okay, bye.

920
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,400
Bye.

921
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,120
We are really sorry about

922
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,400
this

923
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,120
technical issue.

924
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,280
Our team is all set.

925
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,120
We're gonna fix it

926
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,880
in about 10 to 15 seconds.

927
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,480
We sincerely thank you for your patience.

928
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,800
[Speak louder. I can't hear you.]

929
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,080
Threatened miscarriage?

930
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,200
Excuse me, I'll be back soon.

931
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,400
That's what the doctor said?

932
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,320
Alright then.

933
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,240
You stay there

934
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
and focus on preserving the pregnancy.

935
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:38,920
Mr. Zhou.

936
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,880
We're about

937
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,560
to record the show

938
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,200
and Lin Fei went to hospital.

939
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,160
What if there's dead air?

940
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,520
I'll do it.

941
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,400
You?

942
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,920
Let me take the slot.

943
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,640
I'm ready.

944
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,520
[Life always seems to]

945
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,880
[have other plans.]

946
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,160
[I thought I would be an interpreter,]

947
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,200
[but now I'm an anchor instead.]

948
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,320
[This reminds me of]

949
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,240
[my favorite line:]

950
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,960
[Life is like a box of chocolate,]

951
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,200
[you never know]

952
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,280
[what you gonna get.]

953
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:33,760
Honey,

954
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,280
do you think this style works for me?

955
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,600
She has over a million followers.

956
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,560
I'm not even close to her?

957
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,600
This looks great.

958
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,080
Right?

959
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,360
You're way better than her.

960
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,440
Exactly.

961
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,080
You'll have to work a bit tomorrow though.

962
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,400
We're going to Li Daoqi's for meal.

963
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,560
That person

964
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,480
I told you about before.

965
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,280
Okay.

966
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,440
What time tomorrow?

967
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,120
Tomorrow afternoon,

968
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,320
I have to go to that company.

969
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,520
Okay, then noon.

970
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,720
Noon works.

971
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,600
It's Li Daoqi

972
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,800
and his wife Cheng Man.

973
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,400
Okay, let's go early.

974
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
Is dad going tomorrow?

975
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,440
Is 11:00 AM okay?

976
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,520
Sure.

977
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,160
[Ran,]

978
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,320
[I want to get you]

979
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,520
[a thin silk quilt.]

980
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,080
Come on, mom.

981
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,000
[I'm heading in.]

982
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,680
Okay.

983
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,160
I told your dad to grab a quilt,

984
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,240
and he brought such a thick one.

985
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,320
Watch out, mom.

986
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,080
Thank you, mom.

987
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,000
Here, this one's for you.

988
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,200
Hi, dad.

989
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,200
Why the winking? What's up?

990
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,280
I'm looking for Fu.

991
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,480
We're gonna chat.

992
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,120
Not with you.

993
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,240
It's already late.

994
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,440
We've been on a plane all day.

995
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:32,920
We're exhausted.

996
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
Let's talk tomorrow. Still getting over the jet lag.

997
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,760
It's okay if dad wants to talk.

998
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,920
You stay out of it.

999
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,720
Jet lag is killing us.

1000
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,640
Come on.

1001
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,120
It's fine. I'll take it.

1002
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,840
Come on.

1003
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,080
Dad's...

1004
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,840
Such a goofball.

1005
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,600
What?

1006
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,920
Your dad cares about you.

1007
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,800
What are you doing?

1008
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,280
Just like you're interrogating a spy?

1009
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,800
Be serious.

1010
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,960
I'm being very serious.

1011
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,200
This one is thin.

1012
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,040
Once when I was organizing things,

1013
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,640
I found a business card

1014
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,880
from that guy

1015
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,080
you used to date,

1016
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,160
Pierce.

1017
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,200
His name's initials

1018
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,080
are PZ.

1019
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,640
What does PZ stand for

1020
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,200
in Chinese?

1021
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
Cheater!

1022
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,080
You're still laughing?

1023
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,080
You really can make connections.

1024
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,480
That chapter's closed. Let's not bring it up.

1025
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,640
What do you mean closed?

1026
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,520
Shouldn't we learn from it?

1027
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,720
Your dad and I have been reflecting

1028
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,280
on your first failed relationship.

1029
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,120
That was our responsibility.

1030
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,920
We didn't vet him properly.

1031
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,480
You can do it now.

1032
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,760
You've already called him out.

1033
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,880
- I didn't say anything.
- Keep it down.

1034
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,720
I didn't stop you.

1035
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,120
Look at you and Ran.

1036
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,720
You've been married for years now,

1037
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,480
and...

1038
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,120
I don't really know you yet.

1039
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,080
We've never

1040
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,400
really

1041
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,160
had a proper chat.

1042
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,480
You don't really know me either.

1043
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,960
Now that you're back this time,

1044
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,040
it's the perfect opportunity

1045
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,360
for us to have a good talk.

1046
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,800
Dad, if there's anything

1047
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,720
you want to know about me,

1048
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,680
feel free to ask.

1049
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,320
I'll answer honestly.

1050
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,400
Fu

1051
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,040
seems pretty honest and reliable.

1052
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,720
Looks like a decent guy.

1053
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,120
He's not bad.

1054
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,720
Alright then.

1055
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,800
But your aunt warned me:

1056
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,920
when people

1057
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,800
come back from abroad,

1058
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,200
everything here in China

1059
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,320
seems

1060
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,520
tempting to them.

1061
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,960
So your dad

1062
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,840
wants to have a word with him.

1063
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,640
Just a reminder.

1064
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,760
See,

1065
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,320
you've been in Canada

1066
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,720
for so many years,

1067
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,280
and you're a PhD,

1068
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,720
educated from a top university.

1069
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,520
You must have

1070
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,520
a global perspective,

1071
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,840
right?

1072
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,480
No, you're too kind.

1073
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
I just studied abroad

1074
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,920
for a few years.

1075
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,360
You're too modest.

1076
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,680
I'd like

1077
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
to discuss something with you.

1078
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,720
Go ahead.

1079
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,320
How about

1080
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,520
we talk about oil?

1081
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,080
Oil.

1082
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,560
I mean the kind used as fuel.

1083
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,080
[It's getting warm globally.]

1084
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,080
Oil?

1085
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,360
[It's getting worse.]

1086
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,080
[So I think we should]

1087
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,920
[talk about how to]

1088
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,840
[save these non-renewable resources.]

1089
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,760
[Oil]

1090
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,960
[is a kind of...]

1091
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,400
How are you so off-topic?

1092
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,280
Why are you talking about oil?

1093
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,200
Leave it to the UN.

1094
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,680
Just go to sleep first.

1095
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,280
Okay, dad?

1096
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,880
We're dealing with jet lag here.

1097
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,280
I don't really know

1098
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,440
the situation over there.

1099
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,040
Oh.

1100
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,000
[Hurry up, Fu Yudong.]

1101
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,960
[Come back and sleep.]

1102
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,720
Okay, okay.

1103
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,480
Go sleep.

1104
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,720
You go to sleep first.

1105
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,080
Fu,

1106
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,360
tomorrow we'll continue.

1107
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,720
Sure.

1108
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,960
Let's sleep.

1109
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,480
You all rest early then.

1110
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,280
Mentioned anything important?

1111
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,240
What important stuff?

1112
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,440
Dad's so adorable.

1113
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,480
The biggest regret

1114
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,000
of my dad's life

1115
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,200
is that he never got to work with oil.

1116
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,720
I can't believe him.

1117
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,720
Time to sleep.

1118
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,840
Where's my phone? Need to charge it.

1119
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,360
Here.

1120
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,760
This quilt's perfect,

1121
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,240
just the right thickness.

1122
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,720
That other one was way too thick.

1123
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,440
Charger.

1124
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,600
I'll dig it out of the suitcase.

1125
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,280
I'll get it.

1126
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,240
In the small one.

1127
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,280
The small carry-on.

1128
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,120
In the small one.

1129
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,880
Yeah, here it is.

1130
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,920
Right side?

1131
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,920
Yes, that's it.

1132
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,520
Type-C connector.

1133
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,920
Welcome to my home!

1134
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,080
Glad to be here!

1135
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,080
When your mom came in earlier,

1136
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,840
she scared me.

1137
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,480
Scared of what?

1138
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,400
You didn't even warn me.

1139
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,680
I was wearing big shorts.

1140
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,040
What's wrong with that?

1141
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,400
First time at your house,

1142
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,280
and I'm in big shorts.

1143
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,360
You weren't wearing underwear.

1144
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:35,960
What's the big deal?

1145
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,840
What's so impolite about it?

1146
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,760
From now on, you'll have to

1147
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,880
wear big shorts at home every day.

1148
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,720
Tomorrow I'll wear them with you.

1149
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,680
I'll wear big shorts too.

1150
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,720
Let's go.

1151
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,920
Let's go.

1152
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,840
This isn't good. Stop.

1153
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
Fu Yudong, you're something else.

1154
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,320
Every day the most you say

1155
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,200
is "stop".

1156
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,760
Stop.

1157
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,480
Honey...

1158
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,000
Zhang Ran...

1159
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,360
Look.

1160
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,480
What are those two doing?

1161
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,920
Personal shopper.

1162
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:25,719
How could

1163
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,320
he possibly be a PhD?

1164
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,360
What executive?

1165
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,679
He doesn't look like one at all.

1166
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:31,920
Oh my...

1167
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,480
I'll call your eldest sister.

1168
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Don't call.

1169
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,840
What if they don't know?

1170
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,159
That would be so awkward.

1171
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,920
Wait, does my sister know

1172
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,480
her daughter is a personal shopper?

1173
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,159
If she does, calling her would be awkward.

1174
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,760
So, we just pretend we don't know?

1175
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,960
Why are you so happy about this?

1176
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:53,719
Oh my...

1177
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,120
Oh, Ran.

1178
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,280
That's too much!

1179
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,640
This is too ridiculous.

1180
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,040
It's not here.

1181
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,400
These are all just blankets.

1182
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,360
Mom.

1183
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:08,560
Mom.

1184
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,480
[What's wrong?]

1185
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,560
It's not here either.

1186
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,800
Where's the bag?

1187
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,320
[Didn't I tell you?]

1188
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,080
[It's in the middle compartment up top.]

1189
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,920
This compartment is all blankets.

1190
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,080
[How did it end up with the blankets?]

1191
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,720
[How did it get...]

1192
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,800
There's nothing back here either.

1193
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,640
It's all empty.

1194
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,400
Honey,

1195
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,920
is this the middle?

1196
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,880
There's one over here.

1197
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,840
Is this the middle?

1198
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,160
What's this?

1199
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,360
Isn't this...

1200
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,680
You're amazing.

1201
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,920
That's the middle left compartment.

1202
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,520
In the red one over there.

1203
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,760
Which red one?

1204
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:37,920
This one?

1205
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,400
Yes. Right there.

1206
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,400
I thought you gave it away.

1207
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,160
No one wanted that.

1208
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,240
It is so useless.

1209
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,800
It's heavy itself,

1210
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,280
can't hold much anyway.

1211
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,840
With this much stuff

1212
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,000
in the cabinet,

1213
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,080
how can you find anything?

1214
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,880
Great. Thank you.

1215
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,640
You're welcome.

1216
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,640
[She's about to give birth soon, right?]

1217
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,440
[For this child,]

1218
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,720
[she's given up quite a lot.]

1219
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,400
[Yes.]

1220
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,160
[Exactly.]

1221
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,080
That's impressive.

1222
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,560
Come on.

1223
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
Mr. Chen, want more?

1224
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,360
Good.

1225
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,000
Look at Zhang,

1226
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:25,960
she did great.

1227
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,520
Right.

1228
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,560
Calm under pressure.

1229
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,520
[I think]

1230
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,840
[with proper training,]

1231
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,480
[in the future,]

1232
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,840
[she won't be any worse than Lin Fei.]

1233
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:32,720
[Mr. Chen,]

1234
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,440
[you can't praise young people to their face.]

1235
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,160
They need more training

1236
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,760
and experience now.

1237
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,960
Give them space to showcase,

1238
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,840
and in the future

1239
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,960
they won't bring shame to our station.

1240
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,680
Right?

1241
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,920
That makes sense.

1242
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,200
Full again.

1243
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,520
Mr. Chen,

1244
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,000
let me toast you.

1245
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,520
Good.

1246
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,520
Thank you for your

1247
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,680
continued guidance and support.

1248
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,120
I'll work twice as hard

1249
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,960
to repay your support.

1250
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,560
Thank you.

1251
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,080
Excellent, excellent.

1252
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,960
Thank you.

1253
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,720
I'll drink with you.

1254
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,160
Thank you.

1255
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,960
Mr. Zhou's worked hard too.

1256
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,400
You're looking better and better.

1257
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,600
Mr. Chen,

1258
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,120
did you see

1259
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,120
the program innovation proposal

1260
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,880
I sent you last time?

1261
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,640
If there's anything not good about it,

1262
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,200
just tell me,

1263
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,320
I'll revise it right away.

1264
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,160
Zhang,

1265
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,920
you just became a host,

1266
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
don't be

1267
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,080
too ambitious.

1268
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,560
Alright, alright...

1269
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,280
I mainly think that

1270
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,320
finance programs

1271
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,080
sometimes

1272
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,200
have too much homogenization.

1273
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,920
If we innovate a bit,

1274
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,600
it might feel fresh

1275
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
to some viewers

1276
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,400
and

1277
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,320
possibly attract new audiences too.

1278
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,960
Proposals are just words on paper.

1279
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
People are what matter.

1280
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,240
Zhang,

1281
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,680
why don't you elaborate

1282
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,280
on your ideas?

1283
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,200
Sure.

1284
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,760
No.

1285
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,320
We agreed today

1286
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,160
we're drinking

1287
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,480
to relax, right?

1288
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,240
If you start elaborating,

1289
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,960
won't that put pressure on the leadership?

1290
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,560
Right.

1291
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,320
No elaborating.

1292
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,320
No elaborating.

1293
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,800
I'll drink a penalty.

1294
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,920
My bad.

1295
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,320
Come on.

1296
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,760
Right.

1297
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,720
I didn't expect...

1298
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,440
Actually just now,

1299
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,480
I had no intention of overstepping.

1300
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,840
For my proposal...

1301
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,800
Since I'm still a newbie,

1302
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,560
I really hope you can

1303
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,000
give me more feedback.

1304
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,440
That way I can improve it

1305
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,800
and make our program

1306
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
even better,

1307
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,680
more appealing to young audiences.

1308
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,680
Actually, I think

1309
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,160
other programs

1310
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,000
could

1311
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,800
apply

1312
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,240
your new proposal.

1313
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,760
Right?

1314
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,240
Right?

1315
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,800
Mr. Jiang,

1316
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,360
I wrote this proposal.

1317
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,280
If it goes to someone else,

1318
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,800
wouldn't that be inappropriate?

1319
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,640
Zhang, you're part of the station.

1320
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,760
[You need to have the big picture.]

1321
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,880
[You need to be open-minded]

1322
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,600
[and know what's more important.]

1323
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,720
[For your dreams,]

1324
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,200
[you need to have a spirit of sacrifice.]

1325
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,600
[When was this decided?]

1326
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,360
I'm done with my resignation letter.

1327
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,160
What I wanted was

1328
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,360
to let you know

1329
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,400
before submitting it.

1330
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:09,720
I'm asking you

1331
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,240
when you decided this.

1332
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,920
You've given so much,

1333
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,240
and now you want to leave,

1334
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,280
the timing isn't right.

1335
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,120
It's all the same.

1336
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,560
I'll leave sooner or later anyway.

1337
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:02,920
Ran,

1338
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,520
why do you like tigers so much?
