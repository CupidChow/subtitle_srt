1
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,800
Brighten up!

2
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,080
You've been down

3
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,039
since the interview.

4
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,520
Cheer up!

5
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,840
Fruit?

6
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,280
Yeah, the amusement park's

7
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,040
having a family event

8
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,080
on Children's Day.

9
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,840
Want to go?

10
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,520
Could be fun!

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,600
Nian's dying to, alright?

12
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,040
Dude, June 1st?

13
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,880
Gonna be crazy hot and packed!

14
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,480
- Check this out.
- You take Nian.

15
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,280
The thought alone makes me cringe...

16
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,360
Just take a look.

17
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,480
We'll be packed like sardines,

18
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,960
- seriously.
- Please, just look?

19
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,360
Plus,

20
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,720
with Nian's condition...

21
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,320
[Special Family Event!]

22
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,280
[Grand Opening!]

23
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,840
[Join the fun...]

24
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,920
You know what? We should go.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,520
Good character building.

26
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
So that's a yes?

27
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,640
Absolutely!

28
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,640
Look at all these people!

29
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
Well,

30
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,240
it is Children's Day!

31
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,800
Gates are open!

32
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,560
C'mon, let's go!

33
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,880
No need to rush.

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,840
Enter later?

35
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,520
Yeah,

36
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,480
till this mob thins out.

37
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,560
No point

38
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,720
getting crushed in this heat.

39
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,000
Good to go now?

40
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,120
Yeah, yeah, looking better.

41
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:20,920
Hey,

42
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,720
maybe take Nian

43
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,560
to the bathroom first?

44
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
It'll be

45
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,160
a nightmare inside.

46
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,200
This one seems OK.

47
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,440
Nian, bathroom?

48
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,280
Go.

49
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,560
Excuse us.

50
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,240
Pretty packed today.

51
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,200
Yeah, Mr. Xing.

52
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,600
Our marketing

53
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,480
really

54
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,320
did the trick.

55
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,240
Mr. Xiao,

56
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,000
great job running this place!

57
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,280
Mr. Xing!

58
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,600
Mr. Xing!

59
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,240
Someone's calling you.

60
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,600
Remember me? Li Daoqi,

61
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,960
dropped by with Dong the other day?

62
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,480
Ah! With Dr. Fu,

63
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,400
- the guy from overseas?
- Yeah!

64
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,680
You guys with the

65
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,480
makeup brand pitch?

66
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,200
Yep, that's us!

67
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,320
You here to

68
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,480
check things out too?

69
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, just unwinding.

70
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,560
Spending the holiday

71
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,360
with my wife

72
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,240
and kid.

73
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
Talk about luck!

74
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,000
Indeed. Let's go.

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,520
OK.

76
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,240
We're heading in.

77
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,880
Sir, public entrance is that way.

78
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,840
Oh, but I'm...

79
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,760
He's with us.

80
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,320
Got it.

81
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,520
Where're you off to?

82
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,040
[Bumped into someone.]

83
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,200
[See you inside.]

84
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,920
[Gotta run!]

85
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,480
Hey?

86
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,760
Hey!

87
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Nian, let's go.

88
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,240
Wasn't this planned?

89
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,880
Just an influencer doing a dance.

90
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,400
Folks!

91
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,560
Pardon us!

92
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,640
Coming through!

93
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,320
Hey, heads up,

94
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,680
The Dreamland's swamped.

95
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,480
Take Nian to

96
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
Rainbow Playland,

97
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,280
catch you there.

98
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,880
Mr. Xing, we got an influencer

99
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,000
doing promo for the opening day.

100
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,320
Let's check that out.

101
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,040
You got it.

102
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,400
What a coincidence!

103
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,760
Could've totally

104
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,440
missed each other.

105
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,080
Right?

106
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,680
Yeah!

107
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,040
Amazing, huh?

108
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,040
Must be fate.

109
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,520
Yeah, fate.

110
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,120
C'mon,

111
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,400
excuse us, kids.

112
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,280
Hey kids.

113
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,480
Please.

114
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,960
Mr. Xiao,

115
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,440
can't slack on

116
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,720
those safety checks!

117
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,240
No worries,

118
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,480
we're on top of it.

119
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:15,920
Good.

120
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,240
Are you doing an inspection?

121
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,720
Cuz I got shares in this place.

122
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,360
Yep,

123
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,200
he's our biggest investor.

124
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,080
Quite an empire you've built!

125
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,880
Oh no, not for me.

126
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,480
Makes

127
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,720
my stomach turn.

128
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,360
Heights freak me out.

129
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,800
Heights get you?

130
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,760
Yeah.

131
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,040
See,

132
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,480
that's your

133
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
weak spot.

134
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
You know,

135
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,360
business is

136
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,640
much like

137
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,520
this roller coaster.

138
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,240
Totally.

139
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,000
Can't let fear hold you back!

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,600
Right.

141
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,640
Wanna do business with me?

142
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,640
Face your fears first!

143
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,840
Let's show him!

144
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,560
You got it.

145
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,480
This way in?

146
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah.

147
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,240
I was kidding, Mr. Xing!

148
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,040
As if someone tall as me

149
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,520
would fear heights!

150
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,240
I'm in!

151
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,160
You sure?

152
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,920
Yeah,

153
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,960
all in!

154
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,200
Don't be a hero.

155
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
If you can't,

156
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,520
just say so.

157
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,120
No, really.

158
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,960
Don't push it.

159
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,920
I got this, let's roll.

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,440
Really?

161
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,280
Yeah, let's do it.

162
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,400
- Go!
- Good!

163
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,520
That thing goes upside down?

164
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,000
Uh-huh.

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,480
Yeah.

166
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,800
C'mon, Daoqi!

167
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,640
Daoqi, VIP line! Go!

168
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,960
Gotta take this call...

169
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,040
Real quick.

170
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,800
Hurry up!

171
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,440
OK.

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,880
Let's go!

173
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,320
OK, OK.

174
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,760
A for effort!

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,360
Daoqi, I saw that.

176
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,920
You should

177
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,800
sit this one out.

178
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,080
No way, Mr. Xing!

179
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,560
I'm so going!

180
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,280
I'm good.

181
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,640
Just had to

182
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,800
clear the system.

183
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,320
Good to go now!

184
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,080
You sure?

185
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,480
Totally!

186
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,440
Onwards to glory!

187
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,960
Mr. Xing!

188
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,560
Gonna puke again!

189
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,960
Heads up, Mr. Xing!

190
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,840
Where'd all that

191
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,680
come from?

192
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,920
Thought you were empty!

193
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,360
Guess that was yesterday's dinner.

194
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm so sorry,

195
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,040
really really sorry.

196
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,600
Sorry.

197
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,000
You got me good,

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,280
but a deal's a deal.

199
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,760
On Monday, bring your PhD buddy

200
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,360
to my office.

201
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,280
We'll talk business.

202
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,200
Keep your distance!

203
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,520
Don't want

204
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,840
round two!

205
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,400
Sorry about that, Mr. Xing!

206
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,600
Monday then!

207
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,160
Yeah, see you on Monday.

208
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,880
[Cool.]

209
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,320
Really sorry, Mr. Xing!

210
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,360
[No worries!]

211
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,480
Should've

212
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,520
skipped breakfast.

213
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,640
Hey everyone,

214
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,680
check out

215
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,360
many new themes...

216
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,600
Heading out now?

217
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,640
Got fireworks tonight,

218
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
you know?

219
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,800
How about it, Nian?

220
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,640
Nian,

221
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,120
we got up early,

222
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,440
played all day.

223
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,000
Mommy will

224
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,480
bring you back

225
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,040
another time for fireworks,

226
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,760
OK?

227
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,360
Leaving now?

228
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,480
Hey, you know,

229
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,640
it's my lucky day today!

230
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,200
Feel like things are

231
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,760
finally going my way.

232
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,240
Once this works out,

233
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,000
I'll share everything with you.

234
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,800
Just one look?

235
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,120
Heard it's amazing.

236
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,040
Really leaving?

237
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,600
I want to see it!

238
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,440
Ms. Zhao, dog walking?

239
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,120
Dong,

240
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,000
grabbing breakfast?

241
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,800
Uncle Li.

242
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,960
Got a favor

243
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,480
to ask.

244
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:08,880
What's up?

245
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,960
Washing machine's broken.

246
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,000
Can you

247
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,160
take a look today?

248
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,440
I've resigned.

249
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,160
Not with ProFix anymore.

250
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,480
You...resigned?

251
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,680
Gonna start something with a friend.

252
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,880
Getting back

253
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,080
to chemistry, my old field.

254
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,560
Wonderful!

255
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,320
Fixing stuff was

256
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,640
wasting your talent.

257
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,600
Nah.

258
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,240
Congrats!

259
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,360
Good luck!

260
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,000
Thanks!

261
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,080
Uncle Li,

262
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,560
playing chess

263
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,080
in this rain?

264
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,600
Better than sitting at home!

265
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,120
Check!

266
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,720
OK.

267
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,520
Just let us know

268
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,840
when you're

269
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,760
coming late

270
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,280
or leaving early.

271
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,560
You were snoring away

272
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,120
when she was back in the dead of night.

273
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,240
I heard her.

274
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,080
Hey, the company's

275
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,440
finally seeing my worth.

276
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,040
Big meeting last night,

277
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,960
the whole room talking about

278
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,160
my future.

279
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:05,960
For real.

280
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,440
Another stream?

281
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,280
Yeah, that was before...

282
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,080
When did you stream?

283
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,760
Didn't catch it?

284
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,920
Never told us.

285
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll...give a like.

286
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,840
No need,

287
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,880
c'mon, let's eat first.

288
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,240
Mom, Dad, I'm back!

289
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,040
Just eat,

290
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,080
one like won't make a difference.

291
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,600
Up already?

292
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,920
Was gonna

293
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,960
work out

294
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,000
but got rained out.

295
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,880
Grabbed some

296
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,680
buns and

297
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,840
meat swallow wontons instead.

298
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,040
Quite a downpour.

299
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,760
About that stream,

300
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,120
you didn't finish.

301
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,080
What was it about?

302
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh,

303
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,720
nothing much,

304
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,640
just regular stuff,

305
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,680
same stuff,

306
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,160
you know?

307
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,160
Stream? You streamed?

308
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,200
Missed it?

309
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,440
Too busy.

310
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,480
Skip it,

311
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,640
it's nothing.

312
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,720
Eat up.

313
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,240
Let me.

314
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,120
Still in elevator, already here.

315
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,920
Morning, Ran!

316
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,840
Morning.

317
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,640
Ran, morning.

318
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,200
Morning.

319
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,280
Morning, Ran.

320
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,400
Morning.

321
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,960
Ran, morning.

322
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,680
Morning.

323
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,600
Morning, Ran.

324
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,560
Morning.

325
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,880
Everyone's acting super weird.

326
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,840
Ran.

327
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,560
C'mon.

328
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,880
What's up? I'm on time.

329
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,400
What's the rush?

330
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,000
Move it!

331
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
- Morning, Ran.
- Morning.

332
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,840
Over here.

333
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,800
What's all this?

334
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,680
Ms. Qian's waiting.

335
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll take your bag.

336
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,520
Hey.

337
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,200
Look for me?

338
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,000
- Here!
- Ran.

339
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,360
Good, talking about you.

340
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,240
We chopped up your

341
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,920
"Little White Sail"

342
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,680
from yesterday,

343
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,720
spread it

344
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,400
across

345
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,480
other accounts.

346
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,960
Totally blew up.

347
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,000
You made clips?

348
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's killing it!

349
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,600
I just wrapped up a plan.

350
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,800
Yeah, show her.

351
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,320
Roger!

352
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,480
OK, now, let me share with you

353
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,200
this proposal I just finished,

354
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,680
"The Desperation Series".

355
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,520
Look,

356
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,480
your stream

357
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
was fire yesterday, right?

358
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,000
You went viral as

359
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,760
the "Desperate Personal Shopper",

360
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,760
so we propose

361
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,280
expanding

362
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
this concept.

363
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,600
"Desperate Housewife",

364
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
"Desperate Kitchen",

365
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,400
"Desperate Daughter",

366
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,640
"Desperate Mom",

367
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,560
"Desperate Employee".

368
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,200
Yeah? How desperate is it?

369
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,520
Super desperate!

370
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,000
See, right?

371
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,920
I'll go all desperate!

372
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,080
[This rice dude]

373
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,200
[sounds shady,]

374
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,360
[like a pickup artist.]

375
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,480
[Yep.]

376
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,120
[Got hooked by his]

377
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,680
[bowl]

378
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,640
[of rice.]

379
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,760
[Times were]

380
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,080
[tough then,]

381
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,880
[so I got into overseas shopping.]

382
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,960
[Real talk, I was all about]

383
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,720
[status back then...]

384
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,680
Zhang Ran,

385
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,000
I saw that clip.

386
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,600
What were you thinking?

387
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,000
How's Dong

388
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,040
gonna feel?

389
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,400
[A good thing.]

390
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,360
[Your mom hasn't seen it,]

391
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,200
[or]

392
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,960
[all hell would break loose.]

393
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,200
[You just can't...]

394
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,800
What're you doing?

395
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,920
Taking a piss...

396
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,000
Piss?

397
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,440
Why're you on the tub?

398
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,160
Just done.

399
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,760
[He turned rice]

400
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,480
[into a cake,]

401
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,000
[drew a candle]

402
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,080
[and put it on top,]

403
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,880
[let me wish on it.]

404
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,520
[Just rice?]

405
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,560
[That's all it took?]

406
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,360
[This rice dude sounds]

407
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,560
[shady, like a pickup artist.]

408
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,680
[Yep.]

409
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,960
[Got hooked by his]

410
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,320
[bowl of rice.]

411
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,920
Gentlemen,

412
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,520
- Mr. Xing's ready.
- [Times were]

413
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,320
- OK.
- [tough then,]

414
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,120
[So I got into overseas shopping.]

415
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,080
[Real talk, I was all about...]

416
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,560
Stop watching! Let's go!

417
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,040
C'mon!

418
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,760
Move it!

419
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,720
Mr. Xing, didn't know

420
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,280
you were into football.

421
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,880
We often do soccer games

422
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,800
for team building.

423
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,560
Join us

424
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,080
if you're into it.

425
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,480
OK.

426
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,520
Cool.

427
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,720
Dr. Fu should come too.

428
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,560
Guess Dr. Fu

429
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,600
doesn't like football, huh?

430
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,360
Mr. Li,

431
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,160
let's talk business.

432
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,560
Mr. Li!

433
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,320
Right, business.

434
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,960
Yeah, that proposal

435
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,440
I've worked on...

436
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,880
Look, Mr. Li,

437
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,720
I've told you,

438
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
I'm just not into

439
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,080
that proposal.

440
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,760
Buying

441
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,560
cosmetic brands?

442
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,560
It won't fly.

443
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,280
I'll explain why.

444
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,280
First,

445
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,120
our research shows that

446
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,600
today's consumers,

447
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,440
especially in domestic skincare,

448
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,400
prefer

449
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,120
fresh concepts and new brands,

450
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,320
instead of

451
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,520
old ones.

452
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,480
Second,

453
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,880
buying a factory?

454
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,360
That's heavy assets, man.

455
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,120
It goes totally against

456
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,800
my investment style.

457
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,520
It's not just about the factory,

458
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,320
I'm after

459
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,720
all the formulas too.

460
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,360
Hold it, hold it.

461
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,080
I know tons of

462
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,960
OEM factories.

463
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,880
I can get any formula I want.

464
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,360
Hyaluronic acid,

465
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,400
retinol,

466
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,440
hexapeptide,

467
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,000
whatever's hot.

468
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,120
Why would I

469
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,000
waste money on old formulas

470
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,760
from a dying factory?

471
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,680
Yeah...

472
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,800
You're right...

473
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,760
So why did you

474
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,480
call us in today...

475
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,760
Got a new project

476
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,400
to talk about. Sit.

477
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,720
Daoqi, I know

478
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,440
you're

479
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,120
scared of heights,

480
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,320
but you still

481
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,120
rode coasters with me.

482
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,560
Know what that means?

483
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,960
What does it mean?

484
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,280
It means you've got guts,

485
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,200
drive. I like that.

486
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,640
And Dr. Fu,

487
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,240
like I said before,

488
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,640
everything about you,

489
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,560
your whole story, fascinating!

490
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,960
If you guys are in,

491
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,319
I'll back you.

492
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,079
Let's launch

493
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,400
a new cosmetics brand.

494
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,599
We'll call it

495
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,319
"Dr. Fu"!

496
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,560
Top school, overseas PhD,

497
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,600
ten-year experience of developing

498
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,120
products

499
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,840
for big cosmetics companies!

500
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,240
Just look at you, Dr. Fu!

501
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,080
With your good looks,

502
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,320
you're perfect

503
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,480
to be the face

504
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,320
of your own brand!

505
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
You're a walking brand.

506
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,160
Mr. Xing, I told you that

507
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,880
I don't have

508
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,200
ten years of R&D experience,

509
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,160
just ten years in renovation.

510
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,040
That's exactly what I want.

511
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,040
You kept a low profile abroad,

512
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,200
clean record.

513
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,160
You're perfect for packaging.

514
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,440
Isn't that fraud?

515
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,040
How?

516
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,080
You can't put it that way.

517
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,960
Product marketing is just storytelling.

518
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,240
Haven't you heard?

519
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,240
Wait.

520
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,120
Hold on.

521
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,400
Mr. Xing,

522
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,520
what I really want to know is

523
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,160
how

524
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,400
exactly do you want to

525
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,760
work with us?

526
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,680
I'm inviting you

527
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,280
to join our company

528
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,680
and work with us.

529
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,640
But the company's partners

530
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,160
are me and Dr. Fu.

531
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,680
I fund it, he's the image.

532
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,080
What about me?

533
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,120
Am I just supposed to

534
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,320
go along with this risky ride?

535
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,360
How is it a risky ride?

536
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,640
You provide the labor.

537
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,040
Labor?

538
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,880
Money, image, labor.

539
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,280
I think it's worth discussing.

540
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,240
On the way,

541
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,160
let's talk it over.

542
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,480
What's wrong? Let's go.

543
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,840
I just remembered

544
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,640
I have something to do.

545
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,280
What is it?

546
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,440
Get in, I'll give you a ride.

547
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,400
No need, I'll walk.

548
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,400
What's wrong?

549
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,640
If you don't like Xing Kai,

550
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,200
many other investors are waiting for us.

551
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,040
Besides, I felt like

552
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,920
Xing Kai really appreciates you.

553
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,760
I don't think it's me he appreciates.

554
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,560
Drive carefully!

555
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,520
Is this the doctor's pride

556
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
acting up again?

557
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,280
I don't get it.

558
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,120
Dad.

559
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,720
Mom.

560
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,240
Fu Yudong!

561
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,160
Why are you selecting pots?

562
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,440
We haven't bought half the stuff yet.

563
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,360
Let's go, hurry up.

564
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,920
Your mom asked for it.

565
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,440
She sent photos to the group chat.

566
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,920
This cast iron pot

567
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,680
is expensive, heavy, and impractical.

568
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,280
If you buy it,

569
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,920
I won't even know where to put it.

570
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,640
You'd have to oil it daily.

571
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,360
It'll just gather dust.

572
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,680
Amanda.

573
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,520
Happy birthday.

574
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,480
I think my birthday was last month.

575
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,400
I know.

576
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,840
The thing is, I was busy.

577
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,480
So this is to make up for it.

578
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,760
Open it and take a look.

579
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,560
So?

580
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,640
Do you like it?

581
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,880
It's beautiful.

582
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,040
Thank you.

583
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,720
But actually,

584
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,080
you keep giving me

585
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,720
all these expensive jewels,

586
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,360
but I never get to wear them.

587
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,200
So...

588
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,360
I hope that

589
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,280
next time you give me something,

590
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,120
it's something

591
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,800
I can actually wear.

592
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,800
Actually,

593
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
I told you a long time ago.

594
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,600
I really don't have

595
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,080
any plans to get married again.

596
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,960
I've waited for you for eight years.

597
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,480
I know.

598
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,840
But it's just

599
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,920
a piece of paper.

600
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,920
What does it even mean?

601
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,200
It makes no difference to me.

602
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,640
What matters most

603
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,760
is when we're together,

604
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,160
we feel happy,

605
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,480
and joyful.

606
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,920
Isn't that good?

607
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,840
I really hope

608
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,160
we can just keep

609
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,640
being happy.

610
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,040
Don't you think?

611
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,800
I already told you

612
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,200
this is my job!

613
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,160
Why can't you understand?

614
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,600
How am I supposed to?

615
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,360
We all need to save face.

616
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,360
You're shameless,

617
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,960
but I have to

618
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,960
save mine.

619
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,880
How am I shameless?

620
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,200
You're being so harsh!

621
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,400
Did I break the law?

622
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,640
What did I do?

623
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,880
What more do you want?

624
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,800
I'm talking about myself,

625
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,840
not you!

626
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,680
Were you born in a rock?

627
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,560
Aren't you my daughter?

628
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,680
Everyone at the sugar factory knows

629
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,240
my daughter is Zhang Ran!

630
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,680
You're so amazing!

631
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,920
I don't know what kind of daughter

632
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,760
you wanted to raise!

633
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,400
I don't get it!

634
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,600
Should I just move out?

635
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,360
Here you go again!

636
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,120
Are you trying to scare me?

637
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,560
This never ends!

638
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,400
You're in a little safe haven.

639
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,800
Dad.

640
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,600
I can't outargue you.

641
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,640
You're the OG at this!

642
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,040
I saw that livestream.

643
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,240
It hasn't been easy for you.

644
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,400
As the old saying goes...

645
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,920
A man needs to know

646
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,880
when to give and take.

647
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,880
I totally get you.

648
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,280
Thanks, Dad.

649
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,960
I saw you checking flights earlier.

650
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,160
Are you going back to Canada?

651
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,560
The renovation crew in Canada

652
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,240
has a project that needs me.

653
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,200
I'm thinking of going back.

654
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,160
So you'll be living apart?

655
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,560
Don't follow your aunt

656
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,800
and uncle's example!

657
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,680
Even the best couples,

658
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,120
if they can't see each other all year,

659
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,040
are bound to fall apart!

660
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,400
Dad,

661
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,640
I'll just go for a few months.

662
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,320
If you go back alone,

663
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,720
does Ran agree?

664
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,360
She...

665
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,520
She should be okay with it.

666
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,800
The main thing is, I'm here

667
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,040
but I can't really do much.

668
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,160
I just end up in the way.

669
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,600
If I go to Canada,

670
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
at least I can

671
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,520
make some money.

672
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,800
And if Zhang Ran

673
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,080
runs into any problems,

674
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,360
I can at least have her back.

675
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,480
That makes sense,

676
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,520
but you must

677
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,640
talk it through with Ran.

678
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,320
Think it over.

679
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,520
For married couples,

680
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,400
if you can avoid living apart,

681
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,480
definitely don't do it!

682
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,360
Zhang Jianbin!

683
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,480
Get over here!

684
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,640
Dad, I'll go.

685
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,480
Anyone who goes is in trouble.

686
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,920
What?

687
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:01,960
What?

688
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,080
Get out, I need to go in.

689
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,000
I was here first!

690
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,280
Let me in.

691
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,600
Hurry.

692
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,480
You're...

693
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:09,880
Hurry!

694
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,400
I...

695
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,320
Fu Yudong!

696
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,600
I'm here.

697
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,960
Zhang Jianbin,

698
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,800
I don't think you can stay there all day!

699
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,440
About the video clip,

700
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,920
let me explain.

701
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,760
I heard everything.

702
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,840
It's all for work.

703
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,560
That day, actually,

704
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,640
during my livestream,

705
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,160
Yuan Yuan burst in.

706
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,120
It's fine.

707
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,680
I understand.

708
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,240
I didn't take it seriously.

709
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,120
Actually, I wanted

710
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,800
to discuss with you...

711
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,760
I

712
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,640
want to go back to Canada.

713
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,640
The thing is, being here,

714
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,600
I feel like right now

715
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,760
I don't have much to do.

716
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,560
If I go to Canada,

717
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,200
at least I can make some money.

718
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,280
Can you stay?

719
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,200
What could I even do?

720
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,760
Give it some more thought.

721
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,120
By the way,

722
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,520
why did you suddenly

723
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,520
come to Lucheng?

724
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,280
I remember

725
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,560
you don't have business here.

726
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,400
I don't.

727
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,720
Can't I just come see you for dinner?

728
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,400
When are you leaving?

729
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,280
Do you remember the time

730
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,360
in Norway,

731
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,880
when we went fishing?

732
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,680
I remember

733
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,000
we had the captain catch the fish

734
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,560
and cook it for you right away.

735
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,600
I'm sure you remember

736
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,240
how that fish tasted.

737
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,520
I do.

738
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,320
Of course I do.

739
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,880
So if I get the chance,

740
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,280
I plan to take my husband

741
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,240
and child

742
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,440
back to Norway.

743
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
Do you remember

744
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,880
John Singer Sargent?

745
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,800
He has an exhibition in Boston.

746
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Are you going to see it?

747
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,360
Now most of my time

748
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,320
is spent on my child.

749
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,120
The paintings I see most

750
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,960
are my son's.

751
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,440
My life's

752
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,840
changed.

753
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,360
Are you happy now?

754
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,240
Are you content?

755
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,640
Is this what you've

756
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,680
been chasing for?

757
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,120
Do you think I'm unhappy?

758
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,960
I'm very happy.

759
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,200
This life

760
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,640
is exactly what I've always

761
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,800
wanted.

762
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,600
Is it good?

763
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,520
It is.

764
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,280
These baby carrots are pretty sweet.

765
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,760
Delicious.

766
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,640
By the way,

767
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,040
do you need a ride home?

768
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,560
After all, we all drank.

769
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,640
We live pretty close.

770
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,000
We can walk or take a cab.

771
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,080
You're still the same.

772
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,560
When you go out to eat and drink,

773
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,680
you don't drive.

774
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,600
Oh,

775
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,120
your agent told me you helped him

776
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,480
at his company,

777
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,840
with real estate development.

778
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,280
He said he gave you

779
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,160
a great deal.

780
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,400
I didn't go through him to buy my house.

781
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,400
I know.

782
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,760
You go ahead.

783
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,680
We'll take some pictures.

784
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,320
Nice to meet you.

785
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:20,960
You too.

786
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,560
Take care.

787
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,440
Let's take a photo.

788
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
Let's take some photos.

789
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,440
Photo, okay!

790
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,680
Here.

791
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,440
Let's...

792
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,320
Go home.

793
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,679
Daoqi,

794
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,400
how we are now

795
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,320
is really great.

796
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,239
We have food and drink,

797
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,920
our life is secure.

798
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,560
Nian's recent test scores

799
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,639
have been improving.

800
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,199
Really?

801
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,280
Now we both have time

802
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,920
to spend more with him at home.

803
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,679
He'll definitely get better.

804
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,600
Daoqi,

805
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,280
I've always hoped for

806
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,840
a home of my own.

807
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm glad I met you.

808
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,040
Me too.

809
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,040
Really.

810
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,600
Me too.

811
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,719
Don't worry.

812
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,760
Things will get better.

813
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,920
Trust me.

814
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,800
Only better.

815
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,760
What's with you today?

816
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,680
You seem off.

817
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,720
Nothing, I'm fine.

818
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,720
Then why are you spacing out?

819
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,800
Cheng Man and I

820
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,960
had dinner with her ex.

821
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,280
Who?

822
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,920
Cheng Man's ex.

823
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,960
Did you know about him before?

824
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,120
I did, but I'd never met him.

825
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,720
It's the first time.

826
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,600
Not what I expected.

827
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,400
I thought he'd be a nouveau riche.

828
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,360
He's not.

829
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,800
He's polite.

830
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,600
Gracious.

831
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
Knows his limits.

832
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,440
Refined.

833
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
Charismatic.

834
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,560
He seemed

835
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,280
pretty comfortable to be around.

836
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,760
Listening to them talk,

837
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,560
for ages,

838
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,520
I only caught half of it.

839
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,040
At first it felt awkward,

840
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,520
but then I just sat there

841
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
listening to them chat.

842
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,400
As I listened,

843
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,440
I got drawn in.

844
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,480
It felt like when I was a kid

845
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
sitting in front of the TV,

846
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,720
watching Hong Kong dramas.

847
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,640
I just feel like Cheng Man and I

848
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,760
aren't from the same world.

849
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,000
Did you feel

850
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
a bit out of place?

851
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,880
Maybe.

852
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,160
Can't quite put my finger on it.

853
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,640
Here's to the odd one out!

854
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,760
I think

855
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,640
the fact that Cheng Man brought you

856
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,800
to meet her ex,

857
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,440
at least shows she's

858
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,480
being open with you.

859
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,280
Yeah.

860
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,640
So don't overthink it.

861
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:56,760
Yeah.

862
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,080
My wife is beyond reproach.

863
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,800
You know what?

864
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,840
Before Cheng Man married me,

865
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,120
she used to love skiing,

866
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,720
playing golf,

867
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,040
tennis,

868
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,480
and traveling.

869
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,640
Worldwide,

870
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,440
she's probably

871
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,600
been to half the countries.

872
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,160
After marrying me, I haven't

873
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,440
taken her abroad.

874
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,360
Not even once.

875
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,440
So tell me,

876
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,160
what does she see in me?

877
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,280
How did she end up

878
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,840
with me?

879
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,520
That's because,

880
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
in her eyes,

881
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,720
you have qualities

882
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,280
that others don't.

883
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,840
Like...

884
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,400
Like what?

885
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,160
Does it take this long?

886
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,920
Your strength is

887
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,400
you have no flaws.

888
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,280
I'm being serious here!

889
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,320
Really! In my eyes,

890
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,400
you have no flaws.

891
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,280
Otherwise,

892
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,200
why would I only hang out with you

893
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
and not anyone else?

894
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,440
I have no flaws.

895
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,520
If you put it that way...

896
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,200
I've been thinking forever

897
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,240
and I can't come up with that!

898
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,400
But if you insist,

899
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,560
I guess there's one.

900
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,760
What?

901
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,840
That you're all strengths.

902
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Yeah, really.

903
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,520
Alright.

904
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,000
Stop

905
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,880
consoling yourself.

906
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,440
Let me tell you,

907
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,600
everyone has flaws,

908
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,320
and everyone has strengths.

909
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,560
The people around you...

910
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,640
It depends on whether they see your flaws

911
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,760
or your strengths.

912
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,240
But I think Cheng Man

913
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,360
has always seen your strengths.

914
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,560
Why are you calling me?

915
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,760
Where's your beard?

916
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,200
You're pretty handsome without it.

917
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,320
I saw a plastic bag.

918
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,960
The wind blew

919
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,760
and it flew up into the sky.

920
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,680
Left, then right,

921
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,280
up, then down.

922
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
I was thinking,

923
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,720
does it know

924
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,920
that it's flying

925
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,000
because of the wind,

926
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,120
or does it think

927
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,240
it can fly on its own?

928
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,960
When the wind stops,

929
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,800
the bag falls to the ground

930
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,120
and gets stepped on.

931
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,200
Nobody cares about it,

932
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,440
because it's just a trash bag.

933
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,320
What's wrong?

934
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,920
Many people and events

935
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,480
just happen to cross paths.

936
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,520
There's no such thing as destiny.

937
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,040
Others rarely care.

938
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,920
"Going with the flow"

939
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,000
sounds nice,

940
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,240
but actually

941
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,760
it's just drifting along.

942
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,080
I think

943
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,040
the wind

944
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,280
is out of the bag's control.

945
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,080
The only thing it can control

946
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,880
is that

947
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,840
no matter how much it gets stepped on,

948
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,760
it shouldn't see itself as a trash bag.

949
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,120
That's the key.

950
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,480
In others' eyes,

951
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,720
it's just a trash bag.

952
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,920
It can hold anything.

953
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,080
Sure.

954
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,320
[But at least it should know]

955
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,240
[it's still useful.]

956
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,840
[Let me tell you something.]

957
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,320
[When are you]

958
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,360
[coming back to Canada?]

959
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,680
[If you don't come back soon,]

960
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,360
[when you're back]

961
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,360
[you won't see me here.]

962
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,440
What are you doing?

963
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,480
[I've already decided.]

964
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,120
[I'm done doing]

965
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,240
[renovations in Canada.]

966
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,760
It's meaningless to me.

967
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,400
I'm going back to filmmaking,

968
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,480
because it's

969
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,800
the only thing in my life

970
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,000
that truly makes me happy.

971
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,240
[I don't care what they think of me.]

972
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,240
[If they think]

973
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,480
[I wasn't good before,]

974
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,240
I can start over.

975
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,800
Either way, I'm going to make

976
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,840
a great film.

977
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,400
[Congratulations, Zhihao.]

978
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,200
You can be yourself again.

979
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,200
You can go do

980
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,440
what you love.

981
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,160
Just do it!

982
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,680
A while back,

983
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,960
at a secondhand market,

984
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,520
I saw a DVD player.

985
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,040
I thought about it,

986
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,520
[but I ended up buying it.]

987
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,880
[You know what I was thinking?]

988
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,880
Back then,

989
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,000
we had you, me, and the DVDs,

990
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,000
but no DVD player.

991
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,720
Now I have me, the DVDs,

992
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,720
and a DVD player,

993
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:41,920
but not you.

994
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,280
It's okay.

995
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,360
When your film

996
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,720
wins the biggest

997
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,320
international award,

998
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,800
invite me and I'll be there.

999
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,800
I'll be at the premiere!

1000
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,400
It's a deal.

1001
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,080
Alright, Zhihao.

1002
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,760
I'll let you go.

1003
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,960
Work on your script.

1004
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:08,640
Zhihao,

1005
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,640
being able to call you

1006
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,640
makes me really happy.

1007
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,520
[Getting your call]

1008
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,400
[makes me really happy too.]

1009
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:18,880
You've got this.
