1
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,759
It's over here.

2
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,600
Okay.

3
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,720
What are you doing with that hanger?

4
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,800
Take it easy.

5
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,680
[You're too far back.]

6
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
[You should lean back.]

7
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,560
[A little more.]

8
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,000
What's this hanger for?

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,160
[Why do you take that?]

10
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,280
[You'd lose face]

11
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,240
[in front of your parents]

12
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,360
[for my wrinkled suit.]

13
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,440
[Then where are]

14
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,120
[you putting it?]

15
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,520
[Economy class]

16
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,720
[passengers aren't allowed to hang it.]

17
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,240
Excuse me?

18
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,880
Excuse me?

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,520
Thank you.

20
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:28,600
See?

21
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,640
I didn't give her.

22
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,520
She took it from me.

23
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,320
[I'd say those fourteen hours]

24
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,840
[on the plane were]

25
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,520
[the most agonizing time of my life.]

26
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,400
[Unbelievable.]

27
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,400
[What an]

28
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,040
[startling coincidence:]

29
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,640
[my cousin and I]

30
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,080
[took the same flight back.]

31
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,880
[I wish I'd had this luck during all the time]

32
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,480
[I spent waiting]

33
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,440
[for my immigration visa.]

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,400
[How ironic!]

35
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,680
[Just as the saying goes:]

36
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
[when it rains,]

37
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,560
[it pours.]

38
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,840
[It's quite ridiculous.]

39
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,320
[Although we've both been in Toronto]

40
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,760
[over the past eight years,]

41
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,640
[we've only exchanged]

42
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,760
[holiday greetings]

43
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,640
[through text messages.]

44
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,760
[Fortunately,]

45
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,800
[she probably didn't notice me.]

46
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,560
[After all the sufferings,]

47
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,960
[I finally found a budget]

48
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,160
[hotel room with]

49
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,680
[a similar arrangement]

50
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,240
[to my home in Canada.]

51
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,480
[My entire suitcase was stuffed]

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,520
[with my old curtains]

53
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,280
[and knickknacks.]

54
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,920
[How pathetic.]

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,600
[It seems like all I have left]

56
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,680
[from my eight years]

57
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,160
[in Canada are these things.]

58
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,079
[I'm such a failure.]

59
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,280
[Anyway, I need to]

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,960
[fool my mom first.]

61
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,200
Miss me?

62
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,800
Yes.

63
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,240
Why are you wearing so little?

64
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,000
[I thought Canada]

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,240
[has been pretty cold lately.]

66
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,839
It's pretty warm

67
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,760
indoors today.

68
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,240
[Mom.]

69
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,200
[I'll be busy with work]

70
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,440
[for a while.]

71
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,200
We might not

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,320
be able to video chat for a while.

73
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Okay, I know.

74
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,040
You've just renewed your work visa.

75
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,920
You should focus on your job.

76
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,520
Well,

77
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,640
your cousin and her husband are back.

78
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,480
[Yesterday, the entire family]

79
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,200
[went to your aunt's place for a gathering.]

80
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,880
Did you watch

81
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,760
the video I sent you?

82
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,800
What video?

83
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,000
The video about

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,480
your cousin being an overseas personal shopper.

85
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,240
She looked a mess.

86
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,640
She said she wants to

87
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,560
work as a live streamer in China.

88
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,000
Not to mention her husband.

89
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,520
He's worse than her ex.

90
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,440
[Her life is on the decline.]

91
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,680
[Excuse me, may I come in?]

92
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,760
Who was that just now?

93
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,800
Mom?

94
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Hello, mom?

95
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,400
Xinying?

96
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,040
Hello?

97
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,640
Didn't you

98
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,000
see the "Do Not Disturb" sign?

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,200
Why did you knock?

100
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,000
Would you like some bottled water?

101
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,120
No, thank you.

102
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,320
The room is such a mess.

103
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,600
Should I clean up?

104
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,120
No,

105
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,600
thank you.

106
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,160
Just close the door, please.

107
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,720
Okay.

108
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,120
[Alright.]

109
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,840
[Mom, I'm going to bed.]

110
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,320
[Once I'm done with this busy period,]

111
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,280
[I'll video call you.]

112
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,520
[Take care of yourselves, you and Dad.]

113
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,840
Okay.

114
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,400
Well,

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,880
go to sleep then.

116
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,400
Talk to you later.

117
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,240
[I really regret my choice back then.]

118
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,159
[I wish]

119
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,520
[I had a time machine]

120
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,400
[to take me back,]

121
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,760
[so I could choose again.]

122
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,440
[If I hadn't met that jerk,]

123
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,160
[I wouldn't have ended up in this mess.]

124
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,640
[Who would have thought that only]

125
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,680
[one month could change one's entire life?]

126
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,640
[I have to cling to the last sliver of hope.]

127
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,280
[If I can find that crooked lawyer]

128
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,520
[and that jerk, maybe I still]

129
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,960
[have a chance to go back.]

130
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,560
Welcome to FIB.

131
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,440
Welcome to FIB.

132
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,720
[Miss Lu.]

133
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,840
The bank closes at 4:00 p.m.

134
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,960
Does that mean

135
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,000
you get off work at that time too?

136
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,880
Let's go for

137
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,960
Italian food after your work.

138
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,200
Please take this

139
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,600
to the counter for the procedures.

140
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,200
Thank you.

141
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,880
Government bonds of

142
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,520
higher safety

143
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,240
are suitable

144
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,720
for long-term investment.

145
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,480
I'd recommend GIC to you.

146
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,480
This is also

147
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,280
a safe investment option.

148
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,400
It has a flexible term, ranging from

149
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,400
several months to several years.

150
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,600
[What are you talking about, girl?]

151
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
[I don't understand you.]

152
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,320
You talk too fast.

153
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,440
I can't keep up.

154
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,440
I don't understand Mandarin.

155
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,800
Ma'am,

156
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,480
excuse me.

157
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,480
I am the branch

158
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,720
manager, Karen.

159
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,120
I can explain it to you if you don't understand her.

160
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
[Please follow me to the office]

161
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,440
[on the second floor.]

162
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,880
I'll create a detailed investment

163
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,640
plan for you.

164
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,720
Okay.

165
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,840
Hanna.

166
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,120
[Can you help me to take care of this client?]

167
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:15,760
Sure.

168
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,040
You speak Cantonese really well, girl.

169
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,200
Thank you.

170
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,200
This way, please.

171
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,400
Okay. See you.

172
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
I'm coming soon.

173
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,840
I've already told you

174
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,880
to send these clients

175
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,080
directly to my office.

176
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,680
You don't know their needs.

177
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,480
You even don't know their language.

178
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,440
Learn some Cantonese.

179
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,240
Remember this, Cynthia.

180
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
Cantonese.

181
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,360
[Yes, the transition period is already over.]

182
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
[Our branch is running pretty well.]

183
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
Yeah.

184
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,760
Most of our clients

185
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,960
are Cantonese.

186
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,080
[So, Sophie and I can handle them. Exactly.]

187
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,120
And you know, Chinese, right?

188
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,080
When you speak

189
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,240
their language, they think they're honored,

190
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,000
and enjoy the interaction.

191
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,720
Yeah, exactly.

192
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,920
[So, I suggest]

193
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,320
[that you don't need that]

194
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,720
[Mandarin-speaking girl anymore.]

195
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,480
[Jennifer is learning Mandarin.]

196
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,840
[She can take her place.]

197
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,520
[I want to hire a new guy]

198
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,840
[who speaks Korean.]

199
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,480
[We don't need these interns]

200
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,520
[anymore.]

201
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,760
[Talk to you later.]

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,600
Bye.

203
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,400
My dear.

204
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,720
You're not allowed to loaf on the job like this.

205
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,040
To be clear, I'm not your rich parent

206
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
and I won't tolerate such behavior.

207
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,520
If I see this again,

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,440
I'll definitely put it in your records.

209
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,680
Now, go back to your work.

210
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,480
You may also put this sentence

211
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,640
on your own record.

212
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,240
Karen Dorman is a hypocrite.

213
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,400
What?

214
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,000
What do you mean?

215
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,640
Do we have a problem here?

216
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,160
Go back to work, now!

217
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,440
I'm on my way.

218
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,480
Emily and Aunt Zhang's niece

219
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,600
got their PR Visa

220
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,880
in the first year there.

221
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,600
This is your third year.

222
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,040
You can't blame me for this.

223
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,800
I'm not blaming you.

224
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,880
I'm just wondering how to

225
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,600
increase

226
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,120
your chances to get the visa.

227
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,600
[Alright.]

228
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,160
[Xinying will get her visa this year.]

229
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
Thanks, Dad.

230
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,480
How about this?

231
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,240
Bring your

232
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,200
tea leaves as a gift

233
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,960
to your manager

234
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,400
tomorrow when you go to work.

235
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,240
[Her name's Karen, right?]

236
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,840
Mom, stop being ridiculous.

237
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,560
That's not how things work here.

238
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,720
[It's not about where you are.]

239
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,160
I tell you.

240
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,240
It's about human nature.

241
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,760
You can never be too polite.

242
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,200
That chubby white guy

243
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,120
during your high school days

244
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,840
[loved]

245
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,320
[the local specialties I gave him.]

246
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,400
[That's why he took]

247
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
[special care of you.]

248
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,760
If you don't get your

249
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,200
PR Visa this year...

250
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,760
I don't want to jinx it,

251
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,760
[but it's better]

252
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,800
[to be safe than sorry.]

253
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,040
[If you fail this time,]

254
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,040
[you'll need to renew your work visa.]

255
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,480
At least, you can build

256
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,400
connections by giving gifts.

257
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,600
Yes, connections matter.

258
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
[Your mom is right about it.]

259
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,160
I know.

260
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,720
I believe in you.

261
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,520
[Thank you, Dad.]

262
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,680
Dad, aren't you busy with work today?

263
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,080
[It's...]

264
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,360
It's fine.

265
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,280
Xinying,

266
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,520
how do you get along

267
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,640
[with your manager?]

268
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,520
Karen is very kind to me.

269
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,840
For any business

270
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,040
matters I don't understand,

271
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,800
she immediately

272
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,280
takes over for me.

273
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,840
She takes special care of me.

274
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,560
Have you had dinner yet?

275
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,000
Yes.

276
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,000
I just had dinner with

277
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,160
my coworker after work.

278
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,560
Listen.

279
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,920
Don't associate

280
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,800
with shady people.

281
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,760
Don't go to

282
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,920
suspicious bars

283
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,880
[or any filthy,]

284
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,720
[messy places at night.]

285
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,600
[Clear?]

286
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,840
I know.

287
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,840
[It's just a coworker.]

288
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,680
[We just had dinner.]

289
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,560
Don't worry, mom.

290
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,040
I don't have

291
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,080
a single friend here.

292
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,240
[My mom sent me]

293
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,880
[to Canada starting from my high school.]

294
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,720
[According to her plan,]

295
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,200
[I would attend school,]

296
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,760
[work, and]

297
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,800
[eventually settle down here.]

298
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,080
[I bear the mission]

299
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,360
[she entrusted to me.]

300
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,040
[She gave me a name,]

301
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,920
[Cynthia.]

302
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
[But she didn't know that]

303
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,240
[whether I could]

304
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,360
[become a real Cynthia]

305
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,040
[didn't depend on my abilities.]

306
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,960
[My work visa is now only valid]

307
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,320
[for one more month.]

308
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,200
[All the resumes I've submitted]

309
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,440
[have gone unanswered.]

310
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,920
[Looks like Cynthia is about]

311
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,000
[to wrap up her role,]

312
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,680
[and I haven't been]

313
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,160
[Lu Xinying for a long time.]

314
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,200
You absolutely must see this play.

315
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,480
Oh, I know this play.

316
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,840
It's called Zuminus.

317
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,280
This is awesome!

318
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,240
You must see this.

319
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,560
Ge Kaiyang.

320
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,640
[Look at that]

321
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,320
[bus stop billboard.]

322
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,600
[Isn't that your lawyer?]

323
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,120
[Can I ask him to]

324
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,240
[help me with my work visa?]

325
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,240
[Yes, I guess.]

326
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,480
[He seems pretty good.]

327
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,120
[His office has]

328
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,040
[photos of him and celebrities.]

329
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,080
[Kaiyang can]

330
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,920
[introduce him to you.]

331
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,720
A Chinese girl!

332
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,200
So what?

333
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,960
[Are you crazy?]

334
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,640
You like her?

335
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,840
Get her number.

336
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,400
You get it for me.

337
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:33,960
Help him.

338
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,560
Okay.

339
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,560
Just kidding.

340
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,280
What's for dinner?

341
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,080
[Hurry up. Stop messing.]

342
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,520
[Chen Xi just asked]

343
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,720
[if you could help introduce]

344
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,760
[your lawyer friend.]

345
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,760
[No problem.]

346
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,040
I'm so full.

347
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,280
This Mexican restaurant is just fabulous.

348
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,000
Yes, it was really nice.

349
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,680
Have you seen the new Chinese

350
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,000
restaurant outside the bank?

351
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,760
Yeah.

352
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,120
It's always packed.

353
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,920
You know what?

354
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,200
The owner is actually one of our clients.

355
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Yeah, no wonder.

356
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,640
China is a real economic

357
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,480
powerhouse these days.

358
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,080
It's developing so fast.

359
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,760
That's true. Actually.

360
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,000
Hi, Cynthia.

361
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,600
Have you had your lunch?

362
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,240
I skipped lunch for losing weight.

363
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,320
Oh, we just went to

364
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,520
a Mexican restaurant.

365
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,200
We had very nice burrito.

366
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,080
You need to come

367
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,040
with us next time.

368
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,720
Okay, next time.

369
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,760
Come for sure.

370
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,080
Okay. Let's play it by ear.

371
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,680
We have a meeting, right?

372
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,480
Yes, at half past four.

373
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,080
Did you prepare the documents?

374
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,160
Yeah.

375
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
[I think it's ready.]

376
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,920
[Not run, no more.]

377
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,280
I have money in my account,

378
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,839
you know me?

379
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,440
Thomas.

380
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:18,960
You...

381
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
[I can handle it.]

382
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,160
Okay. It's easier.

383
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,800
Thank you.

384
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,599
[Thanks.]

385
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,160
How can I help you?

386
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,200
Yes. My credit card, bad.

387
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,240
Sorry. I can speak Chinese.

388
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,480
You're Chinese?

389
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,680
I just spent ages talking to that guy.

390
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,840
This is your bank's credit card. It had

391
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
[automatic payments set up.]

392
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,240
[But since last month,]

393
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,600
[it's down.]

394
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,720
[I've gotten this email.]

395
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,040
Okay.

396
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,920
The automatic payment deduction is down.

397
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,160
Do you have a debit card

398
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,960
from our bank?

399
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,800
They're all here.

400
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,200
I remember you.

401
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Bus stop.

402
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,400
[Which one still works?]

403
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,200
All of them. Any of them.

404
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,040
Sir.

405
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,720
Are you sure there's enough money

406
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,440
in your debit card to cover

407
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,160
your credit card payment?

408
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,440
Sure.

409
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,840
Okay, I'll check it for you right away.

410
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,240
Please wait.

411
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,600
Sir, please enter your password.

412
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,560
Guess who I ran into.

413
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,040
Sir, excuse me.

414
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,880
The password is incorrect.

415
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,480
That's it.

416
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,040
Sir.

417
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,400
It's still incorrect.

418
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,640
[Sir, please think it over.]

419
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,520
[For a third wrong password,]

420
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,960
the card will be locked.

421
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,000
Okay. Check it.

422
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,560
Sir.

423
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,120
It's locked.

424
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,360
What should I do?

425
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,200
[Unlock it.]

426
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,800
But I don't have the authority.

427
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,480
I'll have to go see my manager.

428
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,400
This may take up

429
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,040
your time.

430
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,920
How long?

431
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,800
I can only say I'll do it as soon as possible.

432
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,080
I'm in a hurry right now.

433
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,840
[How about this?]

434
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,560
I'll add you on WeChat.

435
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,160
Once it is unlocked,

436
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,960
you can send me a message. Okay?

437
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,320
Is this how you add people

438
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,360
on WeChat?

439
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,120
No.

440
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
I just can't find someone

441
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,120
to help me right now,

442
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,160
can I?

443
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,360
I'm in a hurry,

444
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,320
and you're a bank clerk.

445
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,440
You can't steal it away.

446
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,400
Okay.

447
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,760
I'll scan your code.

448
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,160
I'm Charlie.

449
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,000
Charlie.

450
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,760
What's your name?

451
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,840
Cynthia.

452
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,760
Your Chinese name?

453
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,320
Lu Xinying.

454
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,960
Lu Xinying.

455
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,520
Quite a novel name.

456
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,240
Which Lu?

457
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,960
The Lu for land.

458
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:22,920
Which Xin?

459
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,160
The Xin for heart.

460
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,240
Which Ying?

461
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,280
The Ying for novel.

462
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,280
Okay. Sent.

463
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,280
Alright?

464
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,480
Let me know when it's unlocked.

465
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,560
Send me a message.

466
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,160
I'm an actor.

467
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,560
[Jackie Chan.]

468
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,480
The Myth.

469
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,440
Okay.

470
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,480
Bye.

471
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,080
[Good bye.]

472
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,440
Jackie Chan.

473
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,720
[Julia.]

474
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,240
[My paper is due this Friday.]

475
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,440
[Have you finished it yet?]

476
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,480
Time's tight,

477
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,280
[so I paid you double.]

478
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,800
If you can't handle it,

479
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,440
I won't come to you next semester.

480
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,520
Bye-bye.

481
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,800
Get this sorted!

482
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,120
Okay. In a minute.

483
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
[Anna. Anna.]

484
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
[Come here.]

485
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,040
[Charlie is getting impatient.]

486
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,880
[It's been ages.]

487
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,120
[Ms. Yang.]

488
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,400
[Come on.]

489
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,800
[Keep going, guys!]

490
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,000
[What's up?]

491
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,960
My schedule

492
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,760
is from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.

493
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,360
Charlie, don't be mad.

494
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,800
[Our rentals operate]

495
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,280
[on a first-come, first-served basis.]

496
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,680
We can do nothing about it.

497
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,480
That children's

498
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,280
ballet class always

499
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,400
runs over time.

500
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
[We should respect the elderly]

501
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,520
[and cherish the young.]

502
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,040
Don't you think so?

503
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,000
How about this?

504
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,400
Wednesday. I book it all.

505
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
[If you clear]

506
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,680
[the crowd out now, I'll pay]

507
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,840
[double in cash]

508
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,720
[every month.]

509
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,160
Okay?

510
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,120
Okay.

511
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,600
Okay.

512
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,960
Practice your Chinese.

513
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,720
[Alright, guys.]

514
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,880
Class is over!

515
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,280
Come here.

516
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:30,920
Come here.

517
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,720
Where's the motorcycle?

518
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,320
Here.

519
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,360
Let me show it to you.

520
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,120
This is the latest model.

521
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,600
A genuine

522
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,960
heavy-duty motorcycle,

523
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,240
with a 23cc engine

524
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,920
of 106 horsepower.

525
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,640
Looks great on the road.

526
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,360
Total babe magnet.

527
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,600
I'm Ge Kaiyang.

528
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,480
I'm twenty-seven.

529
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,720
Hi, Ge Kaiyang.

530
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,960
My dad...

531
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,360
He always saw me as useless.

532
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,880
He thinks he's never wrong.

533
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,520
Always correcting everyone.

534
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,240
So I wanted to escape him.

535
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,920
So I went abroad.

536
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,440
Sorry.

537
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,520
Take your time.

538
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,400
Hi, I'm Fran.

539
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,680
Hello, Fran.

540
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,560
I feel...

541
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,840
In this world,

542
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,440
no one gets me.

543
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,800
No one tries to know me.

544
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,920
Or accept me.

545
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,760
My family

546
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,840
look at me like

547
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,480
I'm some kind of monster.

548
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,480
Their looks feel like

549
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
sharp blades.

550
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,680
They cut right through me.

551
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,720
But I did nothing wrong.

552
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,200
I just want

553
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,880
to live my own way.

554
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,840
I don't want to hurt anyone.

555
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,080
Or be hurt myself.

556
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,840
It breaks my heart.

557
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,800
Cut.

558
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,840
Next time, can you

559
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
say your lines

560
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,600
with some feeling?

561
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Don't be so flat.

562
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,440
Learn from Fran.

563
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,360
Look who's talking.

564
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,640
Didn't you forget a line?

565
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,760
You wrote the script.

566
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,720
Or got a ghostwriter?

567
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,560
I write, direct, and act.

568
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,320
Isn't that normal?

569
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,800
Yeah, yeah, you're great.

570
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,200
Are you...

571
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,080
with Tangdou now?

572
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,160
You two even match outfits.

573
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
Me? With Tangdou?

574
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,000
How dare you say that?

575
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,960
You talk nonsense.

576
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,520
You really do.

577
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,520
So? Was it good?

578
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,880
You've got talent.

579
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,800
Really? I was nervous.

580
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,280
Yeah, you almost made me cry.

581
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,160
I improvised it.

582
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
I was upset yesterday.

583
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,840
I failed two classes.

584
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,280
But just now,

585
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,640
acting cheered me up.

586
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,200
Best Actor, please.

587
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:36,760
Thank you, thank you.

588
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,880
Your father's been busy lately

589
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,320
with the company's IPO.

590
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
So he asked me

591
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,920
to come and check on you.

592
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,720
He's noticed that many of

593
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,120
your recent credit card bills

594
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,560
show a lot of spending on

595
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,480
stage lights and LED screens,

596
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,040
and other unusual

597
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,880
large purchases.

598
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,160
He wants to know

599
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,760
what you bought and why.

600
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,360
So the things you bought,

601
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,400
I need to look at them

602
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,800
and do a quick check.

603
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:01,840
Also,

604
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,880
I need to see

605
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,800
how you're living,

606
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,880
and report back to Mr. Ge.

607
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,080
By the way,

608
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,640
how's school going?

609
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,160
Still studying.

610
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,640
Mr. Ge asked me to say

611
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,040
he wants you to graduate soon.

612
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,200
Because after that,

613
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,800
you pay your own living costs.

614
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,520
He also told me

615
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,200
to pass this on:

616
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,920
keep a low profile,

617
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,000
don't show off.

618
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,200
Got it.

619
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,680
Okay, see you next time.

620
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,160
Bye.

621
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:36,920
Bye.

622
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,640
Hello, actor.

623
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,680
Your card's all set.

624
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,600
I've set up

625
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,600
an auto payment alert.

626
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,240
If next month

627
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,560
the payment doesn't go through,

628
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,520
the bank will send a text

629
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,200
to remind you.

630
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,600
Okay, thank you.

631
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,560
That's it?

632
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,480
What else?

633
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,800
You helped me solve

634
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,680
such a big problem.

635
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
How can I thank you?

636
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,640
It's okay.

637
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,680
It's just my job.

638
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,560
Let me buy you dinner.

639
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
No, thanks.

640
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,440
How about this:

641
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,080
come watch our play.

642
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,960
We don't usually

643
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,760
invite people to rehearsals.

644
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,560
You'll be the only one.

645
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,960
Say whatever you think.

646
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,800
Really, just don't be too harsh.

647
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
Actors are all fragile.

648
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,760
I'm very fragile, actually.

649
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,840
Forget it, I've got things to do.

650
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,400
Wait.

651
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,320
Listen...

652
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,280
Hey, what are you doing?

653
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,240
Trying to fake it?

654
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,360
There's CCTV everywhere.

655
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,800
You pulled me down.

656
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,440
Nice.

657
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,880
Hi, Cynthia.

658
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,040
Let go.

659
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,840
Hi, Cynthia.

660
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,160
Get up, get up first.

661
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,160
If you don't say yes,

662
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,800
I'm not getting up.

663
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,120
Bye, Cynthia.

664
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,680
Get up, come on.

665
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,760
Bye-bye, Cynthia.

666
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,080
Bye.

667
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,680
Bye.

668
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,800
Okay, okay, I agree.

669
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,480
Now get up.

670
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,800
Okay.

671
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,680
Okay.

672
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,200
But right now

673
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,600
I can't really get up.

674
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,240
Give me a hand.

675
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,040
My hand, my hand.

676
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:17,960
I'm sorry.

677
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,840
I lied to all of you.

678
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,880
You asked me to drop my mask.

679
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,360
But I don't even understand

680
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,280
what counts as a mask

681
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
and what is real.

682
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,480
So how can I take it off?

683
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,800
My reason is simple.

684
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,760
I just want to be different.

685
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,000
Even just a little bit.

686
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,320
If you force me to drop my mask,

687
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,040
I'll fight to keep it on.

688
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,320
Because once it's gone,

689
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,000
I'll lose who I am.

690
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,480
Stop eating, drink with me.

691
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,200
Come on, have a drink.

692
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,080
Come on, come on.

693
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,520
Come on, come on, come on.

694
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,920
So what do you think,

695
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,600
how we did today?

696
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,560
Good. Really good.

697
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,960
You're not being objective.

698
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,600
I'll ask Xinying.

699
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,000
Xinying.

700
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,280
You're this play's

701
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:27,880
very first audience member.

702
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,440
What did you think?

703
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,040
Good.

704
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,280
I think everyone's acting

705
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,160
was really great.

706
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,680
Right?

707
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,080
She's praising you.

708
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,600
What about the lines?

709
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,160
Yeah.

710
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
I added the last line.

711
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:35,840
How was that?

712
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,080
Ge Kaiyang.

713
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,000
That last line,

714
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,920
where did you see it?

715
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,640
It's from Zhuangzi.

716
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,520
Zhuangzi.

717
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,240
So pretentious.

718
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,560
Zhuangzi.

719
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,280
So, so pretentious.

720
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,320
I think

721
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:51,960
this script

722
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,400
doesn't match your acting.

723
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,560
You all act much better.

724
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,440
Since you know scripts so well,

725
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,240
join us.

726
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,680
Our drama club

727
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,720
still has a spot, right?

728
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,000
Yeah.

729
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:02,800
We do.

730
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,600
We do.

731
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,120
Yeah.

732
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,280
You work at the bank

733
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:05,760
every day, it's boring.

734
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,360
Join us.

735
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,200
Come on, join us.

736
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,400
Chen Xi's right.

737
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,480
I read people really well.

738
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,360
Don't I?

739
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,120
I think you should, Xinying.

740
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,120
You know, you really fit in.

741
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,880
Well, I think your script

742
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,320
actually has quite a few bugs

743
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,320
in it.

744
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,440
I don't really get it.

745
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,240
Why would you

746
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
spend so much time and effort

747
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,920
and so much money,

748
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,520
when in the end

749
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,560
almost no one

750
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,760
might even watch this play.

751
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,920
What's the point?

752
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,960
Does everything

753
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,360
have to have a meaning?

754
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,040
If it feels fun,

755
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
just do it.

756
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,120
Doing theatre

757
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,080
lets you escape reality

758
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,080
and feel free.

759
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,080
Isn't that meaning enough?

760
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,080
As the fullest you,

761
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,400
shouldn't you

762
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,560
offer something up?

763
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,920
Ge Kaiyang, drink.

764
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,200
I don't know why,

765
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,240
I'm suddenly so happy.

766
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,280
I'm telling you,

767
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,320
what we're richest in...

768
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,600
[I was so naive.]

769
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,680
[Only now do I realize.]

770
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,760
[He keyed his PIN wrong on purpose]

771
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,040
[just to meet me.]

772
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,240
[Later, him on the bike at the bank]

773
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,800
[was part of his plan too.]

774
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,840
[He really knows how to play people.]

775
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,080
[He built a dream on that stage.]

776
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,160
[When you live in reality too long,]

777
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,760
[it's easy]

778
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,200
[to trust people in a dream.]

779
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,120
[So I believed him.]

780
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,840
[I told him]

781
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,200
[I really needed]

782
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,960
[permanent residency in Canada.]

783
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,240
[He immediately took me]

784
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,440
[to see a lawyer.]

785
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,200
[Kuang Dazhi.]

786
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,400
[He said one fee was enough]

787
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,840
[to fix the whole thing.]

788
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,080
[Sure enough,]

789
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,600
[my sponsorship came through fast.]

790
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,200
[The mission my mum gave me]

791
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,880
[was almost complete.]

792
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,160
[I finally felt relieved.]

793
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,640
Ge Kaiyang!

794
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,400
You're pinching my arm!

795
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,800
Is that fun?

796
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,520
Don't shout in just one ear!

797
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,360
Ge Kaiyang!

798
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,400
Look, I'm no good at this.

799
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,240
You should skim the water.

800
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
Look, it's flying now.

801
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:13,920
Look.

802
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,640
Let me ask you something.

803
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,600
When this play is over,

804
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,560
what are you going to do?

805
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,280
Truth or Dare.

806
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,480
Winner gets to ask.

807
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,120
Go.

808
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,320
Rock, paper, scissors.

809
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,920
I'm planning to buy an asteroid.

810
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,920
Why not just buy the moon?

811
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,680
I really bought an asteroid

812
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,520
and named it after me.

813
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:43,880
I also want,

814
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,080
after finals are over,

815
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,920
to throw a space-themed party.

816
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,760
Come over then,

817
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,720
I'll show you the certificate.

818
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,800
You rich kids and your lives,

819
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,840
we common folk can't relate.

820
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,120
Do you think "rich kid"

821
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,080
is a nice label?

822
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,240
Who likes being labelled anyway?

823
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,680
Okay.

824
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,960
But hey, your finals...

825
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,760
Aren't we about the same age?

826
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,120
You're in grad school, right?

827
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
That's the next question.

828
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,280
Your turn.

829
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,880
Okay.

830
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,400
I'm playing scissors again.

831
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Then I'll go with rock.

832
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,360
Bring it on.

833
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,960
Rock, paper, scissors.

834
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,840
See?

835
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,400
I keep my word.

836
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,639
Answer that.

837
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,560
I'm definitely older than you.

838
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,679
But who decided

839
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,280
life has to follow a schedule?

840
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,639
Some start university in their thirties or forties,

841
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,159
or in their fifties, sixties,

842
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,440
and still do masters and PhDs.

843
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,920
Besides,

844
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,000
I did foundation and language courses,

845
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,960
then changed my major.

846
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,600
Seven years, give or take.

847
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,880
You spent seven years on undergrad.

848
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
I have my own

849
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,120
subjective and objective reasons.

850
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,400
I'm going with rock again.

851
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,480
Rock, paper, scissors.

852
00:34:59,240 --> 00:34:59,720
Cheater.

853
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,560
Go on.

854
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,640
What are your subjective reasons?

855
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,040
Have you seen

856
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,280
"The Truman Show"?

857
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,080
If a person,

858
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,720
from birth,

859
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,200
has their whole life preplanned,

860
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,920
what happens to them?

861
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,200
Which primary school they go to,

862
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,920
which high school they attend,

863
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,000
when they go abroad,

864
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,400
when they have to return,

865
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,160
when they join the company,

866
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,760
what kind of spouse they find,

867
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,320
how many kids they have,

868
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,560
which hospital they use when ill,

869
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,080
which cemetery they end up in.

870
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,720
If it were you,

871
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,560
what would you do?

872
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,040
Do you think he'd go mad?

873
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,160
I used to think in this world,

874
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,000
only my life was that scripted.

875
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
Now I've found my kind.

876
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,800
What about your parents?

877
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,080
They sent me here

878
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,320
for high school and university.

879
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,400
My family...

880
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,640
maybe not selling everything,

881
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,600
but they really gave it all.

882
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,520
They sold an apartment for me.

883
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,160
Mum quit her job

884
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,600
and came here to stay with me.

885
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,400
She's been here six years.

886
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:22,960
Crazy, right?

887
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,440
It's another era now.

888
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,240
Your parents really love you.

889
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,720
They do love me too much.

890
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,120
But that love is so heavy.

891
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,600
All I can do now

892
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,440
is work, work, work,

893
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,800
and to become that

894
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,200
shining child they see in their minds.

895
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,600
So back home,

896
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,320
they can hold their heads high

897
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,120
and be the ones

898
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,520
people talk about

899
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,560
as "successful parents".

900
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,360
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

901
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,200
Sometimes running away is okay.

902
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,360
Do what I do.

903
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,480
You really don't believe

904
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,320
someone can skip a stone seven times?

905
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,560
My grandpa.

906
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,640
When I was little, my parents were busy,

907
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,800
so I lived with my grandparents.

908
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,760
I saw it with my own eyes,

909
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,120
he really did it.

910
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,040
He was unbeatable in Lucheng City.

911
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,800
You really are from Lucheng City?

912
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,800
Yeah.

913
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,520
I'm off. Bye-bye.

914
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,840
Bye-bye.

915
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,800
I've got a question for you.

916
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,080
Go ahead.

917
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,480
How about I pick you up tomorrow?

918
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,440
Four p.m. Don't stand me up.

919
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:26,960
Okay.

920
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,440
I'm heading off then, bye-bye.

921
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,040
Bye-bye.

922
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,080
Hello?

923
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,680
Young lady.

924
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,240
Don't try to fool me.

925
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,360
My credit card was stolen and used.

926
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,240
If I don't go to the bank,

927
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,040
who else do I go to?

928
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,880
I've just explained to you,

929
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,280
your credit card

930
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,720
was issued by a card company.

931
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,200
For things like fraud,

932
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,880
you need to contact

933
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,480
the issuer to sort it out.

934
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,800
We as the bank can't just

935
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,680
cancel the charge on our own.

936
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,240
Don't play games with me.

937
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,720
If you don't want to help,

938
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,640
just say so.

939
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,800
If you don't know how,

940
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,200
get someone else who does.

941
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,240
Stop standing here

942
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,320
wasting my time.

943
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,680
It's okay.

944
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,400
Your

945
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,640
work permit,

946
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,320
we might still find a way.

947
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,480
What are you all doing here?

948
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,120
We can't find Ge Kaiyang.

949
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,360
Have you tried his place?

950
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:38,920
None of us has been there.

951
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,160
We don't even know

952
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,120
who he lives with.

953
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,680
It's like he vanished.

954
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,280
Don't stress yourself out.

955
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,160
Sometimes running away is fine.

956
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,520
Seriously.

957
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,000
Learn from me.

958
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,320
Maybe he just got hit by a car.

959
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,720
[Chen Xi's work permit]

960
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,560
[has run into trouble.]

961
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,560
[The sponsor Kuang Dazhi]

962
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,640
[found got investigated.]

963
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,200
[Apparently]

964
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
[one single address]

965
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,400
[was used for over twenty]

966
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,200
[visa applications.]

967
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,720
[That sponsor]

968
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,720
[has already been arrested.]

969
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,760
[Chen Xi and the others' visas]

970
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,240
[are all facing cancellation.]

971
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:18,720
[Kuang Dazhi]

972
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,080
[has shut down his firm too,]

973
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,840
[probably to lie low.]

974
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,400
[No one knows where he is now.]

975
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,720
[I used to think in this world,]

976
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,760
only my life was that scripted.

977
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,520
Now I've found my kind.

978
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,400
Ms. Lu.

979
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,440
Ms. Lu.

980
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,440
So after that,

981
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,720
you never saw that Ge...

982
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,560
Ge Kaiyang.

983
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:43,760
That lawyer Kuang

984
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,960
was the one he introduced to me.

985
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,840
And that dodgy

986
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,560
private sponsorship,

987
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,000
they were the ones who fixed it up.

988
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,720
None of this has anything to do with me.

989
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,080
I knew nothing about it.

990
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,600
Does that count as a defense?

991
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,800
In law,

992
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,480
this so-called

993
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,280
"private sponsorship"

994
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,280
does amount to visa fraud.

995
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,320
From what I hear,

996
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,960
you did know about it.

997
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,000
No,

998
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,440
I didn't know this

999
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,200
was against the law.

1000
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,640
But you did it, right?

1001
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,840
Visa fraud is very serious.

1002
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,280
I know your situation.

1003
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,120
Your parents did so much

1004
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,240
to get you here to Canada.

1005
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,480
You've had a work permit for three years.

1006
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,600
This year you had a real shot

1007
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,080
at being picked for permanent residency.

1008
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,800
I do feel sorry for you.

1009
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,400
And I believe that in this matter,

1010
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,600
you really were duped.

1011
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,000
But the law is the law.

1012
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,520
Whether it was intentional or not,

1013
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,840
you've already broken it.

1014
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,080
So...

1015
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,440
there's nothing I can do.

1016
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,440
Then can I sue them?

1017
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,480
Sue that lawyer Kuang,

1018
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,640
and that private sponsor,

1019
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,400
and Ge Kaiyang.

1020
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,760
They were all in it together.

1021
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,840
I know you want your money back.

1022
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,480
You can go back and find them.

1023
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,920
Once you track them down,

1024
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,280
get in touch with me online.

1025
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,160
I'll help you appeal as much as I can.

1026
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,680
But you do have to leave soon.

1027
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:57,800
[I went to a fast-food stall]

1028
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,400
[outside the Chinese supermarket.]

1029
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,000
[I ordered a bowl of malatang.]

1030
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:02,840
[Once I finish this meal,]

1031
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,800
[I'll be flying back home.]

1032
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,360
[I've always felt]

1033
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,240
[the malatang in Toronto]

1034
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,880
[never tastes quite right.]

1035
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,240
[I blamed it on the water.]

1036
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,280
[But I never thought that, before leaving,]

1037
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,240
[my last meal here]

1038
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,240
[would still be malatang.]

1039
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,280
[Malatang really is]

1040
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,640
[a comfort for lonely souls.]

1041
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,000
[The lawyer said if I find those two,]

1042
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,200
[there's still a tiny bit of hope.]

1043
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,680
[I think she was just comforting me.]

1044
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,160
[How am I supposed to find them?]

1045
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,800
[How do I face my mum?]

1046
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,600
[How do I even face myself?]
