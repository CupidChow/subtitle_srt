1
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,320
Mr. Lin,

2
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,840
before we begin

3
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,680
the new show,

4
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,640
I wanna

5
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,759
settle the cut.

6
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,759
Your terms

7
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,840
are fine with me.

8
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
It's in process.

9
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,720
I was planning

10
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,800
to talk to you

11
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
regarding the new show.

12
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,479
We think

13
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,680
you need a co-host.

14
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,680
Two hosts?

15
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,280
Who do you have

16
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,760
in mind?

17
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,600
Zhang Ran's been killing it lately.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,720
Getting her involved

19
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,440
would take the show

20
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,800
to the next level.

21
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,079
Next level...

22
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,320
Look,

23
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:38,920
I've always

24
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,640
handled these shows

25
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,920
myself.

26
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,240
Adding someone

27
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,079
feels like

28
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,320
you're

29
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,520
taking my project away.

30
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,560
Plus, you haven't even

31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,000
given me a good reason.

32
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,200
Consider this,

33
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,079
her popularity

34
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,800
would

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,560
boost your numbers.

36
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,280
The show would reach

37
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,520
new heights.

38
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,760
This project

39
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,360
is my creation,

40
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,600
my own initiative.

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,240
You can't

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,560
swoop in and take over.

43
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,320
While it's your creation,

44
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,760
it's also a company asset.

45
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,360
We all want it

46
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,480
to succeed.

47
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,280
You wanna do things

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,040
your way,

49
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,280
but we need to think about

50
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,600
what's best

51
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,560
for the show.

52
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,920
This is ridiculous!

53
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
I've given

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,960
everything to this project!

55
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
My team and I

56
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,680
have handled everything

57
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,320
for six months,

58
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,800
from concept

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,440
to investors

60
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,200
to sponsors.

61
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,920
You're just stealing it!

62
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,320
How dare you?

63
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,800
Trust me,

64
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,720
I've already

65
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,960
got the investors on board.

66
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,240
Call them if you wanna check.

67
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,880
Don't be upset.

68
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,360
We go way back.

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,320
If you're really against it,

70
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,680
I won't push.

71
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,240
But changing plans

72
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,600
means a lot of explaining

73
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,560
to investors.

74
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,200
Who knows if

75
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,320
they'll stick around.

76
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,720
Here,

77
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,440
take a sip.

78
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,240
People are watching.

79
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,560
Gimme an out.

80
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,680
Please.

81
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,280
Smooth move.

82
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,400
We appreciate it!

83
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,240
Thanks!

84
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,720
That's our star!

85
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,440
Let's hear it!

86
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,760
Alright,

87
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,480
enough clapping.

88
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,080
We're all working for Mr. Lin.

89
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,600
Whatever he decides,

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,960
we follow.

91
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,040
I'm grateful

92
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,760
for your investment in me.

93
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Whatever you say!

94
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,280
Everyone,

95
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,880
coffee's on me!

96
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,920
Thank you all!

97
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,200
Thanks!

98
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,560
Good luck, Zhang Ran!

99
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,600
You too...

100
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,400
Need to talk.

101
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,000
Sure.

102
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,800
Just go.

103
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,080
Why's she getting

104
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,320
called in?

105
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,840
What happened?

106
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,280
Zhang Ran,

107
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,760
have a sandwich.

108
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,880
Already ate,

109
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,800
please, help yourself.

110
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,360
It'll go bad soon.

111
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,120
We're thinking of

112
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,840
putting you on Lin Anran's show.

113
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,280
Thoughts?

114
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,000
I appreciate the opportunity,

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,520
but I'm concerned.

116
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,680
Afterall,

117
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,159
this show

118
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,440
is her creation.

119
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,760
Joining now

120
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,520
seems like I'm...

121
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,680
piggy-backing on her success.

122
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,200
It's important she knows,

123
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
every opportunity comes from the company.

124
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,320
All decisions are about

125
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,640
what's best for business.

126
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,080
Got it.

127
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,080
But this isn't

128
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,920
my wheelhouse.

129
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,440
No real experience here.

130
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,560
Don't wanna be dead weight.

131
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,240
Being an influencer

132
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,640
isn't like your hosting gig.

133
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,480
There's more flexibility.

134
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Don't see this

135
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,280
as a promotion,

136
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,280
you've earned it.

137
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,080
Truth is,

138
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,680
I see a brighter future

139
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,559
in you.

140
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,720
That's a lot of pressure.

141
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,280
Take it easy.

142
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,120
Actually getting hungry now.

143
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,560
C'mon.

144
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,600
Thanks.

145
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,080
Better eat it before

146
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,760
it expires.

147
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,920
Boss,

148
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
you're so generous.

149
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,160
Really.

150
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,640
Thank you!

151
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Um... maybe

152
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,880
I'll... eat it in my office?

153
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,960
Thanks, boss.

154
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,560
[Morning, Mr. Li.]

155
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,160
[Morning!]

156
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,480
Morning!

157
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,600
Nice one!

158
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,600
One-nil!

159
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,480
Celebrate, you guys!

160
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,120
Happy goal dance!

161
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,480
Everyone's

162
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
going crazy!

163
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,480
Yay!

164
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,320
What's this?

165
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,200
Mr. Li!

166
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,760
Morning, Mr. Li.

167
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:06,960
Mr. Li!

168
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,160
Mr. Li.

169
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,520
Hi.

170
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,160
[Mr. Li,]

171
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,120
[I appreciate]

172
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,440
[your involvement.]

173
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,160
[But I trust]

174
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,520
[the experts]

175
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,480
[to do what they do best.]

176
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,840
[And what we bring to the table is the vision.]

177
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,440
[Market penetration?]

178
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,000
[Or branding strategy?]

179
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,840
- [That's for Michael's team]
- Alright.

180
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,680
[to decide.]

181
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,400
[When I started...]

182
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,040
Michael knows his stuff.

183
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,800
[Dreaming big, feeling unstoppable...]

184
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,640
[Always trying to...]

185
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,440
Fine.

186
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,280
[Prove my worth.]

187
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,320
[But that just]

188
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,960
[pushed people away.]

189
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,560
[Ended up as]

190
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,800
[window dressing.]

191
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,080
[Hard pill to swallow then.]

192
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,360
[Now I get it,]

193
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,680
[I wasn't ready.]

194
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
That's how you

195
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,080
become a figurehead.

196
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,760
[We]

197
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,920
[rarely recognize]

198
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,240
[our own limitations.]

199
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,320
[Ah,]

200
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,480
[I've acquired two whiskies.]

201
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,080
OK.

202
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,360
[Oak-aged, single malt.]

203
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,240
[We should share them sometime.]

204
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,800
Drinks, great.

205
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,320
Two fancy whiskies.

206
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,760
Sharing drinks.

207
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:15,840
Wonderful.

208
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,520
Hey,

209
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,280
gotta say something back.

210
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,120
What do I say?

211
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,000
Got it, Mr. Xing.

212
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,320
Whatever you say.

213
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,120
[Yeah,]

214
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,480
[hit "Follow" up top!]

215
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:13,920
[Please,]

216
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,000
[like]

217
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,800
[and subscribe]

218
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,400
[if you enjoy the stream!]

219
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,000
Mr. Lin!

220
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,240
Here.

221
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,440
Everyone!

222
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,000
Gather around!

223
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,800
C'mon!

224
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,160
Guys, here!

225
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,160
Everyone gather around!

226
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,040
Take five!

227
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,240
Come here!

228
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,240
An announcement.

229
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,680
Alright!

230
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,640
First off,

231
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,320
really big thanks

232
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,160
to your hard work.

233
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,920
We've made the leap

234
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,840
from short videos and streams

235
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,520
to full-length content.

236
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,280
And major props

237
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,560
to our star, our ace,

238
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,800
Ms. Lin Anran!

239
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,320
She's the compass

240
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,880
guiding our vessel!

241
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,760
Zhang Ran, come up here.

242
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,440
Her recent dedication

243
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,080
has made her

244
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,560
a rising star.

245
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,960
Her go-getter attitude

246
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,400
sets an example for us.

247
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,600
Long road ahead, folks.

248
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,400
If your stats aren't perfect,

249
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,040
don't look for excuses.

250
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,560
Our mission is crucial.

251
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,680
We're shaping culture,

252
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,200
driving the economy.

253
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,480
We're

254
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,440
the industry's pioneers!

255
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,000
That window

256
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,960
in my office?

257
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,440
Every day

258
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,120
I watch you streaming,

259
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,840
it warms my heart!

260
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,080
Seeing those numbers light up the screen,

261
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,440
I tear up.

262
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,680
Every one of you

263
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,760
has made

264
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,040
the company what it is.

265
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,920
We're so grateful.

266
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,800
So

267
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,040
the management and Anran

268
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,880
have decided to

269
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,680
bring Zhang Ran into the new show.

270
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,960
It'll create more buzz,

271
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,800
break new ground!

272
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,480
Bravo!

273
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,040
The show isn't individual property,

274
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,560
it's a collective asset.

275
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,319
Everyone gets their shot!

276
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,080
I'm confident these two

277
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,880
will create

278
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,560
amazing synergy together.

279
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,880
Thanks, Anran.

280
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,160
Let's soar together.

281
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,360
Together!

282
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,720
Hi!

283
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,680
Great effort, folks!

284
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,520
Appreciate it!

285
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:53,960
Thanks!

286
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,720
Thanks!

287
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,360
More spacious here.

288
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,480
Definitely bigger, right?

289
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,040
From a cubbyhole to a palace.

290
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,080
Over here.

291
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,200
Suite has a minimum spend of 680.

292
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,440
680?

293
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,840
680's fine

294
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,960
for two.

295
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,160
On you anyway.

296
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,400
Suite's overkill for two!

297
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,320
You're buying then!

298
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,880
C'mon...

299
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,440
you promised...

300
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,040
A toast!

301
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,880
The team has been

302
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,840
exceptional lately.

303
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,720
Tonight's on me!

304
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,920
Lost my appetite.

305
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,400
You?

306
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,800
One minute he's starving,

307
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,160
the next he's not!

308
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,200
Can't figure this guy out!

309
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,720
Good night.

310
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,760
Now what?

311
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,360
Just go, okay?

312
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,840
Look at us,

313
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,800
like these lions,

314
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,520
fancy titles

315
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,760
but

316
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,280
no substance!

317
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,520
Like seeks like.

318
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,480
Get in!

319
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,560
Not leaving.

320
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,160
Fine, I will.

321
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,800
No, you're not.

322
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,920
What?

323
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,800
Dinner, of course!

324
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,240
Why should we

325
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,120
back down?

326
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:37,880
In there!

327
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:38,920
C'mon!

328
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Sorry, we'll stay.

329
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:43,960
Go!

330
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,560
Why'd you bolt

331
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,520
if we're staying?

332
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,320
You bolted!

333
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
That was all you!

334
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,480
You started it!

335
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,320
You're right here,

336
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,680
waitress there...

337
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,040
Dude, you totally bolted.

338
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,160
Then you just...

339
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,280
Still a suite?

340
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,600
Main hall's fine.

341
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,160
Alright.

342
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,280
Over here.

343
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,200
Here's the menu,

344
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,960
let me know.

345
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,880
Thanks.

346
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,080
This is power move.

347
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,600
Eating right here!

348
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,400
By sitting here,

349
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,760
we've already conceded.

350
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,160
See the big picture!

351
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,760
Us out here

352
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,120
beats their suite.

353
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,800
All part of the plan.

354
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:32,960
How's that?

355
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,120
Staff in the suite

356
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,840
while the bosses here?

357
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,720
Rather awkward

358
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,120
for them, right?

359
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,040
Let's order.

360
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,000
That thing's in the way.

361
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,480
Let's move it!

362
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Don't make this weirder.

363
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,280
It's stuck.

364
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,640
What to order?

365
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,840
Anything goes.

366
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,480
Can't go on.

367
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,080
About to burst.

368
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,520
Bounce?

369
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,920
We're just warming up.

370
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,240
Notice something?

371
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,920
Not one

372
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,800
bathroom break

373
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,240
from there.

374
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,760
They've spotted us

375
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,040
and are too chicken

376
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,320
to come out.

377
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,560
All of them holding it in,

378
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,680
got it?

379
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,240
Watch them squirm.

380
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,880
What now?

381
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,000
Keep eating.

382
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,960
So it's either outlast them

383
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,920
or burst trying?

384
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,960
They'll break first.

385
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,640
C'mon, cheers!

386
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,160
Excuse me,

387
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,200
menu!

388
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:38,800
On it!

389
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,240
Order anything you like,

390
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,120
go wild!

391
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,200
Cheers,

392
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,680
guys!

393
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,480
Time to go!

394
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,400
Watch the tipsy ones!

395
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,080
Watch it!

396
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,400
Check, please.

397
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,560
Mr. Li, Mr. Fu!

398
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,640
Hey! Fancy seeing you here.

399
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,040
Small world.

400
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,280
Indeed!

401
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,040
Mr. Li's here too.

402
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,680
Michael!

403
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,040
Mr. Li,

404
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,000
Mr. Fu...

405
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,760
didn't expect to run into you.

406
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,120
Just grabbing a bite.

407
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,000
Talk about timing!

408
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,200
Yeah, yeah!

409
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,360
Everyone's been

410
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,560
putting in long hours,

411
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,920
so I took the team out.

412
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
Would've invited

413
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,240
you both,

414
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,280
but didn't wanna put you

415
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,560
in an awkward spot.

416
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,720
Right,

417
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,000
you'd be more relaxed

418
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,040
without us.

419
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,520
Thank you for your...

420
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,040
You've been through a lot lately.

421
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,760
You deserve this.

422
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,840
It's on me!

423
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,480
You guys head out.

424
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,400
No! Mr. Li!

425
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,560
We're still a startup.

426
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,520
Can't spend company fund.

427
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,200
I got this, really.

428
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,920
Not company money,

429
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,960
from my own pocket!

430
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
To show appreciation.

431
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,880
Mr. Li and Mr. Fu

432
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,840
are buying dinner!

433
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Thank you so much!

434
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,560
Don't

435
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,480
mention it,

436
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,320
you guys earned it!

437
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:19,960
So,

438
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,800
any words from the bosses?

439
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,760
Nah, get going!

440
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,520
Get some rest!

441
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,600
OK, we're off then.

442
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:24,840
Sure.

443
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,520
Take care.

444
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,000
Thanks.

445
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,480
Later!

446
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,160
Bye!

447
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,280
All that waiting

448
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,360
just to hear them vent?

449
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,880
They had a blast!

450
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,280
So much for being embarrassed.

451
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,520
Mere surface pleasantries.

452
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,200
They're awkward within.

453
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,760
You felt

454
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
that tension, right?

455
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,280
Mission accomplished!

456
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,040
Totally...

457
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,280
Wonder what their tab came to.

458
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,400
How bad could it be?

459
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
What happened to

460
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,520
our after-dinner walk?

461
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,520
You're practically running.

462
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,480
I'm getting cramps.

463
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,480
Keep this up

464
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,160
and dinner's

465
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,400
coming back up.

466
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,800
What are we even doing?

467
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,880
The company's turned into

468
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,760
something different from

469
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,520
what we dreamed up.

470
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,600
What choice do we have?

471
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,840
It is what it is.

472
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,440
Gotta roll with it.

473
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:44,880
Damn,

474
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,360
these guys

475
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,680
racked up almost ten grand!

476
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,560
Wish I'd known they'd pig out

477
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,760
before offering to treat.

478
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,800
So pissed!

479
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,680
Bright side,

480
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,640
you just saved

481
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,000
ten grand for the company.

482
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,320
Always Mr. Silver Lining, huh?

483
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,680
How about

484
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
we talk to Xing Kai?

485
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,480
About what?

486
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,600
"Dr. Fu" has gone

487
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,640
completely off the rails.

488
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,760
Keep this up,

489
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,880
and I'm done.

490
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,000
Not this again.

491
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,200
Listen, I get you,

492
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,280
but this whole work thing?

493
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,640
It's all an act.

494
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,880
Everyone's in it.

495
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,880
Xing Kai's playing investor,

496
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,360
and Michael,

497
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,760
he's playing a smart dude.

498
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,560
It's just about

499
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,640
picking your role.

500
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,840
Plus, we're

501
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,480
strapped into this ride now.

502
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,600
Can't bail

503
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,800
halfway through.

504
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,760
Gotta tough it out.

505
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,560
Let's go!

506
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,960
Really got a cramp?

507
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,720
Yeah.

508
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,240
Follow me.

509
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,920
Slow down!

510
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,880
Slowing down

511
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,800
makes it worse.

512
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,160
Just pick up the pace...

513
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,120
Fine, faster!

514
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,400
C'mon, move it!

515
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,360
Is that cramp real?

516
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,000
Totally!

517
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Dude, you suck!

518
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,440
Why even sub you in?

519
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,920
Should've left you out.

520
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,320
God...

521
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,280
Oh yeah,

522
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,400
perfect!

523
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,160
Nice!

524
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,960
Awesome!

525
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,440
See.

526
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,920
That's how it's done.

527
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,840
Hey, don't nuke

528
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
everything.

529
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,240
Leave a few, Bo.

530
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,040
Eating like a queen.

531
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,840
What about Yudong?

532
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,720
Why didn't you ask him?

533
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,040
No use trying.

534
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,800
He's all big boss now,

535
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,920
always tied up.

536
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,880
Doing who knows what.

537
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,360
Yeah,

538
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,400
hey,

539
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,320
look at this mess.

540
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,760
What?

541
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,120
They're trash-talking you.

542
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,000
I tried to fight back

543
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,840
but these move too fast.

544
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,000
Can't keep up.

545
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,120
Just report them!

546
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,560
Don't

547
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,840
concern yourselves!

548
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,000
Go on,

549
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,440
report them.

550
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,320
Outrageous!

551
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,760
Boss said it today,

552
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,840
you only get haters

553
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,920
when you're hot.

554
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,480
Nobody bothers with nobodies.

555
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,120
I know exactly who it is,

556
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,320
our competitors.

557
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,520
Playing dirty.

558
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,160
Liu Bo's

559
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,040
handling it for me,

560
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,600
don't sweat it.

561
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,400
Got a team for this.

562
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,960
Liu Bo deals with

563
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,920
the comments, reports,

564
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,720
all that jazz.

565
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,120
Mom, for real,

566
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
I'm blowing up.

567
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,760
This afternoon at work

568
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,600
was insane, you know.

569
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,920
My boss had everyone

570
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,560
line up

571
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,600
and clap for me.

572
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,560
I'm bringing in the big bucks!

573
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,720
Really?

574
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,600
I'm on fire!

575
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,720
Straight

576
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,880
to the top!

577
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,240
I'll be the queen bee in no time!

578
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,360
Here we go again.

579
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,800
Just stating facts.

580
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,960
Your dad's still in there.

581
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,800
Bet his legs are gonna

582
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,200
go dead.

583
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,720
He's like a bathroom hermit.

584
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,520
Why does

585
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,000
he camp out in there?

586
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,200
Get him out!

587
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
Dad, we're going to bed!

588
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,200
Food's ready!

589
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,480
Coming!

590
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,240
Every single day,

591
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,280
no wonder Mom

592
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,040
gives you grief.

593
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,200
Even strangers would set you straight.

594
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,520
I'm good.

595
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,240
Spot-on impression

596
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,160
of that

597
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,000
crutch salesman.

598
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,440
Just like him.

599
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,120
Gotta change that toilet seat.

600
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,520
Hard on butt

601
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,640
and freezing cold.

602
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,760
Takes forever to warm up.

603
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,640
I'll get you a new one.

604
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,880
That heated toilet seat

605
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,320
Lady Wan was selling?

606
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,800
Imported!

607
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,640
So nice!

608
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,080
But your mom shot it down.

609
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,480
Listen to you,

610
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,000
"Lady Wan."

611
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,080
You don't even

612
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,640
talk that sweet

613
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,720
to your actual sister.

614
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,760
Such a dinosaur.

615
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,600
She doesn't know anything.

616
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,320
Oh, you're up on Lady Wan!

617
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,280
Impressive!

618
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,320
So what?

619
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,440
I'm even part of

620
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,360
her fan community!

621
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,240
Just eat, will you?

622
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,600
Stick to

623
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,600
being Mom's fan.

624
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,080
No thanks.

625
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,560
See?

626
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,960
She kicked me out of

627
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,520
her fan club

628
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,720
and blocked me!

629
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,160
You're getting famous,

630
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
I'll be your fan.

631
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,760
Sure.

632
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,200
Some place you picked...

633
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,200
our legs are gonna die.

634
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,720
What's the deal

635
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,480
with this

636
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,160
sitting style?

637
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,320
Just wanna treat you

638
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,400
like a VIP.

639
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,320
Here,

640
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,680
a little something!

641
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,400
You laid them?

642
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,480
Stress balls.

643
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,560
Get stressed? Just squeeze.

644
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,400
Yeah, I know these.

645
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,360
Spill it, what's up?

646
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,040
OK.

647
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,680
Got a tiny favor

648
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,560
to ask.

649
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,120
Make it snappy,

650
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,520
time is money.

651
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
You're

652
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,000
a big shot influencer now,

653
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,440
right?

654
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,040
Yup.

655
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,480
You've got connections.

656
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Any way

657
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,880
you could hook us up

658
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,920
with Lady Wan?

659
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,760
Maybe

660
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,640
get her contact info?

661
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,480
If we could

662
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,000
partner up...

663
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,560
with our products...

664
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,400
we could really...

665
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,240
That's all?

666
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,520
Please?

667
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,200
Why didn't Fu Yudong

668
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,560
just ask me himself?

669
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,320
You know how he is

670
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,280
about these...

671
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,760
right?

672
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,000
Feels like getting special treatment?

673
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,120
Jeez,

674
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,520
when's he gonna

675
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,000
start thinking straight?

676
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,200
She scared me!

677
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,480
A ghost, huh?

678
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah, he's just...

679
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,440
forget it, let's drop it.

680
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,360
Drop it?

681
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,120
He's my husband, c'mon!

682
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,200
He's just impossible.

683
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,480
I just... anyway,

684
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,120
didn't even bring it up.

685
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,840
Like before,

686
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,240
I said let's get gifts,

687
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,600
one for his dad,

688
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,640
one for your mom.

689
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,880
Asked him to deliver them,

690
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,440
but no, such a pain.

691
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,560
Had to use delivery

692
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,280
in the end.

693
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,120
What's the deal?

694
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,960
What's this

695
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,280
deep grudge about?

696
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,200
They're family.

697
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,400
Stay out of their mess,

698
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,600
seriously.

699
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,040
It's beyond fixing.

700
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,600
Gotta fix it somehow.

701
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,480
This isn't some

702
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
random person off the street,

703
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,560
nor is it some neighbor,

704
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,920
it's his dad!

705
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,320
They've been together for ages!

706
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,600
Mom's not just some neighbor either!

707
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,040
Exactly!

708
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,560
Why can't he get over it?

709
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,440
Death is a part of life.

710
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,040
- Right?
- Yeah.

711
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,160
What's wrong with

712
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,080
finding new love?

713
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,280
His mom's spirit

714
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,320
would get it.

715
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,800
I've talked myself dry,

716
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
but he wouldn't listen.

717
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:16,920
No way around it.

718
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,320
And honestly,

719
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,680
I'm not just running my mouth.

720
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,640
When I married Cheng Man,

721
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
I told her straight up,

722
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,920
if I ever

723
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,120
end up like that,

724
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,240
do what his dad did,

725
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,040
pull the plug.

726
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,040
She'll be at peace,

727
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,040
plus less burden on the family.

728
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,720
What plug did Uncle Fu pull?

729
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,040
You don't know?

730
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,960
No.

731
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,760
Let's pretend I was never here.

732
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,640
C'mon, I need to know.

733
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,320
I'm Fu Yudong's wife,

734
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,360
this concerns me.

735
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,120
Gimme the eggs.

736
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,160
They seem poisoned...

737
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,560
Hang on,

738
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,800
calling ambulance.

739
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,120
Hello?

740
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,080
OK,

741
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,880
let's make this quick. Gotta run.

742
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,400
Miracle recovery, huh?

743
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,360
Long story.

744
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,760
Then make it short.

745
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,280
[Yudong,]

746
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,080
[that upgrade plan]

747
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,239
[you sent,]

748
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,480
[had the factory check it out.]

749
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,080
[But look,]

750
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,280
[the current samples]

751
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,639
[are killing it,]

752
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,920
[and the process works fine.]

753
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,120
[So maybe]

754
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,199
[let's put this stuff]

755
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,199
[on ice,]

756
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:40,719
[yeah?]

757
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,679
[Daoji told me]

758
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,520
[you guys don't wanna be figureheads.]

759
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,360
[Frankly, stay in your lane,]

760
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,639
[that's key,]

761
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:50,880
[isn't it?]

762
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,000
Fu Yudong...

763
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,560
Sleeping.

764
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,960
We're good together,

765
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,800
aren't we?

766
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,600
Yeah.

767
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,160
If I go before you

768
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,320
someday,

769
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,680
what would you do?

770
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,600
Cut it out

771
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,920
with this crazy talk.

772
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,520
Just sleep.

773
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,080
Death's just

774
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,720
part of life, yeah?

775
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,960
If I

776
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,360
leave first,

777
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,880
promise me

778
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,080
you'll take care of yourself.

779
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,800
I mean it.

780
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,080
Won't happen

781
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,840
on my watch.

782
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,880
Even if you

783
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,320
jumped off a cliff,

784
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,520
I'd kick you back up.

785
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,960
You're not Superman.

786
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,320
If I got something

787
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,280
incurable,

788
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,960
what could you possibly do?

789
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,360
What did my dad tell you?

790
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,680
I was too curious,

791
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,640
asked Li Daoji,

792
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,880
and he told me everything

793
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,480
about you and your dad.

794
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,600
Zhang Ran,

795
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,080
you're a terrible liar, y'know?

796
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,480
I'm not lying.

797
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,480
Truth is,

798
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,440
before coming back,

799
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,280
I didn't think

800
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
much of your dad either.

801
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,440
Don't wanna talk about it.

802
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,560
After I came back

803
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,840
and met him,

804
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,760
he seems nice.

805
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,440
Not like what you think

806
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,320
or what you've said.

807
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,640
So I really wanna know

808
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,960
what's your trigger,

809
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,040
what's this thing

810
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,720
you can't get past?

811
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,760
We're married,

812
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,480
please open up to me.

813
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,520
Tell me,

814
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,440
and once I get it,

815
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,320
I'll stop wondering.

816
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,520
Can we drop this?

817
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,280
Let's sleep.

818
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,200
Don't wanna talk about it.

819
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,520
Honey,

820
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,040
this thing's

821
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,440
been eating at you

822
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,440
for years,

823
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,680
I get why you can't move on.

824
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,440
But sometimes

825
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
when I look at your dad...

826
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,200
When he had to

827
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:33,680
pull her plug,

828
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,360
wasn't that...

829
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:34,960
That's enough!

830
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
A tough call for him?

831
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,400
This isn't your business.

832
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,880
You don't get to make peace for me.

833
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm not trying to.

834
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,160
This is just what I think.

835
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,640
Is that wrong?

836
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,480
Why are you being such a coward?

837
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,800
He's your flesh and blood.

838
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,840
He's your dad!

839
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,000
Your own father!

840
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,880
I just want peace

841
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
between you and your dad,

842
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,840
Is that so wrong?

843
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,320
Don't need peace with him,

844
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:00,720
alright?

845
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,640
What do you need then?

846
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,720
Tell me.

847
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,040
You've done this

848
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,840
multiple times.

849
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,760
I've told you,

850
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,520
this ain't your

851
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,200
business.

852
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,400
But you keep

853
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,480
pushing,

854
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
I'll say it one last time,

855
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,760
anything about my mom

856
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,160
is off limits, got it!

857
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,640
Alright, Fu Yudong.

858
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,080
I won't bring up your mom.

859
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,600
I've been trying to

860
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,560
change myself lately,

861
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,240
and suddenly

862
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,600
everything just clicked.

863
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,120
You just won't make an effort

864
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,480
to make a change.

865
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,440
You're scared to face things!

866
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,280
With your dad,

867
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,280
your family stuff,

868
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,360
moving back to Canada,

869
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,600
even your work,

870
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,760
it's always been this same issue!

871
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,640
Life's full of stuff

872
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,720
we don't wanna

873
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,040
deal with,

874
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,760
but you gotta change to make it.

875
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,480
I know

876
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,760
you hate hearing this,

877
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,720
but you know

878
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,320
I'm right.

879
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,200
Are you doing this for me?

880
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,200
Aren't I?

881
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,120
You're trying to show off

882
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,080
how good you are.

883
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,680
Fu Yudong...

884
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,800
Problems nobody else can fix,

885
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,000
You just wave your magic wand!

886
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:01,840
Years of

887
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,040
deep-rooted issues?

888
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,480
Poof! Gone!

889
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,880
My, aren't you just special?

890
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,280
But I'm telling you!

891
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,520
About my own stuff,

892
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:10,920
I'm saying this seriously,

893
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,680
one last time!

894
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,240
Stay out of it!

895
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,280
Fu Yudong...

896
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,360
Fu Yudong!

897
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:45,920
Fu Yudong?

898
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,520
Why are you up so early?

899
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,320
Don't look,

900
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,400
you'll ruin the surprise.

901
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,960
What're you making?

902
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,280
The surprise is gone!

903
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:53,720
Just one look,

904
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,520
come on!

905
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,360
OK, didn't see a thing.

906
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,760
Who was talking to me?

907
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,560
I love you!

908
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,920
Enjoy.

909
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,760
Honey, what're you eating?

910
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,400
Got my own, yeah.

911
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,640
Let me see.

912
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,160
I'll have that.

913
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:01,800
I want it too.

914
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,440
- C'mon!
- I want this.

915
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,600
Always wanting what others have.

916
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,760
You've got your own.

917
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,480
If you don't eat it,

918
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,360
I made it for nothing.

919
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,960
This looks a bit raw.

920
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,200
I like that better. Here.

921
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,480
Raw?

922
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,280
This is Eggs Benedict!

923
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:13,960
You have no idea

924
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,960
how many eggs

925
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,040
I wasted

926
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,240
making just this one?

927
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,680
Was trying to show off

928
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,160
my cooking skills...

929
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,440
Thanks, babe.

930
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,600
Don't spoil

931
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,560
the romantic vibe.

932
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,840
Give it back!

933
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,360
I love Chow Fan.

934
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:43,920
That's mine.

935
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,400
I can finish it all.

936
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,480
Give it back.

937
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,960
Let go. Don't waste it.

938
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,280
Hey...

939
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,840
my cholesterol

940
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,320
won't go crazy, right?

941
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,440
Maybe for others,

942
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,080
but not you.

943
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,600
How come?

944
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,880
All that shopping,

945
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,160
racking up those miles,

946
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,840
you're actually abusing cholesterol!

947
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,280
And you work hard too,

948
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:57,880
you burn it too.

949
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,440
Well then,

950
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,240
this isn't even enough!

951
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,560
This feels like a skit.

952
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,080
Less talking, more eating!

953
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,680
Got cash to chase!

954
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,480
This is yours!

955
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,320
Let go!

956
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,520
Have some bread.

957
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,280
Don't want it.

958
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:17,600
C'mon!
