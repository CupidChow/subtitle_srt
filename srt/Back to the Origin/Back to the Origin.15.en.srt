1
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,360
[First time home in six years.]

2
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,720
[Welcome back.]

3
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,880
Yeah,

4
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,520
your slippers.

5
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,120
I'll take the purse.

6
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,880
Thanks.

7
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,160
No need for that.

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,640
Place looks clean.

9
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,720
Yeah?

10
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,360
I cleaned all day

11
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,560
for you.

12
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,440
C'mon,

13
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,960
rest up.

14
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,600
I'll fix us something to eat.

15
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,440
Something light,

16
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,320
how about noodles?

17
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,920
We could go out.

18
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,200
You gotta be hungry.

19
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,880
I'll make you

20
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,560
quick noodles.

21
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,360
Sure.

22
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,840
I'll start now.

23
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,320
Checking my phone?

24
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,920
Just...

25
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,840
checking time.

26
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,680
You need reading glasses?

27
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,400
Huh?

28
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,399
Need reading glasses now?

29
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,040
What?

30
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,839
Whose are these?

31
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,880
Glasses? No idea.

32
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,320
These are reading glasses.

33
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,400
Where did these...

34
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,080
yours?

35
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,320
Mine?

36
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,920
Can't see through them.

37
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,720
No way

38
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,680
they're mine.

39
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,640
It's fishy.

40
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,680
[I've no idea...]

41
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,320
Don't need

42
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,440
to turn.

43
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,680
Stop here.

44
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,640
OK.

45
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,280
Continue?

46
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,880
Yes.

47
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:34,680
OK.

48
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,480
Who's "Sunny Butterfly?"

49
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,600
She's just

50
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,920
someone from

51
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,880
my photo club.

52
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,600
We take photos together.

53
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,320
Oh, she feels

54
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,560
"so bad"

55
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,880
about losing your jacket.

56
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,400
It's not what you think.

57
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,160
I just lent her

58
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,440
my UV jacket.

59
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,600
She lost it and

60
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,840
offered to replace it.

61
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,400
Why were you

62
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,840
lending her anything?

63
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,160
It was burning!

64
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,440
Not your problem,

65
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,720
is it?

66
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,920
She ain't got one.

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,280
Since when is that

68
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,760
your concern?

69
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,520
Just a jacket,

70
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,480
why make a fuss?

71
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,080
Just a jacket?

72
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,800
Texting about

73
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,280
a "jacket" at 9 PM?

74
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,080
Yeah, right!

75
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,800
Who buys

76
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,240
that excuse?

77
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
Maybe she's

78
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,640
tied up during the day.

79
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,640
That was her free time

80
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,159
or...

81
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,200
You seem to know

82
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,440
her schedule well, huh?

83
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,040
What's the deal?

84
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,000
Just a jacket.

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,720
Why are you making such a fuss?

86
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,960
How'd you like it

87
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,400
if I did something like this?

88
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,200
You're checking my phone,

89
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,320
how should I feel?

90
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,360
Fine. Won't check anymore.

91
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,560
I won't care at all.

92
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,240
ALRIGHT?

93
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,240
About the job hunt.

94
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,080
Just

95
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,200
take your time.

96
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,720
But maybe...

97
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,040
you shouldn't crash at their place

98
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,720
forever.

99
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,720
Why not rent your own place?

100
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,440
Can't afford it.

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,800
C'mon,

102
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,480
Daddy's got your back!

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Might make it

104
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,960
easier to

105
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,480
break the news to

106
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,080
your mom.

107
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,120
How?

108
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,360
[You know Mom.]

109
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,360
[Well...]

110
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,200
Xinying?

111
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,400
You're not in Canada?

112
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,480
[Well...um...]

113
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,720
What's happened?

114
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,400
She's at Li Manfei's

115
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,520
and you knew it?

116
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,720
Kinda.

117
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Don't "kinda" me!

118
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,840
Did you know

119
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,039
or not?

120
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,039
Simple question!

121
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,120
I knew it.

122
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,480
Lu Xinying!

123
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,680
Six years in Canada! I did

124
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,680
everything,

125
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,480
your laundry, cooking,

126
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,480
driving, everything!

127
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,200
Now everyone's in

128
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
on the secret

129
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,160
except me!

130
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,480
Do you think it fair?

131
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,960
That's not...

132
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,240
Hands off!

133
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,560
This is exactly why I didn't

134
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,280
tell you...

135
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,240
What?

136
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,880
Look me in the eye.

137
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,080
Do you feel comfortable with that?

138
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,000
Stop signaling!

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,880
Over here,

140
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,200
where I can see you, now!

141
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,200
Some father

142
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,520
you are,

143
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,360
encouraging this.

144
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,480
Your phone, now!

145
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,320
Book tomorrow's

146
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,720
earliest flight.

147
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,640
She's leaving for Canada!

148
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,720
You can't mean that.

149
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,440
Mom,

150
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,840
be reasonable!

151
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,000
I am!

152
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,960
I'm being respectful!

153
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,200
I'd be justified

154
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,840
in slapping you

155
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,160
right now!

156
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,040
Easy now, easy.

157
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,120
Y'know?

158
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,000
Did I hit you?

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Quit the drama!

160
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,840
Don't push me!

161
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,160
Young lady!

162
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,040
Push you?

163
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,640
How?

164
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,600
This is your fault!

165
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,280
Let me handle...

166
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,000
Stop the act!

167
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,640
I'll handle her.

168
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,840
Go reflect!

169
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,560
Too late

170
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,040
to parent now!

171
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,240
Fine! I'll leave!

172
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,760
Three minutes to pack

173
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,080
and get down here!

174
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,760
Young lady!

175
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,640
Take three days

176
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,520
to reflect!

177
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,840
Minutes, not days!

178
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,440
Oh, didn't catch that.

179
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,960
Always straddling the fence.

180
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,800
Playing Mr. Nice Guy,

181
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,520
you're the worst!

182
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,480
Let's calm down.

183
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,720
Liar!

184
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,040
Teaching her to lie to me!

185
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,240
C'mon, please...

186
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,440
And Li Manfei's mother,

187
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,240
what a phony,

188
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
putting on a show!

189
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,480
Let's talk in the car.

190
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,200
You'll be my death.

191
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,000
[Yeah,]

192
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,720
[Xinying's]

193
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,160
[no longer with us.]

194
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,400
Could she

195
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,000
get the job back,

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,200
if she

197
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,600
returns?

198
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,800
Any...

199
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,360
any openings?

200
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,320
[We're]

201
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,080
[fully staffed.]

202
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,240
[Not hiring.]

203
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
[Sorry.]

204
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,680
Thanks.

205
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,960
She told you everything already.

206
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,520
Why embarrass her

207
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,080
by calling her coworkers?

208
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,120
Quiet!

209
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,640
[Hello?]

210
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,080
Lily?

211
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,080
[Oh, yes?]

212
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
Can you hear me?

213
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,400
It's Zhou Ailing.

214
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,520
[Oh...right...]

215
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,720
I wanna

216
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,000
inquire about

217
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,400
the Canadian real estate

218
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,200
market.

219
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,560
You helped us buy

220
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,440
that apartment.

221
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,200
Since I'm not there,

222
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,920
what's the market like?

223
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,200
[It's so-so.]

224
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,080
[Tough to sell now.]

225
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,440
[By the way,]

226
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,360
[your daughter]

227
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,320
[switched realtors.]

228
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,720
[Actually I saw]

229
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,840
[your apartment]

230
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,920
[listed online,]

231
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,960
[for rent.]

232
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,880
[Got tenants pretty fast.]

233
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,080
It's rented?

234
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,600
[Yeah, yeah.]

235
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,240
Oh,

236
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,640
I see.

237
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,840
[Are you thinking of selling]

238
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,000
[instead of renting?]

239
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,400
[Leave for good?]

240
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,080
No, just...

241
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,320
let me think it over.

242
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,280
I'll call

243
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,840
if I need anything.

244
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,480
[Sure thing.]

245
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,720
Thanks for your time.

246
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,400
[No problem. Bye.]

247
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,480
Heard that?

248
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,320
Yes.

249
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,240
Rented out.

250
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
That brat!

251
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,720
Don't get

252
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
too worked up.

253
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,520
Cool down first.

254
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,040
Stop talking!

255
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,160
- I'm back, Mom.
- Hi!

256
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,240
Had fun?

257
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,040
Whatever.

258
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,120
Honey,

259
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,520
made you birthday noodles.

260
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,160
- Not hungry.
- One bite...

261
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,880
About Xinying...

262
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,520
I couldn't

263
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
figure out

264
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,480
how to tell you.

265
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,320
Waited for

266
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,520
the right time,

267
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,520
but...

268
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,240
Also,

269
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,120
there's more...

270
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,880
Don't jump to conclusions!

271
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,880
You know,

272
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,000
that startup story?

273
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,800
A lie.

274
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,080
I got laid off.

275
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,600
You lost your job?

276
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,000
No need to repeat it.

277
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,600
At my age,

278
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
finding a decent job

279
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,800
isn't easy.

280
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,120
Been driving

281
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,120
ride-share.

282
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,640
That's why

283
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,440
the front seat's a bit off,

284
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,600
the one you kept talking.

285
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,360
Why hide this

286
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,440
so long?

287
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,840
Why spread

288
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,280
the worry around?

289
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,600
Also, how?

290
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,240
Your husband,

291
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,520
top university grad,

292
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,360
pioneer foreign company exec,

293
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,520
got booted out?

294
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,800
It's OK.

295
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,080
Love driving anyway.

296
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,960
Feel good about this gig.

297
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,840
You didn't have to

298
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,400
do ride-share.

299
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,960
Your back can't take it.

300
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
Had no choice.

301
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,680
Bills to pay,

302
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,840
money for Xinying,

303
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,880
luxury brands for someone

304
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,720
to show off.

305
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,680
I've shouldered it

306
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,760
all alone.

307
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,760
What does that mean,

308
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,840
huh?

309
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,200
That last bit...

310
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,920
I'm freeloading?

311
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
The last bit

312
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,840
was a joke.

313
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,120
Some joke!

314
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,720
So,

315
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,080
who pushed for

316
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,520
overseas education?

317
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,360
Me.

318
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,560
Who made me quit my job?

319
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,320
Still me...

320
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,520
Right? Your calls,

321
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,560
we followed.

322
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,280
Yeah, yeah, I...

323
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,720
Getting all snarky now,

324
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
like I'm some freeloader.

325
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
No, no, you're

326
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
reading too much into it.

327
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,200
I was genuinely joking.

328
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,200
Oh, yeah?

329
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,360
Six years abroad,

330
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,080
you never visited once.

331
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
Heartless!

332
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,040
Was swamped with work.

333
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,880
Then had to

334
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
drive for money.

335
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,080
Enough with your

336
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,280
"busy" excuse.

337
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,120
Who knows what's true?

338
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,640
Those tickets cost so much...

339
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,120
I...

340
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,280
had...

341
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,200
Yeah?

342
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,120
Hi there!

343
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,680
Oh, you're both in!

344
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,120
Yes, yes.

345
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,800
Heard

346
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,080
voices,

347
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,480
thought you'd

348
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,600
returned.

349
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,280
Have a seat.

350
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,839
Please, sit. What's up?

351
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,400
Please.

352
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,920
Well,

353
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,720
here's the thing.

354
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,720
Xiaofeng's

355
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,880
getting married.

356
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,960
Yeah.

357
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,079
So soon!

358
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,680
Congratulations!

359
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,560
He's of age.

360
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,720
Need a place

361
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,920
for marriage.

362
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,960
Thought

363
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,200
this place

364
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,359
would work,

365
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,520
perfect for

366
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,640
keeping close.

367
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,000
Just downstairs.

368
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,520
Yeah.

369
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,640
So we'll

370
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,200
need the house back.

371
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,640
- Got it.
- But...

372
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,520
Happy for the wedding,

373
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,760
but,

374
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,400
remember

375
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,280
our agreement?

376
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,920
We sold the place

377
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,960
at a fair price.

378
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,360
True, true.

379
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,760
You promised

380
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,840
long-term

381
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,920
rental.

382
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,840
Indeed,

383
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,120
really sorry.

384
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,080
You sold

385
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,440
two houses for

386
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,640
Xinying's education,

387
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,240
and when I bought this place,

388
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,360
I promised

389
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,480
you could

390
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,040
stay.

391
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,440
It was your home after all.

392
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,520
But now...

393
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,240
my son's gotta get married...

394
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,640
We get it.

395
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,040
Big moment.

396
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,640
Right, right.

397
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,480
Never even raised the rent

398
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,160
all this time.

399
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,840
True, true.

400
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,120
Tell you what,

401
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,720
last three months

402
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,000
rent-free!

403
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,680
- But...
- Move out in three months?

404
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,120
Yes.

405
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,880
OK,

406
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,840
we'll find a place

407
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,520
and move.

408
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,560
Perfect!

409
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,960
That's settled!

410
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:21,840
Really,

411
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,880
no rent for three months,

412
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,640
I mean it!

413
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
Thanks, thanks.

414
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,400
It's late. I'm off.

415
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,200
Good night!

416
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,800
Good night!

417
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,760
[OK, bye!]

418
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,600
[No need to see me off.]

419
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,520
[Congrats again!]

420
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,360
Thanks.

421
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,280
Xiaofeng's getting married...

422
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,600
So...

423
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,960
Dumbass!

424
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,040
Complete idiot!

425
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,240
Just kill me now!

426
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,880
It's their property.

427
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,000
They've

428
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,560
got right

429
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,800
to have it back!

430
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,120
Mrs. Zhou,

431
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,400
thanks for coming.

432
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,600
We've got

433
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,640
a big crowd today.

434
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Only you could handle

435
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,920
this many people.

436
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,160
Not really,

437
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,880
just a bit

438
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,960
more experienced.

439
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,280
Nah,

440
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,400
too humble.

441
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,720
Everyone says

442
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,600
you and your daughter are their inspiration.

443
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,240
This way.

444
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,120
Mrs. Zhou,

445
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,880
feeling OK?

446
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,880
Oh yeah,

447
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,680
where's my seat?

448
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,080
There, follow me.

449
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,520
Please.

450
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,520
Mrs. Zhou, up there...

451
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,000
Mrs. Zhou, stage seating.

452
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,280
Now?

453
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,920
Yeah, everyone's waiting.

454
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,440
C'mon.

455
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,480
Mom, hear this,

456
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,080
Xinying's mom showed up!

457
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,400
I'm here with my students

458
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,640
performing.

459
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,560
[Now,]

460
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,320
[our regular speaker,]

461
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,040
[Mrs. Zhou,]

462
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,360
[sharing]

463
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,240
[her experience!]

464
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,440
Let me take that purse.

465
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,680
Thanks.

466
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,320
[Please sit here.]

467
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,160
[Round of applause!]

468
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,120
Hello,

469
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,480
I'm...

470
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,520
Give me this.

471
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,640
Will get you a new one.

472
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,120
All good!

473
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
Hello,

474
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,080
I am...

475
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,240
She's giving a speech...

476
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,120
I'm...

477
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,240
Lu Xinying's mother...

478
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,520
Name is...

479
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,840
No medicine box in trash.

480
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:57,960
You skipped

481
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,920
insulin again?

482
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,920
Not needed every day.

483
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,280
Since when are you the doctor?

484
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,760
It's out!

485
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,680
I don't buy it!

486
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,960
Look yourself.

487
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,040
Gone for days.

488
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,920
Tell me the name.

489
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,680
I'll get some.

490
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,920
Not covered by insurance.

491
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,680
No money!

492
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,880
Where's

493
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,120
Dad's IOU

494
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,800
you mentioned?

495
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,600
His stuff,

496
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,240
not mine.

497
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,360
How should I know?

498
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,680
Tell him to find it.

499
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,320
Stop messing around.

500
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,280
I'm trying

501
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
to help.

502
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,600
He...

503
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,960
used to clean

504
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,400
pigeon poop

505
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
on the roof.

506
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,480
Check fertilizer container?

507
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,920
Having fun?

508
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,640
What's the point of tricking you!

509
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:52,960
Hello.

510
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,680
Hello.

511
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,640
Mr. Ge?

512
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,280
Yes.

513
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,680
I'm Mr. Chen's secretary.

514
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,320
He wants to

515
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,520
check your IOU

516
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,960
with accounting.

517
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,720
We'll transfer

518
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,560
your money

519
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,120
after verification.

520
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,680
OK,

521
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,720
here it is.

522
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,760
Tell accounting,

523
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,520
no late fees needed,

524
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,560
just return

525
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,480
the money quickly.

526
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,120
Please

527
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,200
wait here a bit.

528
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,560
OK.

529
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:11,920
OK.

530
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,640
Thanks.

531
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,320
Hi.

532
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,520
Hello, sir.

533
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
Can you call and

534
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,160
ask about

535
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,240
my money?

536
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,240
What's going on?

537
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,200
One moment.

538
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,640
Got it.

539
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,520
Sir,

540
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,400
no unscheduled

541
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,760
visits today.

542
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,200
Please come another day.

543
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,760
Not visiting,

544
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,080
someone just took my IOU.

545
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,440
Sorry,

546
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,880
this is what

547
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,040
I was informed.

548
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,400
They're have a meeting.

549
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,040
What?

550
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,000
I waited four hours!

551
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,040
Why didn't you say so?

552
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,200
Sorry, sir.

553
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,040
Skip the sorry.

554
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,880
Just return

555
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,560
my IOU,

556
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,720
I'll come another time.

557
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,960
I don't know about any IOU.

558
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,400
Really sorry, sir.

559
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,000
What're you talking about!

560
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,440
What do you mean you don't know?

561
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,560
She changed shifts. It's not...

562
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,160
Changed shifts?

563
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,800
Someone

564
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,600
just took the IOU from me.

565
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,720
We'll call the police if this goes on.

566
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,240
Sir.

567
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,800
Dad, I'm not lying.

568
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,640
The interview went really well today.

569
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,880
I just felt the company

570
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,040
didn't meet

571
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,960
my employment standards.

572
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,280
So I want to keep looking.

573
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,160
Really.

574
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,720
Don't worry about me.

575
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,800
Focus on driving.

576
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,600
Be careful.

577
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,400
Alright. I'm hanging up.

578
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,400
No rush.

579
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,400
Right now,

580
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,560
you don't have solid evidence.

581
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,640
The security footage is broken.

582
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,640
And they all claim

583
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,440
they didn't take anything.

584
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,520
In this situation,

585
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,840
we can't open a case.

586
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,480
They're just taking advantage.

587
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,920
That money is really important to me.

588
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,320
It's for my grandma's medical treatment.

589
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,240
We

590
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,640
won't let this go.

591
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,720
But we need to investigate first.

592
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,640
We'll let you know.

593
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,040
I just learned

594
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,520
what it means to be helplessly cheated.

595
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,120
Is this the so-called

596
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,960
change in social class

597
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,440
making everything different?

598
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,000
We can't just take this lying down.

599
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,280
I have experience with debt collection.

600
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,120
Look, Kuang Dazhi is so sly,

601
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,600
but I got the money back from him.

602
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,120
I'll help you get your money back.

603
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,240
I'm sorry about the Kuang Dazhi thing.

604
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,960
It's in the past.

605
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
You'd still dare to help me?

606
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,840
Of course.

607
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,560
You haven't even fixed your own job.

608
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,400
Can you not

609
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,520
poke at my sore spot?

610
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,600
You just said it yourself.

611
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,920
I think helping you get the money back

612
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,680
is way more fulfilling

613
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,880
than finding a job.

614
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
We've got nothing to lose.

615
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,120
Let's go find him at his factory.

616
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,400
Don't work here anymore.

617
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,360
Spread the word.

618
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,280
Here, take it.

619
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,200
Young lady,

620
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,640
last time was a misunderstanding.

621
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,640
Let's talk this through.

622
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,640
[This container of cotton]

623
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,560
[is all I have left now.]

624
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,560
[I really can't give you anything else.]

625
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,040
Ge Kaiyang, have you thought about it?

626
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,640
That shady boss

627
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,840
just said

628
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,080
it's now or never.

629
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,480
This is

630
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,440
our only chance today.

631
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,840
If we don't settle this today,

632
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,760
we might

633
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,800
never see him again,

634
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,640
never find him,

635
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,920
and never get the money back.

636
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,280
Ge Kaiyang, say something.

637
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,000
Are you crying?

638
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,440
Just one word.

639
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,120
Money or pride?

640
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,600
Money.

641
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,040
Until we find

642
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,640
a suitable buyer,

643
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,400
this container of cotton

644
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,000
will stay in your warehouse.

645
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,600
You're responsible for the storage fee.

646
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
Hear me out.

647
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,360
Three-month deadline.

648
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,480
After three months,

649
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,280
either we come

650
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,160
take the cotton,

651
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,000
or it's

652
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,080
all yours.

653
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,040
We won't ask for a cent. Deal?

654
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,880
Your cotton here

655
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,920
is all raw material.

656
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,200
We have to sell it to a factory.

657
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,640
That's hard to sell.

658
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,000
If you won't even

659
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,200
cover the storage fee,

660
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,880
just pay up.

661
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,520
Tomorrow I'll get more media

662
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,280
to protest at your company entrance.

663
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,440
Let's go.

664
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,360
Wait, wait.

665
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,240
I really have no money right now.

666
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,720
This raw material

667
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,960
was given to me as payment.

668
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,360
How about this?

669
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,960
You take this container of goods.

670
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,040
I'll cover three months' storage fee.

671
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,600
I'll go with what she says.

672
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,160
Alright?

673
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,400
Okay.

674
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,080
So it's agreed.

675
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,520
I'll go print the agreement.

676
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,800
Do you think

677
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,400
we can sell

678
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,440
all this cotton

679
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,760
in three months?

680
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,000
Have you forgotten what I did

681
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,960
in Canada?

682
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,200
Sell it to the bank?

683
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,640
Ge Kaiyang, no wonder it took you

684
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,880
seven years for your bachelor's. You...

685
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:14,960
Thank you.

686
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
No... No problem.

687
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,840
Who are you looking for?

688
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,720
Hello.

689
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,960
We're raw material suppliers.

690
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,160
We're here to discuss business.

691
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,560
Not interested.

692
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,760
Get out of here.

693
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,200
Stop hanging around. Get out now.

694
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,640
I'll call security if you don't leave.

695
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,320
I'm sorry.

696
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,200
Sir.

697
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,400
Hello.

698
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,560
Are you out of your mind?

699
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,440
Sorry, we have

700
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,560
1.5 tons of cotton.

701
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,480
Raw material. Very high quality.

702
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:58,800
Not interested.

703
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,640
Would you like to see?

704
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,600
We... We have inspection reports.

705
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,200
Take a look.

706
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,360
Sir, please have a look.

707
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,560
It's legitimate!

708
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,920
Ge Kaiyang, stop chasing him!

709
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,920
Don't stress about it too much.

710
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,600
I never

711
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,000
really expected to get that money back.

712
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,960
No. I promised

713
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,080
I'd help you get it.

714
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,400
I have a bachelor's in economics.

715
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,600
And I can't even sell

716
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,720
one box of cotton.

717
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,520
Do you think I'm a total disgrace?

718
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,280
Not at all.

719
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,000
Look, this job posting

720
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
seems like a good fit for you.

721
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,840
Overseas returnees preferred.

722
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,120
I submitted my resume.

723
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,360
Never heard back.

724
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,440
It's not like

725
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,640
I can't find a job.

726
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,600
I just haven't found the right fit.

727
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,360
Mom, your delivery.

728
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,840
I didn't order anything.

729
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,200
I didn't either.

730
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,560
Coming.

731
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,640
Hello, are you Manfei?

732
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,160
I'm... I'm Xinying's dad.

733
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,000
Well, is Xinying here?

734
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,480
Freshwater Giant Prawn.

735
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,160
Stir-Fried Double Crispy Delights.

736
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,080
And I added

737
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,840
a Seafood Steamed Egg for you.

738
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,640
Dad, I'm allergic to eggs.

739
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,920
I don't know how it happened.

740
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,280
When I was in Canada,

741
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,680
I ate something once

742
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,480
and broke out in a rash all over.

743
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,000
Got tested at the hospital.

744
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,720
Said I'm allergic to eggs.

745
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,040
When did it happen?

746
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,080
Second year of high school in Canada.

747
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,760
My body

748
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,120
wanted to fit in more than I do.

749
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,960
Because foreigners

750
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,400
often have allergies

751
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,600
to eggs or milk.

752
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,360
Alright. I'll change it.

753
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,880
Okay.

754
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,000
Dad, you didn't drive today?

755
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,360
I'm off today.

756
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,800
Alright. Let me.

757
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,560
Here.

758
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,400
That's enough.

759
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
You drink too?

760
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,960
I'm 26.

761
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,080
Come on.

762
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,480
Come on.

763
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,760
After you went back with Mom last time,

764
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,080
did you two continue...

765
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,320
Did you drink like this in Canada too?

766
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,240
The legal drinking age in Canada is 19.

767
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,440
I could buy

768
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,520
my own alcohol

769
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,000
back in 2017.

770
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,800
Dad, I'm asking you.

771
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,720
What did Mom say after you went back?

772
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,920
We had a nice chat.

773
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,560
Didn't fight.

774
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,640
She just told me to sleep on the couch.

775
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,440
Still hasn't spoken to me.

776
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,400
Last time at the convenience store,

777
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,960
you just drank the soup from the oden.

778
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
Here I am treating you to a meal,

779
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,560
and you're allergic to the dish.

780
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,480
What kind of father am I.

781
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,000
It's fine.

782
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,560
Do you remember

783
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
the last time

784
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
we had a proper meal together?

785
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,440
Last time?

786
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,360
Before I went abroad?

787
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,040
At...

788
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,960
that...

789
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,840
Lucheng Kitchen

790
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,520
And Aunt and Uncle were there too.

791
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,360
We didn't get a private room that day.

792
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,640
Mom scolded us for it.

793
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,880
No, I mean

794
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,360
just the two of us, alone.

795
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,320
Alone.

796
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,480
Back when you were in elementary school.

797
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,320
I had just been promoted to manager.

798
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,120
Probably 2007.

799
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,320
On Teacher's Day,

800
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,440
your mom had an event at school.

801
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:38,960
She told me

802
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,960
to pick you up from piano lessons

803
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,040
and take you to eat.

804
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,440
Remember?

805
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,520
And you said you wanted spicy hot pot.

806
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,440
I said no way.

807
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,720
Your mom definitely wouldn't allow it.

808
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,520
We argued

809
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,800
and you ended up crying.

810
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,560
But later,

811
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,440
we still went to eat spicy hot pot.

812
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,160
Right.

813
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,880
Yeah? When we got home,

814
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,680
you kept telling me

815
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,480
not to let Mom find out.

816
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,040
We brushed our teeth like crazy,

817
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,720
over and over.

818
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,320
I even washed our clothes.

819
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,480
Afraid she'd smell it.

820
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,360
When Mom got back, she asked me

821
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,679
why you were

822
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,040
acting so nice

823
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,679
and whether he felt guilty for something.

824
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,639
She asked me

825
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,239
where we ate

826
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,239
and if we met

827
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,320
any pretty women.

828
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,400
Your mom is just like that.

829
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:25,920
She

830
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,679
overthinks.

831
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,960
Always suspicious of everything.

832
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,120
Dad, you ordered so much.

833
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,000
We won't finish it.

834
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,239
We'll take our time.

835
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,239
Alright.

836
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,679
Let me get that. Thanks.

837
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,360
Thank you.

838
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,040
Here.

839
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,480
Okay. Eat something.

840
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,239
Here.

841
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,560
I'm happy to eat with you.

842
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,960
And

843
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,680
you can even have a drink with me.

844
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,720
But we can't

845
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,280
let your mom stay home unhappy

846
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,480
by herself, right?

847
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,960
What if she gets sick after a while?

848
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,920
So I think

849
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,200
we need to figure out a way

850
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
to calm her down.

851
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,240
Mom's always been like that.

852
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,640
If things don't go her way,

853
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,760
she's unhappy.

854
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
The only way

855
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,880
to make her happy right now

856
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,680
is for me to get back to Canada.

857
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,120
No, no.

858
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,400
That's not what I meant. I...

859
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,640
She's just worried about you.

860
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:37,880
You snuck back here

861
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,280
all by yourself

862
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,960
and are staying at a friend's place.

863
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,560
And now you don't have a job.

864
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,560
Of course, I know

865
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
you're trying to find one.

866
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,800
Dad, I really don't think

867
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,000
this is about the job.

868
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,800
Right.

869
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,720
But we need to put your mom's mind

870
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,640
at ease.

871
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,360
I think you could

872
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,800
give in a bit and apologize to her.

873
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,880
Just because I won't go back to Canada?

874
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,120
Shouldn't it

875
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,920
be my own decision, Dad?

876
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,360
Yes.

877
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,320
I understand your point of view.

878
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,640
But look,

879
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,960
when you went to study,

880
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,760
your mom quit her job

881
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,680
to be with you there for six years.

882
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,320
That means she basically

883
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,200
had no personal life

884
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,920
of her own.

885
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,280
She really gave up

886
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,000
a lot for you.

887
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,160
So you have to understand her.

888
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,600
But I never asked for it.

889
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,160
The decision for me to study in Canada

890
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,560
was made by you.

891
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,080
You never discussed it with me.

892
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,560
Just like learning piano.

893
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,880
You arranged everything

894
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,120
and then told me

895
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,960
to take lessons.

896
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:40,960
No.

897
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,280
You know all this.

898
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,720
Besides, you have a talent

899
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,320
for piano.

900
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,240
Even the teacher said so.

901
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,680
You passed level ten.

902
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,280
But I don't like it, Dad.

903
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,720
But you...

904
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,120
never said anything before.

905
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,920
What was I supposed to say?

906
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,120
Mom kept saying

907
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,640
how many months

908
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,560
of your salaries

909
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,960
the piano cost,

910
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,120
how much

911
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,480
the tutor cost,

912
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,680
and how we could've

913
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,760
gone on vacation

914
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,640
like Mr. Qian's family

915
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,400
if we'd saved that money.

916
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,400
How could I told Mom

917
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,840
I didn't like learning piano?

918
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,800
We were afraid

919
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,080
you wouldn't appreciate

920
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,760
the learning opportunity, so...

921
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,560
I complained to her before.

922
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,360
She said

923
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,960
I never

924
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,600
stuck to anything.

925
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,040
She said only by sticking

926
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
with a hobby

927
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,760
could you get good at it.

928
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,360
But piano

929
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,800
was never my hobby.

930
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,120
I get it.

931
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,320
Your mom can be

932
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
a bit stubborn sometimes.

933
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,640
But

934
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:56,960
you really hurt her

935
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,080
this time.

936
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,120
She was so happy

937
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,360
when she found out you were working

938
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,360
at a bank in Canada.

939
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,400
She told everyone

940
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,040
you were her pride.

941
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,480
She even lectured everyone about it.

942
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,400
But with you coming back like this,

943
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,040
it's like

944
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,400
her six years were wasted.

945
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,600
She has nothing to show for it.

946
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,800
Dad, actually,

947
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,800
I tried to please her.

948
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,480
I really tried hard to please her. I...

949
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,920
I wanted to stay in Canada.

950
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,160
I'm not lying.

951
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,080
When I first went to Canada,

952
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,400
Mom told me

953
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,360
not to hang out

954
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,840
with the Chinese kids,

955
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,360
or my spoken English wouldn't improve.

956
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,560
I said okay.

957
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,800
So I hung out

958
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,360
with the foreign kids.

959
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,000
Then she said

960
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,840
because I was hanging out with them,

961
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,880
I wore makeup

962
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,840
and dressed

963
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,600
inappropriately.

964
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,080
She thought I dressed too revealingly.

965
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,680
Then they took me to see

966
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,520
an avant-garde art exhibit.

967
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,920
Then she got mad again.

968
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,280
She said that wasn't something

969
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,920
for someone my age to see.

970
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,800
So,

971
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,960
she wanted me to fit in,

972
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,120
but then she was like this.

973
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,680
Those foreign kids

974
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,720
are all like that.

975
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,400
I... I think

976
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,640
she wants everything on me.

977
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,080
She wants me to be like that,

978
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,880
but also wants me

979
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,760
to live a conventional life

980
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,840
like Chinese kids.

981
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,560
Dad, I can't

982
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,400
do anything right.

983
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,520
Whether I try to fit in or not,

984
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,880
it's never right.

985
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,800
Hello.

986
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,040
Get me another bottle of wine.

987
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,600
There, there.

988
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,280
Eat up.

989
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,840
Try this.

990
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,200
Have some shrimp.

991
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,080
Alright, no more talking. Let's eat.

992
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,200
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

993
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:29,720
I'm not.

994
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,640
I'm not.

995
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,120
I don't want to quit my job.

996
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,520
I'm an excellent teacher.

997
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,640
I have a decent job.

998
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,200
Why should I quit?

999
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,880
Besides, I've asked a lot of people.

1000
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,360
Even the principal said so.

1001
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,920
He said kids nowadays

1002
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,880
can just get their bachelor's degree

1003
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,800
at home,

1004
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,240
and then go abroad for a master's

1005
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,880
or PhD later. There's still time.

1006
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,040
I understand.

1007
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,480
That is a common view.

1008
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,120
But I believe

1009
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,680
the earlier she goes,

1010
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,920
the better she can

1011
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,560
settle into life there.

1012
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,160
Think about it.

1013
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,440
If she goes

1014
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,760
after her bachelor's or master's,

1015
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,840
her spoken English won't be

1016
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,320
as good as if she'd grown up there.

1017
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,520
By then, it's hard

1018
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,360
to change.

1019
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,720
Also, if she doesn't

1020
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,160
grow up with local kids,

1021
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,680
how will she have anything in common

1022
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,720
with them later?

1023
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,280
How is she supposed to

1024
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,520
really fit into the local life

1025
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,760
and culture then?

1026
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,840
Most of all, I have another concern.

1027
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,440
Competition in China

1028
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,160
is so fierce these days.

1029
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,000
What if

1030
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,800
Xinying doesn't perform well

1031
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,720
and fails the college entrance exam?

1032
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,440
Why think about

1033
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,720
that "what if"?

1034
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,400
I'm just a bit worried.

1035
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,800
What if she doesn't do well

1036
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,040
and it affects her mindset?

1037
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,160
Going abroad then

1038
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,040
might be even more difficult.

1039
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,080
Right?

1040
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,240
You know

1041
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,480
Mr. Li Bo at our company?

1042
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,200
His son

1043
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,120
and Zhou Hong's daughter

1044
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,960
were sent abroad early.

1045
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,440
Sending Xinying now

1046
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,280
is already considered late.

1047
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,120
They were sent out already?

1048
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,040
And Mr. Li's wife

1049
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,880
is there with their son.

1050
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,600
She quit her job?

1051
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,360
She worked at a foreign company.

1052
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,800
Quit just like that.

1053
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,560
All for the kids.

1054
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,440
Me going over alone?

1055
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,880
A woman by myself?

1056
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,000
My English isn't good.

1057
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,680
I'd be in an unfamiliar place all alone.

1058
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,360
I'm scared.

1059
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,040
I completely understand that.

1060
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,600
Anyone would feel

1061
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,960
out of place

1062
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,600
in a new environment.

1063
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,240
And your teaching job

1064
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,360
is really good and stable.

1065
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,560
But we're doing this

1066
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,440
so that our daughter

1067
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,880
can have a better future.

1068
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:49,840
Right?

1069
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,160
I promise

1070
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,080
I will support

1071
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,800
this family.

1072
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,120
Dad.

1073
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:02,960
Are you okay?

1074
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,080
I slipped again.

1075
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,680
You scared me.

1076
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,560
You barely drank

1077
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,000
that second bottle, did you?

1078
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,880
Of course I drank it.

1079
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,000
You had one glass from the second bottle.

1080
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,480
I drank the rest.

1081
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,280
You've grown up.

1082
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,920
And your tolerance has improved.

1083
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,520
You're better than me now.

1084
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:38,960
Do you know

1085
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,880
why I decided to send you

1086
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,320
to study in Canada?

1087
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,240
Because...

1088
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,680
Because my cousin went there.

1089
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,280
And my high school scores weren't good.

1090
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,920
Listen,

1091
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,280
this decision

1092
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:00,680
was very hard

1093
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,960
for both

1094
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,200
you and me.

1095
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,400
So difficult.

1096
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,440
It meant

1097
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,840
we'd have to live apart.

1098
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,480
There was

1099
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,680
financial pressure.

1100
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,040
But when your mom was pregnant with you,

1101
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,000
she often patted her belly and said,

1102
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,320
"Just don't be a wimp like your dad."

1103
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,520
I immediately said

1104
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,640
that's impossible.

1105
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,280
Your mom and I came to an agreement.

1106
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,040
We decided that once you grown up,

1107
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,800
you could leave

1108
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:32,840
this little town

1109
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,600
and see

1110
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,760
the bigger world

1111
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,120
we've never seen.

1112
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,200
Dad.

1113
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,800
So annoying.

1114
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,760
Dad, I caught you!

1115
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,440
You caught me.

1116
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:02,600
Well...

1117
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,200
I can't even remember

1118
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,120
how long it's been

1119
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,240
since last time I hugged you.
