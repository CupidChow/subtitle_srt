1
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,759
Xiaohe.

2
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,840
Anran wants to see you right now.

3
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,600
I thought I was getting fired.

4
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,720
What does she want now?

5
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,720
But you're doing just fine.

6
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,880
Why would she fire you?

7
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,400
[Xiaohe.]

8
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,720
[My anxiety issue]

9
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,960
[is spread all over the company.]

10
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,440
[You were]

11
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,280
[the only one who knew.]

12
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,600
[How could you do this?]

13
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,640
[They're gossiping about me behind my back,]

14
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,280
[laughing at me.]

15
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,000
[I treated you]

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,240
[like family this whole time.]

17
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,440
[I've been taking care of you,]

18
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,280
[protecting you,]

19
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,040
[sheltering you from harm.]

20
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,920
[How could you]

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,520
[repay me like this?]

22
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,480
Yudong, it's 7 P.M.

23
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,240
Zhang Ran.

24
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,040
The live stream.

25
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,520
Why not go home to watch?

26
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,440
What's the point?

27
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,400
Watching on my phone is the same.

28
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,120
Besides, even if I go home,

29
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
Zhang Ran just ignores me.

30
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,920
I'm better off in her live room.

31
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,520
Throw her a tip every now and then,

32
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,760
and she might even say something to me.

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,040
Say what?

34
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,960
"Thanks, bro."

35
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
So you're her

36
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,560
top tipper?

37
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,400
You got nothing to do.

38
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,000
Why not go home?

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,960
Now I get home

40
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,120
promptly at ten every night.

41
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,600
Cheng Man's asleep by then.

42
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,680
And neither of us

43
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,320
has to talk to the other.

44
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,160
It's nice.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,520
No drama.

46
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,240
Come on, it's not that bad.

47
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,760
Just because you argued

48
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,320
about the kid's school stuff?

49
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,800
Why did you say you liked Cheng Man

50
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,520
in the first place?

51
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,280
Wasn't it because

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,480
she's worldly?

53
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,000
That she knows how to live?

54
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,920
And you? What did you tell me?

55
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,720
You said you liked Zhang Ran's

56
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,640
sense of justice.

57
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,280
That fierce way she argues.

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,440
And I thought to myself

59
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,000
why not just marry Conan the Barbarian?

60
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,800
People change.

61
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,360
Zhang Ran used to be so tough.

62
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,400
And now?

63
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,600
Mimicking cats, dogs, gorillas.

64
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
What a world.

65
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,279
So we both can't go home right now.

66
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,720
Misery loves company, huh?

67
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,880
[Dancing]

68
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,200
[really isn't my strong suit.]

69
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,520
[But, but hey, folks...]

70
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,080
[Well,]

71
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,560
[how about this.]

72
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,040
[Not much of a dancer,]

73
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,800
[just gonna do a jellyfish dance.]

74
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,160
Alright, alright.

75
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,320
Music's ready.

76
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,440
[It's all improvisation.]

77
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,880
[Guys, totally impromptu.]

78
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,200
[No choreography,]

79
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,360
no script.

80
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,720
Nothing. Let's go!

81
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,440
Sorry.

82
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,840
The power just went out.

83
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,000
What now?

84
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,280
Still doing the PK?

85
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,720
How can you dance

86
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,760
in the dark like this?

87
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,520
[It's okay, I can fix this.]

88
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,360
[Give me a moment, guys.]

89
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,360
[Not a scripted bit!]

90
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
[Definitely not.]

91
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,880
[No advance planning at all.]

92
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,000
[It's fine, I'll grab a light.]

93
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,800
Can you all see me now?

94
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,520
Is that better?

95
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
My family's home.

96
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,920
He can fix this.

97
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,560
See? Luck's on my side.

98
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,320
[I really do want to dance,]

99
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,440
[but it's just too dark.]

100
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,640
[You can't see me clearly, right?]

101
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,200
[Tell you what, I...]

102
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,600
[I don't want to ruin the fun.]

103
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
Since she's dancing,

104
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,320
I'll sing a song.

105
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,680
Dancing, singing...

106
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,760
That's fair game, right?

107
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,520
Okay, a song for you all.

108
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400

134

You've probably

135
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
heard this many times,

136
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,000
but I still think

137
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,200
I need to keep saying it.

138
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,920

you'll understand

146
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,160
I was wrongfully accused.

147
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,480
What I said back then

148
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,559
wasn't meant that way.

149

[What I actually wanted to say]

151
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,280
[was that]

152
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,360
as an ordinary person,

153
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,919
if I want to make it

154
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,600
as an influencer,

155
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,600
I have to go all out.

156
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,120
Without

157
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,840
a strong mentality,

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,160
and the courage to risk it all,

159
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,080

160

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,880

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,320
[it was twisted,]

163

I don't really care anymore.

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,760
Well, you're right.

165
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,000
But you do have

166
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,840
other options.

167
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,880
You have

168
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,280
a husband, a family.

169
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,320
No need to come online

170
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,600
and get abused every day.

171
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,440
I often ask myself

172
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,680
if it's worth it.

173
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,920
My husband asks me too.

174
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,560
But honestly? I don't overthink it.

175
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,480
There's just one thing

176
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,960
weighing on my mind,

177
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,120
I just can't let it go.

178
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,760
I'm being straightforward.

179
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
Totally honest here.

180
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,000
Look,

181
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,840
this guy named

182
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,920
"Qubobo" says

183
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,040
I'm ambitious

184
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,840
and vain.

185
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,000
You're right.

186
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,440
That's exactly me.

187
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,200
I am impatient for success.

188
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,040
I am vain.

189
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,240
I want to achieve

190
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,680
what I set out to do.

191
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
In fact, I was so close

192
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,360
to success.

193
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,720
I even got on a show.

194
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,680
I was there, wasn't I?

195
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,960
But it ended as soon as it started.

196
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:50,880
It's like

197
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,040
having a sweet dream

198
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,880
and suddenly getting kicked awake.

199
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,440
I was

200
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,920
about to be famous,

201
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,120
about to make

202
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,680
a fortune,

203
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,720
and then I woke up.

204
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,640
That's exactly how I feel.

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,400
So I can't let it go.

206
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,120
Because all the effort I put in

207
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,160
was real.

208
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,920
So I told myself

209
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,400
I'll

210
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
surrender a bit later.

211
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,240
Before the final moment

212
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,040
arrives,

213
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
I'll grit my teeth

214
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,240
and get back up one more time.

215
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,440
If it doesn't work this time,

216
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,560
I'll see if I have any strength left.

217
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,640
If I do, I'll get up again.

218
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,880
That's just how I am.

219
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,480
That's me.

220
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,800
Vain, impatient for success,

221
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,800
won't stop till I get there.

222
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,840
It's me.

223
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,840
These are my true feelings.

224
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Thank you all so much

225
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,800
for taking the time

226
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
to listen to me,

227
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,800
and for supporting

228
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,040
such an imperfect me.

229
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,960
Thanks for all your encouragement.

230
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,120
Thank you, guys.

231
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,120
Thank you!

232
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I floated around

233
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,240
the acting scene for 4 years.

234
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,360
I also can't let it go.

235
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,760
You know what,

236
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,560
in those four years,

237
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,080
I never got a single role

238
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,160
with actual lines.

239
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,000
So are you thinking

240
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,880
of giving up now?

241
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,640
I'd say

242
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,200
don't give up just yet.

243
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,160
Yeah,

244
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,360
even if you give it one last push,

245
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,280
you might not

246
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,760
succeed,

247
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,600
but think about

248
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,360
all that effort you put in.

249
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,680
If you quit now,

250
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,080
you'll lose that drive for good

251
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,120
when you want to come back to it later.

252
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,680
Doesn't that break you?

253
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,240
I know my beliefs

254
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,680
would crumble.

255
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,480
That's why

256
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,000
I hope you surrender a bit later too.

257
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,680
Give it another try.

258
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,080
So many gifts!

259
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
Oh, Go-Karts!

260
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,240
Thank you, thank you!

261
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,160
8867 8867

262
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,040
Let me say it three times!

263
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,600
8867

264
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,440
Thank you for the cake!

265
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,960
I'll enjoy it, thanks!

266
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,240
Rocket from "Dreamer".

267
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,440
Don't tell me you're gonna survive on

268
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,520
instant noodles for days after this.

269
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,480
Just kidding.

270
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,920
Thank you, "Dreamer".

271
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,440
Thank you for the big rocket!

272
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
I really should

273
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,160
screenshot this scene.

274
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,560
Is it...

275
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,600
Is the PK over already?

276
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,360
Did I win?

277
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,280
Thank you.

278
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,920
Thank you, guys.

279
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,960
This is the first time

280
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,880
I've won a PK.

281
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,960
Thank you for encouraging me.

282
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,600
See? I told you

283
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,640
things would get better.

284
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,680
I knew I could win.

285
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,200
I will now, and I will later.

286
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,120
You will too.

287
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,320
One to zero.

288
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,520
Sorry about that.

289
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,320
Lame.

290
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,560
Can't handle losing?

291
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,640
The first half isn't even over.

292
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,800
Let's go again.

293
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,520
Don't feel like it.

294
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,920
What's up?

295
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,920
You seem a bit down

296
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,960
today.

297
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,400
How did Lady Wan get famous?

298
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
Didn't she say?

299
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,360
Well...

300
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,480
"Era dividends plus personal struggle."

301
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,080
From the interview I sent you.

302
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,000
That's the official story.

303
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,960
I want to know if there's

304
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,480
an easier, faster way.

305
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,320
Why are you asking?

306
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
Ran's

307
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,880
been working so hard lately.

308
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,200
She's finally making some progress.

309
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,760
I think

310
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,840
I should do something to help her.

311
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,480
I'll send you a WeChat contact.

312
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,520
Add him.

313
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,520
What does he do?

314
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,400
I met this guy in

315
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,280
Lady Wan's fan group before.

316
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,600
He's pretty capable.

317
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,080
He can do anything:

318
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,680
gain followers, boost data,

319
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,800
get on trending topics...

320
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,120
Whatever you can imagine,

321
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,920
he can make it happen.

322
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,960
Why don't you buy

323
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,200
300,000 followers for her?

324
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,400
Just give it a try.

325
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,120
Buy followers?

326
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,240
Anything can be bought.

327
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,440
The internet is

328
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,360
about the Matthew Effect, you know?

329
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,640
The bigger her follower base,

330
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,880
the more likely the platform's algorithm

331
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,440
will push her to others.

332
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,360
If she has no followers,

333
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,600
nobody pays attention.

334
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,480
No.

335
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,840
We can't do that.

336
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,520
Huh, interesting.

337
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,880
You asked for a shortcut,

338
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,760
but now you're against it.

339
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Honestly, you're such

340
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,680
a walking contradiction.

341
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,800
What's his name?

342
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,880
"Know-It-All Shao."

343
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,240
Why are there only

344
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,800
around 30 people in my live room?

345
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,200
Why isn't anyone joining?

346
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:10,960
You...

347
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,920
Did you come from

348
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,800
my homepage?

349
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,360
What's going on?

350
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,320
Seriously, what's happening?

351
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,840
Why am I throttled?

352
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,320
What did I do to get throttled?

353
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,520
300,000 followers.

354
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,440
I spent a fortune on those.

355
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,400
I was just trying to help.

356
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,640
Bro,

357
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,880
stop trying to be helpful,

358
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,240
okay?

359
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,480
I finally got some traffic,

360
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,800
and started to make progress.

361
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,840
Can you stop messing with me, bro?

362
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,080
What's wrong with you?

363
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,560
Why do you keep calling me bro?

364
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,400
Can those other guys compare to me?

365
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,520
I'm the best bro you've got.

366
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,840
That guy said even

367
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,640
Lady Wan bought followers

368
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,360
from him.

369
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,680
First,

370
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,760
that guy might not be telling the truth.

371
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,520
Second,

372
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,480
time has changed.

373
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,040
Lady Wan's era is past.

374
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,080
You're always holding me back!

375
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,400
What am I supposed to do now?

376
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,760
So what now?

377
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,560
I'm throttled for three days.

378
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,480
Can't stream at all.

379
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,720
Only three days?

380
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,160
"Only"? You…

381
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,720
Do you just hate seeing me succeed?

382
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,560
I only had around

383
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,040
30 people in my live room.

384
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,920
You suddenly bought me 300,000.

385
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,080
Of course they'd flag me.

386
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,120
I already had no traffic.

387
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,520
Couldn't even get matched for PKs.

388
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,320
Now I have no one to chat with.

389
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,920
Who am I gonna talk to?

390
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,080
Myself?

391
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,960
Talk to me. I'll keep you company!

392
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,880
Don't think my three-day break

393
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
gives you an opening,

394
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,400
you know?

395
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
An opening for what?

396
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,760
To get close? I've been guarding

397
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,520
an empty nest to support your career.

398
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,480
I'm used to it by now.

399
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,120
I'm practically desireless, okay?

400
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,760
Now, every time I see you,

401
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,800
I think of a gorilla.

402
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
I just mimic it well.

403
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,200
That doesn't mean I am one. Got it?

404
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,800
You're more gorilla than a gorilla.

405
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,400
Gorillas learned from you.

406
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,760
Wanna know what I'll do

407
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,320
during my three-day break?

408
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,760
What?

409
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,480
I'll beat you up!

410
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,240
Come on, try it!

411
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,840
Come and get me, big ape!

412
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,160
You're so annoying!

413
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,640
Get over here!

414
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,600
Come and get me, big ape!

415
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,760
Catch me if you can!

416
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,120
Missed me!

417
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,280
Be careful.

418
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,880
[Hey, "Moonlit Night",]

419
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,000
[please think twice before]

420
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,840
[sending gifts.]

421
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,240
[Don't wrong yourself for me.]

422
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,880
Zhang Ran is really

423
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,760
a cockroach you can't kill.

424
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,800
But it seems she was

425
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,800
throttled recently.

426
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,400
Why's that?

427
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,640
Apparently bought 300k bot followers.

428
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,880
Clumsy move,

429
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,119
but commendable courage.

430
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,359
I like her more and more now.

431
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,680
So how many

432
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,720
real followers does she have?

433
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,520
Not many,

434
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,200
around 3,000.

435
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,560
3,000.

436
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,160
Sounds like a small number,

437
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,320
but these are all fans

438
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,080
who've stuck with her through the lows.

439
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,400
Exactly.

440
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,200
So they're a purified,

441
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,960
loyal base.

442
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,040
Keep an eye on her.

443
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,400
Sure, I will.

444
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,520
These are real fans who can be monetized.

445
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,480
I'll get back to work then.

446
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,880
Now she's doing acrobatics too?

447
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,240
Come on, let's celebrate.

448
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
My live room's

449
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,480
throttling being lifted.

450
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,560
This soda is flat.

451
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,720
Let's celebrate!

452
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,720
Yeah.

453
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,080
So happy.

454
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,920
Thank you! Thank you!

455
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,720
About that throttling,

456
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,280
it's over.

457
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,120
Let's move on.

458
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,600
It's a long story.

459
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,400
No sabotage or framing.

460
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,520
No, really.

461
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,880
No conspiracy.

462
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,720
Seriously.

463
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,000
My video was

464
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,160
maliciously edited before,

465
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,040
but that's

466
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,200
all in the past now.

467
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,120
Lin Anran...

468
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,120
Let's not bring up others here.

469
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,720
Okay?

470
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,240
I think

471
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,600
I should look forward.

472
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,160
Focusing on myself is what matters most.

473
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,520
[Now that I have your support,]

474
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,840
[I'm so happy.]

475
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
[I've been watching]

476
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,160
[Zhang Ran's streams lately.]

477
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
[Liu Bo was right.]

478
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,240
[As someone who knows the truth,]

479
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,240
[staying silent]

480
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,160
[is condoning injustice.]

481
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,680
[I should, and I'm obligated to]

482
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,800
[post it online,]

483
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,160
[let people know the truth.]

484
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,960
Hello, Bo.

485
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:56,920
Who?

486
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,560
Oh my god.

487
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,080
Anran, we can't keep up

488
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,080
with all these comments to delete.

489
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,720
Reached 22 on the trending chart.

490
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,640
Rising too fast, out of control.

491
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,200
Keep deleting!

492
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
I'll hire more trolls.

493
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,560
We can only

494
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,440
push other topics up to cover it.

495
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,240
Then find other topics.

496
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,680
We're out of topics.

497
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,560
I was such a fool.

498
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,280
I was just too kind back then.

499
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,960
I treated her like

500
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,800
my own little sister.

501
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,640
Even when she made mistakes,

502
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,760
I never really

503
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,520
punished her.

504
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,760
Never thought she'd

505
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,440
bite the hand that feeds her.

506
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,040
Everyone in the company knows

507
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,120
about my anxiety.

508
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
She's the one who spread it.

509
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,680
Even so,

510
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,240
I was just angry,

511
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,960
fired her,

512
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,800
thinking I'd bring her back

513
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,720
once I cooled down.

514
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,960
Just to teach her a lesson.

515
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,920
And what does she do?

516
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,600
Turns around and bites me!

517
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,240
What does she want?

518
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,920
As her sister, I just

519
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,080
criticized her a bit.

520
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,160
What's the big deal?

521
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,880
Why make netizens attack me?

522
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,280
Put your phones away. Stop filming!

523
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,400
Stop filming!

524
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,680
What's wrong?

525
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Get out!

526
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,840
What's happening?

527
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,760
Relax, relax.

528
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,320
Let it out. That's good.

529
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,080
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

530
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,560
Relax, relax, relax.

531
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,640
It's okay. Relax, relax.

532
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,360
Inhale, inhale, inhale.

533
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,200
Good, slow down.

534
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,440
Okay.

535
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,080
You have to trust us,

536
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,440
trust Tide Media.

537
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,720
The company is your

538
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,080
strongest backup.

539
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,960
Don't speak for now.

540
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,080
Just listen to me.

541
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,800
Have some soda.

542
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,520
Dan, the breathing thing,

543
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,240
what's that called?

544
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,640
Abdominal breathing.

545
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,440
Abdominal breathing.

546
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,000
Okay.

547
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,760
Right.

548
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,040
Just focus on breathing.

549
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,080
And listen to me.

550
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,400
Have some water.

551
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,440
The company has a lawyer

552
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,680
talking to Xiaohe.

553
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,000
Everything is under control.

554
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,120
The lawyer said

555
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,400
the video

556
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,720
she posted

557
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,560
was recorded secretly.

558
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,720
She is infringing copyright.

559
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,680
Yes.

560
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,760
Legally speaking,

561
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,000
she has to take down the post.

562
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah.

563
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,040
Everything is under control.

564
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,120
Don't worry.

565
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,760
Take a sip of water, easy now.

566
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,360
Slowly.

567
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,000
Easy.

568
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,160
Easy, easy.

569
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,360
Mr. Lin,

570
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,360
I want to go home.

571
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,560
You can go home now.

572
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,360
What about the day after tomorrow?

573
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,280
I don't

574
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,080
wanna do it anymore.

575
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,720
That's still two days away.

576
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,040
In two days,

577
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,440
you'll definitely feel better.

578
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,040
I won't.

579
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,280
My anxiety has been

580
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,720
getting worse and worse lately.

581
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,360
You saw

582
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,960
how I was today.

583
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,880
And it's not

584
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,080
the first time.

585
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,080
It's not.

586
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,720
Let me show you something.

587
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,160
Anran,

588
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,800
look at this.

589
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,440
The company has found ways

590
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,560
to cool down the hype.

591
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,160
And pushed positive topics up.

592
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,840
You're the top star at Tide.

593
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,240
I am your strongest backup.

594
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,400
I believe you

595
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,960
can navigate this storm,

596
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
ride the waves.

597
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,840
You can do it.

598
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,480
You just need to push a little harder.

599
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,080
I really can't do

600
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
this job anymore.

601
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,480
I'm going home.

602
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,720
We all

603
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,560
need a little hardship

604
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,080
to break out of our cocoon.

605
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,720
What doesn't kill you

606
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,520
makes you stronger.

607
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,360
You always wanna

608
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,960
get a higher share, right?

609
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,360
This time, I promise you, at the risk of

610
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,480
board accountability,

611
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,680
if you get through this,

612
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,960
you'll have what you want.

613
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,480
Deal?

614
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,120
It's not about the money.

615
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,400
Really, it's not.

616
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,000
It actually is about money.

617
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,320
Brands have stocked up on goods,

618
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,520
paid for link fees.

619
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,960
If you don't stream,

620
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,920
how much will you have to compensate?

621
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,520
I know you've been through a lot lately.

622
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,280
Go home and rest.

623
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,680
Turn off your phone.

624
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,360
Stay off the internet.

625
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,920
I promise,

626
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,320
when you're back, all will be well.

627
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,120
You'll be even more famous than now.

628
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,560
Really?

629
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
We'll start the new split

630
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,360
the day after tomorrow.

631
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,000
Okay?

632
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,800
Is that okay?

633
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,000
Yeah.

634
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,360
Can I go home now?

635
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,440
Dan, see her out.

636
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,440
Come on.

637
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,760
Take good care of her.

638
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,800
Let me help you.

639
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,960
Put your shoes on.

640
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,680
Dr. Fu.

641
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,720
You left deep impression

642
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,320
on my fans.

643
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,200
Lately when I sell skincare products,

644
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,880
fans still ask

645
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,400
"When will Dr. Fu come back?"

646
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,920
All female fans.

647
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,640
So,

648
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,160
that's why we're here.

649
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,400
Thank you for the invite

650
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,160
to the Double 11 domestic products special.

651
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,560
We're so excited.

652
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,360
Thank you.

653
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,480
Like you said,

654
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,480
I enjoy growing

655
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,160
alongside domestic brands.

656
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,000
Hope we can be of help.

657
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,480
You're a huge help.

658
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,120
Thank you so much.

659
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,800
This time, Lady Wan

660
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,720
plans to offer you

661
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,600
five product links.

662
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,600
After we sign

663
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,680
the initial intent agreement,

664
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,720
I'll follow up with you on

665
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,400
product selection and bundling.

666
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,040
To be honest,

667
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,960
our product prices

668
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,760
are quite affordable.

669
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,440
If we have to guarantee

670
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,280
such a high commission rate

671
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,360
for each product,

672
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,720
we'll need to stock up

673
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,600
a huge amount of inventory.

674
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,880
Every brand is eager

675
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,240
to get into Lady Wan's live room

676
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,880
for sales volume.

677
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,360
Don't worry.

678
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,320
No matter your stock,

679
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:15,880
I can sell it all.

680
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,920
I'm not worried about that.

681
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
I mean,

682
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,000
we'll need to cover

683
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,680
a lot of costs in advance.

684
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,520
I'm afraid...

685
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,720
The Double 11 special

686
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,600
isn't like the charity one

687
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,200
we did last time.

688
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,840
We have to get back to

689
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,000
normal business sense.

690
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
The commission rate

691
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,560
might be high,

692
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,680
but the money doesn't

693
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,760
go to just one person.

694
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,240
Our entire team,

695
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,400
business, customer service,

696
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,080
live stream crew,

697
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,440
hundreds of people

698
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,920
depend on this live room.

699
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,800
Lady Wan really admires you.

700
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,280
She insisted on

701
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,360
giving you this opportunity.

702
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,840
Of course, we know

703
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,920
you're a start-up.

704
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,600
If you're hesitant

705
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,520
about joining this,

706
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,160
we completely understand.

707
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
No concerns at all.

708
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,400
We're definitely in.

709
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,920
We absolutely want to do it.

710
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,560
But

711
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,000
could we talk about

712
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,200
some other options for the pricing?

713
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,160
My fans and I

714
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,760
really like Dr. Fu.

715
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,160
How about this.

716
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,040
We'll waive the link fee.

717
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,520
That's so generous.

718
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,920
It's a deal.

719
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,400
Let's do it.

720
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,600
Thank you, Lady Wan.

721
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,440
Pleasure working with you!

722
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,040
You too.

723
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,240
Li Daoqi, what were you thinking?

724
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,760
You know exactly

725
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,120
what's in the company account.

726
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,680
Stocking so much goods?

727
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,600
Raw materials, production, warehousing,

728
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,120
and logistics. How much will that cost?

729
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,080
Where's the money coming from?

730
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,840
Seriously,

731
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,040
you can't put in another cent.

732
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,360
Nice one, Yudong.

733
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,440
You can read financial reports now.

734
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,600
Those two were putting on a show,

735
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,560
can't you tell?

736
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,280
How terrifying!

737
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,160
Putting on a show.

738
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Not bad, Yudong.

739
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,800
You even saw through that.

740
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,360
You know what,

741
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,800
I really think you're

742
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,840
cut out for business.

743
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,320
If you'd come back earlier,

744
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,240
you might've made it big by now.

745
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,800
Cut the crap. Tell me,

746
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,680
what about the money?

747
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,360
No need to worry.

748
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,120
Xing Kai's got it.

749
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,440
Xing Kai won't pay a cent.

750
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,960
Michael is his guy.

751
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
And that Michael

752
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,720
has always been

753
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,080
against Lady Wan

754
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,880
live stream deal.

755
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,480
That means Xing Kai is too.

756
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,200
They're in this together.

757
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,480
You saw right through them!

758
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,400
Sharp eyes!

759
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,640
Xing Kai and Michael,

760
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,160
no matter how they act,

761
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,200
they're well aware how vital

762
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,080
it is to be on Lady Wan's

763
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,920
Double 11 livestream.

764
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,200
At next week's meeting,

765
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,040
let's put on a show too.

766
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,400
Help me out.

767
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,120
Let's figure out

768
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,720
how to get the money from Xing Kai.

769
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,720
Honestly,

770
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,320
it's not that simple.

771
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,520
But it's not that hard either.

772
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,080
Take it easy, okay?

773
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:09,719
You know what.

774
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,719
This is what I call

775
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,080
negative thinking.

776
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,719
You always tend to

777
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,480
think of

778
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,560
the worst-case scenario.

779
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,920
Oh no, are we on

780
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,800
the elevated road?

781
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,040
It's on you.

782
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,600
You were distracting me.

783
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,560
So what now?

784
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:28,600
Forget it.

785
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,280
Let's go on a day trip.

786
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,239
Enjoy the scenery, clear our minds.

787
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,600
Before your stream,

788
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,560
can we talk?

789
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,760
Need your opinion.

790
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,160
Lady Wan agreed

791
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,160
to let us join

792
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,600
their Double 11 stream.

793
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,520
Should be great news,

794
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,360
but when I saw the contract,

795
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,160
I was shocked.

796
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,600
Now I see why

797
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,720
so many want

798
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,520
to be influencers

799
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,560
and sell live.

800
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,240
One live room like that,

801
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,040
earns in a night

802
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,560
almost as much as

803
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,120
some listed firms'

804
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,040
yearly revenue.

805
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,520
Yeah, I get it.

806
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Li Daoqi is super confident

807
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,760
about this,

808
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,080
but I just feel uneasy.

809
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,040
It feels like a

810
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,880
big gamble.

811
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,720
What if we lose?

812
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,720
Is this what doing business is like?

813
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,920
Why do I feel so insecure?

814
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,200
Don't worry.

815
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:51,840
I know I shouldn't

816
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,920
hold us back now,

817
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,200
but I've been reflecting,

818
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,880
I don't think I'm

819
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,880
cut out to be a CEO.

820
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,680
And I'm really

821
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,040
worried about Li Daoqi.

822
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,400
He seems like

823
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,440
a different person from before.

824
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,360
Whenever we talk about this,

825
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,560
he's like a gambler

826
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,920
who's lost his senses.

827
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,960
Was it a mistake

828
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,920
for me to agree to this

829
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,080
in the first place?

830
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,560
Absolutely not!

831
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,680
The company

832
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,120
trained me from scratch.

833
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,720
Dan, I would never

834
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,880
sabotage the company

835
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,160
at a time like this.

836
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,680
I won't do anything.

837
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,120
I mean it, believe me.

838
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,040
Contact me if anything comes up.

839
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:29,960
Goodbye.

840
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,800
Xiaohe

841
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,840
wrote a long post online

842
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,040
accusing Lin Anran.

843
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,600
She was going to post

844
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,000
the full version of that video

845
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,480
we filmed earlier.

846
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,760
It's already up.

847
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,240
Once this is out, I'm cleared.

848
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,160
But Lin Anran is in trouble.

849
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,440
Trending for a day,

850
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,280
getting torn apart.

851
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,120
Qian Dan asked if I could

852
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,520
avoid mentioning this

853
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,280
during the live stream.

854
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,040
I said okay.

855
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,280
She's truly the company's top star.

856
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,160
When I was in trouble,

857
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,480
no one helped me

858
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,720
cool down the hype.

859
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,400
You've been mumbling.

860
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,000
Were you

861
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,360
talking to me?

862
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,880
No, nothing.

863
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,160
Hurry up and eat.

864
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,800
Yeah, just one more bite.

865
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,840
Going for makeup, then live.

866
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,720
Don't worry,

867
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,200
I'll clean up later.

868
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,840
When do you end stream?

869
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,720
No set time, might be late.

870
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,840
Sleep if you're tired.

871
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,560
Don't wait up for me.

872
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,800
Hey,

873
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,000
there's a trending topic today:

874
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,520
["Everyone owes Zhang Ran an apology."]

875
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,000
[See it?]

876
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,280
These kinds of shows

877
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,040
are complicated.

878
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,600
Hard to explain in a few words.

879
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,680
But I hope

880
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,080
my viewers

881
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,920
won't

882
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,200
easily judge

883
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,240
or attack someone.

884
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,720
Sometimes what you see

885
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,160
isn't the whole truth.

886
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,320
So please,

887
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,600
be kind with your words.

888
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,360
Focus more on

889
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,160
the good things

890
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,280
in life instead.
