1
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,520
[How did you]

2
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,360
[end up starving yourself,]

3
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,280
[I wonder.]

4
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,400
Dad,

5
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,640
you're unbelievable.

6
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,880
It's all Shi's fault.

7
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,400
He won't let me stay at his place.

8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,960
So why?

9
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,160
Why did you run away from home?

10
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,680
You can't function without my mom.

11
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,040
Mom takes

12
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,840
care of everything for you.

13
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,800
Now you're living

14
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,600
like a homeless man.

15
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,200
This won't do.

16
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,320
Just go home,

17
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,160
okay?

18
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,840
You're right.

19
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,960
Marriage is about

20
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,640
understanding each other.

21
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,160
Exactly.

22
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,640
And it's the same with you and Yudong.

23
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,440
It's normal for couples to have conflicts.

24
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,480
Sometimes you

25
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,160
just have to let things slide.

26
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,200
Don't nitpick over

27
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,800
everything.

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,160
Dad, we're talking about you.

29
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,840
How did this become about me?

30
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,600
Why

31
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,079
can't I lecture you?

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,400
Yudong's a good guy.

33
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,600
He's sacrificed a lot

34
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,320
for your marriage.

35
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,440
Now he has a career too.

36
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,000
You should support him

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,920
and understand him.

38
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,560
For marriage to stay solid,

39
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,360
both sides have to give

40
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,800
and make sacrifices.

41
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,640
And honestly,

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,800
this is the moment you

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,280
need to give a little.

44
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,600
Whatever you're unhappy about,

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,760
you just gotta endure it.

46
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,840
Give? Sacrifice?

47
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,920
I've given plenty.

48
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,800
I haven't said anything,

49
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,000
so you don't know about it.

50
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,760
Besides,

51
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,120
this is between us as a couple.

52
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,079
Who's given more,

53
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:31,960
who's given less,

54
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,520
we know that ourselves.

55
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,960
You don't live with us.

56
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,040
What do you actually know?

57
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,360
Stop meddling.

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,560
Just take care of your

59
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,120
own business.

60
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,840
Go home,

61
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,840
and apologize to Mom.

62
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,760
And make it sincere,

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,000
okay?

64
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,120
Alright, let's drop it.

65
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,240
When I get back,

66
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,640
I'll apologize to her.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,600
But

68
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,600
I'm telling you,

69
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,480
you need to think about what I said.

70
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:53,960
Okay.

71
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,200
I will.

72
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,440
Pass me that bowl of rice. Where...

73
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,800
Here, right here.

74
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,200
But you can only have a tiny bit,

75
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,160
or your blood sugar will spike.

76
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,600
No, order me another bowl.

77
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,280
It's not...

78
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,440
It's already too much.

79
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,800
Your blood sugar will go up again.

80
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,600
Eat some veggies first.

81
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,360
Have the rice later.

82
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,320
Eat the greens.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,160
And those ribs are really greasy.

84
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,000
They taste good.

85
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,800
After we're done eating,

86
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,840
I'll give you some cash.

87
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,240
I know all your money's with Mom.

88
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,560
Do they offer seafood here? I want crab.

89
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,640
[Come on, come on.]

90
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:28,960
[You in?]

91
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,240
[Alright, alright.]

92
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,800
Got ten rings?

93
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,320
Yeah, ten rings.

94
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,560
Watch me now.

95
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,320
Give me ten rings.

96
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,720
Scan the code there to pay.

97
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,280
You got this!

98
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,720
Five yuan.

99
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,440
Mr. Zhang?

100
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,760
Miss, you here to play too?

101
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,400
You don't qualify.

102
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,680
Look, all the players

103
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,960
are old folks.

104
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,960
You're too young. Go away.

105
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,080
Mr. Zhang,

106
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,400
this is a public area.

107
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,320
Please keep

108
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,159
the noise down.

109
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,600
Please pause the game for now.

110
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,920
We got complaints from other customers.

111
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,760
We paid.

112
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,960
I paid for this.

113
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,680
You heard what they said.

114
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,680
By the way, Mr. Zhang,

115
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,960
when you have a moment,

116
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,240
please stop by the front desk to

117
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,440
settle the fees for the past two days.

118
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,800
Miss, see this?

119
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,520
Cash.

120
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,000
You think I won't pay?

121
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,800
No, no.

122
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,800
Let's continue.

123
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,280
Whose turn is it now?

124
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,360
- Don't cross the line.
- Ready, go.

125
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,360
Jianbin,

126
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,680
you picked a great spot.

127
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,600
You bet.

128
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,960
Food, drinks, and a place to stay.

129
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,280
Next time I'll pick a fight with my wife,

130
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,920
I'll just come here.

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,600
You?

132
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,760
No way.

133
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:40,840
Why not?

134
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Your wife doesn't like strangers,

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,159
and you don't like bathhouses.

136
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,560
You're so petty.

137
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,159
Easy. Don't rush.

138
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,200
- Take your time.
- Aim carefully.

139
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,920
Don't rush.

140
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,480
Aim for the 100-yuan section.

141
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:05,960
Speak.

142
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,200
[Hey, Mom.]

143
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,480
[That fight was]

144
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,600
[totally Dad's fault.]

145
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,040
[I already talked to him.]

146
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,120
[I told him to really reflect on it.]

147
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,560
[If he doesn't,]

148
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
[don't let him come back.]

149
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,320
[Don't let him in.]

150
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,960
I wasn't planning to let him come back.

151
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
If he comes back, I'm leaving.

152
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,480
[Okay, okay.]

153
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,480
[Mom, don't be angry.]

154
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,240
[We were wrong.]

155
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
[But the thing with Yudong and me]

156
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,480
[is work-related.]

157
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,800
[P-Please understand,]

158
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,160
[okay?]

159
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,400
Stop using work as an excuse.

160
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,240
That's just shameless, you know?

161
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,520
I don't want to see

162
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,440
any of you right now.

163
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,360
[Aiying, what's up?]

164
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,360
Staying home alone is boring.

165
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,480
[What?]

166
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,200
[What did you say?]

167
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,800
[The signal's really bad here.]

168
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,800
I said I can't stay

169
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,800
in this house anymore.

170
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:56,920
[What?]

171
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,120
[Who has dementia?]

172
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,400
Your signal is terrible.

173
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,280
Fine, fine.

174
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,160
Forget it.

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,440
Yeah, right.

176
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,760
If you like it, come again next time.

177
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:34,840
[Ms. Zhou?]

178
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,560
Liu.

179
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,560
Ms. Zhou,

180
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,600
take a look.

181
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,680
What would you like to buy today?

182
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,040
It's just me at home. I'm not cooking.

183
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,120
I'll just grab something

184
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,960
to eat.

185
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,840
What is she doing over there?

186
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,720
Over there?

187
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,440
Livestreaming, selling tofu.

188
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,159
Look at this tofu.

189
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,440
Selling tofu on a livestream?

190
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,159
So noisy. I gotta go.

191
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,000
Every soybean is plump and glossy.

192
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,600
If you like it, place your order now.

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,440
Thank you to my top donor.

194
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,320
Love you.

195
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,200
You're blocking the street.

196
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,840
Heart to you. Thanks.

197
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,680
Kevin just placed an order too.

198
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,800
Thank you so much.

199
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,080
Hello, welcome.

200
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,919
How many in your party?

201
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,520
Just one.

202
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,559
There's a QR code on the table.

203
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,000
[You can scan it to order.]

204
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,080
[Do you have a paper menu?]

205
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,840
[A paper menu...]

206
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,480
The tripe here is delicious.

207
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,880
Ma'am, here's the menu.

208
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,080
Just circle

209
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
what you want.

210
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,440
Sir, five more bowls of noodles.

211
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,320
Okay. Kitchen, five more bowls of noodles.

212
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,120
Can he even eat that much?

213
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,000
People love watching

214
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,880
mukbangs.

215
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,080
It's good promotion

216
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,880
for the restaurant too, right?

217
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,360
You just want to

218
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,720
sell a few more bowls of noodles.

219
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,000
He's gonna stuff himself sick.

220
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,320
Wait. Ma'am, you...

221
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,440
Fine, I'm not gonna argue.

222
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,000
Just call me when you're ready.

223
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,680
Wait a second.

224
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,440
Your food's coming right up.

225
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,360
Here, here.

226
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,600
[Who says I]

227
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,840
[have a small appetite?]

228
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,040
Let me show you.

229
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,960
Another bite.

230
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,520
[And shrimps.]

231
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,440
That aroma!

232
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,280
We've got 100,000 viewers watching now.

233
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,800
100,000?

234
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,640
I don't get it.

235
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,160
Let's see what's

236
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,480
so interesting about this.

237
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,880
[To all]

238
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,040
[the ladies]

239
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,560
[watching this livestream,]

240
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,520
[today I]

241
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,040
[have to speak up]

242
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,920
for you.

243
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,440
Please take

244
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,840
just ten seconds

245
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
[and look at your hands.]

246
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,040
[You've spent half your life]

247
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,400
[doing housework, cooking meals,]

248
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,720
[taking care of your husband and kids.]

249
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,880
[Yet in the end, there's no one]

250
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,440
[to even take care of you]

251
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,160
[or listen to your heart.]

252
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
[I'm asking you to]

253
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,560
[take 20 seconds]

254
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,040
[and really look in the mirror.]

255
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,120
[Look at that face]

256
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,040
[that was once young and beautiful.]

257
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,600
[When was the last time you took a selfie?]

258
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,560
[When was]

259
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,080
[the last time someone hugged you?]

260
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,240
[When was]

261
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,840
[the last time anyone praised you?]

262
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
[Those heartless]

263
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,680
[men,]

264
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,680
[they vanish]

265
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,120
[the moment they finish eating.]

266
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,240
[Probably hiding in the bathroom.]

267
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,000
[Ladies,]

268
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,360
[when your back aches]

269
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,000
[and you're in tears at midnight,]

270
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,280
[isn't your husband snoring]

271
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,720
[like thunder?]

272
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,560
[When your feet are so cold]

273
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,600
[that you can't sleep,]

274
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,880
[you find that older,]

275
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,000
[snoring husband's hogged all the blanket.]

276
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,360
[When you try to]

277
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,080
[guide the children you sacrificed]

278
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,320
[everything to raise,]

279
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,400
[they brush you off and couldn't]

280
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,560
[care less.]

281
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,400
[Those days]

282
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,640
[when you felt loved because]

283
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,680
[you were needed are gone.]

284
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,360
[I can't stand watching this.]

285
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,920
[I'm]

286
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,480
[standing up for you.]

287
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,560
[Women are]

288
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,760
[beautiful at any age.]

289
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,360
[You deserve better.]

290
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,080
[You spend the first]

291
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,280
half of your life living for others.

292
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,920
[Now, it's time to live]

293
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,920
[for yourself.]

294
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,280
Ma'am, just wait 20 more minutes.

295
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,520
You'll look 20 years younger.

296
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,280
[I've developed for you these]

297
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,920
[Renewal Vitality Pills.]

298
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,040
[Ladies,]

299
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,320
[you think I'm here to sell stuff?]

300
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,520
[Absolutely not.]

301
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,000
[I'd never take advantage of you.]

302
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,080
[My vitality pills have]

303
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,240
[only one ingredient,]

304
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,480
[my genuine heart.]

305
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
[I'm offering you]

306
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,360
[my most sincere care]

307
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,080
[and blessings,]

308
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,560
[hoping you can]

309
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,320
[Hello, delivery's here.]

310
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,440
[break free and]

311
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,000
Coming.

312
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,880
[be reborn.]

313
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,400
Hi, here's your order.

314
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,600
Okay, thanks.

315
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,560
[You need to find yourselves again.]

316
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,880
[Forget the cooking]

317
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,240
[and housework.]

318
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,400
[I know]

319
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,760
[deep inside]

320
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,880
[you're still that little girl.]

321
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,640
[You have the right to pursue beauty,]

322
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,480
[to be free and happy.]

323
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,920
[Now let me help you]

324
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,720
[bring that little girl back.]

325
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,360
Ma'am,

326
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,920
are you interested in tango?

327
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,400
Have you done tango before?

328
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,720
No,

329
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,080
but when I was young

330
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,120
I'd performed on stage.

331
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,560
Great.

332
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,840
That counts as

333
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,840
a dance background.

334
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,240
You could skip the beginner class

335
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,520
and go straight to intermediate.

336
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,320
Don't I need a dance partner?

337
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,080
Oh yes,

338
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,840
but that's not a problem.

339
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,360
I can pair you

340
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,080
with one of our senior

341
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,880
instructors.

342
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
I'll think about it.

343
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,880
How about this?

344
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,320
Today happens to be our store anniversary.

345
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,280
I'll give you a discount,

346
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,360
but only for today.

347
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,160
If you sign up now,

348
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,360
you can get a free dance outfit.

349
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,160
Ma'am, you look absolutely

350
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,440
radiant in that outfit.

351
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,520
You look amazing.

352
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,880
Well, I've

353
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,160
already paid.

354
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,440
You can drop the act.

355
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,480
Then, hurry along to class.

356
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,080
Okay.

357
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,840
This is my first dance class.

358
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,080
Take photos of me. I want

359
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,320
something to remember it by.

360
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,200
Use your phone.

361
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,160
Mine? Sure.

362
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,920
Yeah, yours.

363
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,440
Okay.

364
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,520
Send them to me after, alright?

365
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,840
No problem.

366
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,600
[Chin up, chest out.]

367
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,840
[Good. Let's try another pose.]

368
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,440
Side angle this time.

369
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,560
Chest up, core tight. Three, two, one.

370
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,800
[You're my queen.]

371
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
[So beautiful.]

372
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,000
[You're absolutely glowing.]

373
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
I really have to thank you.

374
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,520
If it weren't for

375
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,600
your encouragement, I wouldn't

376
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,320
have taken this step

377
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,240
and fulfilled this decades-old dream.

378
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,320
[Then keep coming to]

379
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,560
[the dance class]

380
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
[and send me]

381
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,640
[photos every time.]

382
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,640
[That way I can]

383
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,200
[turn your story]

384
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,920
[into videos]

385
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,080
[to inspire my other followers]

386
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,920
[to chase their dreams.]

387
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,000
No, no, don't post them.

388
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,560
The photos

389
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,280
are just between us.

390
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,440
[I think you're]

391
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,840
[exceptional.]

392
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,320
[You're brave enough]

393
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,120
[to go after your dream.]

394
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,000
[You're a true inspiration.]

395
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,040
[Please, I'm begging you,]

396
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,400
[just say yes.]

397
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,400
Alright, alright.

398
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,920
If you need them,

399
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,160
I'll send you

400
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,640
photos after every class.

401
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,800
[Perfect.]

402
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,200
[You have to come]

403
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,160
[to tonight's livestream.]

404
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,200
[I'm singing a song especially for you.]

405
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,400
Okay,

406
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,280
I'll definitely be there tonight.

407
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,880
[Let me share some honest]

408
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,920
[thoughts with you.]

409
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,120
[Marriage isn't a necessity for women.]

410
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,680
This is my daughter.

411
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,720
She's an influencer,

412
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,640
a big deal.

413
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,640
I'm watching her streams.

414
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,120
How impressive.

415
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,520
[Guys,]

416
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,800
[did you hear the nonsense]

417
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,920
[this streamer is spouting?]

418
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,800
[Her name is Zhang Ran,]

419
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,720
[and what she's saying]

420
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,480
[is way too extreme.]

421
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,160
[She says women don't need marriage.]

422
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,640
[Isn't that too narrow a view?]

423
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,560
Ran, watch what you say.

424
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,280
If your mom sees this,

425
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,400
there'll be trouble again.

426
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,160
Wait a second.

427
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,040
Sorry.

428
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,480
You scared me!

429
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,000
What are you doing sitting here?

430
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,880
What, only you can sit here? I can't?

431
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,720
No, I mean...

432
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
This spot's yours only?

433
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,240
What are you watching there anyway?

434
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,560
None of your business.

435
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,400
Listen, you can't

436
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,640
keep watching livestreams.

437
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,160
You're on livestreams

438
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,640
every day yourself.

439
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,120
It'll mess with your head.

440
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,440
Yeah, you're the one with problems.

441
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,640
Why did you

442
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,720
bring back that bag?

443
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,600
Well, I...

444
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,800
Where else am I supposed to go?

445
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,720
You think you can move back in? Get out!

446
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,320
No, wait.

447
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,840
Go do whatever you want. Just leave.

448
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,600
Go.

449
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,240
Aiying, Aiying.

450
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,800
Don't come back.

451
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,760
I-I need to talk to you. It's important.

452
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,480
No, you don't.

453
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,040
We've lived together for decades.

454
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,840
When have you

455
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,680
ever had anything important?

456
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,600
Go. Stop talking. Just go.

457
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,840
I'm serious.

458
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,320
I rushed back to tell you this.

459
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,040
I don't want to hear it.

460
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,680
Don't close the door.

461
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,880
Listen to me,

462
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,240
I really have something urgent.

463
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,960
Look,

464
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,480
I was watching a livestream.

465
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,120
I saw Ran...

466
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,840
Aren't you always watching livestreams?

467
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,440
I watched Ran's stream.

468
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,040
Something's

469
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,840
off with her.

470
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,720
The things she said were extreme.

471
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,120
She even got into conflicts with others.

472
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,240
So what?

473
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,080
Hasn't she always been like that?

474
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,360
She's been impulsive

475
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,760
since she was a kid.

476
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,400
Don't get worked up.

477
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,880
She tore up her marriage certificate.

478
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,640
That's probably fake.

479
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,040
She...

480
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,840
She got married without telling us

481
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,880
and just went to Canada.

482
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,520
Right?

483
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,520
She divorced without

484
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,280
telling us either.

485
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,880
Then she got married again.

486
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,440
What can we do?

487
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,360
We can't control her anyway.

488
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,480
Just respect her choices

489
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,560
and wish her well.

490
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,160
Let's just live our own lives.

491
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,440
Wait...

492
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,760
Stop overreacting.

493
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,360
You're her mother. How can you not care?

494
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,360
And you're her father.

495
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,000
Why don't you go talk to her?

496
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,760
No, Yudong...

497
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
I don't care about this or that.

498
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,640
I'm done.

499
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Aiying, Aiying.

500
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,640
Wait.

501
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,200
Aiying,

502
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,000
this...

503
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,920
Things're really wrong.

504
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,400
Aiying.

505
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:02,920
Aiying.

506
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,920
the dumplings won't

507
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,240
taste good if they get cold.

508
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,440
Come out

509
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,760
and eat.

510
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,080
Who is it?

511
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,280
[Delivery.]

512
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,760
Delivery? We didn't order anything.

513
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,200
[Yes, we did.]

514
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,680
Who...

515
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,080
[Coming.]

516
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,920
[You ordered delivery?]

517
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,920
Yeah.

518
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,600
Coming.

519
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,680
[Hi, here's your order.]

520
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,200
Please check.

521
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:53,960
Okay, okay.

522
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,840
Yeah, no problem.

523
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,120
[Alright.]

524
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,760
[Thank you.]

525
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,400
[My pleasure.]

526
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,240
[I'm]

527
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,840
[standing up for you.]

528
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,800
[Women are...]

529
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,320
Have some dumplings.

530
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,880
The filling's really good.

531
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,720
The roast goose you bought looks tasty.

532
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,840
What are you doing?

533
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,520
From now on we eat separately.

534
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,160
Come on, you can't finish half a goose

535
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,360
by yourself.

536
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,280
I'll have the rest for dinner.

537
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,440
I'm busting my ass here

538
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,640
while you're spacing out.

539
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
Whose stall is this anyway?

540
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,320
You already know the process.

541
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,360
Just handle it yourself.

542
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,640
Wait, are you

543
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,240
still thinking about

544
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,320
your wife?

545
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,600
I already told you

546
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,480
she probably has a crush online.

547
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,040
Get lost.

548
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,960
That's the truth.

549
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,200
My wife's in the

550
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,400
same state.

551
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,520
Does nothing all day,

552
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,840
glued to her phone,

553
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,200
and giggling like an idiot.

554
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Who's your wife watching on livestream?

555
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,200
Is it a guy?

556
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,840
Yeah.

557
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,240
But do you know how much

558
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,120
younger he is than her?

559
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,480
More than ten years.

560
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,280
[Dude,]

561
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,680
are you gonna do business or not?

562
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,480
Coming, coming.

563
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,040
Stop fooling yourself.

564
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,280
Dating older women is trending now.

565
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,080
Age doesn't matter.

566
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,480
You better watch out. Coming.

567
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,640
[Here, here.]

568
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,120
[Okay.]

569
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,280
[There you go.]

570
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,000
Shi!

571
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,440
Shi!

572
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:44,880
Wait.

573
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,440
Li, watch my stall!

574
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,040
[I finally won, and now you're leaving?]

575
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,320
Just keep an eye on it for me.

576
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,240
[Shi,]

577
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,360
[you still running this stall or not?]

578
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,320
Man,

579
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,440
look at her, all dressed up.

580
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,480
That's a dangerous sign.

581
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,960
She's even taking a taxi?

582
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,200
Oh no.

583
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,440
Splashing out like that.

584
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,960
She's definitely meeting a lover.

585
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,440
Go after her.

586
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,240
Go after what?

587
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,600
Your wife.

588
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,080
Come on, move.

589
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,400
I do this all the time.

590
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,200
Come with me.

591
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,120
Take these.

592
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,840
Don't worry.

593
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,640
We'll catch up.

594
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,080
Let's go.

595
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:43,960
Okay.

596
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,440
Good.

597
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,560
This...

598
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,720
Where'd she go? Lost her?

599
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,600
How can my

600
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,000
tricycle outrun a car?

601
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,280
Even my dentures fell out.

602
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,280
Look.

603
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,200
Look at this car.

604
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,080
This is it.

605
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,840
I memorized the plate number.

606
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,640
87?

607
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,640
Yeah, right.

608
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,480
Where is...

609
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,360
What are you doing?

610
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,520
Where did that

611
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,880
well-dressed lady go?

612
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,280
Stealing my car?

613
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,440
Where did that

614
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,960
well-dressed lady go?

615
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,760
I'm calling the cops.

616
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,120
Where did that

617
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,400
well-dressed lady go?

618
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,160
I'm asking you.

619
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,760
Wait.

620
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,800
He's looking for his wife.

621
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,680
What kind of attitude is that?

622
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,880
She's dancing?

623
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,840
Jianbin,

624
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,640
I have to remind you

625
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,440
couples should dance together.

626
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,320
Otherwise, all that touching and hugging,

627
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,240
your marriage'd be in trouble.

628
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,480
What trouble?

629
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,560
That's nonsense.

630
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,400
This is a legit dance studio.

631
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,840
Fine, fine.

632
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,040
Legitimate studio, alright?

633
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,160
She didn't tell you she was

634
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,560
taking dance lessons?

635
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,000
Why do you talk so much?

636
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,400
Okay, okay, let's go.

637
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,960
Don't let Aiying

638
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,040
come to places like this too often.

639
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,880
When we go in later,

640
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,600
make sure you look

641
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:52,960
enthusiastic.

642
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,280
What kind of people are these?

643
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,080
Got it.

644
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,880
[Keep smiling.]

645
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,560
Here.

646
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,520
First give her the flowers

647
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,840
and then go for a hug.

648
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,680
Yeah, yeah, I know.

649
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:02,920
Well,

650
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,520
get ready.

651
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,640
How do I look?

652
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,280
Dandan, touch up his makeup.

653
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,240
Wait, why does he look so familiar?

654
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,240
Hold on.

655
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,520
Let's go.

656
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:15,760
Go.

657
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,120
That's him.

658
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,440
He's the one

659
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,760
who scammed my wife a while back.

660
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,320
She spent tens of thousands.

661
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,800
He targets

662
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,880
women that age.

663
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,080
Who's he going after now?

664
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,360
[Ms.Zhou!]

665
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,600
Ms. Zhou.

666
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,200
[Is it really you?]

667
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,160
I'm not dreaming, am I?

668
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,520
How could it be a dream?

669
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,960
Grace In Motion,

670
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,120
my radiant,

671
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
shining queen.

672
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,240
Seeing you reclaim

673
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,200
your dancing dream, I...

674
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,040
I'm so moved.

675
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,040
I don't know what to say.

676
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,800
Here, come say hi

677
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,240
to everyone

678
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,920
in the livestream.

679
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,440
They absolutely love you.

680
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,480
Say something to them.

681
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,200
I don't want to talk to them.

682
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,240
I want to talk to you.

683
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,120
To me?

684
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,240
I just want to thank you.

685
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,400
Thank you for encouraging me

686
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,960
to fulfill my dancing dream.

687
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,560
Look, these are

688
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,680
my classmates and teacher.

689
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,200
Hello everyone!

690
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,360
Ma'am, we're

691
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,160
the ones

692
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,600
who should thank you.

693
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,880
In front of all our fans,

694
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,400
I really want to

695
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,400
give you a big,

696
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,760
warm hug.

697
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,640
Fraud!

698
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,920
You're a fraud!

699
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,600
[What's going on here?]

700
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,760
Who are you?

701
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,080
[Stop it! Stop!]

702
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,360
What's going on?

703
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,320
Dad?

704
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,760
Here's the situation.

705
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,480
The problem is

706
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,680
your mother won't agree to mediation.

707
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,960
My dad has internal injuries?

708
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,720
Then this can't be mediated.

709
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,840
No, no, hear me out first.

710
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,560
Your mom thinks

711
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,600
your dad should be detained.

712
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,160
What?

713
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,520
She wants him held in custody.

714
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,720
The other party

715
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,760
already agreed to mediation,

716
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,720
but your mom insisted that

717
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,480
since

718
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,920
your father hit someone,

719
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,840
he has to be punished.

720
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,840
Your dad couldn't accept that.

721
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,120
He said your mom

722
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,200
has completely lost her mind.

723
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,360
Then they started arguing again.

724
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,080
There was nothing we could do.

725
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:58,840
Your parents

726
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,800
don't know what to do.

727
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,760
Your mom asked us to contact

728
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,400
your husband, but we

729
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,080
couldn't reach him.

730
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,080
So we called you.

731
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:06,960
Sorry for the trouble,

732
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,600
officer.

733
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,320
Alright.

734
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,560
Let me talk

735
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,520
to them properly.

736
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,240
I'll sort this out.

737
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,840
Alright, so you understand everything?

738
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,640
Yes, I got it.

739
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,880
Fine, I'll bring them in.

740
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,600
Okay. Okay.

741
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,640
I formally apologize.

742
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,960
I'm truly sorry.

743
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,440
W-We'll cover

744
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,400
all your losses.

745
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,120
I'm fine with mediation,

746
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,400
but your mom won't agree.

747
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,880
I make the decisions in our family.

748
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,720
[Good.]

749
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,800
Look at my face.

750
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,080
[I'm bruised like this.]

751
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,680
I'm a livestreamer.

752
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,640
I won't be able to stream

753
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,680
for at least a week.

754
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,480
[This isn't]

755
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,480
[just personal loss.]

756
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,280
All losses,

757
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,960
everything,

758
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
I'll take full responsibility.

759
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,480
What are you talking about?

760
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
He scammed your mom out of tens of thousands.

761
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,520
Dad, stop talking.

762
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,400
Officer, if that's how this goes,

763
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,160
I refuse to settle.

764
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,320
Officer, I want to...

765
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:56,720
He's just...

766
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,560
Alright, stop.

767
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,680
Sir, listen to me. Stop.

768
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,200
Sit down.

769
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,800
Just calm down.

770
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
Why are you so worked up?

771
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,840
Can you stay quiet for now?

772
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
[Listen to me.]

773
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,680
Sir,

774
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,000
I've explained this

775
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,600
many times already.

776
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,160
[His livestreaming]

777
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,160
[is legitimate, alright?]

778
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,280
[Your wife's tipping]

779
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,760
[was voluntary.]

780
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,200
It doesn't constitute a crime.

781
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,200
I can't file charges.

782
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,480
But officer,

783
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,360
he hit someone. That's illegal.

784
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,800
Why isn't he being detained?

785
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:21,680
Mom!

786
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,280
He...

787
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,400
Are you insane?

788
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,800
You two stop talking.

789
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,960
I'll handle this. Officer,

790
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
just talk to me.

791
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:28,920
Okay.

792
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,760
And you,

793
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,480
when you livestream,

794
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,080
you must follow regulations.

795
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,600
Especially no inducing

796
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,280
or deceiving others

797
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,040
into tipping.

798
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,720
I know, officer.

799
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,440
Good. Since we're

800
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,400
on the same page,

801
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,640
and their daughter

802
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,000
is very sincere,

803
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,840
why don't you

804
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,440
be the bigger person

805
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,720
and waive the compensation?

806
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,560
After all, you did receive

807
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,320
quite a bit in donations.

808
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:54,880
I...

809
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,960
I apologize again.

810
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:56,720
Look.

811
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,840
I'm truly sorry.

812
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,400
See?

813
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:01,760
Is that alright?

814
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,800
Alright. Fine.

815
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,040
Great, isn't it?

816
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,760
That's settled.

817
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,200
Come sign here.

818
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,160
How can you two cause

819
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,080
so much trouble?

820
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,080
At your age,

821
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,040
still getting into fights?

822
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,320
Who could you possibly beat?

823
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,440
He's a scammer! Tens of thousands!

824
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,680
It's my money.

825
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,280
Does that even matter?

826
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,520
Who told you to sign?

827
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,840
If I didn't sign, could you get out?

828
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,200
You want to stay in there?

829
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:36,640
I...

830
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
Besides, if you'd

831
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,560
supported her more

832
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,400
and let her dance,

833
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,680
how could this have happened?

834
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,240
How could she be fooled?

835
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,240
And you're so extreme too.

836
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,200
The top donator?

837
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,440
That competitive?

838
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,400
If he really got locked up today,

839
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,480
what would you do then?

840
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,080
I can't believe you two.

841
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,520
I'm swamped every day.

842
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,120
This ends today.

843
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,040
When we get home,

844
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,080
no one mentions it again.

845
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,800
It's over. Try to understand each other,

846
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,160
okay?

847
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,160
Let's go.

848
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,800
You're both this old,

849
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,560
and I'm picking you up from the police station.

850
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,920
Isn't that embarrassing?

851
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,199
How ridiculous.

852
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,480
Aiying,

853
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,800
get up and eat lunch,

854
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,400
or the noodles'll be mushy.

855
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,880
I've reheated them once already.

856
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,760
Get up and eat something.

857
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,400
Don't punish yourself.

858
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,760
His streaming account got banned.

859
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,920
Inducing tips and false advertising

860
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,080
was his fault.

861
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,719
We got scammed,

862
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,040
but let's just learn from it.

863
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,159
As they say,

864
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,760
to err is human.

865
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,320
Learning from mistakes is what...

866
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,040
What lesson am I supposed to learn?

867
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,800
We got scammed

868
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,080
out of...

869
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,120
Am I as cheap as you?

870
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,760
You think I care about the money?

871
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,840
I'm telling you,

872
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,200
I've put this behind me.

873
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,480
I know he's a scammer.

874
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,640
Stop bringing him up.

875
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,720
What I'm thinking about

876
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,160
is that I've wasted

877
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,400
the first half of my life

878
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,280
and what I want

879
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,000
for the next few decades.

880
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,240
Aiying, Aiying.

881
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,040
What kind of life do you want?

882
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,600
Listen up,

883
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,360
starting tomorrow,

884
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,160
I, Zhou Aiying,

885
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,520
will be true to myself

886
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,840
and live for myself.

887
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,920
Wait, Aiying, Aiying.

888
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,640
If you live for yourself,

889
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,080
what about...

890
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,600
Stop bothering me.

891
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,040
I just don't want to live with regrets!

892
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,400
Regrets?

893
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,640
Who doesn't have regrets?

894
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,480
Bravo.

895
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,840
Great.

896
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,600
Slow, slow.

897
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,560
[Quick, quick.]

898
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,680
[Slow.]

899
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,520
[Quick, quick, slow.]

900
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,600
Slow, quick, quick, slow.

901
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,680
Quick, quick, slow, slow.

902
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,320
Slow.

903
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,560
Alright, class.

904
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,720
Ten-minute break.

905
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,720
[Mr. Liu, could you]

906
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,920
[help me with this move?]

907
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:00,880
Aiying!

908
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,160
Shi, what are you doing?

909
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,720
Aiying.

910
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,640
What is it?

911
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,080
Jianbin collapsed outside.

912
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:11,880
Where?

913
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,800
Look,

914
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,680
is that your husband?

915
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,520
Are you messing with me?

916
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,040
This is life or death.

917
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,200
No time for jokes!

918
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,040
Why didn't you call an ambulance?

919
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,800
Why come here?

920
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,920
Go take a look first.

921
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,760
Hurry up.

922
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,520
Wait,

923
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,640
my bag's still there.

924
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,680
[Sir, what are you doing?]

925
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,480
We know each other.

926
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,520
Come on, let's go.

927
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,600
Hurry up.

928
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:41,560
Here.

929
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,880
Quick.

930
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,800
Is this a prank?

931
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,400
You'll see when we get there.

932
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,560
Get where?

933
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,040
Here.

934
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,320
Look.

935
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,160
Where?

936
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,600
Just wait a bit.

937
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,440
Hold on.

938
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,120
[He was just here.]

939
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,040
You tricked me, didn't you?

940
00:38:59,240 --> 00:38:59,880
I will deal

941
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,840
with you later.

942
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,120
Zhang Jianbin!

943
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,120
I'm here.

944
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,880
[Aiying, you came.]

945
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,920
Is this some kind of trick?

946
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,320
No, no.

947
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,760
You planned this together,

948
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,320
didn't you?

949
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,080
No.

950
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,080
You think I'm easy to fool?

951
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,200
No, no, I...

952
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
You jerks.

953
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,280
Aiying, Aiying, don't go.

954
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,880
Don't go.

955
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,760
Please, let me explain.

956
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,480
I...

957
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,800
I tricked you here

958
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,840
because I wanted to apologize.

959
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,680
I was wrong.

960
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,280
I've failed you, Aiying.

961
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
Wrong about what?

962
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:30,720
I...

963
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,320
I haven't contributed

964
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,040
enough to our family

965
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,520
and I haven't cared enough.

966
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,960
I'm really sorry.

967
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,920
Stop with the empty words.

968
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,560
I shouldn't have played

969
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,560
dumb in front of you.

970
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,160
I always ignored

971
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,280
household matters.

972
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,160
I was always avoiding you.

973
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,040
You manage our home

974
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,920
and raised

975
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,400
Ran so well.

976
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,960
You took such good care of me.

977
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,120
I feel guilty.

978
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,520
I've let you down.

979
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,200
Even this scam

980
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,200
happened

981
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,080
because

982
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,680
I'd hurt you earlier.

983
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,800
So when did it all go wrong?

984
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,360
From the

985
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,640
very first day

986
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,520
we met.

987
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,400
Shi, let's start.

988
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,160
Start what?

989
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,320
Aiying!

990
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,720
Aiying!

991
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,960
Isn't this Yonghong?

992
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,600
Wu Ting.

993
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,840
You're all here!

994
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,880
Careful there.

995
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,120
I invited all your performance

996
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,920
troupe friends here.

997
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,560
The dance performance in1983.

998
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,840
That's when Aiying and I first met.

999
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,200
I took her

1000
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,360
picture that day.

1001
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,240
You've got some nerve bringing that up.

1002
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,400
The photo he took was blurry.

1003
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,200
Yes, yes,

1004
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,760
I admit it.

1005
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,160
My photography skills were terrible

1006
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,960
back then.

1007
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,360
So I tricked her here

1008
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,640
to make up for that regret.

1009
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,400
And I asked you

1010
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,160
to be witnesses.

1011
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,280
I will be a new man!

1012
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,800
You heard him?

1013
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,400
Let's take photos.

1014
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,520
I don't have my costume.

1015
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,640
Shi, the costume!

1016
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,440
Aiying's.

1017
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,640
Right away.
