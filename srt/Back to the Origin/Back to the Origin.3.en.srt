1
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:39,840
I heard you.

2
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:44,759
Okay. I heard you.

3
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,240
Okay?

4
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,920
Hello. Hello.

5
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
One two. One two. One two.

6
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,520
Hello everybody.

7
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,880
Hello everyone,

8
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,440
welcome to

9
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,600
Today's Financial Interview.

10
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,680
I'm your host, Zhang Ran.

11
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,360
Today, we're honored to have

12
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,120
the founder of North America's Mired,

13
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,880
a quantum computing software company,

14
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,040
here as part of a business delegation

15
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,280
to share insights

16
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,840
on the current

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,920
international market

18
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,040
and his outlook

19
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,280
on global economic trends.

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,120
Let's welcome

21
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,199
Mr. Sean Montefiore.

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,160
We believe that in the near future,

23
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
China is bound to

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,640
play a more significant role

25
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,000
in the Pacific Rim Economic Circle.

26
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,160
Thank you for watching

27
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,320
Today's Financial Interview.

28
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,280
I'm Zhang Ran.

29
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,760
See you next time.

30
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,720
Fu Yudong, the fish got away!

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,720
Leave it there.

32
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,160
I'll catch it.

33
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,720
Wait.

34
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,240
I've got it.

35
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,480
Well,

36
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,200
leave it there. Don't move.

37
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,920
Let me just put this down,

38
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,400
then I'll grab it.

39
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,320
I can catch it.

40
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,280
Okay.

41
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,120
Alright.

42
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,520
Come on.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,880
Come on.

44
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,720
Okay. Let's go.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,320
Hurry!

46
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,240
Come on.

47
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,080
Where's the fish?

48
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,079
It jumped.

49
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,160
It's fine.

50
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,320
I...

51
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,320
I need to use the bathroom

52
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,920
to wash my hands.

53
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,960
Sure. Go ahead.

54
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,600
Um, Fu Yudong,

55
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,440
can I just

56
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,120
take a shower here?

57
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,160
You live really close by.

58
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,680
I want to take a shower here.

59
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:23,880
Is that okay?

60
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:29,720
Okay.

61
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,800
What's wrong?

62
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,840
Nothing. Just a cockroach.

63
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,120
Uh...

64
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,880
Turn right for hot water.

65
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,720
Don't get it wrong.

66
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,320
I changed it. It was broken.

67
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,000
Unbelievable. Why did you change it?

68
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,600
I... I'm a little sleepy.

69
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,640
You sleepy too?

70
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,360
I...

71
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,880
Yes.

72
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,400
Good.

73
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,920
It's fine.

74
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,440
If... If you don't want to do it,

75
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,120
that's okay.

76
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,960
Tomorrow...

77
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,640
No, no. I...

78
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,560
I want to.

79
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,080
Don't... Don't tell me

80
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,280
you have no experience.

81
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,360
I do.

82
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,720
I've done my research.

83
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,040
Well, you'll be fine.

84
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,920
I trust

85
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,200
a PhD's ability to learn.

86
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,160
Come on.

87
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,480
What's wrong?

88
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,960
Just sudden

89
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,200
stomach cramps.

90
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,160
Maybe another time.

91
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:34,720
Another time.

92
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,200
It's fine. Doesn't matter.

93
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,440
Come on.

94
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,160
I really know how.

95
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,360
Okay.

96
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,680
Alright. Uh,

97
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,680
well,

98
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,400
there's something

99
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,920
I need to tell you.

100
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
My family...

101
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,040
I mean,

102
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,920
I'm from a single-parent family.

103
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,560
You need to know that.

104
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,360
Is that all?

105
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,840
You...

106
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,760
You don't mind, do you?

107
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,880
I don't mind.

108
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,600
Okay.

109
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,160
Happy to be here.

110
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:11,920
Okay.

111
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,160
Sorry, I need a drink.

112
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,880
Don't.

113
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,760
You've had enough.

114
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,480
That's plenty.

115
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,120
If there's no fish, just let it go.

116
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,400
I got a bite.

117
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,160
I was just talking to you.

118
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,960
Did you hear me or not?

119
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,400
You're going to be a personal shopper?

120
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,920
Yeah, I've made up my mind.

121
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,640
Lately, many have been asking

122
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,160
if I can get stuff from overseas.

123
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,160
So I made a side account

124
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,680
and used a fake name, Yuan.

125
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,160
In less than two weeks,

126
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,520
guess how much I made?

127
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,600
How much?

128
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,480
Five thousand.

129
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,680
That much?

130
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,720
Pretty good, right?

131
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,360
So I've decided.

132
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,720
I'll use my main account for promotion,

133
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,160
and the side account for sales.

134
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,680
That way I can make money

135
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,200
without losing face. Right?

136
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,040
You work so hard.

137
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,120
If I do

138
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,040
reselling,

139
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,640
our income could double.

140
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,920
But

141
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,080
we both work cash jobs.

142
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,880
So

143
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,360
we still can't guarantee

144
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,520
the money for a house.

145
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,040
We still have to

146
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,320
work hard and save up.

147
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,360
What's going on?

148
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
Reel it in.

149
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,880
Slow down.

150
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,360
Seems like she's really something.

151
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,640
So how did she end up with you?

152
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,600
Have you thought about that?

153
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,920
She really needs me, actually.

154
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,240
Zhang Ran!

155
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,800
Fu Yudong!

156
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,720
Run! The house is on fire!

157
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,120
Here's that BBQ you wanted yesterday.

158
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,560
It's not burnt, is it?

159
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,720
No.

160
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,960
Fu Yudong, come help.

161
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,320
Fu Yudong!

162
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,200
Coming!

163
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,960
Now I think

164
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,760
having someone around is pretty nice.

165
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,120
Zhang Ran talks a lot.

166
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,720
She calls for me

167
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,800
whenever she needs something.

168
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,920
Every time she calls my name,

169
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,600
it just makes me so happy.

170
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,920
Really glad.

171
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,480
So you like people

172
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,760
calling your name?

173
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,920
And it has to be a host?

174
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,800
So you like people

175
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,280
enunciating your name clearly.

176
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,040
That's weird, dude.

177
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,200
Okay.

178
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,680
Anyway,

179
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,200
you've got skills. Not easy.

180
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,360
The guys on our decoration crew

181
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,200
say the same thing.

182
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,800
What's wrong?

183
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,120
You sound a bit upset about it.

184
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,640
Tell me what's on your mind.

185
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,440
Did you check her Moments?

186
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,920
Yeah, I did. Why?

187
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,080
I always feel like

188
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,360
even though she's here,

189
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
her heart's still back home.

190
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,920
Actually, back when

191
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,960
she was a host in China,

192
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,360
she was really successful.

193
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,760
That's normal.

194
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,280
Well, I wouldn't call this lying.

195
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,720
It's just pride getting in the way.

196
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,640
We can overlook that.

197
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,960
True.

198
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,320
Look at our decoration crew.

199
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,160
Back in China,

200
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,760
every one

201
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,520
of them

202
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,000
was a big deal.

203
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,760
But here in Canada,

204
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,000
to be honest,

205
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,720
hardly any of them

206
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,640
tell their

207
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,920
old friends and family

208
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,960
what they're really doing here.

209
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,360
Dong, let me tell you,

210
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,080
the past doesn't matter.

211
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,560
The present is what counts.

212
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,000
[Even so,]

213
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,800
[I feel like]

214
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
she should

215
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,760
have a better life.

216
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,480
Every time I see her

217
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,920
checking out

218
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,760
the stuff she buys

219
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,640
for others,

220
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,520
it actually

221
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
bothers me.

222
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,960
I keep thinking,

223
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,760
I have to buy one of those

224
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,400
for her.

225
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
If other women have it,

226
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,640
my wife should have it too.

227
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,600
Does Cheng Man have one?

228
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,920
I'm asking you.

229
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,440
Cheng Man has me.

230
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,200
He hung up.

231
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
Hanging up on people is also

232
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,000
a case of pride getting in the way.

233
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360
[After Yuan Yuan left,]

234
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,720
[I went through a really dark week.]

235
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,720
[Thanks to Fu Yudong being there for me,]

236
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,880
[I slowly got back on my feet.]

237
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,720
[Sometimes I wonder]

238
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,520
[if I'm holding him back]

239
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,080
[and if he]

240
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,320
[deserves a better life.]

241
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,440
[But he always comforts me,]

242
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,520
[telling me to let the past be past]

243
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,480
[and that what matters is now.]

244
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,680
[I think he's right.]

245
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,520
[Nothing can beat me.]

246
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,880
[I've been through worse.]

247
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,840
[This is nothing.]

248
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,400
[My goal now]

249
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
[is to make it.]

250
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,520
[I won't care what other people think.]

251
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,840
[I'm gonna be the best personal shopper.]

252
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,800
[Who am I?]

253
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,360
[I'm the amazing Zhang Ran.]

254
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,320
Let's go.

255
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,800
[Mao, here's the thing.]

256
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,520
These shoes

257
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,800
are a hot item.

258
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,040
Only two pairs left.

259
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,400
So I'm not sure

260
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,160
I can grab them on clearance day.

261
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,960
If you trust me,

262
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,400
you can pay a deposit now.

263
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,200
If I

264
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,160
can't get them,

265
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,760
I'll refund you.

266
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,920
Sunscreen.

267
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
Foundation.

268
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,920
[Yuan, your voice]

269
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,360
[sounds like that host]

270
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,000
[from a finance show on TV.]

271
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,520
Fu Yudong.

272
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:10,840
Fu Yudong!

273
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,400
Hold on a sec. Let me reply.

274
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,960
No way.

275
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,720
TV hosts

276
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,600
have

277
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,520
great voices.

278
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,360
It's like this.

279
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,680
Since you paid a deposit,

280
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,680
I'll do my absolute best

281
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,000
to get this order for you.

282
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,160
Alright? Thanks for your support.

283
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:33,960
Honey!

284
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,800
I need your help now.

285
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,160
Between us, we don't have to

286
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,080
mention helping each other.

287
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,320
Just tell me what to do!

288
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,600
I love you!

289
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,840
Me too!

290
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,840
[Honey, listen,]

291
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,200
[once the doors open,]

292
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,160
[head straight]

293
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,320
[to the back row.]

294
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,240
[The row with big carts.]

295
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
[Don't mind]

296
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,760
[the ones up front.]

297
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,680
[People will grab those.]

298
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
But there aren't many in the back.

299
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,440
Once you're in, ignore everything else.

300
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,680
Go to the very back

301
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,920
and get the flatbed ones.

302
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,440
You'll know them.

303
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,160
They're different from these.

304
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,000
Got it?

305
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,800
Understand?

306
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,320
The very back row!

307
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,280
Coming.

308
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,160
Give it here.

309
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,760
Let go.

310
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,280
Come on.

311
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,600
Fu Yudong!

312
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,760
Quick! Give it to me.

313
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,240
These two carts won't hold much.

314
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,600
Go find another one.

315
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,280
Not a small one.

316
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,000
Get one like this.

317
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,600
This one.

318
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,440
That's the right one.

319
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,560
Honey, you're amazing. Go now.

320
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:56,880
Okay.

321
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,760
Get one like this!

322
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,240
Okay.

323
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,960
It's really my size.

324
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,040
Can I have it? I really like these shoes.

325
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,120
I really need this size.

326
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,640
Look, I even traded with you.

327
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,800
Just swap with me.

328
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,400
It's the only pair I need.

329
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,680
Fu Yudong!

330
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,840
No, no, no!

331
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,000
No, no, no!

332
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,120
No! No!

333
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,600
Go get another one.

334
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,880
What's that in your mouth?

335
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,760
It brings back childhood memories.

336
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,600
What am I doing?

337
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,640
And what are you doing?

338
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,440
Come here. Guard this.

339
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,760
Honey, it's up to you

340
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,440
to hold the line.

341
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:44,960
Okay.

342
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,720
So handsome.

343
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,200
Please. Thank you.

344
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,840
I really need this size.

345
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,960
Where are my things?

346
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,960
Where are my shoes? They were in a pile.

347
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
Well, there was this girl

348
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,200
looking so pitiful.

349
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,600
She kept begging me.

350
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,640
Who's more pitiful than me?

351
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,960
You're here eating a popsicle, huh?

352
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,200
Just get out of the way.

353
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,320
Wait for me in the car.

354
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,600
Go on.

355
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,880
I'll hold the spot.

356
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,640
I won't let anyone take anything.

357
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,200
Go away!

358
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,960
I will not let anyone take them.

359
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,640
After all the trouble I went through...

360
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,360
Can't take them. No.

361
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:10,880
Just give me one pair.

362
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,360
No, no, no!

363
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,680
Look, you have so many already.

364
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,840
Nice.

365
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,240
I...

366
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,240
Can I get one?

367
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,160
I don't understand.

368
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,600
No, no, no. No English.

369
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,360
No English.

370
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,800
For Mr. Wu Hanneng!

371
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,240
Shipped out!

372
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,760
Great!

373
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,560
It can't fit.

374
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,680
Bring it on. No problem.

375
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,720
Another one.

376
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,080
I'm awesome.

377
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,960
I'm seriously awesome today.

378
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,480
Am I now the shining star

379
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,720
of Chinese people in Canada?

380
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,200
Honey, listen,

381
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
you should quit fixing pipes.

382
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,040
From now on, you stick with me.

383
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,840
We'll go snap up some deals.

384
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,720
Before long,

385
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,080
we can rent a bigger place.

386
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
We'll each have our own room.

387
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,080
I'm kinda hungry.

388
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,520
Let's finish this then eat.

389
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,080
Okay. I'll cook for you.

390
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,640
No need to cook.

391
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,360
I'll order the duck blood

392
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,840
from Fuman Restaurant!

393
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,880
So fancy?

394
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,200
We're rich now!

395
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,040
Stop that!

396
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,880
Go open the champagne

397
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,520
your boss gave you.

398
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,960
I want to hear that pop!

399
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
Okay. Just a second.

400
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,800
We're rich now!

401
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,200
We're rich now!

402
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,360
We're rich now!

403
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,760
What should we spend it on?

404
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,600
Let me see

405
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,880
what to order.

406
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,960
Let me see.

407
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,640
Fu Yudong.

408
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,400
Cheers!

409
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,640
What happened to the celebration?

410
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,520
Feeling unwell?

411
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,760
That's just

412
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,520
how life is.

413
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,240
It's hard not to compare.

414
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,600
You just have to come to terms with it.

415
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,520
I don't see it that way.

416
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,880
Hell is other people.

417
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,440
No one can talk you out of this.

418
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,240
She has to figure it out for herself.

419
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,600
I'd say

420
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,320
she's different from us.

421
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,320
If she really had a choice,

422
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,880
she'd want

423
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,280
her old life back.

424
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,280
It's not that easy to let go.

425
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,080
Right?

426
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,520
[Even if it's hard,]

427
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,280
[you have to move on.]

428
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,920
Not all opportunities

429
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,960
will wait for you.

430
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,320
Zhang Ran.

431
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,800
Zhang Ran.

432
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,520
Get up.

433
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,280
The moon's up.

434
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,280
You've been asleep for a full day.

435
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,560
Get up and eat something.

436
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,800
I don't want to, Honey.

437
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,960
You'll hurt your stomach.

438
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,360
Come on.

439
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,000
Get up.

440
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,040
No.

441
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,320
Be good.

442
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:19,960
No.

443
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,560
Show you self!

444
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,400
I don't want to eat.

445
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,120
I don't want to.

446
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,040
Get up.

447
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,600
Feeling unwell?

448
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,280
Come on. Okay.

449
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,600
One, two, three.

450
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,520
I don't want to.

451
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,240
Sit up.

452
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,320
Coming.

453
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,000
Here.

454
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,840
This congee smells amazing.

455
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,640
I told you so many times.

456
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
You don't need to

457
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,400
go so hard to get the stuff.

458
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,800
We're not

459
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,080
that desperate.

460
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,120
Why push yourself so hard?

461
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,840
You'll

462
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,680
wear yourself out.

463
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,400
I don't like plain congee. Tasteless.

464
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,920
Easy fix.

465
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,200
Here, let me add some flavor.

466
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,200
Come on. Alright.

467
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,000
If you're sad, spill the tea.

468
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,680
It'll cheer me up.

469
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,920
You're so annoying!

470
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,360
Get out of here! Go away!

471
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,920
Let me share the burden.

472
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,520
No.

473
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,080
Come on.

474
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,640
No.

475
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,520
Share a little.

476
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,000
No.

477
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,200
How could I go away?

478
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,680
I'm stuck with you.

479
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,600
Wherever you go, I'll follow you.

480
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,200
Honey,

481
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,160
I'm so jinxed!

482
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,480
Are you kidding?

483
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,360
You're so lucky to have me.

484
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,160
Give me a hug.

485
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,000
A hug will make it better.

486
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,520
Come on.

487
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,000
[Dear,]

488
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,800
[your meme]

489
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,280
[is just so funny.]

490
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,640
[It's gone viral back home.]

491
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,480
[I use it every day.]

492
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,760
[So relatable.]

493
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,760
[After I started using it,]

494
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,280
[so many of my friends]

495
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,280
[wanted to buy bags from you.]

496
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,040
[I'll refer them all to you.]

497
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,520
It's raining. Take the umbrella.

498
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,000
Are you going out shopping today?

499
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,680
I'll pick you up.

500
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,760
No. I'm staying home.

501
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,160
Take it.

502
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,080
Your cowlick always

503
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,360
has a mind of its own.

504
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,960
Don't forget your hat.

505
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,880
Take the umbrella.

506
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,200
Here.

507
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,320
No need.

508
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:28,960
Take it. Hurry!

509
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,440
It'll get in the way while I work.

510
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,120
It's raining.

511
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,240
For heaven's sake.

512
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,160
You shut the door

513
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,680
that easily?

514
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,280
Shut it gentle.

515
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,200
Close it again.

516
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,320
What?

517
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:48,800
Bye.

518
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,520
Bye, Honey.

519
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,920
[Hello, dear.]

520
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,840
[It should be morning]

521
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,960
[in Toronto now.]

522
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,240
[You've had a day to think about it.]

523
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,120
[Have you made up your mind yet?]

524
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,360
Let me tell you a story.

525
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,000
I don't want to hear it.

526
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,560
I just thought of a story.

527
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,920
In a mental hospital,

528
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,160
there was a guy

529
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,120
who always crouched in the yard

530
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,400
holding an umbrella

531
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,920
every single day.

532
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
Later, a doctor wondered

533
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,600
what he was doing

534
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,400
and

535
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,520
decided to find out.

536
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,200
The doctor started holding an umbrella

537
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,360
with him every day.

538
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,520
Wherever that guy crouched,

539
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,920
the doctor would crouch there too.

540
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,000
After three whole days,

541
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:29,880
that guy

542
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,000
finally spoke.

543
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,960
You know what he said?

544
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,160
He said,

545
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,400
"are you a mushroom too?"

546
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,200
What are you doing?

547
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:44,800
There you go.

548
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,800
Where are you going?

549
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,240
Now I'm the dark cloud over your head.

550
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,640
See how light I am.

551
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,800
Watch me. Let's go.

552
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,760
Go.

553
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,600
I'm taking off now.

554
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,760
See these threads?

555
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,520
The threads.

556
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,360
They go this way.

557
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,000
See?

558
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,800
So the plumber's tape

559
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,320
has to

560
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,200
be wrapped against the thread direction.

561
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,240
Only then,

562
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
when you

563
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,000
screw it onto the other side,

564
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,880
will the tape hold properly.

565
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,200
Well,

566
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,040
simply put,

567
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,640
If you hold it with your left hand,

568
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,360
you turn it this way.

569
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,040
Outward.

570
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,520
When you hold it with your right hand,

571
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,200
you turn it inward.

572
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,960
Don't underestimate this tape.

573
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,480
It's antiseptic, waterproof, and durable.

574
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,240
They even use it on submarines.

575
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,320
Here, you try.

576
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,360
Come on.

577
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,000
Did you get your degree here?

578
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,760
Yeah.

579
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,560
And you ended up doing this?

580
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,640
Shouldn't you have a job

581
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,200
related to your major?

582
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,040
That's what I thought at first.

583
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,520
I thought this job

584
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,520
was just temporary.

585
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,840
And once I found

586
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,760
the right job,

587
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,240
I'd quit being a decorator.

588
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,800
But later, I found myself

589
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,400
starting

590
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,560
to enjoy it.

591
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,720
I realized that every day,

592
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,800
what I do

593
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
is fix things, dismantle things,

594
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,440
or build things.

595
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,280
It's all tangible

596
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
and concrete.

597
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,920
And it seems

598
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,600
I can actually help the clients.

599
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,520
At the very least,

600
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,240
I can help them live

601
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,200
more comfortably.

602
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,840
Then I thought about the past.

603
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,640
I've written so many papers

604
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,040
and spent so much time

605
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,960
and effort.

606
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,680
In the end,

607
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,960
I don't even know

608
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,840
who read those papers.

609
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,080
You know what I mean?

610
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,240
I was really lucky

611
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,680
when I was young.

612
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,560
My first feature film

613
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,600
won at the Hukedan International...

614
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,360
Never mind. You don't know it.

615
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:52,800
Anyway, it's a

616
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,040
pretty influential

617
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,320
international indie film festival.

618
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,200
I won the Best Newcomer Award.

619
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,480
After the screening,

620
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,800
everyone in the theater

621
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,040
stood up and applauded.

622
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,320
It went on for over 3 minutes.

623
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,680
I can still

624
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,920
almost hear it

625
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,600
in my ears.

626
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,480
Back then, I thought

627
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,400
I had made it.

628
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,159
You know?

629
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:17,960
Right after,

630
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,199
with dreams of becoming a great director,

631
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,560
I made my second film.

632
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,520
It flopped.

633
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,520
So I borrowed money

634
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,280
to make a third one.

635
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,520
But not even anyone

636
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,440
wrote a critique to trash it.

637
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,360
It's okay.

638
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,080
Look at our decoration crew.

639
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Every one of us

640
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,120
had a glorious past.

641
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,560
The one on the ladder,

642
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,679
looking like a monkey,

643
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,760
is Mr. Zhu.

644
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,600
The one who just carried the wood by

645
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,200
was a chief surgeon.

646
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,120
So what?

647
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,560
Now we're all here together,

648
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,080
working happily

649
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,000
and making money.

650
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,280
Being a decorator

651
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,800
might not look that respectable.

652
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,600
But

653
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,680
it's honestly not that hard.

654
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,360
And the pay isn't bad.

655
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,640
Enough to live on.

656
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,600
Contentment brings happiness.

657
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,320
Since we're here, let's just settle in.

658
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,400
Life leaves traces everywhere,

659
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,040
like a wild goose stepping in the snow.

660
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,600
Sometimes it leaves a mark,

661
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,160
but the goose flies, ignoring where it lands.

662
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,440
Most of the time,

663
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,240
life is like that.

664
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,680
Like a goose

665
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,360
flying desperately on and on.

666
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,320
But in the end,

667
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,640
you don't actually know

668
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,600
where you'll end up.

669
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,600
By chance,

670
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,640
you see a stretch of snow,

671
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,320
you stop

672
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,960
and leave a few footprints.

673
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,800
You think this is the place,

674
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,720
and you'll remember it

675
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,160
and definitely return.

676
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,200
Even if you do come back,

677
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,000
once flown, it's gone.

678
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,240
You can't possibly find

679
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,200
the same place again.

680
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,680
Because last year's snow

681
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,560
has already melted.

682
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,600
Right?

683
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,680
So talented, really.

684
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,040
You're really

685
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,600
director material.

686
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,160
No, not really.

687
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,480
But my

688
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,520
award-winning film

689
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,920
explored exactly this.

690
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,840
But I didn't come up with this.

691
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,840
It's by Su Shi.

692
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,880
You haven't read it?

693
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,920
I'm a science major.

694
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,720
Right.

695
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,200
Science major. Yeah.

696
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,440
We science majors

697
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,280
didn't study that stuff.

698
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,120
Yeah.

699
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,040
Why don't you

700
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,160
show us that film of yours?

701
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,120
I told you,

702
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,280
you can't find it online.

703
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:56,760
How can we watch it?

704
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,480
Don't...

705
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,840
No need to be modest.

706
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,480
Bring it out

707
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,840
and let's enjoy it together.

708
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,440
I have the DVD.

709
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,560
Do you have a DVD player?

710
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,400
[Hi, Zhang Ran, I'm Qian Dan.]

711
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,960
[I'm the operations director]

712
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,840
[at Tide Media.]

713
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,440
[We're the largest]

714
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,400
[short-video MCN]

715
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,440
[in Lucheng City.]

716
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,000
[You can look that up.]

717
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,400
[I used to]

718
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,800
[watch your show.]

719
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,480
[I'm actually a fan.]

720
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,920
[I know]

721
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,240
[you've been abroad all these years.]

722
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,520
[Are you considering]

723
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,160
[coming back to China]

724
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,320
[to develop your career?]

725
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
[If so,]

726
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,840
[maybe consider our company.]

727
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:12,800
[We]

728
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,400
[are currently hiring hosts.]

729
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,680
[There's a support program]

730
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,800
[I think would suit you perfectly.]

731
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,200
[Dear,]

732
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,960
[I'm wondering]

733
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,640
[what you've decided.]

734
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,120
[Your topic]

735
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,800
[has been trending really fast lately.]

736
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,240
[I think we really]

737
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,320
[need to decide now.]

738
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,600
[Once this wave of attention passes,]

739
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,640
[the opportunity will be gone.]

740
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,320
[Zhang Ran,]

741
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,000
[I think I understand]

742
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,080
[what you're hesitant about.]

743
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,560
Place this one.

744
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,640
[Actually, being a blogger]

745
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,640
[is very similar]

746
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,840
[to being a TV host.]

747
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,080
[But the career prospects]

748
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,960
[for video bloggers far surpass]

749
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,800
[those of traditional hosts.]

750
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,000
[With your experience,]

751
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,360
[plus the current buzz,]

752
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,120
[you could definitely be]

753
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,800
[in the spotlight again.]

754
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,680
Are you asleep?

755
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,320
Honey, if you

756
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,800
could have one superpower,

757
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
what would you want?

758
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,360
When I was little,

759
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,440
I wanted a bamboo-copter.

760
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,480
Put it on

761
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,160
and fly up into the sky.

762
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,440
When I was in school,

763
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,720
I wanted memory bread.

764
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,240
Press it

765
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,000
against the book,

766
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,160
and the words would stick to it. Eat it

767
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,320
and you'd remember everything.

768
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,160
Now,

769
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,080
I want an Anywhere Door.

770
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,200
Go anywhere you want.

771
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,800
When you go shopping,

772
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,680
just open the door

773
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,640
and you're at the mall.

774
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,640
The Anywhere Door sounds good.

775
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Get one for me too.

776
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,920
Where do you want to go?

777
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,640
I want to go back to China.

778
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,920
For what?

779
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,960
I want to go back

780
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
and be a short-video blogger.

781
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,960
Is that your wish too?

782
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,480
I'm serious.

783
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,560
Then what about me?

784
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,160
I hope you'll come back with me.

785
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,640
It's so sudden.

786
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,400
I can't decide.

787
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,360
Just let me try this once.

788
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,880
If it doesn't work out, I'll come back.

789
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,120
You keep doing your decoration work,

790
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,640
and I'll stay home and have babies.

791
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,640
You have my word.

792
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,800
I've never lied

793
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,560
to you

794
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,480
since the day we met, right?

795
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,960
You've already decided, haven't you?
