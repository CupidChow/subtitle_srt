1
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,902
You'll be lonely all your life

2
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,656
and die alone on the street somewhere.

3
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,412
That's my dream.

4
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,916
Being sprawled out on the street dying,

5
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,628
as I gaze up at the dazzling blue sky.

6
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,174
It really is my dream.

7
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,307
Go ahead and punch me then.

8
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,801
You made her leave?

9
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,385
Couldn't stand her…

10
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,470
3 YEARS AGO, WINTER

11
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:38,098
…going on and on
about wanting to be a mom?

12
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,643
You think I let her go because I love her?

13
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:43,978
Didn't you?

14
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,273
Please, Bong-suk. That's bullshit.

15
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,609
You hold onto love,
you don’t just let it go.

16
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:50,944
Some people might.

17
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:54,072
No. Love and attachment
are directly proportional.

18
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,116
When you don't care,

19
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,618
you don't hold onto them.

20
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,287
You just leave them…

21
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,999
because it's easy to.

22
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:22,433
MR. PLANKTON

23
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,061
Ow! Hey!

24
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,690
Fucking hell!

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,193
-Hey, stop!
-Hey! Fuck!

26
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,154
-You're trashing my place!
-Hey!

27
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,197
-That was expensive.
-Fuck.

28
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,993
You lunatics! You're wrecking the place.

29
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,953
Stop wreaking havoc! Will you--

30
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,873
Get off me! For fuck's sake!

31
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,503
Damn it, cut it out! Hey!

32
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,506
You asshole! You fucking bastard!

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,593
I can't believe it.
How could you do this to me? You jerk!

34
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,845
Fuck.

35
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,182
Die! Just die, you asshole!

36
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,267
-Hey! Stop!
-Damn you!

37
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,019
It's not what you fucking think!

38
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,698
-What brought you here?
-Two buses.

39
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,409
-I mean, why are you here?
-Why are you here?

40
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,580
-Who's that woman?
-That's Bong-suk. She's 40.

41
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,748
-Hey!
-What?

42
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:28,666
Damn it.

43
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,673
-That's my last one.
-Here.

44
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,775
Don't you remember me?
We met a few times at his errand house.

45
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,236
-Let's go.
-Who am I talking to?

46
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,988
Stop imposing on her.
She's just some old landlady.

47
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,699
He's not imposing when he's in my arms.

48
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,203
What about your dad search?
Why are you fooling around with a cougar?

49
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,496
Come on, let's go.

50
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,582
Hey, I'm only 12 years older than him.

51
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,543
And look who's talking.
You almost married a sugar daddy.

52
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,588
Hey, you told her about that?

53
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,382
We talk about everything together.

54
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,842
-Bong-suk.
-Yes, baby?

55
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,513
Give it a rest.

56
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,515
You brat.

57
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,018
-Let's go.
-What? Okay.

58
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:03,428
Hey, is your nose okay?
I hope it doesn't get infected.

59
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,680
We could go to a pharmacy.

60
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,977
I searched all over the city to find you.

61
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,438
And when I finally found you

62
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,357
and saw you like that, I just lost it.

63
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,611
Get in.

64
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,951
Where are we headed?

65
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,162
Where are we going then?

66
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,707
-Please take her to Wanju.
-All right. Sure.

67
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,168
Hey, Hae Jo!

68
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,351
So why did you bother
bringing that back to me?

69
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,068
You said you took pity on it
because it was abandoned.

70
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,277
So I gave it back.

71
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,321
What's the issue?

72
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:07,867
Is that all?

73
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,494
What else would there be?

74
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,955
You were worried about me
and missed me like crazy.

75
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,042
The shoe was just an excuse.
You think I don't know you?

76
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,502
Well, clearly, you don't.

77
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,547
If I was worried
and missing you like crazy,

78
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:25,218
I wouldn't have waited two weeks
just to drop it off and leave.

79
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:29,389
I would've brought you with me
even if I'd had to climb over the wall.

80
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,850
I simply returned something you loved.

81
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,520
It has nothing to do with my feelings.

82
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,325
Please, Jae-mi.

83
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,703
Don't mistake kindness for affection.

84
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:57,417
You're so desperate for affection
it makes you look pathetic.

85
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,755
You're right.

86
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,134
I am pathetic and desperate for affection.

87
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,553
I've fallen for all your tricks,

88
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:12,181
let you drag me around,
and even followed you here like an idiot.

89
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,977
Because I missed you so much,
and I'm still crazy about you.

90
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:20,940
So what?

91
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,859
What's wrong with that?

92
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,778
It's exhausting.

93
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,408
It's definitely been easier alone.

94
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,745
Honestly, we have fun,
but we've always had bad luck.

95
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,664
You even got stabbed, you know.

96
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,460
-It was an accident--
-Why do you think it happened?

97
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,463
An unfortunate girl
and an unlucky guy were together.

98
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,965
We attract all the universe's misery.

99
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,720
Are you saying that…

100
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,224
I make you even more miserable?

101
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,101
You've said the same.

102
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,819
Misery is contagious, like a virus.

103
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,366
So,

104
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,289
let's just go our separate ways
and stop wrecking each other's lives.

105
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,001
For a happier future.

106
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,630
Goodbye.

107
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,304
Man, what a relief.

108
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,976
Like finally taking a huge dump
after being backed up.

109
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,979
That means you shat all over her.

110
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,398
Am I meant to feel happy or sorry for you?

111
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,569
Hug me.

112
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,197
Dumbass. Stop acting so tough.

113
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,407
Come here.

114
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,741
Goodness me.

115
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,204
Bong-suk.

116
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,539
Yes?

117
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,791
I'm an asshole.

118
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,419
Not just any asshole. A giant one.

119
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,462
Fuck.

120
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:49,797
A huge asshole.

121
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,175
Do you still think
you can't let someone go if you love them?

122
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,014
No.

123
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,658
I was wrong.

124
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,413
It's because you love them…

125
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,334
that sometimes…

126
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,421
you have to let them go.

127
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,753
As forecast, despite the fall weather
cooling off the subtropical heat,

128
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:16,092
the metropolitan area continues
to experience sudden, heavy downpours.

129
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:21,138
Currently, we expect over 350 millimeters
of rainfall in the afternoon and…

130
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,682
It's too loud. Turn it off.

131
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,725
Turn your mind off instead.

132
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,228
It's not like you can undo what you said.

133
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,106
If you're outdoors--

134
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,067
What the fuck?

135
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,947
Even if what you said hurt her,

136
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,866
she wouldn't still be
out in the rain like an idiot.

137
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,119
Like I fucking care.

138
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,582
It's because of all the sex offenders
on the loose around here.

139
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,544
-They blast the sirens to scare them.
-Shit.

140
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,883
I knew he wouldn't last 30 minutes.

141
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:25,786
What the hell?

142
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,540
Sir, let's go.

143
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:34,962
Fuck.

144
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:52,605
HAE JO ERRAND HOUSE

145
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,976
What are you doing here?

146
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,442
I waited for you out there for a while,
but you never came back.

147
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,616
So I thought

148
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,662
you might come looking for me here.

149
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,157
See?

150
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,576
I was right.

151
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,670
So this place will be gone by next week?

152
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,629
Yeah.

153
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,841
Good thing I came today, then.

154
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,259
Why?

155
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,303
I found something really valuable.

156
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,139
Kkari already sold off
anything worth a dime.

157
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,098
What was it?

158
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,186
Something you gave me.

159
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,912
Damn, it's completely burnt.

160
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,416
-What are you making?
-Seaweed soup.

161
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,293
It's my birthday today.

162
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,798
MY BIRTHDAY

163
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,135
NOVEMBER - MY BIRTHDAY
DECEMBER - MY BIRTHDAY

164
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,554
Your birthday this month is today.

165
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,307
I just need to season it. Have a seat.

166
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,225
Hey!

167
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:23,852
This is balsamic.

168
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,814
Well, I'll just balance it
with a little green plum syrup.

169
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,983
You have a seat. Give me three minutes.

170
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,027
DELICIOUS SEAWEED SOUP

171
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,657
How could they have the nerve

172
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,160
to list the day I was abandoned
as my birthday?

173
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,496
I mean, are you shitting me?

174
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:46,291
Every year, you have to celebrate
on the worst day of your life.

175
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,043
That's emotional abuse.

176
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,921
I'll keep choosing my own birthday.

177
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,507
Still, 12 birthdays a year
is a little excessive.

178
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,635
You abuse me 12 times a year
by making me eat your soup.

179
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,637
Does that explain the instant packets?

180
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,432
I promise I'll find out
your actual birthday, no matter what.

181
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,393
So please do this once a year--

182
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,571
What is this?

183
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:17,781
A birthday gift.

184
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,868
Couple's rings? No way!

185
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:27,583
Yes, I made them
out of a lightning rod that got struck.

186
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,667
A lightning rod?

187
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,210
On your birthday last month,

188
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,965
you said not knowing your date of birth
made you feel unlucky.

189
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,592
But,

190
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,595
bad luck can strike anywhere,
like lightning.

191
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,390
And lightning
never strikes the same place twice.

192
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,185
So don't ever leave my side.

193
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,062
From now on,
I'll protect you from the lightning.

194
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,356
Okay.

195
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,737
How about we go get your teeth cleaned
for your birthday?

196
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,406
I just love it!

197
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:54,002
Do you think
early menopause struck me like lightning

198
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,629
because I threw my ring away?

199
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,930
Your misfortune ends here.

200
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,976
From now on,
I'll take all the lightning strikes.

201
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,396
I'll never let you go again.

202
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,364
Hey, are you okay?

203
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,095
How are we supposed to do the ceremony

204
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,888
with the heir in that state?

205
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,392
He's clearly unwell.

206
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,437
You can't expect him to be well.

207
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,480
Goodness, my back.

208
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,569
The girl he almost married
just got kicked out.

209
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,322
It would be weird if he were totally fine.

210
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,283
Hey, I've got this. You should rest.

211
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:11,621
We're celebrating you
winning this year's presidential award.

212
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,832
Don’t you think she deserves a break?

213
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:14,791
Hush now.

214
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,003
I'm the clan heir's mother.
I should do it.

215
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,300
By the way, about the prayers.

216
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,304
Why don't we have Heung do it?

217
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,307
We're sharing news
of my achievement with our ancestors.

218
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,227
Wouldn't it be better
if my own son did it?

219
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,325
Goodness.

220
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:03,882
Shall we take a look
at the clan heir's first prayer?

221
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,764
"On this fine day,
I kneel and offer this prayer

222
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,225
to the gods of heaven and earth."

223
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,895
"We're celebrating a lady
who's a role model for our nation

224
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,730
and an honor to our family,

225
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:24,027
who founded Heung's Kitchen,
where she fosters talented individuals."

226
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:29,199
"I miss and deeply yearn for Jo Jae-mi."

227
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,661
"Oh, my dear Jae-mi, where are you?"

228
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,830
"Thoughts of you consume me."

229
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,791
"I see you in my dreams.
I see you when I'm awake…"

230
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,337
Oh, you little…

231
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,465
You…

232
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,844
Hey…

233
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,224
Listen, Ho-ja.
Are you sure Heung is going to be okay?

234
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,685
The thing is,

235
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,439
he and I went to the market
to get food for the ceremony.

236
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:06,027
Oh my goodness! Look who it is!
If it isn't Mr. Newlywed.

237
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,030
Enough chitchat, lady.
Aren't you here to do business?

238
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,199
We'll take some mugwort rice cakes,

239
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,494
millet bukkumi, injeolmi,
heukmi, and Jo Jae-mi.

240
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,455
Ten packs of each.

241
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,248
What's a Jo Jae-mi?

242
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,167
How much?

243
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:48,820
Get up.

244
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,198
Your little stunt won’t work.

245
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,491
So cut it out already.

246
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:58,079
Get up by the count of three
or I'll dump water on you.

247
00:24:58,955 --> 00:24:59,956
One.

248
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,000
Two.

249
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,419
Three…

250
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:26,149
Come on, leave the kid alone.
We've got a big ceremony to perform.

251
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,236
That's exactly why
I need him to snap out of it.

252
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,655
Oh, for heaven's sake.

253
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,073
What…

254
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,828
Oh no. My back.

255
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,457
-My back.
-Oh my God, Ho-ja!

256
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,417
Oh, my back.

257
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:48,672
What are you doing?
Pick her up and take her to Heung. Go!

258
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,881
-Go!
-Oh my God!

259
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,051
My back. Good heavens! My back.

260
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:56,846
Come on!

261
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,766
Heung’s in no shape
to do acupuncture right now.

262
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,601
Take me to his clinic. Yes.

263
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,688
Why would you go there
when your doctor son is right here?

264
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,065
John! Back!

265
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:10,110
No! Take me to his clinic!

266
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,653
-Ho-ja! Come back.
-No, John.

267
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,613
John! Come back. Back!

268
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,032
No, take me to his clinic!

269
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,077
John! Get back here. For heaven's sake.

270
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,912
Take me to his clinic!

271
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,249
Back here! John! Come back!

272
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,530
Jae-mi?

273
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,744
Having trouble sleeping lately?

274
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,332
You look so worn out. I feel bad.

275
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,879
Life is no fun without you.

276
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:16,760
Do you want to play a game?
How about word chain?

277
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,845
Potato.

278
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,975
Tonight?

279
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,230
One beginning with "night."

280
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,068
Night...

281
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,529
Nightlife.

282
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,616
Lifetime.

283
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,495
Timeout.

284
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,331
Outwin.

285
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,337
Winter.

286
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,091
Intercom.

287
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,262
Compare.

288
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,809
Repro.

289
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,438
Provide.

290
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,277
Demo.

291
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,322
Mojo.

292
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,285
Jo Jae-mi.

293
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,712
Mistake.

294
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,758
Take my word, I'm sorry.

295
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,098
I'm coming. I'm on my way right now. Okay?

296
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,391
Stop pestering me, man.

297
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,982
-I'll kill you.
-No, I will kill you.

298
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,027
For leaving me all alone.

299
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,155
-I'm going to settle my debt.
-Debt?

300
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,574
I owe the guy who tracked you down.

301
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,619
Oh, so you made a deal with Kkari too?

302
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,703
"Too"?

303
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,332
Of course. That's how you found me.

304
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:56,377
He called me after I spammed
the errand house's website for days

305
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,630
saying "I'm looking for Hae Jo."

306
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,715
Kkari, that damn traitor.

307
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,967
So I'm coming with you.

308
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,428
No, it won't take long. Go to Bong-suk's.

309
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,013
Not her place!

310
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,432
Suit yourself.
I'm going there when I'm done.

311
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,935
Hey!

312
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,313
Wow, he's actually leaving?

313
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,695
He's going to trip doing that.

314
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,365
Look where you're going. You'll fall over!

315
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,699
-Oh shit.
-See?!

316
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,746
He's so silly.

317
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,795
What's he doing now?

318
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,761
Aren't you going to go?

319
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,682
I'm going now.

320
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:51,641
Bye.

321
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,695
Yeah, you know who I mean.

322
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:09,576
The kid who flooded our website every day
with all the looking-for-my-brother posts.

323
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,785
It's her, that girl.

324
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,997
So you just want me
to make her give up, right?

325
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,040
No backing out of our deal now, okay?

326
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,208
NQA, dickhead.

327
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,378
No questions asked.
Just do what I tell you.

328
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,505
FOOD ORDERS - KKARI ERRAND HOUSE

329
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,257
Number 103, that son of a bitch.

330
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,718
Spicy noodles with pork and cha-gye-chi?

331
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:29,429
You bastard, this isn't a goddamn diner.

332
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:32,015
I bet he's gonna bullshit me later.

333
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,831
Are you the kid who spammed our website?

334
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,833
Are you the errand house lackey?

335
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,293
"Lackey"?

336
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,671
-Kid.
-It's Chae Seung-a.

337
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,381
Right. Kid, I'm the owner--

338
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,342
Will you find my brother?

339
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,802
Do you always cut people off? That’s rude

340
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,387
I haven't got much time.

341
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,639
Neither have I.

342
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,016
So find him fast. He's Chae Seung-hyeok.

343
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,064
Who?

344
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,441
My brother, Chae Seung-hyeok.

345
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,778
Honey!

346
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,864
Seung-a hit her forehead.
She needs to see a doctor.

347
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,588
Damn. Kkari, that freaking…

348
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,133
What's wrong?

349
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:53,680
Shit.

350
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:59,227
So, you're number 139?

351
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,605
I'm number 17.
Fourth grade, class two, number 17.

352
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:06,651
We're from the same freezer.
I'm number 137, and you're number 139.

353
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,736
Are you drunk?

354
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,781
Why did you want to meet here?

355
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,283
I like seahorses.

356
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,495
But I'd never seen one before.

357
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,205
Most kids come

358
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,291
with their parents.

359
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:23,876
I can't.

360
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,630
My mom moved to the UK last year to study.

361
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,050
And your dad?

362
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,638
He doesn't care about me.

363
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,118
Why do you like seahorses?

364
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,663
Because it's the dads who give birth.

365
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,253
Only male seahorses have a brood pouch.

366
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,174
I wish my dad were a seahorse.

367
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,509
Why?

368
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:19,015
If he had given birth to me himself,
maybe he’d love me more.

369
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:36,157
You think just like she does.

370
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,618
-Who?
-A girl I like.

371
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,038
I like her because she's goofy
and quirky like you.

372
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,794
Why are you suddenly looking for a brother
who left before you were even born?

373
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,130
Mom says she's divorcing Dad

374
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,509
and taking me to the UK
during my winter break.

375
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:58,096
If I'm gone too, my dad will be all alone,

376
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,514
and I feel bad for him.

377
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,266
So maybe my brother can…

378
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,102
HAE JO ERRAND HOUSE

379
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,479
You feel bad?

380
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,566
Kid, your dad brought this on himself.

381
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,568
You get what you deserve.

382
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,863
-So don't waste time with this card.
-Give it back!

383
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,241
-No!
-Focus on your nice new life in the UK.

384
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,536
Why did you tear it up?

385
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,413
I took that from my dad's drawer.

386
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:28,209
What if he notices the card’s missing?

387
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,462
I'm going to get in trouble again.

388
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,633
Can I have yours?

389
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,600
Don't worry.

390
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,896
Your dad would never look for something

391
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,566
once it is out of his sight.

392
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:55,111
You lousy lackey!
You're just a mean old man!

393
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,154
Old?

394
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,447
Stop crying.

395
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,783
Hey. Shush.

396
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,244
Oh, for God's sake.

397
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,914
She's my sister. Hey, come here. Come on.

398
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,000
You don't listen, do you?

399
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,131
Are you serious?

400
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,138
Goddamn it.

401
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,765
That little bitch must have a death wish.

402
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,894
She went behind my back?
So where is she now?

403
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,979
I'll have to go by myself.

404
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,524
She broke her leg.
She's no use in a wheelchair.

405
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,942
Forget it. I have to go.

406
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,155
Oh fuck. You scared me. God.

407
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:42,116
-Hey, what kind of food do you like?
-Food?

408
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,952
I feel bad for imposing,

409
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,537
so I thought I'd cook--

410
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,623
You're a lousy cook. I'll order in.

411
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,086
Wow, you guys really
don't have any secrets.

412
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,383
Actually, do you really want to be useful?

413
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,677
Yes. Is there something I can do for you?

414
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,596
Do you know the Refund Sisters?

415
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:07,975
Those tough girls from the TV show
like Lee Hyo-ri and Jessi?

416
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,060
Let's be them.

417
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,855
But we’ll change “refund”
to “cash upfront.”

418
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,867
Hey, what exactly do you need me to do?

419
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,410
Nothing much.

420
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,788
We're going to kick those girls' asses

421
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,748
for disappearing with my money.

422
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:34,543
I'll do the heavy lifting.
You just glare as hard as you can.

423
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,254
What money?

424
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,673
I told you. Money I paid up front.

425
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,024
Your bus is 12 minutes away.

426
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,902
Just take a cab. I'll pay, okay?

427
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,866
Fine, be my guest.
You're saving me money. Cool.

428
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,118
Super cool.

429
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,506
Did you get those bangs to hide your scar?

430
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,635
You should show it off.

431
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,221
It's cool,
like Harry Potter's lightning strike.

432
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:31,267
It's a lightning bolt.
A lightning strike can kill you.

433
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,269
Oh, sure.

434
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,368
Hey, number 139.

435
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,039
Do you like your dad?

436
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,709
Why?

437
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,462
You said he doesn't care about you.

438
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,173
He gave me life.

439
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,762
Are you happy to be alive?

440
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,140
It's fun.

441
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,893
Oh, here it comes.

442
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,048
Oh boy.

443
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:29,927
You can come out now.

444
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,972
Come on out.

445
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,141
You little…

446
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,185
Wow, long time no see. What were you--

447
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,813
Hey. You took money from her, didn't you?

448
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,148
I'm not a monster.

449
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,734
I helped a brother and sister reunite.
It's like charity--

450
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,027
Just buy me a drink.

451
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,612
A drink?

452
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,240
You won't smash my head with the bottle?

453
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,867
How's your leg?

454
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,870
Chil-seong, that son of a bitch!

455
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,455
I told you we shouldn't do it.

456
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:01,125
Think of all the crap
I had to deal with because of it.

457
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,002
I don't get it.

458
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:06,589
He doesn't care about her,
but she cares for him because he made her?

459
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,132
That doesn't make sense.

460
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,926
All she got from him
are his genes, so why?

461
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,428
Blood ties.

462
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,056
They say blood is thicker than water.

463
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:21,479
People are just drawn to their family.
What's that fancy word for it?

464
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,981
Damn. Got it! A celestial bond.

465
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,695
Celestial bond. Blood ties.

466
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:33,365
I fucking hate my old man too, you know.
I fucking hate him.

467
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:37,786
But when I go home and see him sleeping,
it breaks my fucking heart.

468
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,956
I tear up for some reason
and feel like being nice to him.

469
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,877
It's called unconditional love.
There is no reason.

470
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,629
That's a celestial bond?

471
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,173
Can we get gizzards?

472
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:50,841
The third guy.

473
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,093
Should I keep searching?

474
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,554
-For the third sperm donor?
-Yes.

475
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,932
-What?
-How do I know?

476
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,601
I made Jae-mi tell me
in exchange for finding you.

477
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:04,271
Your guy bailed
when he heard about Chil-seong anyway.

478
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,525
Hey, I can be your guy.
I'll give you a 30% discount.

479
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,276
Damn it, Jae-mi.

480
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,196
Let's order. You’re buying.

481
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,573
Fuck, I said that?

482
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,328
My babies.

483
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,247
Let's go home with mama.

484
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,339
Oh my God!

485
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:34,718
Wow. So you made babies with my money?

486
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:38,097
I swear I didn’t mean for this to happen.

487
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,350
Hey, you know me.
I'm not that kind of girl.

488
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,310
What the hell?

489
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:47,147
I'm taking your babies!

490
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:52,570
Oh my God! No!

491
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,075
Hae Jo. You've just won the lottery, man.

492
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,577
Full of shit, as always.

493
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,746
Shin Myeong-su, the next candidate.
I did some digging.

494
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,667
He's the fucking head of Unpung Pharm.
The company owner.

495
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,336
-The chairman, the owner, the boss.
-You're crazy.

496
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,965
Look, man. You know I don't talk nonsense.

497
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,843
When he was still working in sales,

498
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,887
he did an interview
about being the most frequent donor.

499
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:22,975
Damn. How much did he fucking pump out
to be named "the sperm king"?

500
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,894
If he's a king and you're his son,

501
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,771
that'd make you a fucking prince.

502
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,565
By the way,

503
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,693
what's with the language?

504
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,613
I'm two years older than you,

505
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,031
Seung-hyeok, you punk.

506
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,909
I guess we're on the same level now.

507
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,203
I've always wanted a rich friend.

508
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,290
Fuck you. You said
being near me screwed up your life.

509
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,500
And now you want to be friends?

510
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,128
You can’t let anything go, huh?

511
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,546
I don’t need friends.

512
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,050
-One billion won.
-What did you say?

513
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,596
If I get really rich,
I'll give you one billion in commission.

514
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,848
Really? You can't take that back.

515
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:07,561
You gotta record everything these days
so you don't get conned.

516
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,188
Okay, what did you say?

517
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,274
What the hell?

518
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,153
-So sorry.
-I'll clean it up.

519
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,823
I didn't realize he was that drunk.

520
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,535
-It just slipped out of his hand.
-It's okay. I'll clean it up.

521
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,455
There's glass here. Be careful.

522
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:27,623
Be careful.

523
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,250
-Okay. I'll be careful.
-What the fuck's going on?

524
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,335
I'll clean it up.

525
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,296
I'm so sorry about this.

526
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,596
Come on, man!

527
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,140
I'm really sorry, ma'am.

528
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,142
What's wrong with you, dude?

529
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,269
Ma'am, how much do we owe you?

530
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,647
Hey! Hae Jo!

531
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:55,025
Hae Jo! Hey, dude!

532
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,696
Hey, Hae Jo! What's wrong with you?

533
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,738
I'm sorry.

534
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:02,783
Hae Jo!

535
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,244
What is it? Are you okay?

536
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:06,912
I'm sorry, everyone.

537
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,373
Come on, let's get you home.

538
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,419
I'm really sorry! Sorry!

539
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,045
Let's go.

540
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,259
-Let's go. I'm beat.
-Go home.

541
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:24,430
-Why? I'll drop you off first.
-No, just go.

542
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:36,442
Man, what a way
to weasel out of our billion-won deal.

543
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:40,696
Now just go home
and call me when you get there, buddy.

544
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:41,613
-All right?
-Yes.

545
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,289
What's up with him?
He used to drink like a fish.

546
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,332
Freaked out by the rich dad thing?

547
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,711
I have a bad feeling.

548
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,757
My gut feelings are usually right. Damn.

549
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:12,895
Fuck.

550
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,302
Excuse me, driver.

551
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,724
Can you play something
really fucking upbeat really fucking loud?

552
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,476
Okay, sure.

553
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,412
What was it again?

554
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,376
Oh fuck.

555
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:00,711
Bong-suk!

556
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:23,275
Fucking hell.
Has my goddamn brain gone to shit too?

557
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,715
Did you see the look on her face?

558
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:50,677
She must've thought you were nuts,
whipping your ponytail like that.

559
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:53,388
We're like debt collectors…

560
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,223
-Oh! Hey, Hae Jo.
-What?

561
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,767
Why are you out here?

562
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,145
What's wrong?

563
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,399
What the hell is this?

564
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,403
I went to help her with some work.

565
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,907
Why the hell
did you take her to that dump?

566
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,661
Oh, hey. No, I asked her to…

567
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:20,666
Dump?

568
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:24,419
It’s not like I took her
to some criminal hideout.

569
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,671
What's the difference?

570
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:29,466
Money-crazy assholes drink,
smoke, and play mahjong all night there.

571
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,885
What if they lost their shit and hurt her?

572
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,474
What’s with all that noise?

573
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,351
-I mean…
-Oh, I see.

574
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,269
So you're saying

575
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,481
it's fine for me to be around that,
but not her.

576
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,149
That's not what I said.

577
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:47,943
You know,

578
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:52,698
with the money I made
dealing with those lowlifes,

579
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,533
I put a roof over your head.

580
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:57,619
I've worked my ass off to raise you,
and you…

581
00:49:58,996 --> 00:49:59,830
Bong-suk.

582
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,165
Now I'm just trash because you got a girl?

583
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,501
I cannot believe this. God!

584
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,838
-Oh, hey.
-Oh God.

585
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,881
-I can't do anything right.
-I'm sorry.

586
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,676
-I should've just gotten a dog.
-What's all this noise?

587
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:13,719
Oh, fuck off!

588
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,721
Will you stop all that racket?

589
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,973
-Calm down.
-Shut up! What racket?

590
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:21,309
-Get back inside! All of you!
-I said be quiet!

591
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,227
I'm sorry.

592
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,772
I'm really sorry, okay?

593
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,691
Come on, I'm just really tired.

594
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,985
Ungrateful to someone who raised you.

595
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,361
She's all you care about.

596
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,196
No, it's not like that. I…

597
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,198
I'm sorry, forgive me.

598
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,325
I've wasted so much money on your ass.

599
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,578
I don't need your empty words. Piss off.

600
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,496
Hey.

601
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,998
-Get on your knees.
-Seriously.

602
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:47,461
-No…
-You know, I just…

603
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:52,632
-Fuck. I've had the shittiest day ever.
-He'd get the finest food and clothes.

604
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,676
It's all been for nothing.

605
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,679
Do I really have to do this? Seriously?

606
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,686
Fine, I guess I do.

607
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:06,813
Bong-suk.

608
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:12,277
My dear Bong-suk, hey

609
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,237
Hey, yo

610
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:18,658
Do you know how much I love you?

611
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,618
Well?

612
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:22,412
My dear Bong-suk, don't be angry

613
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,830
My God! What the--

614
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:24,956
Okay?

615
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,793
Go away! Have you gone crazy? Hey.

616
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,629
-You forgive me, right?
-Stop it! Please.

617
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,047
-Okay!
-Jeez!

618
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,717
-Now for your favorite cocktail, somaek!
-Shit, I cracked up.

619
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,177
-My goodness.
-Oh man.

620
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,471
Bong-suk's favorite drink, somaek

621
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,264
What's up with him?

622
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,599
He's lost it.

623
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:43,934
The bottle opener is here

624
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,728
-I've filmed it all.
-My God, that ass-shaking.

625
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,356
That maniac.
Get your sweater out of your pants!

626
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,398
For God's sake.

627
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:05,038
KNEEL AND BOW IN AN ORDERLY FASHION

628
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,733
WASH YOUR HANDS

629
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,287
What's he doing?

630
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,956
Hey, wash your hands now.

631
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:17,819
Oh, right.

632
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,864
-Bong-suk, is it true?
-Is what true?

633
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:23,158
That you've got three moms and two dads?

634
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,578
Yes.

635
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:30,040
They switched from one partner to another

636
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,000
trying to find someone better,

637
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:35,295
and ended up
with seven products of their failed love.

638
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,923
That's why I never wanted to marry.

639
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,007
Hey.

640
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,219
See? We're better off than her.

641
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,470
What did you say?

642
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,056
How so?

643
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:49,142
Between someone with 100% useless parents

644
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:53,563
and someone who has a 0.01% chance
of having a billionaire parent one day,

645
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,482
who is better off?

646
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,525
The chance of having a billionaire dad?

647
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:00,946
-Even less than getting hit by lightning.
-Right.

648
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,784
But I think I just might
get hit by that lightning.

649
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:06,785
How so?

650
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:11,456
It seems my third father candidate
owns a pharmaceutical company.

651
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,541
Wow! No way!

652
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:17,170
Oh my God!

653
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,632
-You're so ecstatic.
-Of course!

654
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:24,803
Okay. If I turn out to be his son,
I'll give you ten billion, Jae-mi.

655
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:25,887
-Yes!
-Ten billion.

656
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,639
-What?
-I'll open a kindergarten!

657
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,182
And a few kids' cafés too!

658
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:30,850
And bigger boobs!

659
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,019
No. Don't be greedy.

660
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,479
-Oh, come on!
-No.

661
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,148
Listen to all that bullshit.
What about me?

662
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:40,485
For my dear Bong-suk,
a nice villa in the Maldives

663
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,862
where you can drink endless mojitos.

664
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:43,947
I want a building.

665
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,408
-What?
-A 15-story in downtown Seoul.

666
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:49,369
-That's expensive. Let me ask my dad.
-Yes!

667
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,787
And what about you?

668
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:55,500
I want to ride across America
on a Harley-Davidson with you.

669
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,755
-So cool!
-Let's ride, baby!

670
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,091
I'm cool? Come on, let's go! Vroom.

671
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:10,765
PUT INCENSE IN THE POT THREE TIMES

672
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:20,734
That's enough.

673
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:24,362
Just three times. You've put enough in!

674
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,364
-What…
-That's enough! Heung!

675
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,741
-Hey…
-Stop!

676
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:33,830
Oh no! It's hot!

677
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,790
Oh my goodness. Dear me.

678
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:42,964
"October 14th, 2024 CE."

679
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,633
PRESIDENTIAL COMMENDATION
HEUNG'S KITCHEN, BUM HO-JA

680
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:49,346
Eo Heung humbly offers his respects
to his grandfather,

681
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,681
former Grand Master
and Governor of Icheon,

682
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,684
and to his grandmother,
of the Jeonju Lee Clan.

683
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,063
Mother.

684
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,860
You show such reverence
to ancestors from centuries ago

685
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,821
whom you've never met,

686
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:10,241
but you disregard your own son's pain

687
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:15,205
and anguish from losing his partner.

688
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:20,335
I dare ask if I'm capable
of watching over this vast forest

689
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:25,799
when I can't even protect one lonely tree.

690
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,552
Hey, what are you doing? Are you asleep?

691
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,729
Oh God. Heung!

692
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,861
Oh no!

693
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:50,990
Oh, it's hot!

694
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,995
To escape this futile responsibility…

695
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,542
I…

696
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,671
bid you farewell.

697
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,340
My goodness.

698
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,397
Oh, my son.

699
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,817
Heung. Oh, Heung!

700
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,903
Oh, Heung, my boy.

701
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:33,950
Oh, Heung.

702
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,785
Heung!

703
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:37,829
Heung…

704
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:40,540
Heung.

705
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,419
Heung!

706
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:47,714
Heung.

707
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,599
Heung…

708
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:04,606
SIGNATURE SHIN MYEONG-SU

709
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,357
Chairman Shin Myeong-su.

710
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,442
A RISING M&A MOGUL

711
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:08,985
A legend in the industry.

712
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,572
He started as a salesman
after high school 45 years ago,

713
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,073
and now he's the chairman.

714
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,868
He must've been blessed with good fortune.

715
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:20,622
Under his leadership,
they've been merging with global giants,

716
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,624
every new drug has been a hit,

717
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:25,668
and their stocks are skyrocketing.
Dude's freaking unreal.

718
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,506
His stocks alone
must be worth hundreds of billions.

719
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:33,551
But you know what the best part is?
He has no kids. None.

720
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:36,221
Just a wife and three cats.

721
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:40,391
Looks like the sperm king
pumped too much out back in the day.

722
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,310
So, buddy.

723
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:46,689
You'd better hit that 99.99% match
on the DNA test.

724
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,233
Let's fucking do this!

725
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,527
UNPUNG BIO R&D CENTER
COMPLETION CEREMONY

726
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,821
-Are you ready?
-Okay, what's our plan?

727
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,865
Next up, the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

728
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,784
-I'll just wing it.
-What?

729
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,410
Hey.

730
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:04,207
Three, two, one!

731
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:15,176
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's give a warm round of applause

732
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,387
for Unpung Pharm Bio's bright future.

733
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,228
Let's go.

734
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:28,731
-But we've come all the way here.
-I don't feel well. Let's go.

735
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,567
But… Hey! Stop!

736
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,611
-I'll do it. I'll wing it.
-Hey! Jae-mi!

737
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,787
Mr. Chairman, a few words on the new drug?

738
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:47,041
We'll be making an official announcement
to the media…

739
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,127
At Unpung Pharm--

740
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:52,171
-I'm sorry!
-What's going on here?

741
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:56,134
-Shit! I'm so screwed.
-His hairpiece!

742
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:01,139
What on earth is going on?

743
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:03,474
Here, give me a jacket, quick!

744
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:06,978
Someone just collapsed!

745
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:09,689
Somebody, call an ambulance!

746
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,441
Security! Someone collapsed!

747
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:14,485
Everyone step back, please.

748
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,862
Somebody, call 911!

749
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,490
Hae Jo!

750
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,077
No, let go of me!

751
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:32,545
Hae Jo!

752
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:34,672
Hae Jo!

753
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,177
Hae Jo!

754
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,139
Hae Jo!

755
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:48,102
Your misfortune ends here. From now on…

756
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,688
Hae Jo, are you okay? Hae Jo!

757
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,983
…I'll take the lightning strikes.

758
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:23,823
