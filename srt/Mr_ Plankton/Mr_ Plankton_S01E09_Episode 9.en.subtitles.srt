1
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:29,738
6 YEARS AGO, WINTER

2
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,616
Even down to your curved pinky finger.

3
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,661
You're so much like your mother.

4
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,455
Did my mom ever…

5
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,417
miss me?

6
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,627
Of course she did.

7
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,632
She practically begged me
to help her find you,

8
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,010
right up until she died.

9
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,682
Please don't cry.

10
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,520
She was just trying to make a living.

11
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:08,276
Listen, Jae-mi.
You're not an orphan anymore.

12
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,820
You have your auntie here now,

13
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,740
and just as your mother would've been,

14
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,493
I'll be there for you.

15
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:24,250
Are you all right?
Auntie, here. Have some water.

16
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,882
-This is all I have right now.
-No.

17
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,218
-I can't accept this.
-For medical bills.

18
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,844
Jae-mi, don't do this.

19
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,101
That took a while.

20
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,729
So? Can we keep milking this for a while?

21
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:48,691
Jeez. No, forget it. She's flat broke.

22
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,902
She has zero savings.

23
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:54,322
She maxed out her cash advance
to give me 1.5 million won. Damn it!

24
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,326
Come on. Chill. It's all right.

25
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,911
She works at a daycare, right?

26
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,330
I'll show up at her work
saying I'm her uncle.

27
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,332
She can take out a loan.

28
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,752
I knew you'd figure something out, honey.

29
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,464
Who's this prick?

30
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,424
What?

31
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,098
-Babe!
-What the fuck?

32
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,391
-Honey!
-Come out.

33
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,767
What the fuck?

34
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:28,064
What's your fucking problem? You jackass!

35
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,484
Hey.

36
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,572
Get up, you little shit.
Hey, you dumb fuck. I said get up.

37
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,198
You thug! I'll call the cops.

38
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,743
Leave him alone!
You fucking piece of shit! I'll--

39
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,496
-Be my fucking guest. Go ahead.
-Stay away, asshole.

40
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,999
Auntie, you and Mr. Uncle over there

41
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,085
can keep conning people
out of their money all you want.

42
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,171
I don't give a fuck what you do.

43
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,633
Just quit playing family
to scam lonely orphans

44
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,179
who don't have a soul in the world
to lean on, okay?

45
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,889
Or else…

46
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,059
I'll kill you both.

47
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,060
Got it?

48
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,937
Okay?

49
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,897
Yes, sir.

50
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,322
Consider this her compensation.

51
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,826
How could she do that?

52
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,956
How could a human being be so heartless?

53
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,627
Right, but how could you fall
for such an obvious scam?

54
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,296
You’ve got to be smarter than that.

55
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,632
So you're blaming me for this?

56
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,300
Oh, not so slow after all.

57
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,301
Hey!

58
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,511
You dummy.

59
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,097
You've had to fend for yourself
your whole life,

60
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,641
so why are you so naïve?

61
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,519
I'm worried you'll never survive
in this big bad world.

62
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,065
Why worry?

63
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,400
You're here for me.

64
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,284
What would you do without me?

65
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:57,797
MR. PLANKTON

66
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,259
Given his current condition,

67
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,638
I'm afraid there isn't anything more
we can do at the moment.

68
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,225
It's an extremely rare brain disorder.

69
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,686
What are you talking about? He…

70
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,731
Up until yesterday,
he was out and about doing stuff.

71
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,651
Right. Patients may appear healthy,
but it's like a time bomb--

72
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:23,531
But you doctors study for years
to treat such diseases, don't you?

73
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,201
The best thing we can do for him now
is to look for a hospice facility--

74
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,454
That's for terminally ill people!

75
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,707
I’ve got money.
Name your price. A billion won? I’ll pay.

76
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,585
Just do something! Please!

77
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,928
Don't go.

78
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,854
Why should I care?

79
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,858
Scumbags like you

80
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,360
deserve to die!

81
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,028
-That hurts.
-Just die!

82
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,071
It hurts…

83
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,407
Stop joking around! Damn it!

84
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,829
Hey, let's go.

85
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,873
-I don't feel well.
-I'll do it then.

86
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,295
Crazy bitch.

87
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,256
Just let me be happy for once!

88
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,926
So drop dead or something already!

89
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,721
I'll gladly leave your life
if that'll make you happy.

90
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,807
For good?

91
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,476
Yes, for good.

92
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:34,977
Pinky promise?

93
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,692
A PROMISE TO YOURSELF
FOR A HAPPY FUTURE

94
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:52,954
Ju-ri.

95
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,667
Ju-ri!

96
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,714
Hey, Ju-ri. Could you slap me?

97
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,008
Leave me alone.

98
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,887
He'd moan in pain,
get nosebleeds, and even pass out.

99
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,557
But I thought it was all an act.

100
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,227
He was literally dying
right before my eyes,

101
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,980
but I still told him to drop dead
so I could be happy.

102
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,941
I pushed him and told him to go to hell--

103
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,745
You scared me!

104
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,373
-Thank you.
-Your poor thing.

105
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,629
She was a volleyball setter
in high school.

106
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,089
Don't mess with her.

107
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,726
So, do you have a plan B
to approach Chairman Shin?

108
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,936
No, forget it. It can't be done.

109
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,854
Why not?

110
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:04,484
His toupee got yanked off on camera
and now he won't leave his house.

111
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,861
Stay away from him. You'll end up in jail.

112
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,999
Why do you want to find him anyway?

113
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,501
Why now?

114
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,045
School break's nearly over.

115
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:28,007
It's like catching up on homework.

116
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,261
I'll do your homework for you.

117
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,514
So hold on.

118
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,739
Seung-hyeok, are you asleep?

119
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,000
No.

120
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,422
Just giving my eyes a break from the sun.

121
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,303
Want to borrow these?

122
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,227
Hey.

123
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,313
Do you know what's shimmering there?

124
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,899
They're just waves. What else?

125
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,234
Wrong.

126
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,861
Look closely, and you'll see.

127
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,740
It's actually plankton.

128
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,076
They capture the sun's rays
and emit light.

129
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,997
So what you see is sparkling plankton.

130
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,874
Plankton? Floating in the sea?

131
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,834
Yes.

132
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,087
Seahorses feed on plankton.

133
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,214
That's right.

134
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,301
All fish eat plankton.

135
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,930
The very bottom of the food chain.
The lowest in the ocean.

136
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,141
That's kinda sad.

137
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,145
-True, but they're still cool.
-Why?

138
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,274
When those little creatures
give off light,

139
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,651
they also produce tons of oxygen,

140
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,654
which you and I need in order to live.

141
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,990
Otherwise, the Earth would be screwed.

142
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,700
Isn't it amazing?

143
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,828
That such tiny beings

144
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,706
are actually so incredibly valuable.

145
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,086
It's a bit complicated
for me to understand.

146
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,422
It is?

147
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,719
Let's just say, after I die,
I hope I come back as plankton.

148
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,012
Me too.

149
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,806
No, you've still got
your whole life ahead of you.

150
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,574
I should go now.

151
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,826
Go where?

152
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,700
Nurse!

153
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:44,787
What is that?

154
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,373
-What are you doing?
-Look…

155
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,918
What? What's that woman doing here?

156
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:55,339
Help! I need help!

157
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,341
Hey! What's wrong?

158
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,510
-What is it?
-Hae Jo!

159
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,470
Hae Jo!

160
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,931
Hello, sir! You remember me, right?

161
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,057
Get rid of her!

162
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,185
-Sir! Let's just have a chat.
-Hey, that hurts.

163
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,398
Sir! Please! We need to talk.

164
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,275
Could you just spare a minute?

165
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,568
Damn it!

166
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,154
Sorry for being rude!

167
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,156
-Your hair!
-What's wrong with you?

168
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,451
I need your hair.
Just a few strands, please!

169
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,662
What are you waiting for?
Get this crazy woman off me!

170
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,622
Your hair, please.

171
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,333
-Three. Compressions.
-Compressions.

172
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,377
-What do I do if Hae Jo dies?
-One…

173
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,964
-Rhythm check, stand clear.
-Shocking in one, two, three…

174
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,341
-Rhythm check. Clear.
-Hae Jo…

175
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,595
Shocking in one, two, three…

176
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,972
Please!

177
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,682
Hey, get off me!

178
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,934
-Turn off the engine.
-Just a few!

179
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,895
-Just a few strands!
-Help us!

180
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,438
Hey, come push!

181
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,149
-Or your saliva would do too.
-You crazy--

182
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,193
Right here. Spit on my face.

183
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,652
Please leave me alone.

184
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,489
Just spit on me and I'll leave right away.

185
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,573
Quick! Please!

186
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,617
-Okay, fine.
-Sir, please.

187
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,812
MISSED CALLS
KKARI (15)

188
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,651
No. It can't be.

189
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,287
What happened? Why is the room…

190
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,207
Where were you?

191
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,250
Where's Hae Jo?

192
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,003
In there. The VIP ward.

193
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,509
You scared me.

194
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,553
Where have you been?

195
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,768
I just dropped off Mr. Shin's DNA sample
at Perfect Gene.

196
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,729
-For real?
-We'll know by tomorrow morning.

197
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,316
I really hope it's a match. Please God!

198
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,118
He will do whatever it takes
to save Hae Jo

199
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,328
if he turns out to be his father.

200
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,957
I mean, he owns the nation's
biggest pharmaceutical company,

201
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,334
so surely he won't let his ill son suffer.

202
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,253
The chance is very slim.

203
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,256
So let's pray for good luck--

204
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,299
Good luck?

205
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,518
What? I can't even wish him good luck?

206
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,272
Because Hae Jo and I
are cursed with bad luck,

207
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,274
we can't even be hopeful?

208
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,692
Exactly. Don't bother.

209
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,821
We can't afford
to rely on mumbo jumbo right now.

210
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,198
None of that matters if we can't save him.

211
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,412
Finding his father
was what he wanted most.

212
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,497
Ladies, let's keep it down, please.

213
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,707
Stay out of this.

214
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,210
So I gave him what he wanted.
You wouldn't even know--

215
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,296
He had a cardiac arrest and nearly died.

216
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,302
Where were you when he was dying?

217
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:34,850
First, he needs to be alive
to do what he wants to do.

218
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,228
And you're right.
I don't know what he wants.

219
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,191
But at least I know
when I should be by his side.

220
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,365
So, how is he? Is he okay?

221
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,408
I'll go check on him. From now on, I--

222
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,911
No need. Kkari, don't let her in.

223
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,373
-You have no right to stop me!
-Come on, Jae-mi.

224
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,625
I'm his legal guardian and next of kin.

225
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,418
And I'm his friend. Sorry!

226
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,170
Hey! But I'm his girlfriend!

227
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,757
Excuse me, authorized people only.

228
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,218
I'm his girlfriend.

229
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,554
The woman who just went in there
is only his roommate.

230
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,016
I'm his girlfriend.
This sounds so messed up, but…

231
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,061
I mean, they just share an address.

232
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,270
That's all.

233
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,815
I am the one he's actually in love with.

234
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,088
SECOND MOTHER

235
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,830
The number you have dialed…

236
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,790
Foolish boy.

237
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,711
I understand he's heartbroken over a girl,

238
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,880
but a heads-up would've been nice

239
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,591
so I could've at least tried
to sort things out.

240
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,595
I can't believe
he's gone AWOL on us like this.

241
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,721
Poor Ho-ja.

242
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,308
She's so upset
she can't even eat right now.

243
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,448
TO MY MOTHER

244
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:36,573
Why are you wearing sunglasses at night?

245
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,743
No wonder you can't see a thing.

246
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,834
Hey, do you even know what this is?

247
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,420
Ignorance isn't always bliss.

248
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,549
I know you moved to the US
at a very young age,

249
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,051
but you're still Korean,
so you should know.

250
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,388
Oh dear.

251
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,725
Sit down.

252
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,359
It's called jangjuk.

253
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,404
A Korean cigarette.

254
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,420
When my husband…

255
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,216
brought his mistresses home,

256
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:42,431
and when all those mistresses had babies,

257
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,184
and when I had to prepare

258
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:51,982
all the food
for the babies' first birthday parties,

259
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,068
I'd come out here

260
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,779
to smoke this cigarette.

261
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,992
Then when I had Heung,

262
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,080
I buried this in one of the kimchi pots
and never took it out again.

263
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,584
But today…

264
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,379
because of that fool,

265
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:19,593
for the first time in 40 years,
I took this out for a smoke.

266
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,719
Can you believe it?

267
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,837
My baby boy…

268
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:04,096
He was such a sweet angel,
even when he was very little.

269
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,849
So they called him, "American Boy."

270
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,434
Back then,

271
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,980
"American" was used for anything good.

272
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,024
Growing up,

273
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,986
he never upset me or worried me once.

274
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,532
But one day, he came to me begging.

275
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,828
He said he was head over heels for Jae-mi

276
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:34,501
and tearfully begged me
to let them live together.

277
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,380
But I broke them up.

278
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:42,301
I broke them up against their will.

279
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:49,599
I suppose I'm paying for it now.

280
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,812
I must atone for my sins.

281
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,690
My son has abandoned me,

282
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,192
and that is my punishment.

283
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:00,902
Oh God.

284
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,420
Oh gosh. I'm embarrassing myself.

285
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,757
I don't want anyone seeing me like this.

286
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,472
Hey, what is this?

287
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,432
Why?

288
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,435
So people can't see my tears?

289
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,195
Thank you.

290
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,828
Thank you.

291
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:20,857
PATIENT VISITOR PASS

292
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,319
Take this.

293
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,531
She's at the gambling house.
She'll be back in the morning.

294
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,865
I'm gonna get to work.

295
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,075
Thank you.

296
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,369
I was going to give you this anyway--

297
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,124
Oh jeez.

298
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,404
Hey, I'm here now.

299
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:12,159
Are you mad at me
because I wasn't here earlier?

300
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,421
Honestly, I had such a busy day today.

301
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:31,511
Candidate number three, Chairman Shin.
The guy whose toupee I tore off, remember?

302
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,514
If you only knew the lengths I went to

303
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,601
to get his DNA sample,

304
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,604
you'd treat me like a queen forever more.

305
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,065
Love really can work wonders.

306
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,570
And I managed all on my own.

307
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,616
I'm so cool, aren't I?

308
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,166
Yeah, you are.

309
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,587
Hey.

310
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,256
Oh God.

311
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,346
I haven't slept this well in so long.

312
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,932
I'd better fetch a doctor, so he can--

313
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,851
No, don't. Just stay here like this.

314
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,478
Just us two. So nice.

315
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,398
I like everything about this,

316
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,527
except for my view.

317
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,446
Your view?

318
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:33,740
That, up there.

319
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,702
-You mean the ceiling?
-Yes.

320
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:42,832
It's the last thing most people see
before they take their last breath.

321
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,835
The white ceiling of a hospital room.

322
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,713
Isn't it awful?

323
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,597
Do you remember my dream?

324
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,558
Your dream?

325
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,309
Yes, about my last breath.

326
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:12,237
You'll be lonely all your life
and die alone on the street.

327
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,781
That's my dream.

328
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,866
To be sprawled out on the street dying,

329
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,745
as I gaze up at the dazzling blue sky.

330
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,916
It really is my dream.

331
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,361
URGENT
DNA PATERNITY TEST RESULTS

332
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,364
SAMPLE A: CHAE SEUNG-HYEOK
SAMPLE B: SHIN MYEONG-SU

333
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,284
SAMPLE A AND SAMPLE B
ARE NOT BIOLOGICALLY MATCHED

334
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,344
I shouldn't have put in a rush order.

335
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:24,643
We would've been able to dream
for just a little longer.

336
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,863
It really is my dream.

337
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,202
To die as I gaze at the dazzling blue sky.

338
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,260
Damn it.

339
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,906
Oh my God!

340
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:46,075
-What's that?
-It's realistic, right? Just a manikin.

341
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,473
Shit!

342
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,825
We got out. No, hold on!

343
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:30,662
Okay, let's go.

344
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,582
Hey! No, Hae Jo!

345
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,463
That was so close.

346
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,805
Crap.

347
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,355
Come on.

348
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,946
Hey, taxi!

349
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,699
Taxi, stop!

350
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,786
I'm with someone. One moment, please!

351
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:13,913
What? Hey!

352
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,083
Is it heavy? Do you need a hand…

353
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,003
Is that a body?

354
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,129
-What?
-A dead body!

355
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,506
No, mister! He's not dead!

356
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,675
This is a living man. He's alive!

357
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,721
Wait, where are you going, mister? Sir!

358
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,389
What now?

359
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,767
Hae Jo, hey!

360
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,729
Hae Jo!

361
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,567
Hey, look, here comes another taxi. Taxi!

362
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,236
Here, over here. Sir!

363
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,823
Just one second, okay? That's a person.

364
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,201
Wait. I said, it's a person! Hey, mister!

365
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,747
Sir, that's a person, okay?

366
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,415
No! Mister!

367
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,959
What's the matter with them?!

368
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,463
Taxi, sir!

369
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,299
Hey, mister!

370
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,926
What the hell?!

371
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,699
BONG-SUK
WHERE ARE YOU?

372
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,952
PICK UP!

373
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,746
IF YOU COME BACK NOW, I'LL FORGIVE YOU…

374
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,625
I WON'T BE MAD AT YOU

375
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,587
CALL ME BEFORE I LOSE IT!

376
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,010
BEFORE HAE JO DIES

377
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,516
I WILL KILL YOU FIRST!

378
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,962
Shall we just

379
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,632
call an ambulance

380
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,635
and go back to the hospital?

381
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,943
EO HEUNG

382
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,619
What the hell?

383
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:04,083
Honestly, you've got to be kidding me.

384
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,338
Why does he have to call me
right at this very moment?

385
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:20,016
EO HEUNG

386
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:27,523
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable. Please leave…

387
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,950
Jae-mi.

388
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,289
Jae-mi…

389
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,795
Jae-mi!

390
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:03,017
Hae Jo, where should we go? Hae Jo…

391
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:19,242
How is a naïve, unlucky girl like me

392
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,577
supposed to live without you?

393
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:28,000
Life won’t be any fun without you.
How am I supposed to live?

394
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,711
Hae Jo…

395
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:37,635
Please don't die
and leave me here all alone.

396
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,972
Seriously, don't die!

397
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,479
Seriously, what would you do without me?

398
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:59,073
My back fucking hurts. What's going on?

399
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,285
Where are we?

400
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:07,081
Where are we?
Hey, can you untie this thing?

401
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,876
What is this? Is this a goddamn dream too?

402
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,044
Fuck. What do you mean, a dream?

403
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:16,007
Hurry. I'll choke to death
before this disease kills me.

404
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,010
-Hae Jo!
-Why does my head hurt so much?

405
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,262
Stop. That hurts!

406
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,516
Stop slobbering on my face and untie this.

407
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,894
And why does my head hurt so much?

408
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,025
I can totally picture what you did.

409
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:40,031
Hey, seriously! I was so scared.

410
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,953
By the way,
was my lottery ticket a winner?

411
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,164
It was a dud.

412
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,209
Fuck.

413
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,254
Hey, is that really important right now?

414
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:59,383
And why didn't you tell me you were sick?
You know I can't take a hint.

415
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,677
Why didn't you just tell me?

416
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:03,930
Was it a shock?

417
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,015
Obviously.

418
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:10,019
It wasn't to me.
I just thought it was a little unfair.

419
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,064
When did you find out?

420
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:18,152
That day at that funeral home,
when you begged a lady to give you a baby.

421
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,784
An eventful day for both of us then.

422
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,995
Goddammit.

423
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,375
We really are a match made in heaven then.

424
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,670
No. More like a match made in hell.

425
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,509
So? Where are we going?

426
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:45,137
-To find candidate number four.
-Do you know where?

427
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,555
In Gangwon Province.

428
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,517
That's so far away.
How are we going to get there?

429
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,434
With my car.

430
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,228
Does it even work?

431
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,692
What are you gawking at?
Give me my car keys.

432
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,694
Am I seeing a ghost?

433
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,323
Hear that? Ghost, my ass.

434
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,159
Wow. You really are alive.

435
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,705
-Hae Jo! Fuck, seriously.
-Get off me.

436
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,958
You got my car fixed, right? Where is it?

437
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,627
Hey, how did you get out? On your own?

438
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,920
Are you okay? Let's see.

439
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,506
I'm not okay.
I hit my head and it fucking hurts.

440
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,717
Guess it woke me up though.

441
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,802
Just like a faulty TV set.

442
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,430
Next time you conk out,
I'll give you a good smack.

443
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,890
Enough of your bullshit.

444
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,311
Find me some clothes to wear
and a pair of shoes too.

445
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,480
Where are you going at this hour?
And where's Jae-mi?

446
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,233
At the store.
You got Number Four's address?

447
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,985
-Text it to me.
-Are you insane?

448
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,739
-I'm screwed if Bong-suk finds out.
-Have you spoken to her?

449
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:50,453
I kinda messed up,
so I've been dodging her calls.

450
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,038
What do I do?

451
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,664
44 MISSED CALLS
BONG-SUK

452
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,749
You are screwed.

453
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,212
What should I get for his head?

454
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,424
Ointment and Band-Aids.
Would three be enough?

455
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,305
Oh, forget it.

456
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,974
I'm off.

457
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,857
Let go before I throw up.

458
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,734
You will come back?

459
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,944
If you behave yourself.

460
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:29,533
Promise me that you'll come back…

461
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,123
and I'll be your lackey
for the rest of my life.

462
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,635
-Deal.
-Really?

463
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,971
Then I'll be waiting for you.

464
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,307
Okay, I hear you. Let me go, man.

465
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,476
Ditch me and I'll fucking kill you.

466
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,104
Just don’t stab me in the back again.

467
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,522
-Yes, I promise.
-I'm off.

468
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:03,234
I'll do better, so keep your promise too.
I'm all yours, for life!

469
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:09,490
Tell Bong-suk that I love her.

470
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,326
Seung-hyeok, I love you!

471
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,455
I love you, Seung-hyeok!

472
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,625
Fucking idiot.

473
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:28,551
I will never rob the fish store again

474
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:32,012
Those days
When I used to cry tears of sadness

475
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,682
I'm a loner

476
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:40,813
Now I'm off to the beach

477
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:46,110
To catch some fish with spider webs

478
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:51,866
I'm a romantic cat

479
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:57,580
A little dancing starlight
Shining over the sad city

480
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:08,883
Here.

481
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,342
Another one? It's too much.

482
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,762
Hey, are you trying to choke me or what?

483
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,098
No, you need to eat well
to live a long time.

484
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,975
God, you're so clumsy.

485
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,977
-What?
-Who's taking care of whom?

486
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,978
Is it gone?

487
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,202
Wow, I'm so good at this.

488
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,423
My stream's so weak.
Am I running on empty?

489
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,800
I'll say!

490
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,552
Hey, goddamn it!

491
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,262
Shit. Come here. You're so dead.

492
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,890
I wasn't looking! I only heard the sound!

493
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,808
Why would you listen? You pervert!

494
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:04,021
Well, they say your pee stream
can be a good indicator of your health.

495
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,316
What kind of moron told you that nonsense?

496
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,610
Just an oriental medicine doctor I know.

497
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,112
Hey, Eo Heung's a quack.

498
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:13,697
No, he's not.

499
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,200
Forget everything he told you.

500
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,747
Are you sure I can go ahead
and delete them all?

501
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,042
Yes.

502
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,421
If it's at all possible…

503
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:35,553
I also want to erase
all the memories she and I share.

504
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,349
Even though they're etched in my mind now.

505
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:02,121
DELETE 257 ITEMS - ARE YOU SURE?
YES

506
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,172
I want to buy this.

507
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,800
-This one? Yeah, it looks good.
-Yes. It's so nice.

508
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,760
-Which color do you want?
-Me?

509
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,846
-Is it a gift from your boyfriend?
-Yes.

510
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,098
Hey!

511
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,228
Hey, go. Go now.

512
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,106
No! Let the car behind us pass first.

513
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,941
But you said, "Go now."

514
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,735
Ever heard of a side mirror?

515
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,864
No! You've gotta let the raging bull pass.

516
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,782
What bull? Where?

517
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,744
I told you about cars
with wild animal logos.

518
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,121
They're fucking expensive.
Keep your distance.

519
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,498
My mouth hurts
from saying it over and over!

520
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,416
Goddammit.

521
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,378
Hey, the circles!

522
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,882
Split, overlapping,
or with letters inside. Stay away!

523
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:58,177
Just stay in the same lane
until we get there.

524
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,143
Hey.

525
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,481
Where are you going?

526
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:13,776
Walking to Hongcheon.
Give me around two weeks.

527
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,694
Go ahead and wait for me there.

528
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,490
I'm sorry.

529
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:23,118
I said I'd learn another time,
but you insisted on me doing it now.

530
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,953
Then you lose your patience.

531
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,539
Sorry, I won't this time. Let's try again.

532
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,833
Just saying sorry won't cut it.

533
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,964
Okay! I'll take you on a shopping spree.

534
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:44,139
-This is nice. Try it on.
-No, it's okay.

535
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,352
Are you looking for clothes
with floral prints?

536
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,688
No, they don't need floral prints.

537
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,272
You'll look like a cute lamb.

538
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,233
-No.
-Try it on, it'll look different.

539
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,401
It's not my style.

540
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,278
-What is your style?
-This. The Love Cat!

541
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,988
Didn't see anything you liked?

542
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:03,033
Well, they only sell
expensive designer stuff here.

543
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,077
That's why we're here.

544
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,287
To treat ourselves and look nice.

545
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,957
No need for nice clothes
when we have nice faces.

546
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,836
Hey, who will you be meeting?

547
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,256
We're meeting your father, aren't we?

548
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,924
That's right, dummy.

549
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,343
Do you want to meet your father-in-law

550
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,637
in these rags you've had on for days?

551
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,889
Right! Let's go back and buy it.

552
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:27,891
No.

553
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,394
That's more like it.

554
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,784
-Do you like it?
-Yes, I love it.

555
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:51,498
Now, shall we?

556
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:53,709
Yes, we shall.

557
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,628
Hurry up. This is embarrassing.

558
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,548
Awkward pose. Try again.

559
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,633
What should I do?

560
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:45,677
Tra-la-la!

561
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,855
-Let's take one together.
-Okay.

562
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,818
One, two, three.

563
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,112
-Do you mind taking a photo of us?
-Sure.

564
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:16,792
All right, here we go. One, two, three!

565
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,628
I'll take one more.

566
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:23,006
One, two, three.

567
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,872
So, do you like this view?

568
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,165
I love it.

569
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,044
It was worth the effort to drag you out.

570
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,090
Jae-mi.

571
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:11,388
Do you think those stars
we're looking at are still alive?

572
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,140
What do you mean?

573
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,808
I mean, think about it.

574
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:19,771
Those stars are out in space
somewhere very far away.

575
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:23,692
We're not seeing actual stars,
just their light that's reached us.

576
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,905
If a star is really far away,

577
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,825
it can take billions of years
for its light to get to us on Earth.

578
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:35,537
So many of the stars we see
are already dead and gone.

579
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,832
What are you getting at?

580
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,792
It's fascinating.

581
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:45,422
A star may no longer exist,

582
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:50,677
but its light still shines
right in front of our eyes.

583
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,765
Looking up at the night sky,

584
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,977
I’m struck by how meaningless
the line between life and death is.

585
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,815
And I'm struck by how deeply
you think about these things.

586
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,487
-Maybe you should start.
-No need.

587
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,989
I have you.
I can be as thoughtless as I want.

588
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,583
Are you all right? Do you need your meds?

589
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,418
-Where are they?
-I don't need them.

590
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,129
-Come on. Where are they?
-No, I need something else.

591
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,422
What do you need?

592
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,007
What…

593
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:30,550
A kiss.

594
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:34,304
It can be ten times more effective
at reducing pain.

595
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,263
So kiss me quick.

596
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:36,723
You asshole.

597
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,892
Don't joke about things like that.

598
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,479
-Want me to beat the crap out of you?
-Sorry. Just one kiss, please?

599
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,855
Oh! Hey.

600
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,941
You nearly killed me, goddammit.

601
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,527
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

602
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,112
-You're sorry?
-I am.

603
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,321
-For real?
-Yes.

604
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,239
Then kiss me.

605
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,165
Cheers!

606
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,335
Hey, you're really fun.

607
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,587
You're so much fun!

608
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:52,758
Me? Fun? What makes you think that?

609
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,177
I'm not fun!

610
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,261
What the hell?

611
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:01,641
Life's no fun now that Jae-mi is gone!

612
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,269
Hey, Jae-mi?

613
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:06,688
-What are you doing?
-Aren't you Jae-mi?

614
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:07,773
Jae-mi?

615
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,400
Please help me find Jae-mi!

616
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,444
-You need to leave.
-Let go!

617
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,945
Sorry but you're drunk.

618
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,781
Let go. I said let go!

619
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,534
-You hit me!
-Hey, sir.

620
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,244
Bring it on!

621
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,245
SECOND MOTHER

622
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,372
Just kill me, go ahead.

623
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,958
-Let go. Hey!
-Heung. What's going on?

624
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:30,921
Heung!

625
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,673
Oh no. Oh my goodness!

626
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,674
-Let go!
-Heung!

627
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,178
Oh no. Not my Heung.

628
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,348
-Ho-ja.
-I might drop dead at this rate. Get John.

629
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,557
John!

630
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,518
-Hurry.
-John!

631
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,443
Ho-ja!

632
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,613
Do you even know where he is?
Wait until the morning.

633
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,782
It's not like he's actually going to die!

634
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:14,923
How exciting!

635
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,425
This road is so freaking curvy.

636
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,804
Twisty, twisty, twisty, twisty

637
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:23,390
What do you know about the next candidate?

638
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,349
Nothing much.

639
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:27,769
But Kkari said,
"You'll know it when it happens."

640
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,813
Something inside says, "This is it."

641
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,482
The power of blood ties
and celestial bonds.

642
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,534
I need to put some makeup on.
First impressions are everything.

643
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,996
You don't need makeup to look pretty.

644
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,250
-What's with you today?
-What do you mean?

645
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:54,004
I'm not used to so much flattery.

646
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,673
It's not the first time.

647
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,676
I've said before
how you'd make a great wife.

648
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:03,763
Right after that compliment,

649
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:07,142
you crushed my dreams
by saying I should never become a mom.

650
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,148
Do you still want to be a mom?

651
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,158
Jae-mi.

652
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:28,830
The menopause thing is only like
having a wart next to your belly button.

653
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,041
It's not that big of a deal.

654
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:35,795
It may never go away,
but it's not going to ruin your life.

655
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,422
Just a little wart there.

656
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:39,841
All right?

657
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,135
Okay? Hey.

658
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:45,055
I'm not saying you actually have a wart.

659
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:49,976
Did you really have to say all that now?
My mascara got all smudged.

660
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,854
You're the one with warts, you jerk!

661
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,189
Hey.

662
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,149
Oh no. You look like a panda.

663
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,235
-I have to start over.
-Don't.

664
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,820
-Why are you laughing?
-Do we have any tissues?

665
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,323
Crap. What am I going to do now?

666
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:06,660
-You look pretty without it.
-I can't go looking like this!

667
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,046
So this is it? Nice house.

668
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,258
We should be upfront
from the start, right?

669
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,134
Short and sweet.

670
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:26,513
So I'll entrust you
with this one too, Dr. Jo.

671
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,139
If that's what you want.

672
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,155
We're trying to locate his sperm…

673
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,783
-I mean, the sperm donor.
-Yes, who is it?

674
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,495
We're looking for the sperm donor. Good.

675
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,330
May I help you?

676
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,891
You'll know it when it happens.

677
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,853
Something inside says, "This is it."

678
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:19,190
The power of blood ties
and celestial bonds.

679
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,238
-Looking forward to school break?
-Yes.

680
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:27,949
No plans yet, right?

681
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:50,263
Hey! Why are you leaving without me?

682
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,432
Hey, Hae Jo!

683
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,728
Hey! Hae Jo, where are you going?

684
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:58,980
Wait up!

685
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,318
Don't ditch me like this.
I'm coming with you.

686
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:04,778
Hey!

687
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:13,620
I promise I'll find out
your actual birthday, no matter what.

688
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,714
I should've known.

689
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,886
He was acting too nice.

690
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,225
You bastard!

691
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,482
You total asshole.

692
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:31,364
You're the one who just ditched Jae-mi.

693
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:37,245
So why are you bawling your eyes out
like an abandoned child?

694
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,757
Bro.

695
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:00,310
I abandoned Jae-mi again.

696
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:06,191
I told her I'd spend
the rest of my life with her,

697
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:12,780
but I just ditched her
on the side of the road again.

698
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,292
Here.

699
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:25,919
Bro…

700
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,216
Here, eat this.

701
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,888
Seriously. That's gross.

702
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,349
What a mess.

703
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:42,060
Just blow. Give me a nice big "heung!"

704
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,021
God.

705
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,692
Man, you're so gross.

706
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,194
Blow!

707
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,502
Are you done crying?

708
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,004
