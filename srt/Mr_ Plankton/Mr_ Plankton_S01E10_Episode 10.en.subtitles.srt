1
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,973
Hey. Excuse me.

2
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,895
Can we just…

3
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,738
Do you know who I am?

4
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,038
Do you know who I am or not?

5
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,629
Look at me. I said look at me!

6
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,617
Honey! What's taking so long? Who is that?

7
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,911
Just a minute!

8
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,417
Do you know who I am?

9
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:15,927
You don't know?

10
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,139
You really don't know?

11
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,603
Then why did you look like you knew?

12
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,859
Why are you messing with my head again?

13
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,617
Why would you

14
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,328
abandon me all over again?

15
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,206
Why?

16
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,312
Miss! Do you need a ride?

17
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,734
-Let's just go. She seems a bit off.
-Don't be like that.

18
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,029
Where are you headed?

19
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:21,075
I don't know. I have no idea.

20
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,748
That warty jerk!

21
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,258
How about a compliment? I did a good deed.

22
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,345
You call abandoning her a good deed?

23
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,513
I didn't abandon her. I found out

24
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,350
her real birthday.

25
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,562
Are you proud of that?

26
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,732
Fine.

27
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,069
I'm just an asshole, right?

28
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,073
Yes, a total asshole.

29
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,243
I can't believe
that all I did for her before dying

30
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,247
was leave her at her birth mother's door.

31
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,751
I’m a piece of shit.

32
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,505
What a jerk.

33
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,095
GOODBYE
YOU ARE NOW LEAVING GANGWON STATE

34
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,349
GOODBYE
MR. PLANKTON

35
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,907
That jerk abandoned me.

36
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,952
Tearing him into pieces
wouldn't be punishment enough.

37
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,413
So why am I so worried about him?

38
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,373
Damn it.

39
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,543
What if he passes out at the wheel again

40
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,212
and crashes?

41
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:02,260
Why am I such a pushover? This sucks.

42
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,682
Huh?

43
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,685
-Hello?
-Jae-mi?

44
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,187
Thank God!

45
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,189
Where are you right now?

46
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:19,819
I've been walking up this mountain road,
but it seems to be leading nowhere.

47
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,071
Wait, more importantly,

48
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,990
where's Hae Jo?

49
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,159
Listen, Jae-mi.

50
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,662
I’ll send a cab to your location.

51
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,247
Take it and come to Seoul.

52
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,583
Share your location with me.

53
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,293
He's heading back to Seoul?

54
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,134
Ma'am. She's on her way from Hongcheon.

55
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,179
If he steps on it,
she'll be here in an hour and a half.

56
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,930
Hongcheon? Jesus.

57
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,433
Does she have wanderlust or what?

58
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,394
She's traveling all around the country.

59
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:58,024
But is it really necessary
to use Jae-mi to find your runaway son?

60
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,484
I'm afraid so.

61
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,362
It wouldn't be necessary

62
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:07,158
if you hadn't deleted
the location tracker thing from his phone.

63
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,786
That's the reason
for this needless hassle.

64
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,288
And Gal-ja got me so worked up

65
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,375
I couldn't wait any longer, goddammit.

66
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,710
You want this?

67
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,338
Seriously?

68
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,675
Why the hell is everyone
always asking me to find people?

69
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,803
What am I, the North Star? Damn it.

70
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,265
Where’d she go?

71
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,558
What now?

72
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,646
Jo Jae-mi.

73
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,815
-Well--
-Spill it.

74
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,693
Hae Jo's dying
and she's dragging him around.

75
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,823
Wait, what's all this that I'm hearing?

76
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,825
Hey, you're here!

77
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,701
That little…

78
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,495
-Damn.
-And who are you?

79
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,541
And why are you looking for Jae-mi?

80
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,168
To find my boy.

81
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,337
Oh God.

82
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,966
That means we're in this together.

83
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,309
-Hey, you're bleeding.
-I'm all right.

84
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,644
What?

85
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:27,738
HAE JO
THIS TIME, I'LL FIND YOU!

86
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:35,621
SO JUST STAY ALIVE!!!

87
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,086
Please.

88
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,473
Come here instead
of the Internet café. Quick!

89
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,892
22, TOEJEONG ROAD, ALLEY 47

90
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,520
Excuse me, sir.

91
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,109
Where are we going after this?

92
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:06,652
I don't know.

93
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,239
There's no place I want to be.

94
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,912
What about your father?

95
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,416
What's the point?
Jae-mi's not with me anymore.

96
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,554
You really should eat,
even if you don't have an appetite.

97
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,098
Your meds are strong.

98
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,979
Appetite is a funny thing.

99
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,857
I was so hungry I could've eaten a horse.

100
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,860
But since throwing up, I can't face food.

101
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,863
Still, you need to eat.

102
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,826
My mother always says
that if you still can take a bite,

103
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,247
you have at least ten more years in you.

104
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,709
So take five bites
and you'll make it to 80.

105
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,305
Come on, just five bites.

106
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,308
Open wide.

107
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,853
Come on, be a good boy.

108
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,483
Knock, knock. Open up, please.

109
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,778
I'll spank you if you don't.

110
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,743
Fine, then don't.

111
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,663
Don't eat.

112
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,584
You never listened to your mother
while growing up, did you?

113
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,004
How did you know?

114
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,925
I'm still being punished for that.

115
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,183
What is with you today?

116
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,812
I'm tired of playing LEGO with Dad.

117
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,148
Please give me
a little brother or a sister.

118
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,067
-Tired of LEGO? Then paint with me.
-Seung-hyeok!

119
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,278
Son!

120
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,829
-Is Seung-hyeok here?
-What? I don't know.

121
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,539
He wanted to play LEGO.

122
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,625
Hey, Seung-hyeok!

123
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,131
Mom! I want a brother or a sister!

124
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,842
Stop painting and make me one.

125
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:39,180
Doctor, I was just wondering
if it would be possible

126
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,266
to use my husband’s frozen sperm again

127
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,769
for another baby?

128
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,315
Really?

129
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,317
Yes, thank you.

130
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,779
I was the reason everyone became unhappy.

131
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,407
Pandora's box was now open.

132
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,372
And my mom found out
that I came from some stranger's sperm.

133
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,084
-Nice.
-Nice. One.

134
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,003
-You see how the ball bounces out?
-Yes.

135
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,590
When it hits the glove,
close your hand so it doesn't bounce out.

136
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,217
-Okay.
-You got this?

137
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,176
Yes, I got it.

138
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:22,264
-It went over the fence! Over the fence!
-Wow! It's a home run! Yes!

139
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:27,269
-Home run!
-Home run, yay!

140
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,400
-Dad! I got a perfect score!
-That's my boy.

141
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:36,070
Great job! You got a perfect score!

142
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,573
Mom was going to keep it a secret forever.

143
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,701
What? A brother or sister?

144
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,913
Quiet. Mom told me not to tell you.

145
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,499
Okay, I'll keep it a secret. I promise.

146
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,127
But I blew it.

147
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,423
I'm so sorry.

148
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,299
I don't know what to tell you.

149
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:58,926
Sir,

150
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,679
we'll take legal responsibility.

151
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,597
When were you going to tell me?

152
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,600
Never.

153
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,601
Never?

154
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,565
Don't you know
what having a child means to me?

155
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,900
I was willing to die, Hae-won!

156
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,237
I risked my life to have our child!

157
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,243
But you were going
to make a fool of me forever?

158
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,120
How could you?

159
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,163
What now, then?

160
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,791
Want to get rid of him?

161
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,420
What?

162
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:38,632
You're too worried about your reputation
to do that anyway.

163
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,470
It would've been better
if you didn't know.

164
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,182
Then you could've carried on
being a good dad!

165
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,266
What's the point?

166
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,771
He's not even mine!

167
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,749
Honey.

168
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,627
Are you asleep?

169
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,549
Mom.

170
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,928
Are you going somewhere?

171
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,184
Do you want to go stargazing with me?

172
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,730
No, I'm sleepy.

173
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,037
All right.

174
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,457
Go to sleep.

175
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,020
Honestly, I was scared.

176
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,942
Scared I might never see Dad again
if I went with her.

177
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,781
Are you Seong Hae-won's husband?

178
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:12,286
We found your wife's car this morning
at the bottom of Mount Baegun.

179
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,203
But that choice

180
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,207
led to the complete opposite result.

181
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,996
Dad.

182
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,666
I don't need a brother or sister anymore.

183
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,421
All I need is you.

184
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,235
What scared and upset me

185
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,530
more than my mom's death

186
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,616
was the thought of being abandoned.

187
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,744
I was only eight.

188
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,872
Eight years old.

189
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,545
Dad, would you like to play LEGO with me?

190
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,171
I earned a new belt…

191
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,347
I came from a stranger's seed,

192
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,600
but if I stood my ground,
maybe I'd be able to put down roots.

193
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,063
I could be so naive.

194
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,244
Let's have Jjajangmyeon.

195
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,622
I'll wait for you outside school at noon.

196
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,724
CONGRATULATIONS CLASS OF 2011

197
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,642
It was my graduation day.

198
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,688
It was the perfect time to choose my path.

199
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,613
If he came, I was going to go back home.

200
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:57,117
If he didn't come,
I was going to wander around forever

201
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,203
without putting down roots.

202
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:08,170
So I hoped he would come.

203
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,590
"Please show up for me."

204
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,721
That day, I threw it all away.

205
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,643
The man who was once my dad,
my life as Chae Seung-hyeok…

206
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,019
EXCELLENCE AWARD

207
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,396
…and my belief in unconditional love.

208
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,023
Everything.

209
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,828
It was the worst cold spell in a century.

210
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,835
But since I came from frozen sperm,
I've always been built for the cold.

211
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,294
My God.

212
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,299
The toughest thing was hunger, you know.

213
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,552
A teenage boy could die

214
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,304
after ten days without food.

215
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,349
How did you manage to get by?

216
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,852
I didn't.

217
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:09,398
I’d resorted to digging through trash
but then I hit the jackpot of my life.

218
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:10,983
Jackpot?

219
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,989
Hey, are you homeless?

220
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:17,948
DRUMSTICK CHICKEN

221
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:18,907
That day,

222
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:23,412
I used up the last bit of luck I had left.

223
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,836
-Let's go.
-Where?

224
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,629
To hit up my jackpot.

225
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,374
Wait, how are you two together?

226
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,964
Kkari. Where's Hae Jo?

227
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,842
-Hey, how did you get here?
-What?

228
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,345
That's what I want to ask you. Come here.

229
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,304
Hey, I--

230
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,182
We need to talk.

231
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,227
But…

232
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,230
What the hell is going on?

233
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,150
I told you she wasn't with him.
Give me back my phone.

234
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,695
Why do you need my phone?

235
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:45,869
EO HEUNG

236
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,750
The number you have dialed is currently…

237
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,086
What's going on?

238
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,463
Send him a message to give you a call.

239
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:57,881
Say it's urgent.

240
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,802
No, actually,
tell him to come meet you here.

241
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,262
He'll listen to you.

242
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,013
Did something happen to him?

243
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,642
He didn't run away from home, did he?

244
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,231
No way.

245
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,858
He really is a man of his word.

246
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:20,737
You know,

247
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,865
I ran away from home.

248
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,534
What?

249
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,583
Well, look at you.

250
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,044
You're a BR then. You're a BR.

251
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,588
-What's that?
-A BR. You don't know?

252
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,174
Like BI, beginner investor.
Or BG, beginner golfer.

253
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,884
BR is a beginner runaway.

254
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,680
I've been a runaway for 14 years.
So technically, I'm your senior.

255
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,849
-Excuse me, Mr. Senior.
-Yes.

256
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:53,520
You might think it's shameless
and ungrateful of me to say this,

257
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,438
but honestly…

258
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,233
I'm a little jealous of you.

259
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,946
-What do you mean?
-The way you live your life.

260
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,700
It looks like you do as you please
without giving it much thought,

261
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,118
but to me,

262
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,371
it's impressive.

263
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,586
It’s pretty cool, actually.

264
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,923
I’ve always followed orders

265
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,926
and never stepped out of line.

266
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,933
I was cold, I was hungry,

267
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,436
and I didn't know where to go

268
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,191
or what I should do
to be happy like other people.

269
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,154
It was my decision to leave home.

270
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,243
But I wished somebody would come
and take me in

271
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,748
like an abandoned dog.

272
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,295
Then you called me.

273
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,254
ASSHOLE

274
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,342
You said you were going to dump Jae-mi,

275
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,095
and I could come if I wanted.

276
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,932
Not to take her back though.

277
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:14,935
Forget it.

278
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,145
I'm never gonna let you have her.

279
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,855
-Why not?
-I'd be too jealous.

280
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,524
I'd hate to die a jealous man.

281
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,693
Learn to be happy on your own.
Not together with her.

282
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,446
Wow, you really are an asshole.

283
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:31,243
Still, as a veteran runaway,
let me give you some tips.

284
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,205
Never set a destination.

285
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,291
You feel like you must do something?
Well, fuck that shit.

286
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,836
Just let your instincts guide you.

287
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,587
That way, you won't get lost.

288
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,842
You throw yourself into the unknown,
then you're not adrift anymore.

289
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,635
You become a drifter.

290
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,471
What bullshit.

291
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,349
-Moo.
-Moo.

292
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,690
Why did you want to do this?

293
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,525
Why not? It's liberating.

294
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,778
-I don't have a towel.
-Hey, what are you doing?

295
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,113
Hey, stop!

296
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,240
-But you'll hit me!
-No, come back.

297
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,200
Grow up already.

298
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,871
Hey, Heung! Seriously?

299
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,332
Knock, knock, drink up.

300
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,585
Fine, but don't say "Knock, knock."

301
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,216
You've got to knock first.

302
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,177
Are you insane? Just eat.

303
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,762
Knock, knock!

304
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,598
You'll get us killed!

305
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,142
It'd be nice to die together. Let's do it.

306
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,936
-You want to die, do you?
-Hey, okay.

307
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,731
For God's sake.

308
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,816
How long does this take?

309
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,068
Here.

310
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,790
THE PATH TO THE WORLD
WELCOME TO SEOUL

311
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,629
I left him a voicemail
saying to call me as soon as he gets it.

312
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,216
Now it's down to him.

313
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,719
Well, would you like some tea?

314
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,513
You're a saint.

315
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,183
Being so nice to me
after all I've done to you.

316
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,854
I'm doing it for myself.

317
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,400
I feel like if I'm rude,
you'll show up in my dreams

318
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,028
saying "I want my son back,"
strangling me--

319
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,238
What?

320
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,575
You can be suffocating sometimes,

321
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,828
but you're a great mom really.

322
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,708
What kind of sugarcoated insult was that?

323
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,337
You never gave up on your child.

324
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,340
You nourished him and raised him well.

325
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,888
Boy, I should've had a daughter like you.

326
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,643
I insisted on having a son
to carry on the stupid family line,

327
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:02,686
and now here I am.

328
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,688
Goddamn it.

329
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,899
Sorry to interrupt.

330
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,694
I have a question.
How did you two end up in Hongcheon?

331
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,697
Gwangmyeong is the address I gave.

332
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,949
And how do you know that kidnapper?

333
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,785
-Why Hongcheon?
-For some beef?

334
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,621
-Are you together?
-Did you have a fight? Why--

335
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,872
My mom!

336
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,088
Hae Jo left me

337
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,757
at my mother's house.

338
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,595
I had never met her in my life.

339
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,689
I guess he wanted to find out
my actual birthday.

340
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:52,652
I hated that my official date of birth
was the day I was left at the orphanage,

341
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:58,033
so I always picked some random day
and said that was my birthday.

342
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,580
So? When is your real birthday?

343
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,377
It's the same. The day I was left.

344
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:13,465
Goddamn animal! She abandoned her child
as soon as she gave birth to her?

345
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,550
That's no mother.

346
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,553
She deserves to be beaten to a pulp.

347
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,721
Hey, John!

348
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,058
-Damn.
-No need.

349
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,393
I have guys out there. Her address?

350
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,311
Hang on.

351
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,313
No one uses physical force these days.

352
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,690
I can expose her online.

353
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,233
Name and date of birth?

354
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:37,155
I didn't know you all had my back.
That makes me so happy!

355
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,198
Her address!

356
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:41,451
I'm being serious.
Don't protect her because she's your mom.

357
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,828
Name and date of birth. I'm so pissed.

358
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,916
Wow. You know what? Drinks are on me.

359
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,293
Ju-ri. Can we raid your bar?

360
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,628
But you lost your wallet.

361
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,465
And I never sell on credit.

362
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,386
Hey, Mother's treat.

363
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,514
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

364
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,556
Really?

365
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,267
-That's cool of you.
-No one's ever done this for me!

366
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,603
I'm freaking jealous.

367
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,855
Fried chicken delivery!

368
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,123
-Shit.
-Damn.

369
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,500
-Stop!
-Run!

370
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,960
You jerk!

371
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,547
-Heung, it's me!
-Hey, that hurts!

372
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,966
-That hurts!
-You think this hurts?

373
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,936
What's with the long face? You hit me.

374
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,563
That's not fair.

375
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,649
You're not sorry at all, are you?

376
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:58,111
What, should I shake my butt again?

377
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,281
You're unbelievable. Unbelievable.

378
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,909
You were unconscious, then you vanished.
Is that funny to you?

379
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,121
Why didn't you call?

380
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,458
You could've at least texted me,
for God's sake.

381
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,210
I was worried sick.
Did it never occur to you?

382
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,546
No, I guess it didn't.

383
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:21,634
Come on, why would I think about you?
You're nobody to me.

384
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,304
You're not my girlfriend or my mom.

385
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,974
You just took in some poor fucking kid
for a while. That's all.

386
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,271
Just think of me
as a stray dog you took in

387
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,816
because you were lonely
and needed some warmth, okay?

388
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,570
Are you scared?

389
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,327
Don't act all tough.

390
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,287
Everyone

391
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,832
is scared of death.

392
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,089
Hae Jo.

393
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,969
You're not going to die.
So don't be scared, okay?

394
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,313
-Bong-suk.
-Yes?

395
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,483
I…

396
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,611
can't sleep.

397
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,951
I really want to sleep,
but my head hurts too much.

398
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,955
It feels like
my brain’s full of tangled threads.

399
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,581
I'm losing my fucking memory.

400
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,502
What if I completely lose my mind soon?

401
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,088
What if I die alone somewhere?

402
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,674
No, you won't.

403
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,093
I'll never let that happen.

404
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,021
What did I ever do?

405
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:00,608
Huh?

406
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,113
What did I do to deserve this?

407
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,700
Being born by accident,

408
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,744
left to wander the streets,

409
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,207
and suddenly die
as if struck by lightning?

410
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,342
I was abandoned.

411
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,596
No one came looking for me.

412
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:35,727
Why?

413
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:42,108
So why do I have to be discarded?

414
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,486
Huh?

415
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,336
Why do I…

416
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,299
Why do I…

417
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,801
Why do I have to…

418
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,307
Why me?

419
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,108
Your phone.

420
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,902
Oh, right.

421
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,586
MOTHER - WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?
DO YOU WANT ME TO DROP DEAD?

422
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:34,721
Open it.

423
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:36,973
Okay.

424
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,061
The door.

425
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,313
Open it and get out.

426
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:45,815
Me?

427
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,526
Okay.

428
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,578
Mother?

429
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,663
What…

430
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,208
Mother.

431
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:16,888
Hello?

432
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,432
Go and have your fun.

433
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,769
Have all the fun you want,

434
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,604
then come home

435
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,233
when you’ve had enough
and miss my cooking.

436
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,908
But please keep your phone on.

437
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,870
And try to stick to the main roads, okay?

438
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:44,373
When you cross the street,
use the pedestrian overpass.

439
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,085
Mom.

440
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,671
Yes?

441
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,633
How's your back doing?

442
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:57,845
You threw your back out the other day.
Are you feeling better now?

443
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,474
Oh, for God's sake.
I'll be fine once I lose a little weight.

444
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:05,186
You need to lose a lot. Maybe ten kilos.

445
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,730
I'm hanging up! You're making me carsick.

446
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,667
John, mind if I borrow those things again?

447
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,177
Listen.

448
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,389
Don't go back to America.

449
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,058
Why don't you just stay here?

450
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,980
You can be my second son.

451
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,444
Forget it, then.

452
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,534
Fine, I'll stay then.

453
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,036
Mom.

454
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,677
Wow. I didn't think
I'd be giving you this again.

455
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,099
Here. Wipe your face with it.

456
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,900
Somebody blew their nose in it earlier,

457
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,818
so I was going to toss it.

458
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,237
But

459
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,866
if you want, you can wash it and keep it.

460
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,587
You always give, and I always take.

461
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,423
Like with these shoes.

462
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,301
You've given me much more.

463
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:47,223
You said I was a tiger now,
not a whimpering dog.

464
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,601
You made that possible, Jae-mi.

465
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:54,855
Thank you.

466
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:03,906
But honestly, don't you think
the shoes I got you were prettier?

467
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,827
They were.

468
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,037
Where are they?

469
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,914
I threw them away.

470
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,251
Over the roof of a restaurant in Namwon.

471
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,504
-Hey, come here.
-What?

472
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,304
Beat him to a pulp, Jae-mi!

473
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,776
Hey, where are we going?

474
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,281
You gonna bury me
in the woods or something?

475
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,453
Fine, go ahead.
Bong-suk did the left, you do the right.

476
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,579
Come on, slap me.

477
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:54,999
Just do it. Go on.

478
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:00,087
Why would I hit you? I want to hug you.

479
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,132
Such a good boy.

480
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,511
Hey, I can't breathe.
Wait. I can't breathe, okay?

481
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,596
Thank you.

482
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,932
For finding out my real birthday.

483
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,935
And for coming back safely.

484
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,897
Thank you so much.

485
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,602
Ow! Hey!

486
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,979
That knock some sense into you?

487
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,483
What the fuck? This is a nuclear bomb.
What if it explodes?

488
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,402
-Well, it didn't.
-Hey.

489
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,363
I am grateful,
but you totally deserved that.

490
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,032
I found out my birthday
but why run off like that?

491
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,367
Hey, remember this?

492
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,830
You told me to stay
and said you'd protect me from lightning.

493
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,541
You promised to take care of me forever,

494
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,501
then you ditched me and ran away?

495
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,045
It's the best thing
I could've done before I die.

496
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,255
Are you serious?

497
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,507
Yet your last dying word to me was "shit."

498
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,509
What are you talking about?

499
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:32,221
When you were on the brink of death
after getting stabbed on that island.

500
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,560
Sh…

501
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,186
Sh…

502
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,312
"Shit"?

503
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,357
Oh my God.

504
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,528
What? You're pretending
like you don't remember again.

505
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,656
Oh my God! You idiot!

506
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,452
I wasn't saying "shit."

507
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:59,832
I was saying "shoes."
These shoes you bought me! God.

508
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,669
Shoes? What about the shoes? Why?

509
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:08,007
When we were on that island
and you asked me to come with you,

510
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,885
I actually wanted to go

511
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,388
wearing the shoes you got me.

512
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:21,312
That's what I was trying to say!

513
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:30,821
Why?

514
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,161
Because I thought I might die.

515
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,044
I was scared I'd never get to tell you…

516
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,174
that I wanted to be with you.

517
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,765
Because I love you.

518
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,161
You win.

519
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,249
You win, Jae-mi. I lose.

520
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,417
I surrender. Yeah.

521
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,963
Then bow down to me. Go on!

522
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,048
Yes, ma'am.

523
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,218
What the heck? What are you doing?

524
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,886
Hey, I'll bow down to you,

525
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,138
if you promise me you'll stay.

526
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,683
-Put me down now!
-Come on, promise me.

527
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:41,934
Fine! I promise.

528
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:45,813
By the way, I heard you.
You think the other shoes are prettier?

529
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,399
-No, these are!
-Then why did you say that?

530
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,150
-I heard you.
-No, I mean it!

531
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:54,530
Hey, I'm going to puke. No, put me down!

532
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,574
Let's drink all we want tonight.

533
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:57,992
Eo Heung, three!

534
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,661
Eo Heung, Eo Heung, Eo Heung! Jae-mi, two!

535
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,414
Jae-mi, Jae-mi… No, hang on.

536
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,499
-You missed it on purpose.
-Chug!

537
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,668
Hae Jo, Hae Jo!

538
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,461
-Eo Heung, four!
-Eo Heung…

539
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,380
I thought he was a seal. "Arf-arf."

540
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,383
Oh shit. I was freaking nervous.

541
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,847
Another round. One, two, three, four!

542
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,849
I am ground, introduce yourself!

543
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,268
Wait for one beat, jump in on the next!

544
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,519
Jae-mi, three!

545
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,230
Jae-mi… what?

546
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:35,362
-Bong-suk, four!
-Bong-suk, Bong-suk, Bong-suk, Bong-suk!

547
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,990
-Kkari, three!
-Kkari, Kkari, Kkari!

548
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,368
-Eo Heung, three!
-Eo Heung, Eo Heung, Eo Heung, Eo Heung!

549
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,953
-You lost!
-Come on, chug!

550
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,788
-Who lost?
-You have to drink!

551
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:48,959
Jae-mi, two!

552
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,045
Okay!

553
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,298
-I really don't think I can do this.
-No backing out!

554
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:04,683
Cool Kkari,

555
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,187
jolly Jae-mi,

556
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,272
happy Heung,

557
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,193
and my jackpot bonus, Bong-suk.

558
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,066
Hae Jo.

559
00:44:55,984 --> 00:45:00,280
You and I are going
to split everything now, okay?

560
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,366
Fifty-fifty.

561
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,809
Hae Jo.

562
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:23,947
Where are you going?

563
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,409
Where?

564
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,296
It's cold. Let's go back.

565
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:42,925
No. I have to go find him.

566
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:45,469
What? Find your father right now?

567
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,473
I'm running out of time. I have to go.

568
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,310
No, wait!

569
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,730
I'll come with you.

570
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,609
Hae Jo, let's go get the car keys. Okay?

571
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:02,945
Hae Jo.

572
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,116
Hae Jo, I'll go get the keys.

573
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,787
Wait for me here, okay? Right here, okay?

574
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,415
He was sitting here earlier.

575
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,672
Shit.

576
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,299
-Whoa, it's so noisy.
-Man.

577
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,676
Hey, what is it?

578
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,804
Where are Hae Jo's car keys? It's urgent.

579
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,473
-Help me!
-Hey, where is he?

580
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,184
-Outside, he wants to look for his dad.
-What?

581
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,186
-Donor four? Now?
-He's acting weird.

582
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,437
Wasn't he done looking?

583
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,148
-Is he sick again?
-I should be with him!

584
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,733
-I should go now!
-Hey.

585
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,901
-Hey!
-Jae-mi.

586
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,361
-What's going on?
-Jae-mi.

587
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:53,203
Hae Jo! Hae Jo, wait!

588
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,832
Hae Jo!

589
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,460
He shouldn't be going by himself.

590
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,170
Seoul 61, license number 7880.

591
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,324
Dad?

592
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,443
Seung-hyeok.

593
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,034
Yeah.

594
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,334
Seung-hyeok.

595
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:52,591
Yes.

596
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:05,645
Seung-hyeok.

597
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:09,858
Yes.

598
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:14,571
Yes.

599
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,291
Seung-hyeok.

600
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,337
Seung-hyeok.

601
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:10,710
Seung-hyeok.

602
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,424
Yes.

603
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,419
She looks better without bangs.

604
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,275

CHAE SEUNG-HYEOK
GRADUATION

608
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:28,974
Your room’s…

609
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:33,853
still the same.

610
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,561
There's no place like home.

611
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:36,893
What the heck?

612
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,363
Fucking hell.

613
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:54,077
Who… who are you?

614
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,960
Don't tell me…

615
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:09,092
You must be a ghost.
This is the fucking second floor!

616
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:12,095
-You scared me!
-You scared me more.

617
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,888
How did you get up here?

618
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:16,808
What's that?

619
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:19,060
Well, Kkari helped me.

620
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:22,856
He even knows all the moving companies
that catch nighttime runaways.

621
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,232
Jo Jae-mi.

622
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,903
-Do you like me that much?
-Yes, that much.

623
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,698
Oh, for God's sake.

624
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,244
Are you happy to see your real dad?

625
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:37,954
Yes, I'm happy.

626
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:43,126
But it's a bit awkward and uncomfortable.
Both this house and my dad.

627
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:46,921
I'm finally home
after wandering for so long,

628
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,340
so why does this feel so weird?

629
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,176
That's perfectly normal.

630
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,262
Everyone feels stifled at home
and awkward around their dads.

631
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,847
Is that so, Ms. Know-It-All?

632
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,433
Hey, is your father home?
I should meet him--

633
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:02,061
No, don't. He might try and pay you off.

634
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,230
-Why?
-He owns a midsize company.

635
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,734
And he never lets strangers into his home.

636
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,612
-He's a freaking recluse.
-Then what should we do?

637
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,282
-Let's tell him I'm pregnant.
-Hell no.

638
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:17,076
That is a sensitive topic here
because of me.

639
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,413
So what, then? Should I just go?

640
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,042
Well, I guess we have no choice now.

641
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,462
You came all this way on a ladder truck.

642
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:28,421
So go for it.

643
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:30,882
Go for what?

644
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,926
Kidnap me.

645
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,364
Wow.

646
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,126
Are you up?

647
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:31,693
I'M YOUR FATHER - CEO CHAE YEONG-JO
I'M YOUR SON! - CHAE SEUNG-HYEOK

648
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,643
-Totally worth the wait.
-So good.

649
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:08,354
-Can I have a glass of soju?
-Of course not!

650
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,772
-Beer?
-No way!

651
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:12,775
They say her bouillon
makes such a tasty broth.

652
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,069
…we're joined by Chef Bum Ho-ja.

653
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,779
Hello. I'm Bum Ho-ja.

654
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:17,864
No way!

655
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,240
I'm excited to present

656
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,993
Heung's Kitchen all-natural seasoning.

657
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:24,954
Heung's Cube.

658
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,831
This single cube

659
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:31,210
encapsulates all the cooking knowledge
I've accumulated over 60 years.

660
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:34,213
Wow, she used to hate flavor enhancers.

661
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:37,091
-The broth…
-It's freaking delicious, right?

662
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,344
Yes. Freaking… Freaking delicious.

663
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:42,180
"Freaking delicious"?
You're on air, you know.

664
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,682
No sunglasses? Nice.

665
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:52,440
Diaper.

666
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:55,318
-Persimmon.
-Monkey Poop.

667
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,903
Poop bag.

668
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,666
Don't look.

669
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:10,833
What's happening?

670
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,336
Keep them closed. One, two, three.

671
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:18,007
-What's this?
-Happy first real birthday.

672
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,300
Oh! Thank you.

673
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:31,688
What do you think?
Bright, good water pressure,

674
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,189
and it won't be demolished.

675
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,233
Get it, then.

676
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,985
The owner's fucking demanding.
Greedy as fuck.

677
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:40,029
What? What are you talking about?

678
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,824
You wanted to pay
only 10% of the rent price.

679
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:45,118
You know what?
Forget your new errand house.

680
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,412
Just date each other.

681
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:49,747
-Are you nuts?
-Are you freaking crazy?

682
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,170
-It's beautiful.
-It is.

683
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:58,339
When are we going to wash our hair?

684
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,382
I brought water.

685
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,843
I won't fall asleep. I'm not tired.

686
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:03,845
-You've been sleeping.
-I haven't.

687
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,473
-What's wrong? Is it closed?
-Yeah.

688
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,317
This isn’t gonna work.

689
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,736
-Enjoying it?
-Yes.

690
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,612
You always complain about it.

691
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,072
Oh, shush.

692
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:26,617
-He's gay.
-What?

693
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,119
What's this?

694
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:30,747
Hello!

695
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:34,500
Welcome to Heung the Drifter.
I'm Eo Heung.

696
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,502
So I'm climbing up

697
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,046
Mount Geumbyeong right now.

698
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:42,091
It's been a while since I've gone hiking.

699
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,676
It's pretty tough.

700
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:48,222
I once climbed Mount Gudeok in Busan

701
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,558
to find my bride--

702
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,358
We're separated now,

703
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,945
but the breakup didn't just leave me
with heartache and scars.

704
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:07,658
It has made me stronger,
helped me move forward,

705
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,203
and allowed me to grow

706
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,538
and explore the world out there.

707
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,082
Don't set a destination.

708
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,460
Don't feel pressured to do something.

709
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:20,880
Only then can you become a drifter,
instead of being lost.

710
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:26,344
I'm Eo Heung.
Thank you for watching Heung the Drifter.

-I don't like it.
-I like it a lot.

714
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:37,313
-I don't fucking like it.
-What's your problem? I do.

715
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:40,733
Then go drift with him.
What are you doing here with me?

716
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:43,194
Are you jealous?

717
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:44,737
Jealous?

718
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:48,157
Hey, that whole drifter thing was my idea.
He totally stole it!

719
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,245
Ms. Jo Jae-mi,
where are you taking me today?

720
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:55,832
How about somewhere high up,
where we can see the ocean?

721
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,792
High up, where we can see the ocean?

722
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:03,464
-It's so cold.
-It's cold. Come on.

723
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,007
It's freezing.

724
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,678
-The wind!
-Go inside and get warm.

725
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:10,638
Come on.

726
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,682
-Take off your clothes.
-What?

727
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:15,977
-Why? It's cold!
-We need to share body heat.

728
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,104
-Stop it!
-Then it won't be as cold.

729
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:19,021
Take them off.

730
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,777
What are you doing? Stop it.

731
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,531
-Come on, I'm cold!
-All right! Fine!

732
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:30,199
HAE JO AND JAE-MI'S FUN HOME

733
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,416
Damn it.

734
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:51,345
Seriously, how much longer?
The heater's busted and it's freezing.

735
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:54,932
How much longer
must we live on the road like beggars?

736
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,684
Not beggars. Wanderers.

737
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:01,272
-You said it was romantic.
-Only for a few days!

738
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:03,441
-So what?
-I want to stay at a hotel.

739
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:04,650
You do that.

740
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:06,611
Stop the car!

741
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:12,241
You told me to stop.

742
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,370
Hey, all right. I was just joking.

743
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,788
Come on, it was a joke!

744
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,461
I'll get the heater fixed, okay?
Where are you going?

745
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:32,595
-Hey.
-God.

746
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:34,889
How much farther will you go?

747
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,352
I'm sorry, all right?

748
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:41,437
All right?

749
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:44,482
Hey, I'm sorry, okay?

750
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,568
What?

751
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,049
Whoa.

752
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:25,606
Are you insane? Hey, stop!

753
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,275
-Hey, wait.
-Check out all the snow!

754
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:32,655
-Hey, be careful, okay?
-Go away! Oh my God!

755
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:34,573
What…

756
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:37,827
What are you doing?

757
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:40,538
-You…
-Are you crazy?

758
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,002
You…

759
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:50,715
You nutcase! Get over here!

760
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:51,757
Hey.

761
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:53,801
Hey! You…

762
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,288
Now it’s your turn to be on the bottom.

763
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:23,998
-Me? No!
-It's your turn.

764
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,383
Hey, are you all right?

765
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:38,179
Look, clovers.

766
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,473
There might be a four-leaf clover.

767
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,603
-Have you ever found one before?
-Of course!

768
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,480
-Liar.
-Hey.

769
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:49,982
We’re way too unlucky to find one.

770
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,859
Don't be a buzzkill again.

771
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:53,903
-You want to bet?
-On what?

772
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:56,197
If you find one, we book a hotel.

773
01:07:57,448 --> 01:08:00,576
But if I find one,
we drift in that car forever. Deal?

774
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,078
-Deal!
-Deal?

775
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,162
-Deal!
-Deal!

776
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:10,377
I don't see one here. Shoot.

777
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,881
I'm going to beat you to it!

778
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:17,635
I'm gonna find one first.

779
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:25,351
Hotel!

780
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:26,852
Yay!

781
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:30,689
Over there.

782
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,177
Found one.

783
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:10,771
Hey, Jae-mi!

784
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:14,859
Hey, Jo Jae-mi!

785
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:28,330
Shit.

786
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:14,543
I'm going to die now.

787
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:26,722
Every night,

788
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:31,268
I imagined what it'd be like to die.

789
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:42,071
Hae Jo!

790
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,034
Hae Jo!

791
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:49,828
Hae Jo!

792
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:54,583
Would it feel exhilarating,
like jumping over a high hurdle?

793
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:57,002
Hae Jo!

794
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:03,634
Or would it feel liberating,
like throwing off soaking wet clothes?

795
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:11,892
Or maybe it would be as mundane as
like walking from one subway car

796
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:14,019
to the next.

797
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:18,732
Hae Jo, no!

798
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,485
No, Hae Jo!

799
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,112
Hae Jo!

800
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:28,325
You fucking bastard!

801
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:35,374
No. That's not it.

802
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:41,630
Now that I'm facing it,
it's nothing like that at all.

803
01:11:45,759 --> 01:11:47,261
I want to live.

804
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,722
I'll kill you!

805
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:52,224
If you die, I'll kill you myself!

806
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:55,394
I swear I’ll kill you!

807
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,147
No…

808
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:02,276
I…

809
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:04,486
I want…

810
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:08,824
I want…

811
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,539
I want to live.

812
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:22,796
I want you in my arms.

813
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:30,846
I want to love you…

814
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:33,766
more…

815
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:37,644
for longer.

816
01:12:56,038 --> 01:13:00,000
Hae Jo, wake up!

817
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:03,462
Please, Hae Jo.

818
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:06,840
Hae Jo, wake up! Hae Jo, please.

819
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:11,303
Hae Jo, look at me. Hae Jo.

820
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,587
In the end, the final scene of my life

821
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,090
is you.

822
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:54,054
Well I guess that means

823
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:56,557
I had a pretty good life.

824
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:01,687
Honestly, it was so much fun.

825
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,357
In every way possible.

826
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,278
I love you.

827
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,240
I love you.

828
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:40,601
I love you.

829
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:28,458
