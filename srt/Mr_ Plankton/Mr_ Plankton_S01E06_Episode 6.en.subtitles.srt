1
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,730
You're very handsome.

2
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:25,984
-On every blind date, I turn into a dog.
-You're my type.

3
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,153
-Yes, a dog.
-Not that looks matter to me.

4
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:32,615
Like the dog in Pavlov's experiment,
trained to drool when a bell rings.

5
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,452
-Exactly like that.
-I want three kids.

6
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,080
-Sorry. Here's a wet wipe.
-Let me…

7
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,165
Man, it's cold!

8
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,333
-Oh dear.
-It's hot!

9
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,002
Oh no, I…

10
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,297
Seriously?
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

11
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,133
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

12
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,469
-For heaven's…
-Women who look like my mother.

13
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,386
Don't you pout.

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,721
Whenever I meet them,

15
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:58,391
I feel like a scared puppy facing a tiger.

16
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,770
I whimper like a dog
instead of roaring like a tiger,

17
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,856
and I really hate myself for it.

18
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,656
Tell me about it!
What can I do? I'd love a baby girl…

19
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,493
Aren't you hungry?
The rice cakes are great.

20
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,244
Try the honey cookies too.

21
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,997
These are a gift from my father to you.

22
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,167
They're really good for men's health.

23
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:29,923
I don't know where my mother finds
all these women who are just like her.

24
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,176
Are you okay?

25
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,469
I'm fine.

26
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,055
Here, drink up. There's a good boy!

27
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:40,475
How about a weekend stay at a hotel?
I have free vouchers!

28
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,977
Why can't I just say I don’t want this?

29
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,312
Because…

30
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,480
31ST BROTH CONTEST

31
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,565
-Are you making broth?
-Yes.

32
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,192
You're using the wrong knife!

33
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,151
Because

34
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,239
my mother is…

35
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,532
What on earth is that?

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,952
…simply terrifying.

37
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,955
Get out of my kitchen!

38
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,251
So many people
have been kicked out like worthless dogs

39
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,378
after crossing my mother.

40
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,421
How dare she use a flavor enhancer?

41
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,550
Still, you've got to admire her courage.

42
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,260
That's how I learned that…

43
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,013
What a moron.

44
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,640
…crawling like a dog

45
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,476
would actually make my life easier
than crossing her.

46
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,437
After all,
it’s best to let sleeping dogs lie.

47
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,483
Then I met her.

48
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,486
The student who was kicked out.

49
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,614
-My dear Jae-mi.
-Excuse me.

50
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,991
Here.

51
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,326
Sorry?

52
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,747
Yes, five birds.

53
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,416
Five birds!

54
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,254
We just opened.

55
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,256
HEUNG ORIENTAL MEDICAL CLINIC

56
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,382
No way.

57
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,928
I was just about to cry.

58
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,054
At first,

59
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,641
I liked how she tried
to put on a brave face.

60
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,275
Here's a fresh one.

61
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,322
Would you like a candy?

62
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,950
The cinnamon is too spicy!

63
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,412
I've got other flavors.

64
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,667
What's all this?

65
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,214
I was happy I could do something for her.

66
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,506
I also have this.

67
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,594
I loved how she smiled
at even the smallest things.

68
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,346
How do you even eat this?

69
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,145
One, two, three.

70
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,274
Hang on. One, two, three.

71
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,611
Ta-da!

72
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,283
This looks amazing.

73
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,326
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,162
Don't be. It looks great. I like these.

75
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,456
It's good.

76
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,666
-It is?
-Delicious.

77
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,503
Everything was fun when I was with her.

78
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,880
The joy she brought gave me confidence.

79
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,135
In those moments,

80
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,514
I finally felt like a tiger, not a dog.

81
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,130
That’s the first time I felt the urge

82
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,590
to be strong like a tiger

83
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,677
so I could protect the person I loved.

84
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,353
When I told her

85
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,398
I'd protect her for the rest of her life,

86
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,525
she said,

87
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,446
"Empty promises mean nothing."

88
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:26,034
So I wasted no time
in putting a ring on her finger.

89
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,410
Perfect fit.

90
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,747
You have no idea

91
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,875
how beautifully she smiled at me.

92
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,944
She said she'd wait for me.

93
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:16,084
MR. PLANKTON

94
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,769
Man, looks like it's gonna pour down.

95
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,939
-We should head inside--
-You son of a bitch!

96
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,044
Listen, I…

97
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,511
Thank God.

98
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,519
It's okay.

99
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,397
I found you. Everything's okay now.

100
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,026
I'm so sorry.

101
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,493
Don't say that.

102
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,626
Let me see. Are you okay?

103
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,837
Look at all those scratches.

104
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,049
-What happened to you?
-What?

105
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,510
Did you tumble down a mountain?

106
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,262
Not exactly.

107
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,556
You didn't go up there, did you?

108
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,725
To the cabin? Really?

109
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,643
Of course. How could I not go?

110
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,229
Why? Why would you do that for me?

111
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,315
What do you mean?

112
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:06,068
Why would you recklessly follow me
and put yourself through all of that?

113
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,696
-That's--
-Don't you have better things to do?

114
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,615
I told you over the phone!

115
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,284
I couldn't find my way back to you!

116
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,786
-I--
-You should've given up!

117
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,746
I couldn't.

118
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,750
Why would you do this for me?
I'm nothing special.

119
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,959
Don't say that!

120
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,631
You're more than special. You're a jewel.
My family. My family jewels!

121
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,389
I mean…

122
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,100
Not "family jewels" as in…

123
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,687
Not these ones.

124
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,110
Was that a little laugh I heard?

125
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,738
How about a big, hearty one?

126
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,284
It'll make me feel better.

127
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,096
It’s all fine now.

128
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,599
It's all good.

129
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,728
It's all over now, so let's go home.

130
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,732
Let's go home
and get some long-overdue sleep.

131
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,193
-Put this all behind us--
-Hey! Run!

132
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,113
-Get him!
-Run! Fuck!

133
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,157
-Fuck!
-Stop right there!

134
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,369
Stop, you bastard!

135
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,997
Run! Come on!

136
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,249
-Come on, let's go!
-What? Oh, shit!

137
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,876
-Be careful.
-Damn.

138
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,629
-Fuck!
-Stop right there!

139
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,550
You idiots! Move faster!

140
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,516
Wait! Okay, come on!

141
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,559
What the hell?

142
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,105
-Go on, Jae-mi.
-Damn it.

143
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,608
-Jae-mi, this way.
-Oh shit!

144
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,028
Over there! To the right!

145
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,991
Get them! Catch them!

146
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,367
Run faster!

147
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,955
Come on, let's go!

148
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,715
-Hurry, we need to run!
-This way. Come on.

149
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,760
-Shit.
-To the right!

150
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:36,927
Get him!

151
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,889
Get him!

152
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,436
-You have the keys?
-I just stole them.

153
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,481
-What?
-The rope! Untie the rope!

154
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,316
Yes, untie it!

155
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,692
Goddamn it.

156
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,986
-Damn it!
-Hurry!

157
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,404
Damn it.

158
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,407
Hey, I got it!

159
00:10:59,075 --> 00:10:59,950
Almost done.

160
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,079
Where do you think you're going?

161
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,289
-Watch out!
-What?

162
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,629
-What the fuck?
-He caught it?

163
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:15,091
Why does that asshole in leather
keep showing up?

164
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,133
Go get him!

165
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,385
Mr. John Na.

166
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,261
Hey! The rope up front!

167
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,806
-Up front!
-Heung, up front!

168
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,599
Fucking asshole!

169
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,976
-We've got to go now! They're coming!
-Fuck!

170
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,361
Fuck!

171
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,241
Hurry up! Come on!

172
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,327
Chop it!
Just fucking chop it with the axe!

173
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:44,954
Damn it!

174
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,832
Fucking hell.

175
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,834
I'm so fucking screwed.

176
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,585
Where are the bastards?

177
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,421
You motherfucker!

178
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,883
Don't come any closer! No!

179
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,096
Push him, goddammit!

180
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,141
Fuck!

181
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,893
You fucking bastard! Goddamn--

182
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,228
Get off him!

183
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,148
-Fucking bitch.
-Fuck!

184
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,694
Motherfucker!

185
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,821
You fucking bastard.

186
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,787
You fucking…

187
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,752
-Heung, hurry up! Come on!
-Hurry!

188
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:37,047
-I got it!
-Heung! Yes! Come on!

189
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,967
I got it! Wait, Jae-mi!

190
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,969
Heung! Get on the boat!

191
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,929
Jae-mi!

192
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,973
Heung, get on the boat!

193
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,268
You asshole! Turn the boat around now!

194
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,644
Heung!

195
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,062
-Wait for me!
-Heung!

196
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,774
-Jae-mi!
-Heung!

197
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,902
-Jae-mi!
-Heung!

198
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,071
Take me with you, Jae-mi!

199
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,908
-Heung!
-Jae-mi!

200
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:11,791
Heung!

201
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,423
Jae-mi,

202
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:06,428
we can finally consummate our marriage
as husband and wife.

203
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,181
No need to hold back anymore.

204
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:14,186
Oh, boy.

205
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,231
All right, then.

206
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,193
Time to roar!

207
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,332
Roar.

208
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,046
It's so soft.

209
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,427
Jae-mi.

210
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,979
Close your eyes, honey.

211
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,901
I feel shy.

212
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,908
Roar.

213
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,036
Roar.

214
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:37,728
Heung!

215
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,986
Where are w--

216
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:50,115
I don't know. I'm not sure.

217
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,412
Well, let's go see
what's on that side over there.

218
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,956
What? But…

219
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,249
Watch your step.

220
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,196
Oh, fuck.

221
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,637
Where is everyone?
We need to borrow a phone.

222
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,182
Listen, we should…

223
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,898
We should what?

224
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,359
Well,

225
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,614
we're supposed to be
on our honeymoon right now.

226
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:57,910
How about we pretend we're in Hawaii
staying at a resort for a few days?

227
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,704
No.

228
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,214
Right. There's no place like home.
Let's just go--

229
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,924
I can't go with you.

230
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,846
I'm sorry. The truth is--

231
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,973
-Jae-mi, stop.
-The truth is, I--

232
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,016
Hey, look.

233
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,394
What's that?

234
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,481
It's…

235
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,103
Where's your other shoe?

236
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,857
It got washed away, I guess.

237
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,401
Why didn’t you say anything?

238
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:16,196
You could easily get hurt here.
Sit down. Let me see.

239
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,243
Take this off.

240
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,665
You'll hurt your feet
in cheap shoes like these.

241
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,264
They say good shoes
take you to good places.

242
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:46,560
No wonder you've had a rough journey,
wearing those.

243
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,861
I had to scour the whole country

244
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,447
to find a pair in your size.

245
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,032
Are they comfortable?

246
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,170
Thank you.

247
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,216
For keeping your promise.

248
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,386
That you'd come find me

249
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,514
if I ever ran away.

250
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,975
So promise me

251
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,395
that you'll never let go of my hand.

252
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,439
You kept your promise,

253
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,317
but I couldn't keep mine.

254
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,503
I'm sorry.

255
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,756
-The truth is--
-I…

256
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,969
I don't want to know.

257
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,887
I need to tell you.

258
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,472
No, you don't.

259
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,015
-I--
-I'm not listening.

260
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,022
I can't give you children.

261
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,318
I have premature menopause.

262
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:23,824
I tried to keep it a secret
and marry you anyway.

263
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,201
Menopause?

264
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:30,247
I should’ve ended it when I was diagnosed.

265
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,419
Menopause?

266
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,261
So then,

267
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,265
the whole thing was
about menopause and not that jerk?

268
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,477
That's all? Just menopause?

269
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,563
"Just"?

270
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,983
You're telling me
you couldn't come back to me

271
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,652
because of some stupid menopause, right?

272
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,365
-"Stupid"?
-Oh my God! Are you serious?

273
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,498
You scared the hell out of me!

274
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,500
You're a little devil!

275
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,585
Oh, man!

276
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,714
But what about your family?
The 500-year lineage--

277
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:26,345
I'll just tell them I'm infertile.
Who cares about the family line?

278
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,138
I'd never lose you over that.

279
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,931
But your mother--

280
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:30,849
Seriously?

281
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,353
I don't care about my mother or the clan

282
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,398
as long as we are happy together.

283
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,235
Just the two of us.

284
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,031
The three of us.

285
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,621
-Where did you come from?
-I've been here the whole time.

286
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,914
Hey there!

287
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,127
I guess you've been following us around
like a puppy dog.

288
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,462
That's adorable.

289
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,632
I didn't. You two just walked in a circle.

290
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,218
We haven't even been walking
for that long.

291
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,345
Look.

292
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,015
I swam from there last night,

293
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,434
dragging the two of you by your hair.

294
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,853
There's no one around and no phone signal.

295
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,606
You can walk around
the whole place in ten minutes.

296
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,900
This is a tiny, deserted island.

297
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,235
No way.

298
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,196
And that means
the three of us are stuck here

299
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,407
until somebody comes to rescue--

300
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,785
No, that can't be.

301
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,246
A deserted island?

302
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,165
No!

303
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:44,714
No!

304
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:56,351
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable. Please leave…

305
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,188
What is it?
Is Heung not answering his phone again?

306
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,940
Old sayings are never wrong.

307
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,026
"Out of sight, out of mind."

308
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,403
And it's true.

309
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,030
He stays out for days,

310
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,950
and now doesn't care about
his mother or family anymore.

311
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:16,329
This is why
you must keep your children close.

312
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,165
I bet they'd just love that.

313
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,255
The number you have dialed is…

314
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,215
How odd.

315
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,176
Your go-to is not answering either?

316
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:33,138
It's not like him
to be unreachable for so long.

317
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:37,267
You know what?
I see what's happening here.

318
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,394
What would that be?

319
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,272
-Sonjeol.
-"Sonjeol"?

320
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:49,070
Sonjeol.

321
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:55,285
SONJEOL 1. THE CESSATION OF A FAMILY LINE
2. (SLANG) THE SEVERANCE OF A RELATIONSHIP

322
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:06,421
"The end of the family line"?!
That would be a disaster!

323
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,256
Our clan cannot end here!

324
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,383
Oh, ancestors, don't let this happen!

325
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:15,514
This cannot be what it means!

326
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,068
You switched shoes just like that, huh?

327
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:29,986
What?

328
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,532
I'm just happy for you.
He's fine with the menopause.

329
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,911
You can just march back into his palace,
hand in hand.

330
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,415
There's no reason not to.

331
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,464
Yet when I asked you to leave,
you refused.

332
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,801
So why did you tell me to go?

333
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,722
Was it to send me out of harm's way

334
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,642
so you could die
fighting those thugs alone?

335
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,149
Hey. Speaking of which,

336
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,361
why are they after you anyway?

337
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,824
Where do I begin? All right.

338
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:20,745
Hey, I really don't get it.
Why are you chasing after me?

339
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:24,165
-'Cause I fucking missed ya.
-I thought Kkari told you.

340
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,252
That woman hired me to kidnap her.
That's all, I swear.

341
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,503
-That's all?
-Yes.

342
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,506
-Is that so?
-What the fuck else could have happened?

343
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,846
She cracked his safe
and ran off with the money.

344
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,431
She played us.

345
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,891
So, just run.

346
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,685
Damn.

347
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,146
I like that gaze.
How about you come with me?

348
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,815
Fuck. She threw me under the bus too?

349
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,734
Clever bitch.

350
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,736
Fuck, I should've left with her.

351
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,405
"Left with her"? You motherfucker.

352
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,450
-I'll make you leave this world now.
-Wait.

353
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,494
What would you gain by killing me?

354
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,330
-My face.
-What?

355
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,249
His face. You know, his face.

356
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,085
His mug, his grill.
You know, as in "face."

357
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,757
So you're saying you want to kill me
just so you can save face?

358
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,426
That seems pretty fucking unfair.

359
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,596
Hey, I've got a fake tooth
and a prosthesis here.

360
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,933
You gave me this new face
in front of 300 guests,

361
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:24,851
you bastard.

362
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:28,813
I brought all my boys out here
to kill you,

363
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,315
so if I don't,

364
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,400
what face do I have left to save at all?

365
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,986
So this shit won't end unless I die?

366
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,529
Exactly.

367
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,199
There's no stopping me now.

368
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,745
I was prepared to hunt you down
to the ends of the earth to kill you.

369
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:50,043
You're mine now, Hae Jo.

370
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,969
-You want me?
-Yes.

371
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,225
-Where are you going?
-Fuck.

372
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,186
That son of a bitch. Get him!

373
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,813
Hey! Run!

374
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,857
Run! Fuck!

375
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,779
-Heung!
-Jae-mi!

376
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,825
Man, what a total nutjob!

377
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,535
Right? He's a total psycho.

378
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,537
-Yes.
-You think so too, right?

379
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,914
Yes. You crazy asshole!

380
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,458
Are you trying to get stabbed to death?

381
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,836
-Hey.
-Is kidnapping a joke to you?

382
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:33,878
-No, wait.
-Hey.

383
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:38,341
-You kidnap random women and wreck lives!
-That hurts.

384
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,515
What did I do?

385
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,684
-Damn it! Hey!
-Hey.

386
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,812
-Wait, the sand is hot!
-What? You scared me!

387
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,856
It really is under ten minutes.

388
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,734
You've already kidnapped two women.

389
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,235
I think you're jealous.

390
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,695
Jealous, my ass!

391
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,363
-She's jealous!
-I am not!

392
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,574
-Whatever.
-You're a criminal!

393
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,534
So are you! This is assault.

394
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,286
-This doesn't hurt!
-It does.

395
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,412
Like hell it does.

396
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,498
All right, I'm sorry.
I'll never kidnap anyone else.

397
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,667
You're such a pain!

398
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,254
Take me back home first
before you kidnap anyone else.

399
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:33,104
ROCK-BOTTOM MOTEL

400
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:53,416
Members of a Seoul-based gang
were apprehended at Busan Port last night

401
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,585
following a violent brawl.

402
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:59,422
The Busan Metropolitan Police,
acting on an anonymous tip,

403
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,591
arrested most of them at the scene.

404
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:05,345
They are now focusing their efforts
on locating Wang,

405
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,263
the leader of the Prince Gang.

406
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:11,351
The authorities are urging the public
to come forward with any information.

407
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:46,177
So you don't know where they are
or whether they're alive or not?

408
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:52,559
All right, I see. I'll look into it.

409
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,145
What about you?

410
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,273
Are you all right?

411
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,193
Take good care of yourself.

412
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,849
Oh, jeez.

413
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,438
Damn it.

414
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,317
Let me make this clear

415
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,820
so you won't think that I've forgiven you.

416
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,698
When everyone's survival is at risk,

417
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:53,578
you can't have a fair fight
and determine the winner.

418
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,787
So you're saying

419
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:58,958
we should form a temporary alliance
before we all end up starving to death.

420
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,419
-That's right.
-Sounds like fun.

421
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,338
What? Fun?

422
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,425
"A woman on a deserted island
with her current boyfriend and her ex."

423
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,385
"Who will she choose?"

424
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,554
It sounds like a Netflix show.

425
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:15,892
Ex?

426
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,231
You didn't know?

427
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,027
Well, it's…

428
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,488
Of course I didn't know!

429
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,823
But why should I?

430
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:35,078
Your relationship ended a long time ago.

431
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:40,833
There's a saying that goes,
"Don't look back at a broken steamer."

432
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,670
And it's true. You shouldn't. Why?

433
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,090
Because it doesn't work anymore, right?

434
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,884
It's long gone.

435
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,094
There!

436
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,930
What a sneaky little fish.

437
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,576
It's just menopause.

438
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,454
Stupid menopause.

439
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,960
Why was I so worried about it
like an idiot?

440
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,772
What are you doing?

441
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,276
What are you doing?

442
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,916
What? Are you going to kill me?

443
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:45,958
Yeah.

444
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:56,135
No, why should I?

445
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,013
You two broke up.

446
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,523
You jerk!

447
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,318
You're nothing but a thug!
Get out of here.

448
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,445
Die. I'm going to kill you.

449
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,988
You bastard!

450
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,701
You sure you're okay?

451
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,246
With her menopause.

452
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,958
She was so upset.
It was like her life was over.

453
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,252
Does it really mean nothing to you?

454
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,005
How's that any of your business?

455
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,636
By the way, you knew about her condition?

456
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,514
Yes. I was at the hospital with her.

457
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,686
Oh, and I overheard you earlier,

458
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,939
saying something like,
"Just the two of us is enough."

459
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,816
Jae-mi wouldn't like that.

460
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,735
Just two people relying on each other.

461
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,323
She only wants to marry to have a family.

462
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:04,245
Why on earth would you want
to throw away your big family advantage?

463
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,292
You're either dumb
or you really don't know Jae-mi.

464
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,961
Hey.

465
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,796
Damn you!

466
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,964
You…

467
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,181
Fuck. Come here.

468
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,559
Come here!

469
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,353
Hey! Let go! Fuck!

470
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,564
I'm gonna…

471
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,983
-You idiots!
-You little…

472
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,451
Goddammit.

473
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,502
I told you to catch fish,
not beat each other up.

474
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,838
I can't believe how childish you both are.

475
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,507
We could be stuck
on this tiny-ass island forever

476
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,843
or starve to death soon,

477
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,012
and there you are fighting like kids.

478
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,388
For God's sake.

479
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,183
Can't you see
we're in the middle of a crisis here!

480
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:12,146
While I'm running around looking for food,
you guys waste your energy on fighting?

481
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,689
But he's the one…

482
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,982
-What?
-Never mind.

483
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,901
You're as bad as each other.

484
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,986
-Not true.
-No, we're not.

485
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,626
-Shoot.
-What?

486
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,387
You're just amazing, Jae-mi.

487
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,973
You can build a fire, catch octopuses,

488
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,767
and find fresh water. Is there…

489
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,437
Come here. Is there anything you can't do?

490
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,817
Cook, save, clean,
control herself, and know when to stop.

491
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,527
Shut up and eat.

492
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:03,322
How can I eat if I shut my mouth?
Like this?

493
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,657
What's wrong with you?

494
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,369
It's hot. Let me do it.

495
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,580
I got it. This side isn't so hot.

496
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,999
That's it. There you go.

497
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,341
It's hot.

498
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,805
-Hey, give me one too.
-That's good.

499
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:31,017
-You think they're gross.
-Not when they're cooked. Come on.

500
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,519
Give me--

501
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,979
That's all I'm giving you!

502
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,318
Damn.

503
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,619
Hey. What are we going to eat tomorrow?

504
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,789
Never mind that.
How are we gonna get out of here?

505
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,959
We aren't. No one’s coming for us.

506
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,920
-I have someone who is.
-True, except he's right here.

507
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,883
You've got someone too. That thug.

508
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,343
Right. That's true.

509
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:10,139
Chil-seong! I'm over here!

510
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,683
Come get me!

511
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,644
Where's that bastard when you need him?

512
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,356
Jae-mi, don't worry.

513
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,067
My mother will do whatever it takes to--

514
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,485
Exactly.

515
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,571
She and I would be totally screwed
if you weren't here.

516
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,282
We'd have died on this island
without anyone knowing.

517
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,911
I know it is sad, but it's so funny.

518
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:36,082
There's only one person in the world
who'd come looking for me.

519
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,376
-And he's right here.
-And he's here.

520
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:45,341
My stomach! It hurts.

521
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,384
Mine hurts too.

522
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,720
Seriously.

523
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,723
-Hey!
-What?

524
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,767
Come with me.

525
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,353
Come with me!

526
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,271
What the…

527
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,405
Keep going!

528
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,032
Wait, where are we going?

529
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,620
What are we doing here?
You want to go for round two?

530
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:24,296
Fine. Bring it on then.
First in the water and now on land?

531
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,595
What's that move?

532
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,142
You've gotta be kidding.

533
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,560
Goddammit.

534
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,272
Fucking hell.

535
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,529
Did you really drag me all the way up here

536
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,905
to watch you take a shit?

537
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:53,784
Yeah, because I didn’t trust you
alone with my Jae-mi.

538
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,036
The jealousy is making your stomach turn.

539
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,413
It's the mussels.

540
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,624
-The mussels?
-I'm a Lesser Yin body type.

541
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,961
Things like mussels and oysters
upset my stomach.

542
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,171
Then why eat it?

543
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:08,007
Because Jae-mi gave it to me. Why else?

544
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,762
You'd eat shit for her?

545
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,647
And he loves me more than I deserve.

546
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,818
He's not scared of commitment.

547
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,905
That's why I chose him.

548
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,573
That's what love is to me.

549
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,951
To support and cherish no matter what.

550
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,037
And I know I can do that.

551
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,413
You can trust me.

552
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,710
Commitment?

553
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,779
Damn it. I knew that jerk would be gone.

554
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,241
What's he planning to do
to my Jae-mi now? Hey!

555
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,955
What? Hey, what the…

556
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,959
Hey, are you okay?

557
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,503
Stay with me. Hey.

558
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,463
Hae Jo. Chae Seung-hyeok.

559
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,090
Stay with me, Seung-hyeok!

560
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,054
Hang on.

561
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,475
Seung-hyeok, stay with me, okay?

562
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,227
Seung-hyeok!

563
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,063
Daddy's here! Over here, son!

564
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:50,276
-Come to Daddy!
-No, come to Mommy!

565
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,112
-Here! Are you coming to Daddy?
-Come to Mommy!

566
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,616
Come to Daddy!

567
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,535
Yes! Daddy's here!

568
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,291
Okay, here.

569
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,127
Hang on.

570
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:42,620
All right.

571
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,083
What's taking them so long?

572
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,462
Are they fighting again?

573
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,076
Goodness.

574
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,412
Doctor.

575
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,915
How long have I got left?

576
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,002
About 50 years?

577
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,297
I’ve cursed you so much,

578
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,676
maybe you’ll last another 500 years.

579
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,763
You must be a quack.

580
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,726
The others said I had three months tops.

581
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,319
Three months?

582
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,450
Does that mean there's no cure?

583
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,663
Let's see. What did they say again?

584
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,002
They took pictures of my brain.

585
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:58,964
My vessels are all messed up,
so they said the blood will start to clot,

586
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,467
and my head will blow up soon.

587
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,135
Apparently, it's genetic.

588
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,513
They gave me about three months.

589
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:08,724
I don't believe this.

590
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,352
That can't be.

591
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,106
What? Wait. Are you crying?

592
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:17,775
Man…

593
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:24,531
-Are you worried about me?
-You damn scumbag!

594
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:28,160
You've been dragging Jae-mi around
knowing that you're dying?

595
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,829
What if you had suddenly dropped dead?

596
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:34,625
How do you expect her
to handle that kind of trauma?

597
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:41,882
And what about me?

598
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,844
I'd have to watch her suffer,
unable to do anything!

599
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,681
Ever thought about that,
you irresponsible jackass?

600
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:56,980
Bro.

601
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,070
-Can I call you bro?
-No, you cannot.

602
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:06,907
Let's set some boundaries.

603
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,494
I was just bored, okay?

604
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:16,542
I hit the road without a plan
to find my birth father before I died.

605
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,671
And before I knew it,
I was on my way to see Jae-mi.

606
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,131
She was always such fun to be with.

607
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,760
It ends here. That's all you're getting.

608
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,346
No, I want her around a little longer.

609
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:30,806
Bro!

610
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,183
Just three days.

611
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,103
One day for each remaining candidate.

612
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,605
Fine, two days!

613
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,900
That's the best I can do, okay?
You heard me!

614
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,319
HOUSE OF OHJUK

615
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,821
I, Bum Ho-ja,

616
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,991
wife of the 17th-generation heir
of the Pungyeong Eo clan,

617
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:53,328
humbly beseech you, Father.

618
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,831
Please bestow your abundant grace

619
00:47:55,914 --> 00:48:00,085
upon my son Eo Heung,
the clan's 18th-generation heir

620
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:03,005
and the fifth sole male heir,

621
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,173
as well as his unborn child.

622
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:09,678
Please protect them from harm

623
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:14,516
and ensure their safe return home.

624
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,900
NO SIGNAL

625
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,450
Mother.

626
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:33,410
MOTHER
CALL ME BACK RIGHT NOW

627
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,411
What the…

628
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,041
Hey!

629
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,667
What the hell are you doing?

630
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,503
You've got to be kidding me!

631
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,464
Why the hell did you do that?

632
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:46,381
Seriously?

633
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,344
-Sorry, bro.
-God!

634
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,061
Hey!

635
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,939
Come on. I think I've found a way out.

636
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,273
-What way?
-Come with me.

637
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,026
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

638
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,445
You don't have a plan, do you?

639
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,494
You're always like that.

640
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:21,166
It's always,
"Let’s just go and see what happens."

641
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:25,128
What matters is you're going somewhere,
not where you're going.

642
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,298
I've got two working legs, a road ahead,

643
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,424
and I'm still alive.

644
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,927
So let's just go. What's the problem?

645
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,726
-Come on.
-No! I'm not going.

646
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,399
Not without Heung.

647
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:47,985
Go by yourself.

648
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,530
Seriously?

649
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,573
Yes.

650
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,992
I won't ask you again.

651
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,412
You really aren't coming?

652
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,677
Fine, suit yourself. I’m going ahead.

653
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,783
Who's here with Ms. Jo Jae-mi?

654
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,827
Yes! Me! I'm here.

655
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,037
Hey! What the…

656
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,040
What happened?

657
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,708
I had a fever.

658
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,001
-A fever?
-Yes.

659
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:46,918
What is it?

660
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,546
You're okay now. It's okay.

661
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:51,882
Excuse me.

662
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:55,635
I'm here for Jo Jae-mi.
She was just brought in. About this tall--

663
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,471
He's here for me. Hae Jo!

664
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,931
Hey! What happened to your face?

665
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,100
-Who is he?
-Who's that?

666
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,813
-Just apologize. "I'm sorry."
-For what?

667
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,190
-"I'm sorry."
-I'm not!

668
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,566
Just do it! Okay?

669
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:13,653
My kid got sick from the snack you made.
What are you going to do about it?

670
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,823
It's the same story
every time I serve broccoli.

671
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:20,160
So what are you saying?
Are you calling my child a liar?

672
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:23,830
Just lower your head
and apologize for once!

673
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:27,000
-Ma'am, I'm sorry.
-Hey! Don't do it.

674
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,088
-Hey, lady.
-Me? What?

675
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,798
My girl doesn't lie.

676
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,425
-Oh my.
-Let's go.

677
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,055
Come on. Let's go.

678
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:24,975
You didn't have to--

679
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,184
Surprise!

680
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,602
-Damn you.
-What the fuck?

681
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,036
You fucking bastard.

682
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,540
Hey, how amazing am I?

683
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,584
I came all this way for you, kiddo!

684
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,085
I'm impressed.

685
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:56,381
You're the only person
who'd ever come looking for me, honey.

686
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:58,633
You're the only one I want, motherfucker.

687
00:52:58,717 --> 00:52:59,926
-Come.
-Thanks, shithead.

688
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,433
Son of a bitch.

689
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,734
You fucking bastard.

690
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:17,944
Fucking asshole!

691
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,280
Fuck you!

692
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,991
-You fucking bastard!
-No!

693
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,367
No, don't!

694
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:07,827
You…

695
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,126
Fuck.

696
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:18,964
Fuck!

697
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,341
Fuck!

698
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,430
Fucking asshole.

699
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:36,982
Is that all you’ve got?
You goddamn son of a bitch.

700
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,240
You pathetic bastard.

701
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,911
Hey, this is finally over.

702
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,498
Goodbye, motherfucker.

703
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,043
Sayonara.

704
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:03,591
Hey.

705
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,637
That hurt, you fucking bitch.

706
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,932
Don't call her that.

707
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,892
Shit. Hey!

708
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,562
-Damn, you almost got killed!
-Are you okay?

709
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,857
-You're bleeding.
-Shit!

710
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,941
Are you okay?

711
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,611
Hey!

712
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:28,408
Fuck.

713
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,178
He’s one relentless bastard.

714
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,847
Goddammit. He's even worse than me.

715
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,183
You're just as bad.

716
