1
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,113
Well, look who it is.

2
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,826
I thought I smelled
rotting garbage in here.

3
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,621
This place is full of human trash
that needs to be taken out.

4
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,751
John!

5
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,795
You gotta get out of here. It's a trap!

6
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,713
Shut up!

7
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,927
You're risking your life
for this pretty little thing?

8
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,679
What a sucker.

9
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:01,686
Your goddamn trap
ain't gonna make me give up on my love.

10
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,415
Come out, asshole!

11
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,172
Goddammit.

12
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,153
No! John Na!

13
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,198
-See you in hell.
-Ma-ri, stay back!

14
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,574
Oh no!

15
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,788
No!

16
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,249
Shit. What have I done?

17
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,548
That fucking hurts.

18
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,552
Ma-ri.

19
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,720
Ma-ri.

20
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,269
Kiss me.

21
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,192
God, that's so ridiculous.

22
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,028
Don't try to make sense of a movie…

23
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,238
FIVE YEARS AGO, WINTER

24
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,282
…that makes no sense to begin with.

25
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,368
Even so, no one would ever
ask for a kiss in that situation.

26
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,370
It's freezing. Get back under here.

27
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,000
I mean, seriously, what kind of woman
would ask for a kiss right before dying?

28
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,335
You can ask for anything before dying.

29
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:52,714
No. That's still just wrong.

30
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,132
It makes her look so lame.

31
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,135
What would you say in her shoes?

32
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,970
-Right before I died?
-Yes.

33
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,389
Let me whisper it.

34
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,517
Whisper it?

35
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,354
-Save me!
-Fuck!

36
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,898
Seriously? "Save me"?

37
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,901
Hey, I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry!

38
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,694
Hey!

39
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,154
Cut it out!

40
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,907
Okay, I'll tell you, for real.

41
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,617
-For real?
-Yes

42
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,454
Just before I died, I would say…

43
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,009
Sh…

44
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,764
-Sh…
-Here! Over here!

45
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,141
Sh…

46
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,853
Sh-sh…

47
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,280
Shit.

48
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,209
Over here!

49
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,438
Jae-mi!

50
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,774
No, Jae-mi.

51
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,693
Jae-mi.

52
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,696
You can't come in here, sir.

53
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,533
Jae-mi… She'll be okay, won't she? Jae-mi!

54
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,327
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

55
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,007
Only one relative.

56
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,176
Okay. Jae-mi.

57
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:37,688
MR. PLANKTON

58
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,082
Get up right now!

59
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:59,794
I'm really sorry, Mother.

60
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,173
Lying about the pregnancy was my idea.

61
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,592
Jae-mi did nothing wrong.

62
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,679
I swear I was going to come clean
once I got home.

63
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:14,058
Son, stop embarrassing us both and get up.

64
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:18,020
It's all my fault.

65
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,357
Fine, you can blame yourself
for all of this mess, all right?

66
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,192
But let's make one thing clear.

67
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,321
You and that wench are strangers now.

68
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,367
Don't waste time on a stranger.

69
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,618
Now we're going home!

70
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,579
No! I don't want to.

71
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:38,291
I'm not leaving without Jae-mi.

72
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,208
No way.

73
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,544
-Drag him out of here.
-Stop!

74
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,385
Back off!

75
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,138
Get away from me!

76
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,100
If you so much as lay a finger on me,

77
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,894
I swear I'll…

78
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,230
That's right.

79
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,191
My goodness. Is he…

80
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,736
I'll take this off. And my undies too.

81
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,987
That little…

82
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,031
Yes, my undies too. How about that?

83
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:15,328
Do you want to see the clan's heir
disgracing the family on camera, Mother?

84
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,871
My God. Oh dear.

85
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,873
You zip those pants up right now!

86
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,833
You wouldn't dare…

87
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,211
-That idiot--
-Excuse me.

88
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,465
-This is insane.
-What are you doing outside the ICU?

89
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,674
Please step down, sir.

90
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,096
-Get down this instant.
-No!

91
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,640
-Why, you little…
-Watch it!

92
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,517
My goodness. You absolute moron!

93
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,802
JO JAE-MI
NEXT OF KIN: EO HEUNG

94
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:51,382
EAT THIS

95
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,391
"The pair of black rubber shoes

96
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:48,939
softly embraced
my dirt-covered and scarred feet,

97
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,942
but I tossed them aside remorselessly

98
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,946
the moment those sparkly shoes
won my heart."

99
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,621
"Even though they were filled
with childhood memories

100
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,790
and the marks that life had left on them,

101
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,253
I was so overcome by my sweet tooth

102
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,049
that I sold the old pair to the taffy man
without a moment's thought."

103
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,516
"It took me a while to realize

104
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,520
the love I got from those rubber shoes,

105
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,355
which never complained,

106
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,401
even after being betrayed and abandoned."

107
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,804
How come there's only one shoe?

108
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,348
She wouldn't have left wearing just one.

109
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,151
How can her foot be smaller than my hand?

110
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,694
How cute.

111
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,338
You switched shoes just like that, huh?

112
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,048
What?

113
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,639
Let go, okay? I said let go.

114
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,812
That hurt! You bit me, you asshole!

115
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,814
What are you, a dog?

116
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,859
You've been whimpering like a puppy
while holding that girl's shoe for days.

117
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,778
Got a thing for shoes?

118
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,948
Fine. You can have all of mine.

119
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,575
Give me a second.
I got tons of stylish, sexy ones.

120
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,953
They're all yours.
I'll get them out for you.

121
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,871
Any requests? Something sparkly?

122
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,208
Look. You can take them all.

123
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,460
They're all yours, okay?

124
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:00,214
Want some more?
I have them in every color imaginable.

125
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,342
Here. There you go. They're all yours now.

126
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,470
Now you can lounge around with shoes
to your heart's desire.

127
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,980
The leader of the Prince Gang,

128
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,941
captured by three civilians
on a deserted island…

129
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,276
My skull got smashed!

130
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,112
…still insists he was wrongly arrested.

131
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,281
-The public is outraged.
-I'm the victim!

132
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,950
This is so fucking unfair!

133
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:28,909
That's enough.

134
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:34,915
This is old news.
Why are you showing me this?

135
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,336
I'm the one who had
the brilliant idea that led to his arrest

136
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,339
and made significant contributions

137
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:46,051
to ensure this family's precious heir
could walk away unscathed.

138
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,513
The family didn't seem
to be aware of my efforts,

139
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,349
so I decided to pay you a humble visit.

140
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,146
So the person who made
such significant contributions

141
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:58,898
was you?

142
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,942
Indeed. Let me sum it up for you.

143
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,279
I reported the gang fight at Busan Port

144
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,615
to the police.

145
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,325
Where's Hae Jo?

146
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:13,829
Even when I got caught
and was almost beaten to death…

147
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,789
-Here?
-Yes! The bastards are there!

148
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,668
I also told the police
where that damn thug was headed,

149
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,296
so he wouldn't find Heung and hurt him.

150
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,548
But how did you know where Heung was?

151
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,009
Well, about that…

152
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,057
Heung and I set something up a while back.

153
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,517
To ensure safe transactions,

154
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,562
we both installed an app on our phones

155
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,106
to track each other's locations.

156
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,524
You'll get your cash.

157
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,866
So, in other words,
you want a reward for saving his life,

158
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,118
monetarily or otherwise?

159
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,955
Yes, well… That's right, milady.

160
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,084
I'm sorry.

161
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,544
You'll have to talk to his mother.

162
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,298
But, between you and me,
the whole family is very upset right now,

163
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:10,761
so the mere mention of Heung's name
could send her into a rage.

164
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,596
Wait, his mother?

165
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,639
Heung's mother.

166
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,810
You mean you're not his mother?

167
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,312
No, I'm his second mother.

168
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,731
I practically raised him though.

169
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,275
Ho-ja is Heung's actual mother.

170
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,528
He had a third and fourth mother too,

171
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,823
but they both ran away
because they couldn't put up with Ho-ja.

172
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,241
I'm the only one left.

173
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,493
Okay, all right, then.

174
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,370
You're his mistress.

175
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,163
"Mistress"?

176
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,625
You should’ve said so from the start.
Damn, my legs.

177
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:47,256
I'm here to talk business
with the lady of the house!

178
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,465
Jeez.

179
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,510
Make an appointment and come back.

180
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,679
-Shit! A wild boar!
-What? A wild boar?

181
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:57,141
-Heung's mother! Ma'am!
-That little… Hey, you!

182
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:03,439
If any of you dare
let that numskull set foot in here,

183
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:08,027
that will be the last day
you spend here under my roof.

184
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,695
Do I make myself clear?

185
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,696
Yes, ma'am.

186
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:16,827
Shit.

187
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,039
Fuck, that old lady's terrifying!

188
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,338
I can hardly sneak in through the roof.
God, this is insane.

189
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,652
I thought he was meant to be
from some prestigious family.

190
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,447
Turns out,
his father had multiple mistresses.

191
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,865
That family is messed up.

192
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:59,328
And that boss mother or whoever she is
is so fucking scary.

193
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,206
Next to her, you’re an angel.

194
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,123
A total angel.

195
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,958
I'm busy. Cut to the chase.

196
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,001
Yes, ma'am.

197
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:07,961
Well…

198
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,925
I heard you were looking for
a manager for the gambling parlor--

199
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,302
Kkari, I like shiny new things.

200
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,721
I never shop used, employees or otherwise.

201
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,850
When I worked for Hae Jo,

202
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,520
I made good money behind his back.

203
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,438
Then go back to him.

204
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,356
I'm not crazy.

205
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,525
I won't put my life on the line again.

206
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,735
Guess what that bastard
did to me in Busan.

207
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:36,406
He ditched me knowing my leg was fucked up
and just ran away with his chick.

208
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,408
I got stabbed all because of him!

209
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,577
-It fucking hurt, damn it.
-His chick?

210
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,080
Yeah, Jo Jae-mi or whatever her name is.

211
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,417
Poor girl. Getting kidnapped by that jerk.

212
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,712
I think she's locked up
in that family's house now.

213
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,507
Man.

214
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,219
Hae Jo's such an asshole.
He's ruined several people's lives.

215
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,472
He's probably carefree, napping somewhere.

216
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,473
Son of a bitch.

217
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,935
Anyway, what's all this?
Putting your shoe collection up for sale?

218
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,604
You got some nice shoes here.

219
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,815
Someone's raking it in, huh?

220
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,990
Fuck.

221
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,326
Boss! I…

222
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,536
Jesus. Fuck.

223
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,294
Look confident.

224
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,147
I did it.

225
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,127
Take these herbal pills.
They'll help boost your energy.

226
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,255
I'll give you guys a bunch of them. Here.

227
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,883
You'll get yours later.

228
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:32,898
Shit…

229
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,464
Jae-mi.

230
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:08,475
This herbal brew
should help speed up Jae-mi's recovery.

231
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,324
John,

232
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,952
please let me go inside and give her this.

233
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,037
Heung practically begged me.

234
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,381
You're so handsome. Very stylish, too.

235
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,030
Go inside. Go. Quick.

236
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,201
You're good now. Oh my God.

237
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,459
I made you some herbal medicine.
Take a sip.

238
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,088
It's a little bitter.

239
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,924
Good.

240
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,221
I've been told
Heung wasn't at the clinic today.

241
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,681
Has he been here?

242
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,016
We haven't seen him.

243
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,144
My goodness.
Where on earth did that fool go then?

244
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,521
-Do not let him in!
-Yes, ma'am!

245
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,982
-This is ridiculous.
-Hush.

246
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:48,075
It's her, isn't it?
That tiny girl. She's your ex.

247
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,204
I guess that shoe is hers.

248
00:22:59,002 --> 00:22:59,836
Hey!

249
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:01,922
Damn it.

250
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,259
What the fuck…

251
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,526
Damn it!

252
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,153
Bong-suk, you evil little…

253
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,449
-Where the fuck is it?
-He looks like a hobo.

254
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,661
I'm going to kill her!

255
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,707
Goddammit!

256
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,855
Hey, are you homeless?

257
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,032
Maybe not. Forget it.

258
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,286
I guess you're not then.

259
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,168
DRUMSTICK CHICKEN

260
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,641
Who needs expensive perfume?

261
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,187
Nothing beats the smell of fried chicken.

262
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,626
No more free food for you.
From now on, you'll earn your keep.

263
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,462
Come in and wash your face.

264
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,049
He stinks.

265
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,261
As you can see, he's a minor.

266
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,722
I don't know who he is.
We'll call him John Doe.

267
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,601
Have him run errands
so he can earn some pocket money.

268
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,436
And don't let him into the rooms.

269
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,604
Yes, ma'am.

270
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,315
But who is this kid?

271
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,525
I found him on the street. I'll raise him.

272
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:55,447
He'll either grow up
to be my son or my boyfriend.

273
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,159
That's a crime.

274
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,415
Hey, kid!

275
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,125
Can you get me more ice?

276
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,462
Hey, kid. Call a cab to Sangsu-dong.

277
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:12,964
Sangsu-dong.

278
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,133
Hey, kid. Go clean the restroom, quick.

279
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,596
Hey, kid. Ask the kitchen lady
how much fruit is left.

280
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,431
Hey, kid. More ice, please.

281
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,809
-Hey, kid. A cab to Siheung.
-Hey, kid. Clean the hall first.

282
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,563
A cab from Mademoiselle to Siheung.

283
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,941
Everyone asks you to do things

284
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,611
and run errands for them,

285
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,279
so why not just…

286
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,073
HAE JO ERRAND HOUSE

287
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,950
I came up with that name and got him work.

288
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,744
What does that make me?

289
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,332
A softie. My softie. My Bong-suk.

290
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,879
It's working fine.

291
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,297
Looks cool, huh?

292
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:57,967
Hey, Hae Jo!

293
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,266
Let's get something to eat.

294
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,686
My God. She's out of her mind.

295
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,232
Jeez.

296
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,124
GOOD RESTAURANTS NEARBY

297
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,543
The smell of fried chicken
used to be enough.

298
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,129
Now it's so hard to get you to eat.

299
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,887
Hey. You need a shower, okay?

300
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,729
What's the deal with that shoe?

301
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,606
You're such a weirdo, seriously.

302
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,907
So pretty.

303
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,493
Could you take 4,000 won off, please?

304
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,413
I only have 10,000 won right now.

305
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,623
Just 4,000 won.

306
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,708
Oh boy.

307
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,758
She really is a small-town cutie.

308
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:27,265
They're not even brand new.
Why are you treasuring them?

309
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,975
Let them get scuffed.

310
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,018
I don't know.

311
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:34,147
I've always felt so bad
for things left out on the street.

312
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,774
I want to nurture them.

313
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,360
I guess they remind me
of abandoned kids like me.

314
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:53,041
I'm sure those were also treasured
before they got thrown out. Funny, right?

315
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,877
Even expensive pianos.

316
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,255
I feel so bad for them
when I see them thrown out.

317
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:08,431
I guess being on the streets devalues you,

318
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,393
no matter your original worth.

319
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,824
The fact that these were thrown out
makes me cherish them even more.

320
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,955
How cute.

321
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,666
They are cute, aren’t they?

322
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,294
Look, they're clean now.

323
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,177
Excuse me, sir. Please take us to Wanju.

324
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:47,929
What?

325
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,265
No, sir. No, don't…

326
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,891
Yes, we're going to Wanju.

327
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,768
Why would we go there, you nutjob?

328
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,694
Where is it?

329
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:05,488
Damn it. I swear I saw it fall down here.

330
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,121
Yes, I found my shoe! Yay!

331
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,623
Found it.

332
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,002
I found it.

333
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,879
What? You "found it"?

334
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,798
Yes, I found it.

335
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,092
Found what?

336
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,722
The holy grail or something?

337
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:33,933
Mother.

338
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,064
Mother, I'm sorry.

339
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,902
Well, since you're still recovering,

340
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,696
I don't want to waste my breath

341
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:50,533
talking about what can't be undone,
so I'll be quick.

342
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,327
Okay.

343
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:57,206
Heung insisted on staying by your side
until you fully recovered.

344
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,126
So I gave in and brought you home.

345
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,545
But I can't let you stay here any longer.

346
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,798
And I think you know why.

347
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,718
So leave discreetly
sometime today or tomorrow

348
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,472
if you have any decency left, all right?

349
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:16,976
Yes, ma'am.

350
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:18,937
All right.

351
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,688
Well, then--

352
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,607
First, I'll talk with him and then--

353
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,485
What's left to talk about?

354
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,782
I won't have you
messing with my son's head.

355
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,743
I want you gone without a trace,

356
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,245
like dust in the wind.

357
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,498
Is that really so hard to understand?

358
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,419
God, this is so frustrating.

359
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,103
She'll only kick your ass to the curb.

360
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,191
-Why?
-Just look at yourself.

361
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,531
Sir, can we stop at the next rest area?

362
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:17,578
Jae-mi.

363
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,709
Where is Jae-mi?

364
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:26,587
She and your mother
seemed to be having a heated discussion.

365
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,922
Then she left.

366
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,382
My mother?

367
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,178
Hold on.

368
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,431
Jae-mi?

369
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,101
Jae-mi.

370
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,771
Jae-mi…

371
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,690
Jae…

372
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,567
Jae-mi!

373
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,695
Jae-mi.

374
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,075
Goddammit.

375
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,089
This is the seed paste
of the Pungyeong Eo clan.

376
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:14,844
It's made from a recipe
that has been passed down for 380 years.

377
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:18,097
The sauce base adds to its age-old flavor.

378
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,395
We only make our pastes…

379
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,191
once a year,
on the last day of lunar November,

380
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,985
in hundred-year-old pots
with no chemical--

381
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:31,986
Mother.

382
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,114
-We mix bedrock water with bamboo salt--
-Mother!

383
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,159
All the details are in the video.

384
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,369
Please excuse me for a moment.

385
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,001
First, you should taste our pastes.

386
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,753
They're finger-licking good.

387
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,297
-That's right. Please.
-Why don't you try…

388
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,592
You can't just kick out
someone who's still recovering.

389
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,764
Where did she go?

390
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,058
Well?

391
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,769
Where is Jae-mi?

392
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,108
Your begging only worked in the past

393
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,654
because I didn't know what was going on.

394
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:18,699
I told you the whole baby thing
was all my fault--

395
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,785
I'm talking about her menopause!

396
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:30,336
She confessed everything to me earlier.

397
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,089
Why would Jae-mi--

398
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,006
Exactly!

399
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,677
How dare she hide that from us
and then try to marry into this family?

400
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,220
That insolent little…

401
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,557
My God, you pathetic fool.

402
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,058
You're such a moron.

403
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,019
But why…

404
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,230
Thank God for the wedding fiasco.

405
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,108
Yes, our ancestors were helping us.

406
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,862
Any scheme you're cooking up won't work,
so don't even bother.

407
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,530
Just get over her.

408
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,826
Clearly, the two of you
weren't meant to be.

409
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:02,910
Why not?

410
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,248
Why can't I be with her?

411
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:10,960
Seriously?

412
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,461
I love her.

413
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,840
So what if she's infertile?

414
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,178
Maybe that's my fault.

415
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,516
I guess I can't be a father
because I'm still a child myself.

416
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,435
How is that her fault?

417
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,190
Why do you keep saying no? Why can't I…

418
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:38,487
Why can't I be with her?

419
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,531
Jae-mi…

420
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,117
Jae-mi.

421
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,596
What's taking him so long?

422
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,140
Shall I go check on him?

423
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,934
No need. You enjoy your food.

424
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:12,730
He's probably sprucing up in the restroom
before seeing his long-lost girlfriend.

425
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,695
What is he doing?
This is a public restroom.

426
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,518
Nice. It's giving edgy goth vibes
now that I've lost weight.

427
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,773
Hey, kid.

428
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,651
Do you want to know
what "edgy goth" means?

429
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,322
It means being damn sexy.

430
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,538
"Damn sexy"?

431
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,597
Heung.

432
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:40,484
Don't venture out by yourself.
You don't know your way around.

433
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,160
Are you all right?

434
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,415
I’m pretty sure our house
is about 4,000 pyeong.

435
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:59,837
Yet for some strange reason,
I find it suffocating in there.

436
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,885
Should I just run away from home?

437
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,055
No.

438
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,975
I like guys who own
100,000-square-foot mansions.

439
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:17,229
-Sure beats runaways.
-Wow, you're so materialistic.

440
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:21,776
That's the thing.

441
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,114
That's what everyone would think

442
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:31,494
if I kept digging my heels in,
determined to marry into this family.

443
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:37,833
Well…

444
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,046
So, that being said…

445
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,177
let's just say
I finally know my place now.

446
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,058
I think…

447
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,355
it's for the best to end things here.

448
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,154
Jae-mi.

449
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:11,158
Eo Heung, you're a tiger.

450
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:15,204
A tiger can't guard the forest
if it’s stuck watching one tree, right?

451
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,629
I'm not a tiger.

452
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,673
I'm a dog. A whimpering dog.

453
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:30,553
What? Says who?
Who dared to say such a thing to a tiger?

454
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,096
I'm a dog.

455
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,056
No, you're not. You're a tiger!

456
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,808
-Woof-woof.
-Roar!

457
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,893
-I whimper like a dog.
-You roar!

458
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:38,936
Woof-woof.

459
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,367
But you know, Mother.

460
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,079
Let me just say this one thing
before I leave.

461
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:00,291
The reason I've decided to give up

462
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,711
isn't because I can't get pregnant
or because I come from nothing.

463
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:08,674
I'm actually giving up
because I'm not good enough for your son.

464
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,596
So please stop…

465
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,141
treating him so badly.

466
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,644
What did you say?

467
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:27,318
Let's face it.
Your family members let you yell at them

468
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,945
only because you gave them an heir.

469
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:34,074
So why are you always so harsh
on your son?

470
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:47,379
He's your precious son,
so please be good to him.

471
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,008
Treat him with respect.

472
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:58,015
I'm asking you kindly as someone
who once was your future daughter-in-law.

473
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,563
Insolent brat.

474
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,486
But she sure can recognize a good man
when she sees one.

475
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,745
Well, I must say…

476
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,457
she wasn't all that bad.

477
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:36,262
Look here, if Heung is anything like you,

478
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,139
he'll forget that girl in no time

479
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,143
and fall for someone else
before we know it.

480
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,524
But what if he doesn't?

481
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,379
HEUNG'S KITCHEN

482
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,192
You ruined everything.

483
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,738
You're the reason my life is such a mess

484
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,574
and why I'm going through menopause
at this age.

485
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:43,621
It's all because of you,
you piece of shit.

486
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,837
It's either you or me.

487
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:55,132
That's the only way
we'll never cross paths again.

488
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,135
So if you're not going to let me go

489
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,638
or kill me right now,

490
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,182
then just let me be happy for once!

491
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:06,143
So drop dead or something already!

492
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,312
Jae-mi?

493
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:09,938
Jae-mi.

494
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,274
Jae-mi, wake up.

495
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,069
Jae-mi!

496
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,623
Bong-suk.

497
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,376
Hey, Bong-suk.

498
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,128
What? What is it?

499
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,756
I want corn on the cob.

500
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,257
What?

501
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,094
I'm hungry.
They're selling it just over there.

502
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:48,560
STEAMED CORN ON THE COB

503
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:52,731
He could've eaten at the rest stop.
I’m way too soft on him.

504
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,409
This is so sweet. Delicious.

505
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,569
It's me.

506
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,332
Where are you going?

507
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,421
So, I did some thinking on my way here.

508
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,631
I figured you'd be so angry

509
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,217
that you might punch me
if you saw my face, bro.

510
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:06,263
I pulled a fast one on you
back on the island.

511
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,890
And I felt bad about it.

512
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:10,017
But you still came to my rescue.

513
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:14,062
I'm so fucking grateful
that I'm too ashamed to show my face.

514
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,106
It was to rescue Jae-mi, not you!

515
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,107
Careful!

516
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,492
You're so warm, bro.

517
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:29,661
Get off me.

518
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:34,082
Human body temperature is a funny thing.

519
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,753
You’d think we’d all feel the same,
just lukewarm.

520
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,922
But each person is different.

521
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,135
I knew it the minute I met you.

522
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,640
"Yes, of course. I'm glad you're here."

523
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:54,937
You grabbed my hand and shook it,
grinning from ear to ear.

524
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:59,024
I thought, "If I mess with him,
I'll feel like such an asshole."

525
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,443
That's rich coming from you.

526
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,530
I know.

527
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,741
"Anyone in my life gets fucked."

528
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,245
"I don't want this guy to get hurt."

529
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,250
That thought really did cross my mind.

530
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:37,062
You really are warm.

531
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,402
Is that why you're good at taking pulses?

532
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:50,242
Hey, stop smoking. It's bad for you.

533
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,870
Oh, look who secretly cares.

534
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,372
Go home.

535
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:56,707
Hey, wait.

536
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:02,838
Are you all right?

537
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,258
-What do you mean?
-Well…

538
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:12,556
Well, your mother.
Is she still very upset?

539
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:18,896
I was just wondering
if you managed to sort things out…

540
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,188
Yes, I'm fine.

541
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,317
Jae-mi is doing better too.

542
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,612
Really?

543
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,072
Thank God.

544
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,158
Glad to hear it.

545
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:36,455
Hey.

546
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,791
Can I ask you something too?

547
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,127
You're finally showing
some interest in me.

548
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,629
Why do you go by Hae Jo,

549
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,006
Chae Seung-hyeok?

550
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,509
That's your real name. So why Hae Jo?

551
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:53,430
Did you run a background check on me?
That's usually my specialty.

552
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:54,514
And your father?

553
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,018
Seriously?

554
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:01,146
You're from a wealthy neighborhood.
Do you still live there?

555
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,064
What?

556
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:05,567
-Do your parents know you’re sick?
-Hey.

557
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,704
What are you doing?

558
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,792
Interrogating me
like I'm your daughter's suitor?

559
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,002
Give me a break.

560
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,714
Don't wanna answer? Fine.

561
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,384
Hey, can you do me a favor?

562
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:33,804
Here.

563
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:38,475
She lost this on the island.
She was really fond of it.

564
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,644
Can you give it to her?

565
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,567
Did you buy this shoe for her?

566
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,988
Well, yeah.

567
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,157
If you don't want to, forget it.

568
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,868
You can toss it or burn it.
I don't care. Bye.

569
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,337
Shoes.

570
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,215
Did you say "shit"?

571
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,592
Shoes.

572
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,472
I wanted to put them on.

573
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,142
You wanted to put on those shoes.

574
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,352
And go…

575
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,273
to you.

576
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,303
She wouldn't have made it
if it weren't for this shoe.

577
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,889
We found this in her pocket.

578
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:44,935
Luckily, the sole blocked the blade
from reaching her small intestine.

579
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,186
Oh, thank God.

580
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:51,274
Thank you so much.

581
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:55,070
Thank you for saving Jae-mi's life.

582
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,028
Oh, man.

583
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:11,850
A FEW DAYS LATER

584
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,705
Who are you?

585
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,086
-But it's here.
-What is?

586
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:41,921
Who is it?

587
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,470
Hey…

588
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,440
-Why you…
-Hey, no.

589
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,900
It's not what you--

590
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,734
Ouch! Shit!

591
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,866
Fuck…

592
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:12,947
