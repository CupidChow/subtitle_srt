1
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,941
I'm going to die now.

2
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,611
Fuck.

3
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,532
Fucking hell.

4
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,456
Every night,

5
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,002
I imagined what it'd be like to die.

6
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:35,220
Would it feel exhilarating,
like jumping over a high hurdle?

7
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:43,645
Or would it feel liberating,
like throwing off soaking wet clothes?

8
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:51,986
Or maybe it would be as mundane as
walking from one subway car to the next.

9
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,948
You fucking bastard!

10
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,574
No.

11
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,204
Now that I'm facing it,
it's nothing like that at all.

12
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,333
I… I want to live.

13
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,335
I'll kill you!

14
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,674
I want to live.

15
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,425
I will kill you!

16
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:48,334
MR. PLANKTON

17
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,505
What? Another one died?

18
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,972
What's the problem?
Why do they keep dying?

19
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,561
This is driving me nuts.

20
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,611
Did your kid run away?

21
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,239
Are they a delinquent or simply a runaway?

22
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,783
Sure, finding people
is a piece of cake for us.

23
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,786
Two days, tops.
Just give us the name and date of birth.

24
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,455
-Long time no see.
-Hi.

25
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,209
We just need a three-million-won retainer
before we set out.

26
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,960
Hey! You idiot!

27
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,463
Blocking the fucking road!

28
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,133
Sorry?

29
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:42,180
My boss doesn't do small jobs like this.
I'm in charge of this sort of thing.

30
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,849
If you're reluctant, go find someone else.

31
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,601
We're already swamped.

32
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,981
HAE JO ERRAND HOUSE

33
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,610
I'm saying this
because now only you two are left.

34
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,530
You guys had better die together
at the same time.

35
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,575
Don't leave the other one all alone.

36
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,956
Open the door, Hae Jo.
I know you're in there.

37
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,540
Open up!

38
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,752
We should replace this goddamn door.

39
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,268
Oh no, ma'am!

40
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,646
Your shoe! I'll bring it right to you.
Here you go, ma'am.

41
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,069
-Open up.
-Sure. We must protect your fair skin.

42
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,909
Goddamn it!

43
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:49,122
He's not here.
Probably headed to the sauna for a scrub.

44
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,877
That goddamn weasel.
Where did he run off to this time?

45
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,631
He does whatever the hell he wants.
He's like the rain. No stopping him.

46
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,050
He comes and goes as he pleases.

47
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,262
Don't you just love the smell of summer?

48
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,430
Hey, you. Lackey.

49
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,307
I'm Yoo Gi-ho, not "Lackey."

50
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,351
Lackey, you'd better tell your boss this.

51
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,688
His pretty face can only save him
until the month ends.

52
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,690
-Yes, ma'am.
-Get me some ice water.

53
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,109
Damn. It's boiling in here! Hey!

54
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,653
-Switch the fan on first.
-The fan! Of course.

55
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,700
It's so hot.

56
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:30,288
-Fuck.
-They'll tear down this building anyway.

57
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:34,125
Why does he have to be so stubborn
and send the union after me?

58
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,168
So annoying.

59
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,502
Freaking annoying.

60
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:41,007
I bet I'm the only landlady
who has to beg her tenants to move out.

61
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,345
You're a real saint in the rental market.

62
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,556
Drink up. Refreshing, right?

63
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,686
He's got no choice.
Tell him he should just move in with me.

64
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,022
-Sorry?
-He has nowhere else to go.

65
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,523
I'll take him in.

66
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,110
Good thing I just bought
a new king-size bed.

67
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,032
What the…? Just look at this.

68
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,746
You'll hurt your back sleeping
scrunched up on couches like this.

69
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,456
My God, this is…

70
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,876
Yes, they're moving out.
By the end of the month, yes.

71
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,295
What? What the fuck?

72
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:24,384
If you guys show up here with an excavator
without my permission, you're dead.

73
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,474
I almost got crushed to death.

74
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,311
My foot's gone numb.

75
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,939
I told you
we needed to look for a new office,

76
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,691
or you really will end up
in that woman's bed.

77
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,235
Wouldn't be the first time.

78
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,575
Actually, I've been meaning to ask.
What's going on between you two?

79
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,456
-She's my mom.
-Mom?

80
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,875
A sister at times.

81
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,002
Fuck. Goddamn it!

82
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,588
-A friend, a lover.
-Disgusting!

83
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,384
Pick up your dog's poop!
You don't deserve to have a pet.

84
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,679
Financier, pimp, boss, landlady.

85
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,805
Whatever.

86
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,933
How can we move out
when we have no place to go?

87
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,810
You think that's why I hold out?

88
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,189
There's nowhere I want to go.

89
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,359
So I'm just staying put.

90
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,030
Whatever. Let's just get to work.

91
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:32,034
All right. Let's see what kinds of wackos
need our services today.

92
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,453
STAND-IN FOR SON NEEDED

93
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,164
This man wants us
to visit his dying mother

94
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,874
and stay by her deathbed.

95
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,877
-She doesn't recognize him anyway.
-Boring. Next.

96
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,172
That druggie from Sadang-dong
wants 200 zolpidem pills.

97
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,132
He's had his fun. Time to drop dead.

98
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,091
-Next.
-Next.

99
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,594
"My boss is on a work trip. Kill him…"

100
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,096
We're not hitmen, you fucker. Next.

101
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:57,351
This guy's asking us to take care of
some bullies at his son's school.

102
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,478
That sounds fun.

103
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,395
First,

104
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,523
we'll protect him in person for two weeks

105
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,027
while hacking the bullies' phones
to gather evidence.

106
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,737
Then press the authorities.

107
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,989
Seven-million retainer fee, plus bonus.

108
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:15,453
Seven million won for the Uncle Package.
That's inflation for you, man.

109
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,414
It's that damn girl again.

110
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,332
What is it?

111
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,043
She wants us to find her runaway brother.

112
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,963
This brat posted all over the board.
How am I supposed to delete all these?

113
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,798
A little girl?

114
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,718
A fourth grader.
How old could she be? Ten or eleven?

115
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,761
Eleven.

116
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:38,559
You didn't put up a notice?
"No teen missing-person or runaway cases."

117
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,144
Shit.

118
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,604
-"Shit"?
-Yes.

119
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,523
Why do everything but that?

120
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,902
Finding a missing family member
is easy, rewarding and good money.

121
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,947
It's a gold mine.
You're ruining our business.

122
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,198
Just toe the line.

123
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,325
How about I stick my toe up your ass?

124
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,868
-My ass?
-Yes.

125
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,662
And I wanna see your ID.

126
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,665
You're younger than me, aren't you?
Let me see it.

127
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,464
Would you prefer to work your ass off
for a younger boss?

128
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,551
Then you can be my elder.

129
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,844
My big bro, Kkari.

130
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,688
You want to know why I don't take
missing person cases? It's simple.

131
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,650
If a parent loses their child,
it is their job to find them.

132
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,487
And if a kid runs away from home,
we should respect their decision.

133
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,866
In other words,
we have no reason to get involved.

134
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,077
Do you get it now?

135
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,038
Answer me, Kkari.

136
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,833
Yes, understood, boss.

137
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,588
Then hurry up and put up the notice.
And get some food too, fuckwit.

138
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:56,637
"We don't take on missing person cases,
you fucking morons!"

139
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,521
We have arrived.

140
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,984
H O AND HO

141
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,615
What does that say?

142
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:20,369
"Ho and Ho"?

143
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,757
5,000,000 WON DEPOSITED

144
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,426
Hell, yes!

145
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,387
You can stick to your stupid rules,

146
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,600
but this honeybee will suck
all the honey out of this sweet gig.

147
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,311
Man, this is sweet. Hell, yeah!

148
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,273
What the hell?

149
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,443
It's clogged again?

150
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,740
What the fuck!

151
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,537
NO CALLER ID

152
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,125
NO CALLER ID

153
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,045
NO CALLER ID

154
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,595
NO CALLER ID

155
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,305
IGNORE ME AND I'LL KILL YOU

156
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,534
Fuck.

157
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,090
Oh, dear.

158
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,012
So, why did you ignore my calls?

159
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,391
I was so close to killing you.

160
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,565
I like that gaze.

161
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,113
Oh, jeez.

162
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,407
You look better with them on.

163
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,966
That was funny.

164
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,635
Funny? This is getting boring for me.

165
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,179
Hurting me, breaking things,

166
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,057
and threatening to kill me
if I don't do as I'm told.

167
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,728
Think it would work?

168
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,814
I was told
you'd do anything except murder.

169
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,358
That's why they call you Hae Jo,

170
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,194
as in "fixer."

171
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,239
Hae Jo. Hae Joo?

172
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,535
I don't like how it sounds.

173
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,580
I don't take on just any job.

174
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,457
Then what?

175
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,252
Only the jobs I want to do.

176
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,093
Well,

177
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,933
I didn't come here expecting
a cliché threat like that to work anyway.

178
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,896
I wanted to make a strong impression,
so I went a bit overboard.

179
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,066
Sometimes, clichés do work.

180
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,861
A classic never gets old.

181
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:41,862
Whatever.

182
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,490
Kidnap me.

183
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,374
Kidnap me at my wedding.

184
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,087
-And the theme?
-I told you.

185
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,382
I like clichés and classics.

186
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,136
Sounds fun.

187
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,850
This isn't about fun.
You could get yourself killed.

188
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,726
I looked into that nutcase.

189
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,313
If you do take on this job,

190
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,149
you'll be lucky to walk away in one piece.

191
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,442
So what?

192
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,444
-Your head would be--
-Hey!

193
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,949
Fun, my ass! Fun doesn't pay the bills!

194
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,371
Your ass? No, blame her ass.

195
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,126
Ms. Jo Jae-mi?

196
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,296
How's the size?

197
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,922
Perfect. Not too tight.

198
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,719
I've never seen a family ring
that's over 500 years old.

199
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,680
It's just right
for the head family of a clan.

200
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,806
Lucky you.

201
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,018
But it doesn't have diamonds or anything.

202
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,147
Anyway, it will end up going
to my future daughter-in-law.

203
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,822
I'm telling myself not to get attached.

204
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,825
Yes, good point.

205
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,704
Besides, this ring pales in comparison

206
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,790
to the amazing gift
she's bringing to the family.

207
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,712
Congratulations. How far along are you?

208
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,631
Eight weeks.

209
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,885
Goodness me.

210
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:28,802
PARENTHOOD GUIDE

211
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,889
Ms. Yoon Hyeon-su to treatment room two.

212
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,100
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

213
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,769
What's taking so long today?

214
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:40,022
Two of our doctors
are attending a seminar today.

215
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,316
-So please bear with us.
-How much longer?

216
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,485
-Just a bit…
-Please, sit here.

217
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,238
Thank you.

218
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,953
Wow! Such pretty eyes!

219
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,997
You have your grandma's eyes.

220
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,207
Mom.

221
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,209
Not grandma.

222
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,004
You're so pretty, just like your mom.
Like a princess!

223
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,881
Prince.

224
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,341
He's a boy.

225
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,593
Oh, incoming call.

226
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,056
Yes, honey. I'm at the hospital now.

227
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,058
Those tests I got done…

228
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,817
Please put your phone on silent.

229
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,859
Okay.

230
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,696
My God.

231
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,739
PRO LAUNDRY

232
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,909
When's the pick-up date?

233
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,620
You can't borrow that.
It belongs to a prosecutor.

234
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,959
Public officials are off tomorrow.
I'll return it by tomorrow morning.

235
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,670
That damn punk.

236
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:48,048
That lady's husband-to-be
isn't just some punk. He's a gang boss.

237
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,384
Wang Chil-seong of the Prince Gang.

238
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,471
So, if I'm meeting the Prince,
I must look presentable.

239
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,515
Where is it this time?

240
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,599
A wedding hall.

241
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,019
So there won't be
any blood stains this time?

242
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,813
But he might come back covered in blood.

243
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,481
Hello, sir!

244
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:09,570
Damn, it's so freaking hot today.
An outdoor wedding on a day like this?

245
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:13,949
Garden weddings are trendy at the moment.
Chil-seong is big on trends.

246
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,325
Trends, my ass.

247
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,412
By the way,
I heard the bride's drop-dead gorgeous.

248
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,248
How did that bumpkin bag her?

249
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:26,503
Apparently, her family live abroad,
so he won her over when she was lonely.

250
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,005
How did he win her over?

251
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:31,800
Come on. He's the Prince, you know.
The Prince and his big family jewels.

252
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,178
Quit messing around. You clowns.

253
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,055
-Congratulations.
-Long time no see!

254
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,099
-Congratulations.
-Hey, thanks.

255
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,184
Hello!

256
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,602
Hey, Chil-seong!

257
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,564
You were only just sent to prison.
When did you get out?

258
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,192
I jumped over the fence
to come to your wedding.

259
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,694
You could've busted your bad knees.

260
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,612
It's fine.

261
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,821
My goodness.

262
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,949
I'll make sure nothing on your plate
resembles prison food.

263
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,285
-Go sit at the VIP table.
-Okay.

264
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,456
The package?

265
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,959
Good work. Head over there first.

266
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,507
BRIDE NOH YANG-HUI

267
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,986
This is reckless.

268
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,781
Fuck, this is really reckless.

269
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,032
CHIL-SEONG LOANS

270
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,700
This is a bad idea.

271
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,163
Hold on.
What's taking this suited prick so long?

272
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,170
Fuck! Damn it! Who the hell was that?

273
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,655
Hello, we're LimeLight.

274
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,866
-Chil-seong.
-Yang-hui!

275
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,410
Congratulations on your wedding!

276
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,162
COMEDIAN JUNG MYUNG HOON

277
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,454
Dear newlyweds,

278
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,957
I hope you are blessed
with many baby princes…

279
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,875
Two-bit thug!

280
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,002
Time to reign in the honeymoon suite.

281
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,170
What a clown!

282
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,632
Chil-seong, Yang-hui! Congratulations.

283
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:42,556
My fluttering heart

284
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,101
Coochie-coochie-coo coochie-coochie-coo

285
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,022
Please love me

286
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:56,570
I'll follow you to the end of the world

287
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,783
Please don't tell me
you have a dead body in that bag.

288
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,286
We go in, grab the girl, and that's it.

289
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,246
Fuck…

290
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,459
Wet yourself again?

291
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,628
At least that I could clean up, but this…

292
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,341
You guys have a plan, right?

293
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,009
Does it look like we do?

294
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:24,514
I, Wang Chil-seong,
can't live without you, Noh Yang-hui.

295
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,016
For the past 40 years…

296
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,856
I can't believe I wasted all that time
without you in my life.

297
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,320
If I could turn back time,
I'd travel to the past to meet you sooner.

298
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,238
Don't cry!

299
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,365
Don't cry!

300
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,450
Hey, I am not crying. Hold on.

301
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,287
"Happy wife, happy life."
With this as my motto,

302
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,958
standing before my love,
my bride, Noh Yang-hui,

303
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,794
I swear on the name of the Prince Gang

304
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:57,256
that I will be devoted

305
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,966
to building a happy family.

306
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,263
I'm a married man now!

307
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:12,396
You see, that's the secret
to our 100% success rate.

308
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,690
We never have a plan.

309
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,276
Let's hear it for the bride and groom!

310
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,702
What's going on?

311
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,632
What's this? Another surprise performance?

312
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,519
Some people don't need a plan,

313
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,271
because they're unstoppable.

314
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,355
Who do you mean?

315
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,818
Someone who's totally unpredictable.

316
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:04,489
Enough with the surprises, okay?
I don't want to be too tired for tonight.

317
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,867
Someone who just goes with the flow.

318
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,202
I've never seen you before. Are you new?

319
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,788
Quit acting.

320
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,831
What?

321
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,500
Don't get married.

322
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,006
What is he saying?

323
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,092
I love you.

324
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,471
I'll never give up on you.

325
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,391
Hey, are you talking to me?

326
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,521
-Boss!
-Holy shit!

327
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,023
What a performance!

328
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,691
Let's go.

329
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,694
Oh, I see. They're acting.

330
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,738
-A round of applause!
-I see.

331
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,324
-Wow, boss!
-You fooled us.

332
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,993
Boss! You're bleeding!

333
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,080
Look at this. He lost a tooth.

334
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,165
Hey! Go stop that punk!

335
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,500
Boss!

336
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,131
Stop him!

337
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,229
-Move!
-You little…

338
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,985
Get off!

339
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,737
Go!

340
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,661
Catch him!

341
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,081
He takes life day by day,
just for the fun of it.

342
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,751
No one can stop a guy like that. Never.

343
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,231
I love this!

344
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,865
Hey! I've never met anyone as wild as you!

345
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,783
Too bad we have to part ways.

346
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,662
How about you come with me?

347
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,331
Come with me!

348
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,294
This is so awesome!

349
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,022
Mom?

350
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,232
Dad?

351
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,945
Hey! Have you lost your mind? Watch out!

352
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,587
Mom!

353
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,298
Dad!

354
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,605
-Mom.
-Don't call her that.

355
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,524
She's not your mom.

356
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,734
Dad.

357
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,694
How could I be your dad?

358
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,322
You're not my child.

359
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,033
Stop following us.

360
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,952
We don't know you.

361
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,835
Then who… who am I?

362
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,129
Who am I?

363
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:52,759
Then who am I? Who am I?

364
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,304
Dad!

365
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,642
Mom!

366
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,771
Who am I?

367
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,168
Boss.

368
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,753
You're awake.

369
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:30,589
Boss.

370
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,757
How many fingers can you see?

371
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,926
How about now? How many?

372
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,303
Motherfucker.

373
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,516
Looks like a mild concussion.

374
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,436
Does being reckless bring good luck?

375
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:48,982
How is she?

376
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,901
That lunatic managed
to roll away right before impact.

377
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,613
She got treated and dashed to the airport.

378
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,532
I told you not to take the job on.
You nearly died.

379
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,908
All good, then. Let's go.

380
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,910
Wait. We need to talk.

381
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:10,629
You see these round white things here?

382
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,344
What, like rice cake balls?

383
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,428
Rice cake balls?

384
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,973
Those little ones you get
in red bean porridge.

385
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,355
Four, five…

386
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,566
-Six--
-These are blood vessels in your brain.

387
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,613
They are knotted up abnormally.
That's why they look like tangled threads.

388
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,530
Abnormal.

389
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,492
If left untreated,
they'll reduce blood flow to the brain,

390
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,244
resulting in a lack of oxygen,

391
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,623
an increase in intracranial pressure,
and eventually--

392
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,791
They'll explode.

393
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,293
Like a bomb.

394
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,420
That's impossible.

395
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,508
This makes no sense at all. I'm only 28.

396
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,429
Premature menopause?

397
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,473
It's rare,

398
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,811
but these days,
due to stress and hormonal issues--

399
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:08,937
No.

400
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,023
No, no way.

401
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,025
This really makes no sense.

402
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,654
Menopause?

403
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,868
This is insane.

404
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:26,871
Look.

405
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,541
Ms. Jo?

406
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,335
Right, fine.

407
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,171
It can happen to other people
due to hormones,

408
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,508
eating habits, stress,
sleep deprivation, but not to me.

409
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,677
This shouldn't be happening. It can't!

410
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,388
-Ms. Jo.
-Premature…

411
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,685
Ms. Jo Jae-mi!

412
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,569
I need an eight-week-old baby.

413
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,990
Right here.

414
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,578
Already growing in my womb.

415
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,917
Am I going to die?

416
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,504
How long do I have?

417
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,132
Well, this is a rare condition, so…

418
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,426
A year? Half a year?

419
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,138
You can't undergo surgery now, so--

420
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:28,141
-Three months?
-If I'm being optimistic, yes.

421
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,778
Vascular malformations
are hereditary in most cases.

422
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,156
Hereditary?

423
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:46,451
If your parents or siblings
have a similar condition…

424
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,248
Come to think of it,
it's fucking hilarious.

425
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,751
You see, I don't have parents,

426
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,129
but I inherited something from them?

427
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,173
And it's a ticking time bomb?

428
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,384
Seems a bit unfair.

429
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,138
I can't believe it.

430
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,058
You lied about being pregnant
to get married?

431
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,310
It was his idea.

432
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,729
Indeed, the eldest son and heir

433
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,023
to a 500-year-old family lineage!

434
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,609
Oh, God, I'm getting a headache.

435
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:23,196
Given your hormone levels,
it's too late for medication.

436
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,240
But some cases overseas--

437
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,741
Please be honest with me.

438
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,536
"One-in-a-million," "miracles,"

439
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,954
none of that crap.

440
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,749
Can I get pregnant?

441
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,753
-As soon as possible.
-When's the wedding?

442
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,088
In three days.

443
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,930
-How old's your baby?
-Eight months.

444
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:49,973
Eight months?

00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,124
BY YOUR SIDE LIKE FAMILY
FOR A BEAUTIFUL FAREWELL

448
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,739
MY LOVE

449
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,911
God, what am I going to do now?

450
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,331
What do I do?

451
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:48,132
God, what do I do now?

452
00:32:55,723 --> 00:33:00,019
I came here to cry
without worrying what others might think,

453
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,773
but you beat me to it.

454
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,984
Thank you.

455
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,370
You bastard!

456
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,789
You said Chil-hyeon would be the last.

457
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,041
Hold on!

458
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,127
Can you take him for a sec?

459
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,547
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

460
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,844
What do you mean, "Kids raise themselves"?

461
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:37,306
An incompetent loser like you
doesn't deserve to be a father.

462
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:42,729
I'm going to rip your balls off
if you don't get a vasectomy right away!

463
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,689
Screw you!

464
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,153
He's my seventh child.

465
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,949
And I just found out
that I'm pregnant with twins.

466
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,786
I'm going to lose my mind!

467
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,622
I'm jealous.

468
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,501
Try raising one. It'll drive you nuts.

469
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,673
Then give me one.

470
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:12,759
What?

471
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:16,012
If they're driving you nuts,
can I have one?

472
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,556
Dear God.

473
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,976
I thought you were serious there
for a second.

474
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,269
Here, I'll take him.

475
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,356
You have nine children,
but I can't even have one?

476
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,442
It's so unfair.

477
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,652
Give me back my baby.

478
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,446
Let him go, come on!

479
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:36,240
Christ, what's wrong with this woman?

480
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,368
Please just give me one!

481
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,830
I really want a baby!

482
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,957
You're crazy!

483
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,843
Why can everyone have a baby except me?

484
00:34:56,385 --> 00:35:00,181
Why is my life so messed up? Why me?

485
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:03,309
I'm about to marry into a dynasty.

486
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:08,106
I must produce a son,
but I can't with premature menopause!

487
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,796
MYOUNG SUNG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

488
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:39,864
I must produce a son,
but I can't with premature menopause!

489
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,535
Move, move over.

490
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,245
-Oh, that worked.
-Yes.

491
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,498
One, two, three.

492
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:56,881
I want to be a mom. That's my dream.

493
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,509
Since I don't have a mom,

494
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,387
I want to be one myself.

495
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,681
A mom who showers her children with love.

496
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,226
What do you think? Sounds cool, right?

497
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,562
Yes. You'll be a wonderful wife.

498
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,606
You're so lovable.

499
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,863
But you can't be a good mom.

500
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,284
Parental love is passed down,
but we never experienced that.

501
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:30,831
People deprived of parental love, like us,
only pass resentment onto their children.

502
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:35,711
That's why we can't become parents.
You and me both.

503
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,839
You'll be lonely all your life

504
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,550
and die alone on the street.

505
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,635
This is boring.

506
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,430
Jae-mi, you're no fun anymore.

507
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,671
Fuck!

508
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,509
What the fuck?

509
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,053
Where did my money go?

510
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,055
Shit!

511
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,308
Shit!

512
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,981
Motherfuckers!

513
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,483
I'm sorry, boss.

514
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,903
It must've happened
when we were all at the wedding.

515
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,074
We got too carried away with the planning.

516
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,954
-This is all our fault, boss!
-We apologize, boss!

517
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,879
What the fuck?

518
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:00,963
Tissue.

519
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,424
This is so embarrassing, damn it.

520
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:11,349
Find the fucker who kidnapped Yang-hui.

521
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:17,063
Well… I'm not sure if it was a kidnapping.

522
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,690
It got a bit dicey
after you got knocked out.

523
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,733
Hey.

524
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,028
"Dicey"? What do you mean?

525
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,031
Oh, are you trying to say

526
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,659
that my Yang-hui is a cheating whore?

527
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,871
-Yes.
-You think I'm a moron?

528
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:37,750
That's why I got blindsided
and lost all my money, huh?

529
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,710
Yes, boss.

530
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,880
Listen to this twerp.

531
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,425
Then what about these idiots?

532
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:50,221
Are they useless jackasses
who just watched those two run away

533
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,265
and bowed to them
as they were making their grand exit?

534
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,020
-Yes.
-You stupid fucker.

535
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,689
You little shit.

536
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:05,236
So, what you're saying
is everyone in the Prince Gang

537
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,614
is a useless fucking moron
who got played by a chick?

538
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,282
Yes or no?

539
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,910
Yes or no? Answer me, motherfucker!

540
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,621
CEO WANG CHIL-SEONG

541
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,964
You’ve got a lot of nerve,
taking off with my girl and my money.

542
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,385
You crossed the line, you bastard.

543
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:34,682
I'm going to make mincemeat
out of this asshole.

544
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,462
What's your deal?

545
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:06,881
What do you mean?

546
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:11,218
You were being so elusive,
and now you're here sucking up to me.

547
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,428
What gives?

548
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,268
Don't you have any friends to drink with?

549
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,020
I wouldn't be here if I did.

550
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,731
Fine, milk me dry then.

551
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,649
Hey, Bong-suk.

552
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:30,404
It's Ju-ri, Bong Ju-ri!
I changed my name ages ago, you brat.

553
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,574
Don't hit my head, okay?

554
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:37,786
Or else what?
What are you going to do about it?

555
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,747
Seriously, hey.

556
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,544
If you keep hitting it, it'll explode.

557
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,047
There's a bomb in my head.

558
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,883
Fourteen bombs, actually.

559
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,391
Just sleep, all right?

560
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,228
That's crazy talk
from wandering around in the rain.

561
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:03,729
Just go to sleep.

562
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:07,024
Sleep, sleep, my dear Hae Jo

563
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:09,652
Hey, Bong-suk.

564
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,403
You little…

565
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:17,993
Why do tragedies keep happening
to those who are already suffering?

566
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,373
You're more likely to get sick
when you're poor,

567
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:25,292
you have no family to care for you
when you're sick,

568
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,420
and you're all alone
when you have no family.

569
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,633
Loners push away their fellow loners.

570
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,720
Are those song lyrics?

571
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,690
You'll be lonely all your life

572
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,193
and die alone on the street.

573
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,779
Am I going to die? How long do I have?

574
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:58,075
You can never become a mom.
You'll never be a mom.

575
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:01,996
But I can't with premature menopause!

576
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,421
What a fucking joke.

577
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,861
Madam Bum Ho-ja,
who brought traditional Korean cuisine

578
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:34,945
to the world,

579
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:39,283
is the wife of the 17th-generation
eldest son of the Pungyeong Eo clan.

580
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,661
Using high-quality, natural ingredients,

581
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:46,332
the family's centuries-old
secret fermentation method,

582
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:50,127
and her loving, careful touch…

583
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,004
Hello, ma'am.

584
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,339
Hello.

585
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:05,476
My goodness.
I was wondering what the noise was.

586
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,935
Mother.

587
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,520
Here, let me.

588
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,358
Hold it like this and slice diagonally.

589
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,525
No, relax your wrist!

590
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,528
Yes, that's it. Now try.

591
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,990
No, do it again.

592
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,494
Goodness gracious.

593
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,248
What are you doing?
You really are hopeless.

594
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,380
Oh God.

595
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,675
She can't even use a knife.
Who let this klutz into my kitchen?

596
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,718
My goodness, Ho-ja.

597
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:45,766
With only three days before the wedding,
I'd ask even a five-year-old for help.

598
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,477
She volunteered
to help prepare the wedding food

599
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,480
seeing as it's traditionally done
by the bride's family.

600
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,649
That's right. I insisted.

601
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,068
I'm supposed to prepare the food,

602
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,153
but you kindly offered to do it.

603
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:02,241
What was I supposed to do?
Ask you to make enough food

604
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:06,120
for nearly 600 guests,
knowing that you're an orphan?

605
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:10,499
The wedding is tomorrow.
Don't be like that before the big day.

606
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:14,420
Exactly! Why did she have to cut herself
right before the big day?

607
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,429
Here.

608
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,142
You're surrounded by knives,
flames, and hot oil in here.

609
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:32,855
If you're not careful,
you could get seriously hurt or even die.

610
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:37,276
You shouldn't come in here,
especially when you're pregnant!

611
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,360
You know?

612
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:42,322
Goodness me. What were you thinking?

613
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,413
All right.

614
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,169
You haven't been eating
and look like crap,

615
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:58,297
so I went all the way to Sillim
to get this. Try it.

616
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,549
They're famous. Here.

617
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,525
You don't like red beans?

618
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,818
I don't like you.

619
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,487
How ungrateful. It's good.

620
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,738
I'll eat it, then.

621
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,656
SO THEY CAN ALWAYS HAVE SWEET DREAMS

622
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,992
So they can have fun and be safe.

623
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:33,373
So they can smile every day.

624
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:38,420
Filled with fatherly love,
ensuring only the best for his child.

625
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,174
Bullshit. Who does he think he is,
Darth Vader?

626
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:50,182
I'M YOUR FATHER
CEO CHAE YEONG-JO

627
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,738
Was the Darth Vader joke that funny?

628
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,826
He said fathers want only the best
for their kids. Funny, huh?

629
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:14,206
So how come
I got nothing but a bunch of bombs, then?

630
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,593
I feel so pissed off all of a sudden.

631
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,011
You're scaring me.

632
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,390
Where are you going?

633
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,100
-To meet Darth Vader.
-What?

634
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,144
That bastard
brought me into this shitty world.

635
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,772
It's only fair
that I get to see him before I go.

636
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,691
You were just napping. What is this?

637
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,150
You're fired.

638
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,110
Me?

639
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,321
The money from your side gigs
will be your severance pay.

640
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,324
Sell everything in the office.
That'll be this month's pay.

641
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,284
Bye, I'm off!

642
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,452
Wait, boss! I can explain!

643
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,621
Fuck. How did he find out?

644
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,551
ALL YEAR 24/7
HAE JO ERRAND HOUSE

645
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,515
JO JAE-MI

646
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,976
What does your name mean?

647
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:19,897
"Talent" and "taste."
"Taste-making talent." Pretty cool, right?

648
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,483
They do say
your name determines your destiny.

649
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:27,279
I hear you work in the food industry too,
just like Ms. Bum.

650
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:29,364
Korean food? Western food?

651
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,325
Snacks, actually.

652
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:35,829
I made snacks at a daycare
but got fired because I sucked.

653
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:42,377
Where did you find the time
to prepare these handwritten cards?

654
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,005
There must be hundreds of them.

655
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,299
My, how thoughtful of you.

656
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,845
I'm not providing a dowry,
so it's the least I can do.

657
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,055
Nonsense!

658
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:56,099
You come bearing the most precious dowry.

659
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,101
In the kitchen earlier,

660
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,438
you saw that Ms. Bum
doesn't care about anyone

661
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,732
but her son and her grandchild.

662
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:06,485
That's all she cares about. Her bloodline!

663
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,488
It's because she had a hard time

664
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:12,449
conceiving her eldest son,
so please understand.

665
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,785
But I can assure you

666
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:19,039
that she'll take care of that baby
in your womb with her life,

667
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,874
so don't worry about a thing.

668
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,292
Okay.

669
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,296
Of course, it's her bloodline.

670
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,276
Should I just give up
and go back to Seoul?

671
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,494
Darn it.

672
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,080
It's so gorgeous.

673
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:07,379
God, what a mess.

674
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,673
What should I do?

675
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,384
Mother!

676
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,889
This… this is…

677
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,477
Did you really think
you could fool me with your tricks?

678
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,273
I was going to let you go in one piece

679
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:29,651
if you came clean before the wedding,
for my son's sake.

680
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:33,447
How dare you try to deceive me?
You shameless wench!

681
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,490
Come out!

682
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,034
-I'm sorry, Mother.
-Out!

683
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:40,078
-Sorry, I don't want to leave!
-Come out. Let's go!

684
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,081
Come out!

685
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,542
What are you waiting for?

686
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,878
-Wrap her up.
-Yes, ma'am!

687
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,297
-Wrap her up!
-Please don't make them hurt me!

688
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,966
No!

689
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,677
No, Mother. Please don't do this.

690
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,222
How dare you ridicule
and deceive this family?

691
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,807
No, let me explain.

692
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,184
What are you waiting for?

693
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,978
Wrap her up and beat her at once!

694
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,482
Mother! No, Mother! Please forgive me!

695
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,733
You spiteful wench.

696
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:12,819
Please forgive me just this once.
Please! Mother!

697
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:24,206
I'll end up dead if I marry her son.
I'm going back.

698
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,294
MY LOVE

699
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:01,952
Here.

700
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,288
Nice.

701
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:59,176
You're bringing the perfect dowry.
My gosh, so stunning.

702
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,393
Hello, sir. You made it.

703
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:11,855
Thank you.

704
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,357
You said you weren't feeling well.

705
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,444
The eldest son of the family
is getting married.

706
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:18,904
I should be here.

707
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,114
Gentlemen. I'll take a picture now.

708
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,952
What a handsome little boy.

709
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,872
-Look at that.
-It's so heavy.

710
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,625
Don't run, you rascals.

711
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,961
Goodness, who tied it like this?

712
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,757
Hey, don't touch it.

713
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,260
-Thank you!
-You little brat!

714
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,637
What a pain in the neck.

715
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,694
Oh no! That's…

716
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,032
Catch it!

717
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,220
We'll go and bring the groom in now.

718
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,304
Okay!

719
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,689
There. Not bad.

720
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,440
My knees don't hurt.

721
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:41,236
These should protect my knees
during the bowing ceremony.

722
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,321
Five hundred bows? Bring it on.

723
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,575
I look so pretty.

724
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:10,932
You look pretty.

725
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,186
How did you…

726
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,314
I'm curious too. My God.

727
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:21,818
How did you manage to snag this family?
It's so majestic here.

728
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:22,736
Why…

729
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:24,779
Why are you here?

730
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,698
To pick you up. Come on.

731
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,493
Get lost, or I'll call for help.

732
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,663
Why? What you want is to run away,
not get married.

733
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,998
So I'm here to help.

734
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,625
Stop talking nonsense and get out.

735
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,296
Then let's say it's a kidnapping instead.

736
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:43,089
I always play the bad guy anyway.

737
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:57,729
What a handsome groom!

738
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,038
Slap me all you want, but outside.

739
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,248
Let go of me. I'm going to scream.

740
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:19,000
They'll drag you out. Let go!

741
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:25,507
-Do you not care if they find out?
-What?

742
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,759
That you're not actually pregnant.

743
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:33,473
How could you be pregnant
when you're in menopause?

744
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,530
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Yes, you do.

745
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,033
You're scamming them.

746
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,576
This is a crime, Jae-mi.

747
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,956
Are you threatening me?

748
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,544
I'm asking you to cooperate.

749
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,262
Come with me.

750
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:21,766
