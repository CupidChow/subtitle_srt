1
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:37,912
Drop it off at the Incheon Port
container terminal by 10 a.m.

2
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,665
Man, this traffic's so bad.

3
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,127
Oh, no.

4
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,962
Damn. It's raining.

5
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,146
Shit.

6
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,027
-Hey, excuse me!
-Damn it.

7
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,655
You can't cut in like that.
Didn't you see my turn signal?

8
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,038
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

9
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,748
Fuck, that's the least of my--

10
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,558
Seung-hyeok?

11
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:45,980
Seung-hyeok!

12
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,732
Seung-hyeok, Daddy's home!

13
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,361
Hey, I got you a baseball glove--

14
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,450
Have you been a good boy?

15
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:58,868
Yes.

16
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,842
Honey! Seung-a hit her forehead.

17
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,468
She needs to see a doctor.

18
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,304
Get his number for the insurance company.

19
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,183
Are you all right?

20
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,654
Here's my card.

21
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,868
I'M YOUR FATHER
CEO CHAE YEONG-JO

22
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,787
"I'm Your Father"?

23
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,374
Can I have yours?

24
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,337
I have a name too.

25
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,340
Hae Jo. Nice to meet you.

26
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,426
Hae Jo.

27
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,223
I do everything except killing.

28
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,851
Call me if you ever need
something taken care of.

29
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,191
By the way,

30
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,321
I don't deal with missing-person cases,

31
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,699
such as children,
or runaway family members, you know.

32
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,035
Just so you know.

33
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,356
Don't go.

34
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,903
Please don't go.

35
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,491
Don't… don't go.

36
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,827
Don't go.

37
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:00,883
I…

38
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,012
told you not to run away.

39
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,769
What is this? What the…

40
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,688
Hey, you look sexy.

41
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,775
Shit, untie me! I'm going to kill you!

42
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,527
You should've listened to me.

43
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,154
-Smile!
-What?

44
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,780
Hey! Seriously!

45
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:26,159
MR. PLANKTON

46
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,130
What a dummy.

47
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,924
Why did she close her eyes
that very second?

48
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,434
Who's this?

49
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,728
PERFECT GENE

50
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,397
PATERNITY TESTING COMPANY
PERFECT GENE

51
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,950
How long will it take?

52
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,121
You'll receive a text message
when the results are in.

53
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,791
I could fast-track it
and get them by this evening.

54
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,293
Call me before noon.

55
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,295
For me,

56
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,298
a day is like a year.

57
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,851
This is all I can give you at this time.

58
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,353
1991 SPERM DONORS

59
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,105
-"Unpung Pharm"?
-Big pharma reps.

60
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,815
In those days,

61
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,652
they often donated their sperm
to fertility clinics like mine.

62
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,822
So, they donated their sperm
as a way to sell drugs?

63
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,116
Talk about tributes. Sperm tributes.

64
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,951
"Tributes"? It's a donation.

65
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,035
So you're saying

66
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,415
I have to find sperm donor number 137
all by myself?

67
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,545
All right, then.

68
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,881
Let's narrow it down to donors
with blood type AB.

69
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,425
Five of them.

70
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,221
So there's a 20% chance that the first one
I track down is my biological father.

71
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,558
A 20% chance isn't too bad.

72
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:24,986
Damn.

73
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,238
Fuck.

74
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,907
Have you lost your mind?
Put the knife down.

75
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,119
Who are you to sell the restaurant?

76
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,455
You see, this restaurant is mine.

77
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,873
It's mine.

78
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,793
I'm the one who's put up with our old man
and worked my ass off for years.

79
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:45,047
Why drool over what's not even yours
after shunning us for all this time?

80
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,467
-I will kill you.
-You crazy idiot.

81
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,718
Hey, shithead.

82
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,720
As if that grumpy old man

83
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,347
would leave all this
to a meathead like you.

84
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,183
You only want to scrounge off us

85
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,478
now that your business has gone bust
and your wife has left you.

86
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,104
I'm more reliable than you.

87
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,524
-As if you ever helped us, you fucker!
-Enough. Break it up.

88
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,193
I'll kill that little brat!

89
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,402
-Jeez!
-Hey!

90
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,320
You little…

91
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,198
Hey! Just listen
to your brothers, all right?

92
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,618
Let's accept the nice offer we got,
split the money four ways,

93
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,745
and go our separate ways.

94
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,414
It's for the best,
given Father's condition.

95
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,458
There are some good care homes nearby.

96
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,501
Unbelievable.

97
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,503
Suddenly the dutiful daughter-in-law.

98
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,462
What?

99
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,297
Four ways? You want a cut too?

100
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,215
Obviously!

101
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,509
-Of course, she's family.
-Family?

102
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,386
Fuck that. Family, my ass!

103
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,473
Forget it.
The three of us will split it equally.

104
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,309
Just don't waste it all on crypto,
like you did before.

105
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,229
Watch your fucking mouth.
I'm your older brother!

106
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,939
-You little…
-You hit me?

107
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,357
-Piece of shit.
-Hey!

108
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,947
Get the hell out of my restaurant!
Get out!

109
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,786
SUNDAE SOUP OF FORTUNE

110
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,579
The name is just fucking perfect.

111
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:04,502
Can someone please help me?
I'm literally tied up right now!

112
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,505
Can anyone hear me?

113
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:08,923
Hello?

114
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,602
Shoot.

115
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,702
Damn it!

116
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,181
What are you doing?

117
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,691
-You think this is funny?
-Yes. It's hilarious.

118
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,360
You moved the whole table!

119
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,279
What are you, the She-Hulk?

120
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:20,202
I should've recorded it.
"Jo Jae-mi's most embarrassing moments!"

121
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,831
This is kidnapping and false imprisonment.
You could go to jail.

122
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,833
Doesn't matter. I'm screwed anyway.

123
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,710
You really want to die?

124
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,004
My mother-in-law could have you killed.

125
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,966
She has a lot of connections
and she could find you in no time.

126
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,968
Is that old hag that powerful?

127
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:40,598
She turned traditional food into a brand
and she is a national treasure.

128
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,975
-A person can be a treasure?
-You're so dumb.

129
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,685
That makes you a traitor.

130
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,770
Me? Why?

131
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,981
You dared to deceive a national treasure.

132
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:53,736
You hid your premature menopause
to get your lazy hands on what she built.

133
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,780
You're a national traitor.

134
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,866
Doesn't matter.
Call me a traitor all you want.

135
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,912
-As long as I'm happy.
-So someone's got your back?

136
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,665
Right, your husband?

137
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,126
-Do you really trust that doofus?
-I don't.

138
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,046
But I do believe in love.

139
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,508
You're so naive.

140
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:19,970
Love is a fickle beast.
Do you still blindly believe in that crap?

141
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,140
It's my belief and my life.
Why do you care?

142
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,183
Because it's me.

143
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,062
I'm the one you were once crazy about.

144
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,231
But now?

145
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,983
You hate my guts and you want to kill me.

146
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,985
This is different.

147
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,156
Also, get your facts straight.
I didn't leave you. You dumped me.

148
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,159
-You left willingly.
-Because you pushed me away!

149
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,911
You didn't even look back.

150
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,663
I thought you'd at least stop me!

151
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,605
-Hey.
-Shut up.

152
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,523
No. Hey.

153
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,607
I said, shut up.

154
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,651
No, I just--

155
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,902
Just shut up!

156
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,532
That's my blanket.

157
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,626
Turn it off.

158
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,420
I'm awake now. I can't sleep.

159
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,215
Want to play word chain?

160
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,219
Or pick up where we left off and kiss?

161
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,163
Are you all right?

162
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,250
You're bleeding.

163
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,877
It hurts.

164
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,550
There's a hospital across the street.
Just over there, around the corner.

165
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,344
It hurts like hell.

166
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,598
Hold this for a sec.

167
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,616
AQUA LOVE DAYCARE
TEACHER "YUM YUM" JO JAE-MI

168
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,413
AQUA LOVE DAYCARE

169
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,044
Seeing his back turned to me,

170
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,798
made me want to run up to him
and give him a hug.

171
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,177
That's it. Just like that.

172
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,973
-She's there.
-That teacher over there.

173
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,602
Come see us again.

174
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,869
How did you know that I work here?

175
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,914
AQUA LOVE DAYCARE
JO JAE-MI

176
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:15,831
I see.

177
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,376
You came here just to return this?

178
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,586
Of course not.

179
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,796
-Then why?
-Do you have a boyfriend?

180
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,841
Yes, I do.

181
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,426
They said that you don't.

182
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,429
-What do they know?
-Kids know things too.

183
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,932
Well, so what if I am single?

184
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,058
Be my girlfriend.

185
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,232
I don't believe in love at first sight.

186
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,567
Me neither.

187
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,486
Then why are you hitting on me?

188
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,404
It could be a jae-m. Like your name.

189
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,198
A jam? My name is jammy?

190
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,532
JO JAE-MI

191
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,535
Are you making fun of my name?

192
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,005
-Do you like funny girls?
-Yes.

193
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,801
I like guys who smile a lot.

194
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,303
Okay.

195
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,934
Since you like funny people,

196
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,355
I'll try to make you laugh
at least three times a day.

197
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,190
But promise me

198
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:27,069
to smile like that and pretend it's funny
even if it's not, okay?

199
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:28,696
Sure.

200
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,701
I'm Jo Jae-mi. Nice to meet you.

201
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,536
I am

202
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,745
Hae Jo.

203
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,751
What, seriously?
Hey, your name is weirder than mine!

204
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,672
Hae Jo… "Hi, Joe!" A pleasure.

205
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,879
This is good. Well done.

206
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,471
That's good.

207
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,682
Ho-ja!

208
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,935
My goodness, Ho-ja.

209
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,190
Ho-ja, we have a problem!

210
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,026
Hey! Leave your dusty shoes at the door.

211
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,361
Goodness me.

212
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,532
Ho-ja, we have a problem.

213
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,659
It's Heung. Last night, he…

214
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,876
He went to look for the woman
who's carrying his kid.

215
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,586
It's his duty as a father.

216
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,838
-So, you knew?
-What did you think?

217
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,967
No son of mine
would sit by and do nothing like an idiot

218
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,886
just because I told him to.

219
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,860
Did you fill up Heung's car?

220
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,779
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,614
All right, then.

222
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,495
The men in this family

223
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,248
can't think straight
when it comes to women.

224
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,502
That's the blood
running through Heung's veins.

225
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:53,132
I suppose that's why
the family still follows that old custom.

226
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,299
What custom?

227
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,010
The one that forbids
pre-marital relations.

228
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,388
You know, the rule on virginity.

229
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,307
It was common back then.

230
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,602
In your case, yes.

231
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,564
My husband and I kissed a lot.

232
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,942
We even went all the way
before our wedding night.

233
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,777
Goodness. Stop, you bimbo.

234
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,238
-I'll be honest with you.
-Please don't.

235
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,323
Heung is too uptight and by the book.

236
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,742
-Just like you.
-Shut it.

237
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,871
So naturally,
I assumed he'd stick to that rule.

238
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,205
But what did he do?

239
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,084
He got her pregnant
after dating for just two months.

240
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,794
Well, I'm just saying,

241
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,088
Heung is one of the Eo men after all.

242
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,423
Hey, shut it.

243
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,134
Keep your mouth shut. Don't talk.

244
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,343
You and your mouth.

245
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,894
I'm gonna chew you up and spit you out.

246
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,694
You'll bake to death in there.

247
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,074
NAMWON POLICE

248
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,201
So, to sum up,

249
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,953
a so-called close friend of your bride

250
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,788
showed up at your wedding,

251
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,332
kidnapped your bride,

252
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,752
and dragged her
all the way here to Namwon, right?

253
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,587
Correct. There are witnesses.

254
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,173
And my wife left me a voicemail.

255
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,217
-Is that right?
-And there's also this.

256
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,761
Just in case. Here.

257
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:21,803
What's this?

258
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,309
-Who is this man?
-A composite sketch of the kidnapper.

259
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:32,022
Guys, we already have
a composite image right here.

260
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,858
Very helpful.

261
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,237
I drew this from what I could remember.

262
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,491
In physiognomy, the "glabella"
refers to the area between the eyebrows.

263
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,660
The dull color in this region

264
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,703
and these vertical lines

265
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,289
indicate serious head or stomach problems.

266
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,170
Meaning he's likely to be
a very sly and devious man

267
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,172
who's impossible to figure out.

268
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,968
And this sunken acupuncture point
under his cheekbone--

269
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,637
-You read faces?
-I'm a traditional medicine doctor.

270
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,555
You're a doctor?

271
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,350
-I'd never have guessed.
-Well…

272
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,604
You see, in most similar cases,
it's not kidnapping.

273
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,191
It's highly likely
that they ran away together.

274
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,735
But why would she run off with another man

275
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,570
when her husband is a doctor?

276
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,406
Who knows?

277
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,450
Maybe that man is a way better catch.

278
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,869
-Nonsense! She didn't run off.
-You scared me.

279
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,788
No way. She can't have.

280
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,874
Jae-mi and I are so… You know?

281
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,502
You have no idea
how passionate we are together.

282
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,462
-Okay.
-You don't even know us.

283
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,299
-I'm sorry. Please sit back down.
-You have no idea.

284
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,842
Please, calm down.

285
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,552
Even the night before,

286
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,722
when she put on
the floral shoes I'd bought her,

287
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,850
she was so over the moon.

288
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,814
That bastard had a crush on Jae-mi,

289
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,232
so he kidnapped her.

290
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,616
So that's it?

291
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,202
The reason behind that heated fight.

292
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,582
Jae-mi reminds me of a beautiful flower.

293
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:20,088
A delicate flower. Such innocent beauty.

294
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,675
When I look at her, I'm mesmerized.

295
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,096
This one is nice.

296
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,432
The flowers are so pretty.

297
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,646
Hurry, quick.

298
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,067
It's ready.

299
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,208
I couldn't bear to taint her with my lust.

300
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,877
She's that precious to me.

301
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,925
I must protect and cherish her

302
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,011
with all my heart.

303
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,641
See? What did I say? She totally ran away.

304
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,019
She left him for another man.
"Use it or lose it", right?

305
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,022
We only ever held hands.

306
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,110
It was so hard
to hold out until our wedding night.

307
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:26,488
But then that bastard
literally stole her right in front of me.

308
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:30,492
My wife should be in my arms right now.

309
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,828
I dare not think what he's doing to her.

310
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,163
Drink this and catch your breath.

311
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,457
There's no time to waste, Chief.

312
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,293
Guys, what are you doing? He's talking.

313
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,920
Hear him out.

You fucking prick.

This is no time for singing.
You think we're going on a picnic?

324
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,269
Sorry, Boss.
The road trip got me a bit carried away.

325
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,483
-Let's eat something at the rest stop.
-Sure.

326
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,777
The butter squid thing
and a caramel yacchiato for me.

327
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,156
Sotteok-sotteok, corn,
and a tornado potato for me.

328
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,783
Then I'll get udon and fish cake skewers.

I'll get some Deli Manjoo, boss.

331
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,252
You smartass, American food?

332
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,254
You idiot. "Deli" is in India.

333
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,090
-"Manjoo" is in China.
-It's American. You say "daily."

334
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,675

She's so pretty.

353
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,612
Poor guy. His bride is missing?

00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,344
You said you'd chase me

357
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,389
to the ends of the earth
if I ran away, right?

358
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,225
Yes.

359
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,270
Can I hold you to that?

360
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,439
I'll keep my word.

361
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,400
No matter what.

362
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,154
I'll be waiting. I love you.

363
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,200
Jae-mi…

364
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,379
Thank you.

365
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,968
Thank you for these.

366
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:30,065
Jae-mi!

367
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,984
Jae-mi!

368
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,266
Good Lord! You scared me.

369
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,811
Here, for the meal last night.

370
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,813
You found your wallet?

371
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,692
Hey, this is too much.

372
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,610
Can I have a pair of slippers?

373
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,946
This is way too much, even with that.

374
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,323
You can dye your hair with it.

375
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,743
It'll turn gray soon.
I'm not remarrying or anything.

376
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,296
Eat something before you leave.

377
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,219
You gave me more money
than my own kids ever gave me.

378
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,846
You can't leave like that.

379
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,182
Have some suyuk before you leave.

380
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,102
I'll make sure
it doesn't smell of pork at all.

381
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,314
Come to the restaurant
with your wife in a bit.

382
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,694
Sure.

383
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:05,160
Let's see. Is the meat cooked?

384
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,667
Yes, perfect.

385
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,259
30 YEARS OF TRADITION
SUNDAE SOUP OF FORTUNE

386
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,264
Give it back.

387
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,349
-Give what back?
-My shoe!

388
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,770
Where did you hide my other shoe?

389
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,730
I already told you it wasn't me.

390
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,191
Seriously, how old are you?

391
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,859
Maybe the dog took it.

392
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,614
Thank you. Have a nice day.

393
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,868
Hey, you're not crying, are you?
It's just a shoe.

394
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,244
"Just a shoe"?

395
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,080
Okay. I'll buy you
the exact same pair later.

396
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,750
I want nothing from you. Not even gold.

397
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:57,253
Fine. We'll look for it after eating.
Eat up. It's good.

398
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,547
You said you were here to find someone.

399
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,216
I found him.

400
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,593
I got it. Don't worry.

401
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,512
I'm just waiting for confirmation…

402
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,472
-It's all done.
-Fine.

403
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,683
…on whether I've found the right person.

404
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,521
-Have some water.
-Okay, thanks.

405
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,151
Did someone run off with your money?

406
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,279
How much? I'll give you the money.

407
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,324
So let's just quit this.
Whatever this is. Okay?

408
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,911
-Welcome!
-My gosh. Come on in.

409
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,832
You must have good karma…

410
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,875
-Right there.
-You can sit here.

411
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,546
…seeing as that big coffee franchise
opened right next to you.

412
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,631
-What a jackpot!
-I'll take this.

413
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,049
I brought you coffee.

414
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,636
What brings you here today, sir?
You didn't call us.

415
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:49,806
Well, you guys didn't call me either.

416
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,976
But you can't keep putting it off,
you know?

417
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,645
Time's running out, so here I am.

418
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,481
All right. I need your seal.

419
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,692
We haven't reached an agreement yet.

420
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,735
Goodness. I can't wait forever.

421
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:03,862
A little longer.

422
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,781
-Father, could you taste the broth?
-Sure thing.

423
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,284
Well, I have some savings.

424
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,870
And I put some cash aside for the wedding.

425
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:15,123
-The buyer might change his mind.
-It's not much though.

426
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,916
Anyway, how much did you lose?

427
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,210
-Let's seal the deal today.
-What is this?

428
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,380
-You stay out of this.
-Hey, you. Get out of here!

429
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,966
I am not selling this place, so get lost.

430
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,094
Hey, that's enough.
There are customers watching. Jeez.

431
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,971
You'll get a bigger cut, so stop.

432
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,014
What the hell?

433
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,182
You can settle this amongst yourselves

434
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,226
after you finalize the deal.

435
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,186
-I want half.
-Three ways.

436
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,521
We'll split it four--

437
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,899
Five ways!

438
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,859
What?

439
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,696
Split it five ways.

440
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,531
What?

441
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,953
You see, I think I deserve a cut too.

442
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,998
If the family is divvying it up,
I want in too.

443
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,708
And who are you?

444
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,919
I may be

445
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,755
one of your father's
illegitimate children.

446
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,465
What's the matter with him?

447
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,842
Didn't you guys agree to that last night?

448
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,595
That family members
all get an equal share.

449
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,556
That you'd sell it all,
split the money equally,

450
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,392
and send the old man to a care home.

451
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,061
That's what you said. Right?

452
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,647
What? Are you insane?

453
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,523
I never said that!

454
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,067
Hey, you.

455
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,070
Who the hell are you?

456
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,906
That's right. Sorry.

457
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,950
You were against it.

458
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,119
You want it all
as a reward for taking care of him.

459
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,704
You greedy little bastard.

460
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,622
You lunatic.

461
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,376
-Hey! Stop! Don't do that!
-What's going on?

462
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,546
-Hey!
-What the fuck?

463
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,882
Hey. Are you all right?

464
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,469
Hey, you little…

465
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,181
-Damn!
-You son of a bitch!

466
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,143
I'm sorry--

467
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,021
You motherfucker.

468
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,232
Don't. You'll hurt your hand, moron.

469
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,735
Who are you to butt in?
What are you going to do?

470
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,238
-You moron.
-Fucking bastard! You're dead.

471
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,823
Get him. I'll cover you.

472
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,825
You goddamn lunatic.

473
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,619
Bring it on, you bastard!

474
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,707
-Get him!
-Come on then.

475
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,000
Fuck, what a prick.

476
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,127
He came out of nowhere and ruined it.

477
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,088
The deal was as good as done.
That little shit.

478
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,425
What the hell? Who did this?

479
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,022
Sorry! I'm so sorry.

480
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,273
Thank you.

481
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,983
Excuse me. Jae-mi!

482
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:48,901
Jae-mi…

483
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,364
Jae-mi!

484
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,535
I have to…

485
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,252
You bastard. You're dead meat.

486
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,087
Wait!

487
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,506
How dare you. You piece of trash!

488
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,280
Hey, can you even chop kimchi with that?

489
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,744
What is that, kiddo?
Are you going to shave with that or what?

490
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,664
-I'll do my best, Boss.
-At what?

491
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,042
Everything.

492
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,044
Forget it. You'll only get hurt.

493
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:48,961
Yes, Boss.

494
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,006
-Sir.
-Yes?

495
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,218
They say a fight broke out.
Will we be able to handle it?

496
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,762
Don't you worry. I can take them all down.

497
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,556
-Shouldn't we ask for backup?
-Backup, my ass.

498
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,642
No need. Don't you trust me?

499
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,477
-Of course, I do.
-Let's do a cheer.

500
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,312
-Okay.
-One, two, three.

501
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,648
We got this! Hands on the wheel.

502
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,195
Shit.

503
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:37,093
My stomach! My stomach is killing me!

504
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,054
Oh, no. My baby…

505
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,765
Don't just stand there.
Take her and get out!

506
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,351
I feel like I'm dying!

507
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:49,063
Oh, no. My tummy!

508
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,441
My tummy. My stomach really hurts!
Ouch, my stomach…

509
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,793
-Let's go, Father.
-Get inside, you guys.

510
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,308
They're deceiving you.

511
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,188
Who is deceiving whom here?

512
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,399
Both of you, seriously.

513
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,694
Jeez, you….

514
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:41,032
Did you really think
I had no idea about their spiteful plan?

515
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:48,039
I was just pretending
I'd heard nothing, like I had no idea.

516
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,957
I was willingly being deceived.

517
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,754
Who are you to cause such chaos
when this is none of your business?

518
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,547
Who are you?

519
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,632
I'm…

520
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,761
I'm…

521
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,563
PERFECT GENE
DNA PATERNITY TEST RESULTS

522
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:27,995
You're right.

523
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,583
Fuck.

524
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,335
This is none of my business.

525
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,421
I was just being nosy.

526
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,257
Goddamn it.

527
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,687
So you're sick?

528
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:58,484
Something's wrong with you.
You must be either sick or crazy.

529
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,535
Yes, I guess I'm sick as hell.

530
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,079
Well, good for you.

531
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,610
Let's go.

532
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,532
Hey, come on!

533
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,826
I'm not coming.

534
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,541
Why do I have to play along?
I'm staying here.

535
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,301
-Come on.
-I'm not going. Let go!

536
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:08,137
-Hey! No! Help!
-Damn it.

537
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,555
Jae-mi?

538
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,182
-Honey!
-Jae-mi!

539
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,142
Honey, I'm here! Honey!

540
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,560
Jae-mi! Hold on.

541
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,937
Honey, over here!

542
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,898
-Honey!
-Jae-mi.

543
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:19,982
Jae-mi!

544
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,403
Come on!

545
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,489
Jae-mi… Stop!

546
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,116
Honey!

547
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,120
Let me out, goddammit!

548
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:34,872
Honey!

549
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:43,881
So, where is he?

550
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:47,343
Over there… I mean, right here.
Hae Jo, you're a dead man now.

551
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:48,886
Right here.

552
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,599
We're closed!

553
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,061
We're not here to eat. Where is Hae Jo?

554
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,480
We know he's here,
so just bring him out now.

555
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,357
You fucking idiots.

556
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,693
Just tell us,
or I'll slice you up like a sundae.

557
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,903
Who are you people?

558
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,281
What is that?

559
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:13,994
Damn it!

560
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,250
We're only out to get Hae Jo.

561
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,044
So stay out of this,
unless you want to die too.

562
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:23,671
Get out!

563
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,714
-What?
-Get out of here!

564
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:26,924
-Father!
-Get out!

565
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,510
Get out!

566
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,596
-What the fuck? You old bastard!
-Hands up!

567
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,600
Freeze! Move, and I'll shoot!

568
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,394
Oh, damn. I left mine in the car.

569
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,272
Hey, Officer Kim, what are you doing?

570
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,649
Take their weapons first.

571
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,360
Hey, freeze. Drop your weapon.

572
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,821
You… Stay put, all right?

573
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,577
That's our car.

574
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,417
-A fire at Dongil Market.
-What do I do?

575
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,794
Well…

576
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,506
Officers, I'm really sorry.

577
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,719
I was in a hurry, so I borrowed the car.
I'll return it later.

578
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,137
Identify yourself!

579
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,347
Me? I… I'm…

580
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:16,974
I…

581
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:23,272
I am Eo Heung, the 18th-generation heir
of the Pungyeong Eo clan.

582
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,984
"Heung" as in "prosperity." Eo Heung.

583
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:35,618
This is our signature nine-dish meal
made from age-old family recipes.

584
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:39,455
Now, it's also known
as Bum Ho-ja's signature nine-dish meal.

585
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,625
And this is chicken
braised with persimmon leaves.

586
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,169
-Persimmon leaves?
-Ho-ja. Heung.

587
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,338
-It adds depth of flavor.
-It's Heung.

588
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:52,134
Heung stole a police car? What for?

589
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,552
How would I know?

590
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,933
And now he's on the run in Namwon
in the police car that he stole.

591
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,518
He's on the run?

592
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,564
This fool deserves to be eaten by a tiger.

593
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,442
He went to catch the guy
who stole his bride.

594
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,529
What's he doing
stealing a damn police car?

595
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,657
My gosh, this is so embarrassing.
That crazy fool.

596
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,409
Hey, John?

597
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,288
I'm going to need you

598
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,124
to get on the next flight to Korea.

599
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,502
That's right.

600
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,423
Stop! This is dangerous!

601
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,516
Jae-mi!

602
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,146
Jae-mi!

603
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,398
-Hey!
-Honey!

604
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,776
I am here to rescue you,
so don't do anything dangerous.

605
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,319
Just stay put!

606
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,572
I will never give up on you.

607
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:55,614
Honey…

608
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,241
Just remember that!

609
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,618
Oh, no! Honey--

610
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:02,955
Honey!

611
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,999
Honey!

612
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,209
I love you!

613
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,712
Jae-mi! I love you!

614
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,839
Honey!

615
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,926
Oh, honey…

616
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,603
Jeez, he's one Heungry tiger.

617
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,645
Damn you!

618
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,439
-You!
-What? Hey, hey!

619
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,567
Hey, shit.

620
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,902
Hey! Let me get out! Heung, over here!

621
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,739
I'm over here!

622
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:38,991
Stop the car!

623
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:41,285
I can't just pull over right here. Let go!

624
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,330
Now!

625
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,713
-Let go, damn it!
-That hurt!

626
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:57,509
I'm in here, honey!

627
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,141
What the hell is this?

628
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,697
Honey…

629
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:20,866
-Shit.
-Honey!

630
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,709
Oh, fuck!

631
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,878
Jae-mi!

632
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,057
-What the…
-Hey, are you all right?

633
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:46,934
You're bleeding.

634
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:47,976
I am?

635
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,479
Shit.

636
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,733
-Do you want to be a widow?
-Of course not.

637
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,568
Okay, then I won't kill him.

638
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,071
What? What are you going to do?

639
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,656
Hey, no! Don't! Hey!

640
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,908
Shoot. Hold on.

641
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,620
Jae-mi!

642
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:08,580
Jae-mi!

643
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,082
Shoot.

644
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,711
If you hurt my husband,
I swear I'll kill you!

645
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,213
-Here.
-Honey.

646
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,801
Jae-mi. Don't move.

647
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,679
Do it. Go ahead and shoot if you can.

648
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,514
You sneaky coward.

649
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,684
You're the one holding a weapon,
so this is self-defense.

650
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:32,438
And in the wild,
it's the sneaky cowards who win.

651
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,858
-You son of bitch.
-Woof-woof.

652
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,822
Fuck. Hey, seriously…

653
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,456
Patrol 17. The man who took the police car

654
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,332
is pointing a Taser at a civilian.

655
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,421
Hand her over now.

656
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:01,842
I'll shoot on three.
I really will shoot you.

657
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,802
Go ahead, then. Shoot me.

658
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,847
One!

659
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,766
Go that way.

660
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,642
Two! That way, now.

661
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,187
How can he be a doctor
with such shaky hands?

662
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,314
Mind your own business, asshole.

663
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:16,982
Three!

664
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,568
Wait!

665
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,654
Damn it, why isn't this working?

666
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:26,074
Damn it.

667
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,286
-What are you doing? Shoot already!
-Here goes.

668
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,501
What's wrong?

669
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,503
Damn it.

670
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,631
Fuck, I was scared for a second.

671
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,510
You're hardly an heir. You're an airhead.

672
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,387
Don't move. I really will shoot you.

673
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,097
-Just shoot already.
-Shoot him!

674
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,641
I'm trying, but it's--

675
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,443
No, Heung!

676
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,779
Heung, are you all right?

677
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:06,198
See? I didn't do anything.
He shot himself.

678
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,408
Heung, open your eyes!

679
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,160
Don't overreact, all right?

680
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,246
He won't die. He just passed out.

681
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,081
You son of a bitch!

682
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,458
You absolute scumbag.

683
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,669
Die, just die!

684
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:21,505
-Hey, he's not even dead.
-Die!

685
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:22,631
All right.

686
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,092
-That hurts.
-Just die!

687
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:29,596
-It really does.
-Scumbags like you deserve to die!

688
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,722
That's enough.

689
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:33,809
It hurts.

690
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,811
It hurts…

691
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,571
Stop joking around! Damn it!

692
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,413
Hey.

693
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:14,766
NAMWON POLICE

694
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:18,312
Jeez, this is so fucking frustrating.

695
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,397
I told you. We didn't do anything.

696
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,442
The place was a mess when we got there.

697
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:26,278
For God's sake.
You really are driving me nuts here!

698
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:30,782
Jeez! You know I saw you guys
swinging your weapons in Mr. Oh's face!

699
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,868
I saw it with my own eyes!

700
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,328
So what?

701
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,288
That crazy old man slapped me

702
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,790
with some stuffed pig intestine.

703
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,793
Was I supposed to let him?
I'm the victim here!

704
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,755
Then tell me,

705
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:48,425
why did you guys go there
with all those weapons?

706
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:51,595
To slice some pork liver
for the sundae platter?

707
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,215
I guess she really left.

708
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,348
-Don't push, all right?
-Come on, man.

709
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,059
-All right. In you go.
-Damn it!

710
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,978
-I was kidnapped.
-Yeah okay, go in.

711
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,397
This is a human rights violation.

712
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,067
You can no longer detain anyone
in police substation cells.

713
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:51,571
That's right. You see, my boy here
took the police exam nine times.

714
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,489
He's a half-cop.

715
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,074
So this is a violation.

716
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,201
Is that so?

717
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,745
But this isn't a holding cell anymore.

718
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,914
It's now our storage room.

719
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,457
So keep your mouth shut,

720
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,252
or I'll charge you
with obstruction of justice

721
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,462
on top of everything else. Got it?

722
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,214
He can do that?

723
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:10,966
I don't remember.

724
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,468
You idiot. Goddamn it.

725
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,141
What the… Man, you scared me!

726
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,058
I lost her.

727
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,269
Oh man, that idiot woke up.

728
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,189
You'll get a pay cut for this.

729
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:29,026
How could you leave your weapon
in the car?

730
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,445
Chief, I didn't mean to leave it there.

731
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,988
Hello? Yes.

732
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:37,868
What are you doing? Shoot him!

733
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,661
Shoot him now!

734
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,753
Heung! Heung, are you all right?

735
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:50,213
Heung, open your eyes!

736
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,549
I'm such a moron.

737
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,053
Hey, Jokduri.

738
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,680
That noise is driving me nuts. Keep still.

739
00:50:58,764 --> 00:50:59,681
Hey!

740
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:04,561
Man, that's really irritating me.
Hey, you!

741
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:08,482
Very impressive, Doctor.
You must be very well-connected.

742
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,026
-He's a doctor?
-Yeah.

743
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:14,738
My superiors told me
to just let you go, no questions asked.

744
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:15,947
-What about us?
-Fuck.

745
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,663
Wait, Mr. Eo! Don't leave just yet.

746
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:24,790
Why not?

747
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:28,335
Can you please quiet down?!

748
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,545
You guys are driving me nuts!

749
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,757
-Don't leave yet.
-Why not?

750
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,842
Someone's coming to pick you up.

751
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,053
My mother?

752
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:43,225
No. What was his name again?

753
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:48,146
I felt utterly offended
the moment I heard his name.

754
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,524
"John Na"?

755
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:03,912
What about Jae-mi?
My Jae-mi. What about Jae-mi?

756
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:07,082
You still haven't found her?

757
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:08,667
Well, that's the thing.

758
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,711
We have no idea where they went

759
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,463
after they ditched the car.

760
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:37,964
I thought you left.

761
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,387
Did you hide me over there?

762
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,390
Yep.

763
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:50,518
Thanks.

764
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,613
A token of my gratitude--

765
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:07,786
Don't be delusional.
I wasn't waiting for you.

766
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,373
Where are you going?

767
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,250
Back to where I should be.

768
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,419
-No, don't go.
-Let go.

769
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:19,506
-Don't go.
-Don't try and stop me. I'm leaving.

770
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,841
No, I won't let you.

771
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,051
Then kill me.

772
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,931
Or I might kill you.

773
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:31,851
Why?

774
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,478
It's either you or me.

775
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,941
That's the only way
we'll never cross paths again.

776
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:47,409
So if you're not going to let me go
or kill me right now…

777
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,579
then just let me be happy for once!

778
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,791
So drop dead or something already!

779
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:01,214
Do something, please!

780
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,164
I'll do that, then.

781
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,714
You be happy.

782
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,551
I'll die.

783
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,014
But until then,

784
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:55,143
I'm never letting go of your hand.

785
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,273
You're all mine.

786
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,529
