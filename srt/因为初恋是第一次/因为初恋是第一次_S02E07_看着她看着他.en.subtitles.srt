1
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,150
Here you go.

2
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:27,986
Thank you.

3
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:34,951
Is there something on my face?

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,206
Oh, no. I'll get you a new cup.

5
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,425
TAE-O'S DINER

6
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,260
What should we eat?

7
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,597
How about a warm bowl of kalguksu?

8
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,058
Okay.

9
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,351
Two servings of kalguksu, please.

10
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,890
This tastes amazing!

11
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,185
I must say,
its quality lives up to its name.

12
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,027
If you're done, should we head out?

13
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,655
Let's go and see the sunset by the beach.

14
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,740
Okay.

15
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,166
-Here.
-Thank you.

16
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,102
Are you all right, ma'am?

17
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,563
Yes, I'm fine.

18
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,274
It's just that my eyes
are stinging a little.

19
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,028
Here you go.

20
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,572
Thanks.

21
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,699
The food was amazing.

22
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,494
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

23
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:06,394
WHERE THE GAZE LIES

24
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,942
It's been a while
since I last saw a sunset.

25
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:20,700
Everything seems beautiful yet wistful
when you're at the beach.

26
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,119
Doesn't it?

27
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,339
The lady at the restaurant.

28
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,009
What?

29
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,511
She stared at me for a long time.

30
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:43,681
Really?

31
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,558
It wasn't just any look.

32
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,605
She looked at me as if she knew me.

33
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,904
You said you wanted to take me somewhere.

34
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,867
Where did you want to take me?

35
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,163
Just earlier...

36
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,584
I saw something
that I couldn't make sense of.

37
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,256
It's so absurd...

38
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,176
that I can't understand it at all.

39
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,845
What did you see?

40
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,722
At that restaurant...

41
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,228
there was a photo of me and my mom.

42
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,070
But it's not supposed to be there, is it?

43
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,323
Song-i.

44
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,411
Where have you brought me?

45
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,883
FROM: 401-1 HAEAN-GIL, SEOSIN-MYEON

46
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,303
When I was tutoring Yeong-ho...

47
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:09,350
I found out something at your house.

48
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,897
I wasn't sure how to bring it up,

49
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,483
so it took me a while to tell you.

50
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:19,902
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,745
What on earth are you doing?

52
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,581
If you keep this up,
I'm calling the police.

53
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,207
Look, Jeong-gil.

54
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,126
I told you it's urgent.

55
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,837
It's you who made me come all the way here
by ignoring my calls.

56
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,423
You clearly said that
it would be the last time.

57
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,633
In the early stages of business,
cash flow isn't so great.

58
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,552
You should know better than anyone.

59
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,513
Do you have to be so stingy
when you have a lot of money?

60
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,556
I know, right?

61
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,640
Jeez.

62
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,442
You should stop coming here.

63
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,944
How long are you
going to keep tormenting us?

64
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,280
We've helped you countless times.
How much is ever enough?

65
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,658
Damn it. I already told you
this will be the last time!

66
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,660
Can't you help for the last time?

67
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,245
Please!

68
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,789
Can't you give me a break?

69
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,833
You're driving my family insane!

70
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,753
"Your family"? How can you talk like that?

71
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,506
I'm your family too, you know.
Your one and only brother.

72
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,591
I'm Tae-o's only uncle. How dare you...

73
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,636
Please, stop. Let's talk this out.

74
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,887
Don't say my son's name...

75
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,847
with that filthy mouth of yours.

76
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:30,807
Gosh.

77
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,268
She's saying she'll desert us
now that she has her own husband and kid.

78
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,355
How much more selfish can they get?
What's so hard about sharing?

79
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,440
The rich are just greedy pigs.

80
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,318
You should leave for now. Please go back.

81
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,780
VOLUNTARY RELINQUISHMENT
OF PARENTAL RIGHTS

82
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,698
I HEREBY TRANSFER CUSTODY OF YUN TAE-O...

83
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,170
SIGNED BY: LEE SEO-HUI

84
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,550
Is this really necessary?

85
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,928
He's your son.

86
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,597
You can't cut ties with your own child.

87
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,599
I'm doing it for him.

88
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,437
If I don't do this...

89
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,315
it's obvious how miserable
Tae-o's life will be.

90
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,160
Please...

91
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,498
take good care of him.

92
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,135
Tae-o. Hey, Tae-o!

93
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,511
Leave me alone!

94
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,733
How long have you known?

95
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,654
I found out just recently.

96
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,241
I didn't know...

97
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:16,037
how to tell you.

98
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,207
Tell me what?

99
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,335
That my mom was alive all along,
when I thought she was dead?

100
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,464
That she didn't bother to get in touch
with me for a whole 20 years?

101
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,551
What kind of...

102
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,931
This is so ridiculous. I don't understand.

103
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,059
Tae-o.

104
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,895
Why don't we go back
to the restaurant and--

105
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,063
And do what?

106
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,524
What am I supposed to ask her?

107
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:49,070
Should I go and tell her
that my friend told me something so absurd

108
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,988
and I'd like to know if it's true?

109
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,490
Or...

110
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,450
should I go and ask her...

111
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,202
if she's my...

112
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,293
I'll be there with you.

113
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,837
No.

114
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,881
Come on, Tae-o.

115
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,427
Why did you tell me this?

116
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,477
If you were in my shoes,
would you have handled it well?

117
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,689
Would you be okay hearing something
like this so unexpectedly?

118
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,317
Hey. I'm surprised you called me first.

119
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,695
Hello? Tae-o.

120
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,780
Are you outside?

121
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,491
I'm in Jebu Island right now.

122
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,623
Don't you have anything to tell me?

123
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,833
I see you did go there after all.

124
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,544
Was it Song-i?

125
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,715
-Is she the one who told you?
-Is that important right now?

126
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,176
Come home for now.

127
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:36,927
We should talk face to face.

128
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,804
I'm a grown-up.

129
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,681
Couldn't you have

130
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,059
at least given me hints
while I was growing up?

131
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,729
You could have helped me
figure it out on my own.

132
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,065
I had my reasons
for not being able to tell you.

133
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,651
You were just being a coward!

134
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,821
If you couldn't hide a secret this big,

135
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,200
you shouldn't have kept it
from me to begin with.

136
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,829
Aren't you a grown-up?

137
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,790
Can you even call yourself one?

138
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,083
Tae-o.

139
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,341
Let's go inside somewhere.
You might catch a cold.

140
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,514
Wait.

141
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,010
All right.

142
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,681
It's unusual of you to suggest
we go out for drinks.

143
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,726
I just felt like it.

144
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,813
It's been a long time
since we last had a drink together.

145
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,524
You're right.

146
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,236
I wonder what's been keeping me so busy
all this time.

147
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,871
I was in the mood for it, anyway.

148
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,791
Dad.

149
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,835
Can I ask you a painful question?

150
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,961
Painful?

151
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,757
There are so many that I can think of.

152
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,217
What is it?

153
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,385
I heard that you argued a lot with Mom...

154
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,429
when you two were dating.

155
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,389
It wasn't just when we were dating.

156
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,433
It continued through our marriage.

157
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,562
You already know that.
That's why we got divorced in the end.

158
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,274
But didn't you guys make up right away
when you were younger?

159
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,485
I guess so.

160
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,613
Back then, we were madly in love.

161
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,282
Who knew we'd end up like that?

162
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,160
When you got furious at Mom...

163
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,206
to the point it felt like
it would surely be the end of it,

164
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,377
have you ever been scared that
Mom would leave you?

165
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,879
Of course.

166
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,260
-It happened many times.
-What did you do at times like that?

167
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,678
I don't know.

168
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,474
Whenever I let my pride
get the best of me, it didn't end well.

169
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,144
So, eventually, I apologized.

170
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,732
Even if two people like each other,

171
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,527
the levels of their affection
don't always match.

172
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,654
Even if it's frustrating,

173
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,990
the person who is more in love

174
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,659
should try their best to share that love.

175
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:34,456
I think that's a pretty great
relationship as well.

176
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,127
Here.

177
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,217
SONG-I

178
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:51,599
Pour 120g into this,
and add 6g of the oil.

179
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,600
Pour 120g and 6g?

180
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,976
You know how to do it, right?

181
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,978
Yes. Thank you.

182
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,237
What's this?

183
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,823
I'm really sorry to be asking
at such a late hour,

184
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,785
but could you come to Jebu Island
right now?

185
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,798
I really hope you can come.

186
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:29,386
Tae-o is having a very tough time
right now.

187
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,850
I couldn't tell you
because it wasn't my secret.

188
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,894
I'm sorry, Do-hyeon.

189
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,941
I think he is in need
of your help as a friend.

190
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,320
Can you come here for Tae-o?

191
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,155
I'll wait,

192
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,157
even if you make it late.

193
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,562
Hey, Song-i!

194
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,656
Where's Tae-o?

195
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,088
This is unbelievable.

196
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,883
How could anyone hide a secret
that big for 20 years?

197
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,595
You can never really understand
how grown-ups' minds work.

198
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,640
What now? What is Tae-o's plan?

199
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,144
Has he not spoken to his mom yet?

200
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,562
Well...

201
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,857
that's for Tae-o to decide.

202
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,986
There's only so much
I can do for him at this point.

203
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,823
Do you think Tae-o's mom recognized him?

204
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,203
I'll go and check on Tae-o.

205
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,540
Should I come with you?

206
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,169
He might feel uncomfortable
if we crowd around him. You stay here.

207
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,046
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

208
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,225
Aren't you cold? It's freezing out here.

209
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,895
Come inside and stay indoors with us.

210
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,569
You go ahead first.
I'll join you in a bit.

211
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,322
Well, then...

212
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,284
I guess I'll just sit beside you.

213
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:07,002
If it's too overwhelming for you
to go and meet her again today,

214
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,671
just get on the bus.

215
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,509
You can always come back
if you have a change of heart.

216
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,636
You know where to find her, anyway.

217
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,473
That's what I'll do.

218
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,017
But you know what?

219
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,104
In life,

220
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,273
there are things that
you shouldn't put off.

221
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,819
From time to time, I think to myself...

222
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,449
how things would've been like if I hadn't
had the guts to escape from the airport.

223
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,830
I wondered how it would've turned out
if I had put off escaping.

224
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,793
I probably wouldn't be here now.

225
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,629
That's what I think.

226
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,007
I don't think I would've had
a second chance.

227
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,762
There isn't a second chance, Tae-o.

228
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,140
You shouldn't run away.

229
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,606
Thanks for coming all the way here.
It must've been tiring.

230
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,235
It's not like I walked here.
The bus did all the work.

231
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:17,114
What about you? How are you holding up?

232
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,742
You should have cried
for our help or something.

233
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,704
Why did you bear the brunt
all on your own?

234
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,706
I hardly did anything.

235
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,876
It's Tae-o who's suffering the most.

236
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,711
You guys are so frustrating.

237
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,133
Did you tell...

238
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:37,885
Do-hyeon as well?

239
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,473
Yes.

240
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,104
I told him that I had no choice...

241
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,148
but to come here.

242
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,736
He didn't take it that well?

243
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,369
Well...

244
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,998
I don't know much about
romantic relationships,

245
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,250
but I think...

246
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:15,297
they are about becoming
each other's top priority.

247
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,343
To me, Ga-rin is my topmost priority.

248
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,471
And her topmost priority is me.

249
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,224
I haven't asked her, though.

250
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,688
So, what I'm trying to ask is...

251
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,274
is that the case for you?

252
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,443
Does Do-hyeon...

253
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,196
come first before anyone else?

254
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,969
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

255
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,806
Forget it. Why are you apologizing
in this situation?

256
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,057
Sit.

257
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,188
Let's go home.

258
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,234
What are you talking about?

259
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,486
Why leave it hanging
when you've come this far?

260
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,904
It's my business.

261
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,614
Let me decide.

262
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:23,865
But...

263
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,826
I'll meet you outside.

264
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,996
Hey.

265
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,207
Tae-o.

266
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,128
This isn't right.

267
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,964
I know the situation
doesn't directly concern me.

268
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,134
I'm merely one of your friends
who just found out this crazy news.

269
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,427
Still, I've got to say this.

270
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,595
What is it you want to say?

271
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,931
What I'm trying to say is...

272
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:54,021
if you leave this place now,
you're basically blowing your opportunity.

273
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:57,149
You came all the way here.
Do you really have to...

274
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,360
Gosh, this is driving me mad.

275
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,070
Just let me go.

276
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,073
All I want to do right now is go home.

277
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,037
Who says you can leave?

278
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,378
I just got here.

279
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,894
Evading isn't the answer.

280
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,896
Ask her directly.

281
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,273
Some of them may be facts,

282
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,859
but some are based on your hunch.

283
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,905
You should face the situation head-on.

284
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,866
The only way to move forward...

285
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,536
is to accept it or get past the problem.

286
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,455
It's easy for you to say.
It's not your problem.

287
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:55,916
"Easy"?

288
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,960
Do you think it was easy for me
to come here?

289
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,756
Do you think I came here to comfort
and do something for you?

290
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,133
What are you getting at?

291
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,551
Song-i did her very best.

292
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:12,432
She kept the secret all to herself
and brought you here in a way...

293
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,560
that wouldn't hurt you as much.

294
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,110
Song-i wanted to give you
what you deserved.

295
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,112
So, go for it.

296
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,864
I came here to tell you that.

297
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,284
What if she refuses to meet me?

298
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,248
And if she asks why I came
to meet her after all these years?

299
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,043
I don't want to be a pessimist...

300
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,547
but I can't help imagining things
like that.

301
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,715
She had your photo in the restaurant.

302
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,593
And named the place after you.

303
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,935
She's always had you in her heart.
I am certain of it.

304
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,442
Take this.

305
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,238
I brought it with me just in case.

306
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,699
She hasn't seen...

307
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,618
much of your childhood.

308
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,228
Did you leave something here?

309
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,743
I saw the photo.

310
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,206
You still look the same as then.

311
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,589
I've changed a lot.

312
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,889
It wasn't easy for me to come here.

313
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,853
Please don't avoid me.

314
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,856
I'm not avoiding you.

315
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,875
I wanted to...

316
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,672
get a better view of my son's face.

317
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,079
Thank you for coming.

318
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,916
You said you'd wait for me.

319
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,793
I didn't have a choice.

320
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,466
What's in that USB?

321
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,510
Oh, that?

322
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,973
It has a clip of Tae-o growing up.

323
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,268
It was made for another reason,

324
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,437
but I didn't know it would come in handy.

325
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,691
You must have been very busy.

326
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,195
It was more like chaotic.

327
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,905
You must have had...

328
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,407
only Tae-o on your mind.

329
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,996
Being unconditionally devoted
to a person...

330
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,457
isn't something common.

331
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,169
It's a special thing, Song-i.

332
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,652
What happened last night
still seems surreal.

333
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,238
Same here.

334
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,156
I think I have a cold.

335
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,076
Weren't you wearing your long johns?

336
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:28,373
Well, that's because...
I'm an actor, so...

337
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,418
I have to take good care of myself,
you know.

338
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,381
I'm really grateful that
you guys came yesterday.

339
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,759
If I'd been the only one there,

340
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,886
Tae-o wouldn't have met his mom.

341
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,558
You should be thanking Do-hyeon.

342
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,601
His remark played a decisive role.

343
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,856
You haven't heard from Tae-o yet?

344
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,151
No.

345
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,072
I should go. I'd better get changed.

346
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:02,824
All right.

347
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,076
Text me when you get home.

348
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,077
Okay.

349
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,881
As it's been about 20 years...

350
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:23,052
since Tae-o last saw his mom,
he'd need about two days to catch up.

351
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:26,222
If not, maybe a week? It'd be nice
if he spends more time with her.

352
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,391
He'll come back when it's time.

353
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,771
Why do you sound
like you don't want him to come back?

354
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,191
Well, that's not true.

355
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,986
Hold on. Am I the only one
who has butterflies in my stomach?

356
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,697
Who knows when we'll have another chance
to be alone like this?

357
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,161
You're so cute.

358
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:50,997
Hold on.

359
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,876
-Hey, is that Tae-o?
-No, I don't recognize the number.

360
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,003
Take it. Take the call.

361
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,297
Hello?

362
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,883
This is Choe Hun.
May I know who's calling?

363
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,426
Who is it?

364
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,223
Okay.

365
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:10,850
All right.

366
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,812
Please call me again then.

367
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,150
What did they say that's making you
wear that expression?

368
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,276
I got accepted.

369
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,402
What?

370
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,112
I got the part as Flash.

371
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,241
They said they'll send me my contract.

372
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,827
They want me to review it
before coming to see them.

373
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,036
Really?

374
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:32,997
Hun!

375
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,168
Congratulations!

376
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,920
I really worked hard for this.

377
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,881
You've been through so much.

378
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:54,811
Hey.

379
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,063
Why didn't you wait inside?

380
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,731
I just got here.

381
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,193
How are you feeling? You walked around
in the cold weather yesterday.

382
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,363
I'm not so delicate
that I'd catch a cold because of that.

383
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,408
Let's go somewhere warm today.

384
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,833
It feels like spring here.
It's really fascinating.

385
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,835
This place was on my list.

386
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,295
What list?

387
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,589
A list of places I want to go with you.

388
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,633
The list is quite long.

389
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,887
It's something everyone does
when they date for the first time.

390
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,431
You feel like you have to go
to a lot of places.

391
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,559
We haven't been dating for long,

392
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,729
but I think I've done
many things with you.

393
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,446
When it's finally spring,

394
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,698
I probably won't be in Seoul.

395
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,958
My dad and I will close the restaurant...

396
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,419
and move to Seosan.

397
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,880
I can't believe it.

398
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,425
Why are you telling me this now?

399
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,347
Does it have anything to do with me?

400
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,141
I guess you do know you've hurt me.

401
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,354
It's not because of you.

402
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:23,691
You knew that business wasn't so great.

403
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,822
I can't help but notice...

404
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,825
where your gaze truly lies.

405
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:39,540
I've had stronger feelings
for you than you have had for me.

406
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,543
I was okay with that.

407
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,672
I thought it was something
we could figure out together.

408
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:50,301
But I realized the depth of our feelings
isn't what's important.

409
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,845
It's the direction.

410
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,062
Before I met you,
I was certain about my life.

411
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,231
The things I should do...

412
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,442
and the path I should take
were all clear to me.

413
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,111
That is...

414
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,863
I thought they were.

415
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,993
It wasn't until I met you

416
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,246
that I realized I'd never
even given myself...

417
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,958
a chance to dream.

418
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,345
I've said this to you before.

419
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,931
Because of you...

420
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,269
my whole world is in chaos.

421
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,898
Loving someone has taught me...

422
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:51,237
that I'm a person full of uncertainties
and that I'm not good with emotions.

423
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,450
I realized how monotonous
my life has been.

424
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,455
I've realized and learned...

425
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,291
a lot of things.

426
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,086
It was you...

427
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,883
who shook my world.

428
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,513
Thank you, Song-i.

429
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,707
I'm back!

430
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,375
Tae-o!

431
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:47,919
You punk!

432
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,963
You said you'd be back in a day.
You got us worried.

433
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,299
I'm sorry. It just worked out that way.

434
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:54,967
Is everything all right now?

435
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,512
Yes, I'll tell you about it later.

436
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,892
Just be your normal selves.
It's better that way.

437
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,603
Fine.
You've been through a lot, my friend.

438
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,815
By the way, have you called Song-i yet?

439
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,274
I will soon.

440
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,861
I need to go somewhere before I do that.

441
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,368
I knew you would find out sooner or later.

442
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,454
But I didn't expect it to be this soon.

443
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,250
You probably won't understand...

444
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,212
why we took such drastic measures.
But I'll try to explain.

445
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:36,008
Your mom's family
would've ruined your life.

446
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,471
It was more your mom's decision.

447
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,182
Mom told me everything...

448
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,895
about what happened.

449
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,525
I know that such a decision
was made for my own good.

450
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,654
It's still hard for me to understand,

451
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,991
but I've decided to accept it.

452
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,579
You two made the best possible choice.

453
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,208
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been
who I am now.

454
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:14,130
I told Mom the same thing.

455
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:22,096
Was it so easy for you to call her "mom"
when it was your first time seeing her?

456
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,186
I'm sorry.

457
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:29,770
I...

458
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,858
I'm sorry that I've never
called you "mom."

459
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,779
Don't say that. I didn't mention it
to hear your apology.

460
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,117
I'm planning...

461
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,078
on keeping in touch with Mom.

462
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,291
I think I have that right
now that I'm a grown-up.

463
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,169
I came here to tell you that.

464
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:57,590
And...

465
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,845
I'm sure that both of you must have had...

466
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,890
a difficult time regarding this issue.

467
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,436
You can let it go now.

468
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,277
I'll go and fix us some drinks.

469
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,505
You held up well.

470
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,151
Peekaboo!

471
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,654
Look at Mommy. Look at me.

472
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,656
Yes, that's it.

473
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,533
Are you going to grow
as tall as a giraffe?

474
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,784
Giraffes are super tall!

475
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,916
Did you see that? That was me.
That was Yun Tae-o right there.

476
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,211
Hi, my name is Yun Tae-o
and I'm in my freshman year.

477
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,256
Today's the day of
my college entrance ceremony.

478
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,386
I talked with Dad.

479
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,764
Everything went well, so don't worry.

480
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,269
Stop filming! I need to finish it
before Dad comes back.

481
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,572
Tae-o!

482
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,290
What happened? When did you get back?

483
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,000
Today. Not too long ago.

484
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,961
Why didn't you call?
I told you to call on your way back.

485
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,130
I wanted to give you a surprise.

486
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,632
-What?
-It looks like I've succeeded.

487
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,469
I wanted to see
the surprised look on your face.

488
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,386
You're unbelievable.

489
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,767
Did you get to talk a lot with your mom?

490
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,771
Well...

491
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,899
I think so, in a way.

492
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,318
Or maybe I didn't.

493
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,112
That's such a vague answer.

494
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:29,116
It's too cold to be giving you
the details out here. Let's go somewhere.

495
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,535
Fine. I'm all ears.

496
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:42,088
I was surprised at how easy it was
for me to call her "mom."

497
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,716
Maybe it's because we're family after all.
I find it fascinating.

498
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,052
Were you at your mom's the whole time?

499
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,136
Yes.

500
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,431
We didn't talk that much, though.

501
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,600
We went on walks,

502
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,977
and Mom showed me around.

503
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,355
I also stuffed myself with food.

504
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,207
-Song-i.
-Yes?

505
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:22,711
There's a question that's been lingering
in my head for a long time.

506
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,508
I didn't even know
it was a question at first.

507
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,600
I can't live without you.

508
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,521
Without you,

509
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,982
whether it be a month or a day,

510
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,276
the time I spend
becomes meaningless to me.

511
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,364
That's the conclusion I've reached.

512
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,909
I'm sure you don't understand
what I'm talking about.

513
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,538
I do understand.

514
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,627
You and I have lived the same lives.

515
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,964
And we still do.

516
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,593
The feelings you have about us

517
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,179
are pretty much mutual.

518
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:17,933
I want to say the same thing
that you've just said.

519
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,897
I get the feeling that...

520
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,691
this is how our relationship
will always be.

521
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,458
