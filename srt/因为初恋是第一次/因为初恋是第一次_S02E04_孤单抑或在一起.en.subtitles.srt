1
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:16,558
TAE-O, SONG-I

2
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,812
REST AREA

3
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,535
You can still head back.

4
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,584
I wouldn't have come
if I was just going to head back.

5
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,294
-Seriously?
-Hey.

6
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,588
You are going to look for your mom

7
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:50,467
at a place three hours away from home
where you have no ties.

8
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,260
How could I not come with you?

9
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,221
Have you told Se-hyeon?

10
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:00,518
Did you tell her you've suddenly ended up
coming to Jeonju with me?

11
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,315
I will.

12
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,733
Just go back.

13
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,819
I don't want to complicate things again.

14
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,239
I'm not going back,

15
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,702
so stop wasting our time arguing
and just let me tag along.

16
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,455
I'm sure I'll come in handy.

17
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,087
Shall I get us something?

18
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,005
How about something warm?

19
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,507
I don't want anything.

20
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,427
If you're not hungry, let me at least
get you a drink. Wait here.

21
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,380
Hey, Se-hyeon.

22
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,114
SONG-I

23
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,661
Hi, Song-i.

24
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,205
How's the bus ride?

25
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,584
It's good. I'm at the rest area.

26
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,961
I'm sorry for letting you go alone.

27
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,880
Will you be okay by yourself?

28
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,215
Do-hyeon.

29
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,801
I'm not going there alone.

30
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,471
Really? Who's there with you?

31
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,274
It's Tae-o, right?

32
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,069
Yes.

33
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,324
I guess he overheard me talking to Yu-rim.

34
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,242
-So...
-So Tae-o...

35
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,661
came running.

36
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,754
Come back.

37
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,717
I don't care whether you take a cab
or a bus. Just come back to Seoul.

38
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,677
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,554
Tae-o.

40
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,682
Come back now or we're done.

41
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,645
I'm done with your apologies.
I'll really end it.

42
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,693
I...

43
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,946
have to go.

44
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,951
I have to do this.

45
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,454
When we first met, you left early
because of what happened to Song-i.

46
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:12,335
Why does an urgent matter
always come up for you two?

47
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,087
Se-hyeon, please.

48
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,005
You always make excuses.

49
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,759
The situation isn't the issue though.

50
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,636
It's your feelings.

51
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,554
Don't you get it?

52
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,536
Tae-o...

53
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,746
Is he there?

54
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,297
Yes.

55
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,215
Put him on.

56
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,262
It's Do-hyeon.

57
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,764
Right.

58
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,600
Hold on.

59
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,561
It's me.

60
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,859
I hear you're with her.

61
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:19,819
I am.

62
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,781
She...

63
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,784
may be putting on a brave face now,

64
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,579
but she'll crumble once she sees her mom.

65
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,623
Someone should be by her side.

66
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,462
Right.

67
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,380
Keep her company then.

68
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,426
How come you weren't able to come?

69
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,391
Sure, I'll keep her company.

70
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,679
What did he say?

71
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,350
He wished you a safe trip.

72
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,314
Let's go. The bus will leave soon.

73
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,401
It feels like...

74
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,112
everything has become a mess.

75
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,124
Song-i,

76
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,960
don't think about anything else...

77
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,088
and just think about what you want.

78
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,509
Your mom...

79
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,053
Do you want to see her?

80
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,938
Then I'll think about only one thing too:

81
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,233
You making peace with your mom

82
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,485
and returning safely back to Seoul.

83
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,572
That's really all I want.

84
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,454
What will you do?

85
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,330
Will you go?

86
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,876
Let's go.

87
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:55,016
THE MEANING OF BEING WITH SOMEONE

88
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,449
Hello.

89
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,367
Yes, hello.

90
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,454
Haven't I seen you before?
Do you live around here?

91
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,206
Yes, I live in the neighborhood.

92
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,292
Anyway, what is this place?

93
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,253
You were selling things
the last time I was here,

94
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,880
but today people are knitting.

95
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,426
To put it simply, it's a hobby workshop.

96
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,220
Hold on a second.

97
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,854
Take a look if you're interested.

98
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,273
Sure.

99
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,777
There will be a writing workshop
in the evening.

100
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,695
You're welcome to stop by if you'd like.

101
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:51,864
Sure.

102
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,409
CANDLE MAKING,
MAKING ORGANIC SKIN CARE PRODUCTS

103
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,872
LOOKING FOR THE 5TH FLASH

104
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,457
THE ADVENTURE OF FLASH
OPEN AUDITION

105
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,085
It's even an off-season for auditions.

106
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,966
This still seems like the best one though.

107
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,474
Why did you leave without telling me?

108
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,268
You should've asked me
to buy the groceries.

109
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,272
What's that?

110
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,566
Have you heard of a social gathering?

111
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,360
A social what?

112
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,446
It's a gathering where people who have
the same hobbies meet up regularly.

113
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,741
Remember the shop where
you bought this hairpin for me?

114
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,076
-They hold workshops.
-Right.

115
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,787
I'm going to check it out tonight.

116
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,247
Really? Why?

117
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,417
I walked by the place and I got curious.

118
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,752
I'd like to meet new people too.

119
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,255
-I'm going too.
-You too?

120
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,008
They'll all be strangers.
What if you come across weirdos?

121
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,884
Of course I should come with you.

122
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,511
All right.

123
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,599
It's a writing club though. Are you sure?

124
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,270
A writing club?

125
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,148
That involves using my brain then.

126
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,026
Damn it.

127
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:48,981
JEONJU RETRO BAKERY

128
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,984
1004-10 GYO-DONG

129
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,863
It's in Gyo-dong.

130
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,907
That's quite far from here.

131
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,993
Do you have the address?
Let's take a cab. It won't take long.

132
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,536
Let's just take the bus.

133
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,664
Then it'll take more time.

134
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,541
We're almost there anyway.

135
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,754
I'd just rather take my time.

136
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,260
All right.
Then let's look for the bus station.

137
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,567
You know,

138
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,819
even if I...

139
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,532
yell and argue with my mom,

140
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,077
just let me be.

141
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,789
All right.

142
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:34,462
Even if I cuss at her
and make a huge fuss,

143
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,547
don't stop me.

144
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,716
I got it.

145
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,509
Also, don't be right next to me.

146
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,682
Still, don't be too far away either.

147
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,811
Be close by, so that when I need you,

148
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,605
you can come running.

149
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,817
You can be really difficult sometimes.

150
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,863
Fine, I'll do as you wish.

151
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,204
Do you think...

152
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,877
my mom will come to Seoul with me
if I ask her?

153
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,131
It may be hard for her to do so
right away,

154
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,258
but I'm sure she'll give it a try.

155
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,513
I'm scared.

156
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,352
What if she tells me
not to look for her...

157
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,605
like the last time I called her?

158
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,504
A NIGHT TO WRITE ABOUT MYSELF

159
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:03,926
Ga-rin.

160
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,555
I had no idea that it'd be this posh.

161
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,473
Be quiet.

162
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,855
Hello.

163
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:20,860
Welcome to the third meeting
of A Night to Write about Myself.

164
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,905
Since we have newcomers,

165
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,157
why don't we face each other
and say hello?

166
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,701
-Hello.
-Hello.

167
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,744
Hello, everyone.

168
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,164
At this workshop, you don't have
to reveal any personal information,

169
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,624
such as age or occupation.

170
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,586
Instead, on the piece
of paper in front of you,

171
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,882
you will write honestly
about you and your life.

172
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,637
You may read any of the books in the back.
Please start whenever you're ready.

173
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,764
Sure.

174
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,876
I AM

175
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,880
A MUSICAL

176
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:31,055
I AM A MUSICAL THEATER ACTOR

177
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,614
All right, let's go.

178
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,824
It was another great day today.

179
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,954
Goodness.

180
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,593
What will you do?

181
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,444
Here you go.

182
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,779
-Thank you.
-Put it in here.

183
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:29,863
Sure.

184
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,658
Gosh, it's cold.

185
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,330
-Jeez.
-Maybe we should've bought that too.

186
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,498
Didn't we already buy it?

187
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,291
-Let's take a look.
-Hold on.

188
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,377
Oh, we did get some.

189
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,028
What are you going to do now?

190
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,079
Hey, what are you doing?

191
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,831
Song-i!

192
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,250
I told you not to stop me.

193
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,881
Hey!

194
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,135
What the hell? Who on earth...

195
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:34,970
Wait...

196
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,351
Song-i.

197
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,276
Song-i?

198
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:53,906
Song-i.

199
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,158
How did you...

200
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,036
Tae-o, you too.

201
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,916
Look, Song-i.

202
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,543
I...

203
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,090
I...

204
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,052
I was going to call you, Song-i.

205
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,015
Song-i!

206
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,226
Song-i!

207
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:24,853
Song-i!

208
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,779
Song-i, my gosh!

209
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:34,822
Song-i!

210
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:35,989
Song-i, are you all right?

211
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:36,907
Let go of me!

212
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,118
Let me see if you're okay first!

213
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,328
Why? It's not like you even care!

214
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,830
Song-i.

215
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,916
Whether I'm alive or sick,

216
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,503
how my school life is
or if I'm eating well,

217
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,963
you don't care about any of that.

218
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,674
Why?

219
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,551
Is this your conscience speaking?

220
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,970
Or is it because of that man?

221
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,891
You don't want him to think
you're a bad mother, is that it?

222
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,853
I'm sorry.

223
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,480
I'm sorry about everything, Song-i.

224
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,606
I don't want your apology.

225
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,442
-Song-i, I'm sorry.
-I don't want to hear it!

226
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,362
-Song-i, I'm sorry.
-I don't want to hear any of it!

227
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,866
I don't want to hear it. Just stop. Stop!

228
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,868
Stop!

229
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,922
I'm sorry for not telling you about him.

230
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,136
We went to elementary school together.

231
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,223
We got in touch again

232
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,100
after you started college.

233
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,940
He'd been alone since
his wife passed away ten years ago.

234
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,987
We only started as friends who
talked about hardships and loneliness,

235
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,368
but one thing led to another and...

236
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,126
I didn't know how to tell you.

237
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,796
To you,

238
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,633
I'm just a mom and not a woman.

239
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,927
Are you sure you're even a mom?

240
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,974
I thought you wouldn't understand.

241
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,767
I don't.

242
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:13,981
Right.

243
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:18,610
Hearing you say that
was what I was afraid of the most.

244
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,155
That's how I've always been.

245
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,742
I was a coward who liked to run and hide.

246
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,579
So after your father passed away,

247
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,748
I did everything I could

248
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,961
to make a life for us,
but nothing worked out.

249
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,967
I couldn't think straight after that.

250
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,429
All I wanted to do was to run away.

251
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,474
Is that why you left?

252
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,102
You left your only daughter behind.

253
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,645
Yes.

254
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,441
I ran away without even looking back.

255
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,448
This lousy human being is your mom.

256
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,575
I'm weak,

257
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,535
selfish,

258
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,662
and irresponsible.

259
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,375
I'm...

260
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,214
I'm sorry...

261
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,552
that I'm nothing but a lousy human being.

262
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,097
I'm sorry that this is who I am.

263
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,183
I'm so sorry, Song-i.

264
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:58,126
Wait, are you already
in a group chat with those people?

265
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,878
Yes, it's fascinating

266
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,215
to have friends other than you guys.

267
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,342
Friends, my ass.

268
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,719
You barely know them.
You only met them today.

269
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,721
We were strangers at first too.

270
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,934
Seeing each other often
will bring us closer.

271
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,061
This isn't like you.

272
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,147
You weren't like yourself either
earlier today.

273
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:22,067
You were quiet and lost in your thoughts.

274
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,777
As if.

275
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,240
I couldn't manage to write
a single line about myself.

276
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,450
-Why not?
-Because I'm nothing right now.

277
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,203
I'm neither a student nor an actor.

278
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,373
I'm too embarrassed
to call myself an aspiring actor now.

279
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:41,002
I've never been
this discouraged before in my life.

280
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,712
Why would you say that?

281
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,883
Well,
it's true that you did something stupid,

282
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,220
but apart from that,
I also think you're very brave.

283
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,225
Jeez.

284
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,602
Actually...

285
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,356
there's something
I still haven't told you.

286
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,277
Is it something
I have to be nervous about?

287
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,030
It's a memory we both
probably want to forget...

288
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,577
but it's about the reward.

289
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,248
They already wired it to my account.

290
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,541
What?

291
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,377
Still, I withdrew all of it in cash.

292
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,004
I'll give it to you at home.

293
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,755
Just so you know,

294
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,966
I never was going to keep the money.

295
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,677
My actions were so pathetic
that I couldn't bring myself

296
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,221
to confess
the two most stupid things I did in a row.

297
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,974
Well, now you know.

298
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,601
The man next to you...

299
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:41,730
is even lousier than you imagined. Shoot.

300
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,982
I'm sick of even getting mad at you.

301
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,367
It's exactly what my dad said to me.

302
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,830
I've been thinking lately.

303
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,126
If I had a son like me,

304
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,629
I would've beaten him up too.

305
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,382
Maybe I should just go home

306
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,135
and quit trying to become a musical actor.

307
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,641
I should've known better.

308
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,768
I was wrong to even try.

309
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,230
I'm broke and I have no talent.

310
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,273
What can I do on my own?

311
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,443
My parents were right.

312
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,404
I should've listened to them.

313
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,157
An actor, my ass.

314
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,183
What was that?

315
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,103
I don't know.

316
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,646
I think you should.

317
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:10,360
Is this the first time a girl hugged you?

318
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:11,945
Yes...

319
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,364
No!

320
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,784
Of course not. Don't be silly.

321
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,869
I'm popular, remember?
Didn't you know that?

322
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,830
There's no way...

323
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,624
I see.

324
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,962
What about you?

325
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,256
Is it your first time...

326
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,967
hugging a guy?

327
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,136
Yes.

328
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,105
I just wanted to give you a hug.

329
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,357
That's it.

330
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,610
It didn't mean anything.

331
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,076
Hey, wait for me.

332
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,704
That was a lie, wasn't it?

333
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,873
-Right?
-You're wrong!

334
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,666
-I know you're lying.
-No, I'm not!

335
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:32,067
You came all the way here.
At least stay the night.

336
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,985
Come with me, okay?

337
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,403
No, I'm fine.

338
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,072
I won't make you feel uncomfortable.

339
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,115
If you want,

340
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,203
I'll tell my friend
to stay elsewhere tonight.

341
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,958
I don't think I'm ready to see...

342
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,836
your life with him.

343
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,926
I know you're okay, so I'm good.

344
00:27:58,927 --> 00:27:59,886
I'll get going.

345
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,940
Don't worry too much.

346
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,317
I'll talk to her and make her call you.

347
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,029
I'm ashamed to even look at you.

348
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,283
I'm sorry for not being able
to walk you home.

349
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,414
It's okay. Just hurry and go to Song-i.
We don't want her to get lost.

350
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,291
Sure thing. I'll call you.

351
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:31,793
Sure.

352
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,176
The last bus left?

353
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:41,803
Already?

354
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,807
What about a bus headed to Gangbyeon?

355
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,728
Which is the closest terminal
to Seoul that...

356
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,063
Hello?

357
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,608
Damn it.

358
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:04,117
The last bus for Seoul has already left.
What should we do?

359
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,039
Hey, Song-i. You can't lie down here.

360
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,166
Get up.

361
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,792
Song-i!

362
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,465
-Are you sure there's only one room left?
-Yes.

363
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,759
I know you're lying.

364
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,303
How can you only have one vacant room
in this whole building?

365
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,804
I'm not lying.

366
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:29,267
It's been the season
for couples these days.

367
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,442
We're not a couple.

368
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,360
We're just friends.

369
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,823
There's no need to put on this show.

370
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:48,203
Don't you know that giving you two rooms
means twice the money for me?

371
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,788
Why would I lie?

372
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,372
Here!

373
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,835
Damn it.

374
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,270
The motel owner swears on his soul

375
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,773
that he only has one room left.

376
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,568
I can sleep out in the hallway if...

377
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:24,989
Hey.

378
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,741
Take your key with you.

379
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,349
It's cold out in the hallway.

380
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,727
Just sleep on the couch.

381
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,314
You don't have to mind me.

382
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:08,575
DEOKSU MOTEL

383
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,341
Are you all right?

384
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,719
You know what I hate the most?

385
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,682
Even in this shitty situation...

386
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,146
I'm still glad to have found my mom.

387
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,401
She's not in any trouble...

388
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,487
and she seems to be in good health too.

389
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,532
I feel relieved.

390
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,912
And because of that,

391
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,289
I'm even more annoyed.

392
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,791
Why can't I be meaner?

393
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,962
You're heartless enough.

394
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,381
You even broke someone else's window.

395
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,677
Was I too harsh?

396
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,347
I thought you were cool.

397
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,183
You had a right to do that
since you came all this way.

398
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,525
Still,

399
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,488
you're lucky to have a mom
you can look for.

400
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,117
No matter how lousy that mother is...

401
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,746
it's better than not having one at all.

402
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,875
To have someone
you can love unconditionally...

403
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,003
brings you a lot of comfort
when you need it.

404
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,840
How can that bring comfort?

405
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,134
It can.

406
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:56,057
We all need at least one person
we can love unconditionally,

407
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,395
that makes us feel
connected to this world.

408
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,649
Thank you for being there for me today.

409
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,532
I've always been there for you.

410
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,091
The phone is turned off.

411
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,093
Please leave a message...

412
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,848
I just got off the bus,
and I'm on my way to the store.

413
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,352
TAE-O

414
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:48,401
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the beep.

415
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,122
Let's go and find your mom.

416
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,258
-Song-i, I'm sorry.
-I don't want to hear any of it!

417
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,885
Just stop. Stop!

418
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,310
You're right.

419
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,313
You've always been there for me.

420
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,629
Let's go in.

421
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,216
Hold on. Over there.

422
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:04,412
There's marinated meat at the bottom,
so don't shake the bag.

423
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,998
You don't want it to spill.

424
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,879
How did you know I'd come back?

425
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,048
You have Tae-o.

426
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:17,842
I knew he'd bring you back.

427
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,100
Where did you sleep last night?

428
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,188
We stayed at a motel nearby.

429
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:31,814
Hey!

430
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,694
Well, the rooms...

431
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:40,406
We slept in separate rooms,
so there is no need to worry.

432
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,041
When are you heading back?

433
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,920
I called the bus terminal and they said
there is a bus that is leaving at eight.

434
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,297
We can stay here until then.

435
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:57,757
Right.

436
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,218
You should get going.

437
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,677
I'm sure you have school too.

438
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,534
That man...

439
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,578
Your mom's boyfriend.

440
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,749
He seemed nice.

441
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,252
Even con artists look decent
on the outside.

442
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,963
He didn't seem like one.

443
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,548
He's nothing compared to my dad.

444
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,012
Of course.

445
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,766
No one in this world
is as good as your dad.

446
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,499
Don't bother. I don't need it.

447
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,043
Just keep it on.

448
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:28,806
Jeez.

449
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,353
My mom...

450
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,480
She'll stay there, won't she?

451
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,193
Why do you think that?

452
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:44,697
She seemed happy there, that's why.

453
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:50,202
No parent in this world lives happily
after abandoning their child.

454
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,164
Stop thinking that way

455
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,833
and just sleep
for the remainder of the ride.

456
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,503
Gosh, I am so tired.

457
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,213
As if.

458
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,424
You slept like a baby last night.

459
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,259
No, I didn't.

460
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,886
Yes, you did.

461
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,513
I didn't get any sleep last night.

462
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:12,975
Just get some sleep.

463
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,930
JEONJU BUS TERMINAL

464
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,990
We have about ten minutes left.

465
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,242
Do you want to use the restroom?

466
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:54,827
I'm good.

467
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,232
Do-hyeon?

468
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,422
You're still here.

469
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:49,965
I'm glad.

470
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,592
What's going on?

471
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,135
When did you get here?

472
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,762
Just a while ago.

473
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:59,141
I felt bad for not being able
to go with you.

474
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:06,065
Thank you for going with her.

475
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:07,900
I felt less worried.

476
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,402
Right.

477
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,906
Well, we met her mom.

478
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,451
You must've been worried
since you couldn't reach me.

479
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,787
I'm sorry, but my phone--

480
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,746
It's all right.

481
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,207
I'm here now, so it's okay.

482
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,532
What happened to your phone?

483
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,535
Oh, right.

484
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,787
It broke.

485
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,913
How?

486
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,123
Well...

487
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,167
I threw a tantrum...

488
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,336
after seeing my mom.

489
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,466
What about your hand?

490
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,763
There's a story behind this too.

491
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,144
I guess many things happened...

492
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,231
but I don't know about any of them.

493
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,324
How are things at home?
Is everything okay now?

494
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,037
No.

495
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,498
It's a mess.

496
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,792
Everything is a mess.

497
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,411
Come on. I'll take you to Yu-rim's.

498
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:25,954
Sure.

499
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,247
We'll get going.

500
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,375
I'm coming too.

501
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,044
We're going in the same direction anyway.

502
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,214
You've done enough.

503
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,215
What?

504
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,385
You accompanied her here.

505
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,640
I'll take it from here.

506
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,771
We'll get going. See you.

507
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,553
STORE MANAGER

508
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,474
I'll get going then.

509
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,275
I'm sorry...

510
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:41,029
for making you come all the way down there
so early in the morning.

511
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:44,908
Can't you...

512
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,246
just thank me for coming
all the way down there?

513
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,125
Why do we always apologize to each other?

514
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,920
I was in no condition to call you.

515
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,630
But you could have!

516
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,341
You just didn't make the effort.

517
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,223
It didn't cross my mind.

518
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,895
Imagining it and facing the truth
were two different things.

519
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,316
My mom and that man
looked like a married couple.

520
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,026
They...

521
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,570
looked so happy.

522
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:27,242
I was so angry
that I couldn't think of anything else.

523
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,663
It was a tough day for me too.

524
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,215
You should just get going.

525
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,051
Say what's on your mind.

526
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,427
It's frustrating...

527
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,555
to just part like this.

528
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,558
You're frustrated?

529
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,479
I understand if you're upset or hurt.

530
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,273
I was just as upset.

531
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,777
Why didn't I go with you that day?

532
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,364
The one who's frustrated is me.

533
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,241
My girlfriend's phone was turned off

534
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,034
and I couldn't reach Tae-o either.

535
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,703
I don't even know
where you two spent the night,

536
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,330
but like a complete idiot...

537
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,584
I couldn't even ask if anything happened.

538
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,254
That's how it feels to be frustrated.

539
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,892
I'm sorry I yelled.

540
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:36,728
Do-hyeon...

541
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,273
It's hard for me to look at you right now.

542
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,734
Let's talk again later.

543
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,172
Seriously, where were you last night?
You didn't even call.

544
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,674
Where have you been?

545
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,585
That night,

546
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,671
I was happy to have kept Song-i company.

547
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,008
But it also hurt to be with her too.

548
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:05,067
Not being able to accompany her
drove me crazy.

549
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,027
I knew...

550
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,322
I'd regret that moment for years to come.

551
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,373
Together.

552
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,376
Being together with someone.

553
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:06,962
That night,

554
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:11,258
I realized that there's something

555
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,011
that I'd never be able to forget.

556
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,181
I will never forget the times
we've shared.

557
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,072
