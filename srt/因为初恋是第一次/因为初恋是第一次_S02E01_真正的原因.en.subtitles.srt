1
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,118
Let's go on a date, Song-i.

2
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,953
I'll come pick you up.

3
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,497
Cool. I'm fine with any place.

4
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,333
Who have you been texting so often lately?

5
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,463
Who do you think it is?

6
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,006
Are you seeing someone?

7
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,551
-Yes.
-What? Since when?

8
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,720
Who is he? Is he from our school?

9
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,847
I'm here. Meet me outside.

10
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:57,849
Already?

11
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,444
I'll be down soon.

12
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,205
I have to go. My boyfriend is here.

13
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,877
-Boyfriend?
-Boyfriend?

14
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,510
Gosh.

15
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,887
Song-i really has a boyfriend?

16
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,138
Holy cow!

17
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,183
BANG LP RECORDS

18
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,758
Two egg buns, please.

19
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,597
Here you go.

20
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,268
Thank you.

21
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,477
Let's try it.

22
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,069
It's good.

23
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,075
When should we tell Tae-o
that we're going out?

24
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,744
Right.

25
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,330
It's kind of awkward now
because we missed our timing.

26
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,749
But keeping it a secret is fun.

27
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,141
Gosh, you scared me.

28
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,852
What are you doing?

29
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,355
Were you waiting for me?

30
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,441
Why would I be waiting for you?

31
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,987
Is the owner of this house not allowed
to stand in his own front yard?

32
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,407
When did I say that?
Why are you always so grouchy at night?

33
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,408
Get out of my way.

34
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,252
Where have you been until this hour?

35
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,671
I was...

36
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,466
at school!

37
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:19,676
I had...

38
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,221
to work on my project. That's it.

39
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:26,849
Aren't you going to bed?

40
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,561
I'll go to bed when I want to.

41
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,063
Okay.

42
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,483
I'll head in first, then.

43
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,261
Right.

44
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:07,515
A man and a woman can fall in love
if they see each other often.

45
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,854
I should be relieved that
it's Do-hyeon and not some jerk.

46
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,190
Picturing the two of them together...

47
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,830
What's wrong with me?

48
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:34,917
THE REAL REASON

49
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,923
Okay. I'll meet you at the library
after class.

50
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,508
I'll call you.

51
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,015
What is this doing here?

52
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,351
Han Song-i!

53
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,730
This is yours, isn't it?

54
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,369
Is it?

55
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,329
Isn't it obvious?

56
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,873
Didn't I tell you to clean up
after using the bathroom?

57
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,876
Do you know how unpleasant it is
to find this in the bathtub?

58
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,170
-Ga-rin has long hair too.
-Song-i.

59
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:23,091
I've known you for 20 years.
I can tell this is yours.

60
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,259
Just get rid of this right now.

61
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,348
Goodness...

62
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,683
Gosh.

63
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,105
Does he think he's a hair expert
or something?

64
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,401
Song-i!

65
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,321
I almost tripped and fell because of this.

66
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,827
I'm sure I left it on the rooftop,
but I found it there this morning.

67
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,747
Didn't you say this is your house?
You should take care of your own stuff.

68
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,915
Did you put it there?

69
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,043
No.

70
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,921
What's with that face?

71
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,673
Song-i.

72
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,341
I've known you for 20 years.

73
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,885
You don't think
that I'm lying to you, do you?

74
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,470
It's not that.

75
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,722
It's just weird that the tent is here.

76
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,976
It should be on the rooftop.

77
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:15,893
I don't care!

78
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,438
Take this up to the attic, now.

79
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,405
What's his problem?
There isn't even much space up there.

80
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,454
That was really immature.

81
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,165
I'm really not this petty.

82
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,418
Tae-o, you're much better than this.

83
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,587
You're tolerant, understanding,
and you know

84
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,672
how to approach someone
in an honest manner.

85
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,259
Sounds like someone really loves himself.

86
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,844
You scared me.

87
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,345
What are you doing?

88
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,390
What do you think I am doing?
I'm looking for auditions.

89
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,896
I can't believe
I'm going through this all over again.

90
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,192
You should rest
until you clear your head a little.

91
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,111
Being hasty can make things worse.

92
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,781
Hey. Do you think my face is the problem?

93
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,576
-You just realized that?
-I thought so.

94
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,289
My handsome face doesn't exactly fit
with the current trend.

95
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,083
Should I get a nose job?

96
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,586
Stop talking nonsense and get out.

97
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,796
I'm stressed out as it is.

98
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,425
You've been in a bad mood
ever since we got back from Gangneung.

99
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,552
Don't you ever mention Gangneung again.

100
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,054
Get out!

101
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,194
Can't he take it to the attic himself?

102
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,934
HOME-COOKED MEALS FOR TAE-O!
A NUTRITIOUS AND LOW-SODIUM DIET!

103
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,185
SAUCE

104
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,064
He still has this.

105
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,947
WALNUTS WITH ALMONDS AND ANCHOVIES
TO HELP TAE-O GET SMART!

106
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,580
WATERMELONS, TAE-O'S FAVORITE!

107
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,472
How are you doing?

108
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,600
Is the acting thing going well?

109
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,476
Call me.

110
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,027
I'm staying at Tae-o's and I'm doing well.

111
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,076
Whatever happens, happens.

112
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,061
MISSING PERSON
NAME: O GA-RIN, AGE: 23

113
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:46,896
Dear God,

114
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,441
please do not lead me into temptation.

115
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,735
REWARD: 10 MILLION WON

116
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,699
Okay.

117
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,453
I should throw this away
so that I don't become tempted by it.

118
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:05,956
Holy shit!

119
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,709
I'm sorry.

120
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,046
Did I scare you?

121
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,342
You could have knocked. Why were you
just standing there like that?

122
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:20,888
I just...

123
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,102
What?

124
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,897
Do you have something to say to me?

125
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,902
No, never mind.

126
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,378
Did you tell everyone else

127
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,630
that I accidentally told you about it?

128
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,633
So, you do know that
what you guys did was wrong.

129
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,262
The truth is,
Tae-o was against it the whole time,

130
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,638
but we insisted--

131
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,098
I don't want to know.

132
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,269
For the time being,

133
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,688
let's keep it to ourselves.

134
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,273
Why?

135
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,650
Receiving an apology is useless...

136
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,738
when I'm in this mood.

137
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,999
I'm so stupid.

138
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,668
Why in the world did I say that?

139
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,340
Tae-o's going to be furious
when he finds out.

140
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,052
I can't believe myself!

141
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,763
Oh, gosh.

142
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,516
What am I going to do?

143
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,027
This place is amazing.

144
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,905
You showed me the best view on campus too.

145
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,449
-I'm just returning the favor.
-There is no need for that.

146
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,701
You don't have to return
the favor for everything I do.

147
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,119
Maybe you're right.

148
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,580
It's my favorite view of the city.

149
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,832
The hanok and the buildings

150
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,502
built from different eras
are standing together harmoniously.

151
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,004
You don't get to see such a view
easily in Seoul.

152
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,714
You're right.

153
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,508
It's wonderful.

154
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,641
We should get something to eat.

155
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,811
This place is expensive.
Let's go somewhere else.

156
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,020
That's what I always do.

157
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,690
Let's just eat here. It's on me.

158
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,320
Wow, it's beautiful.

159
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,657
Thank you.

160
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,417
This is really good.

161
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,461
Eating this makes me want to
make a lot of money.

162
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,636
I think that when I'm with you...

163
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,013
What?

164
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:09,932
Never mind.

165
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,142
Architects don't earn much, right?

166
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,353
That's how it is.

167
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,355
You work overtime
even when you're employed.

168
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:21,193
According to the seniors who've graduated,
it's the same as being a student.

169
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,363
You're talented enough
to find a job at a big company.

170
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,283
If you think about the salary,
wouldn't that be a better option?

171
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,451
True.

172
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,331
But I promised my dad
that I'd become an architect.

173
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,125
I can't get out of it now, can I?

174
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,672
You said your dad built the house
you used to live in, right?

175
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,840
Yes.

176
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,508
I saw it on the day we first met.

177
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,761
I liked it. It was nice and cozy.

178
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,769
I'll buy that house back for you
when I make a lot of money.

179
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,981
You're going to have to make a fortune.

180
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,149
I will, for you.

181
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,483
For me?

182
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,528
Well, I...

183
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,781
It's just wishful thinking.

184
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,301
I'm not sure...

185
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,970
if this is an appropriate place
to kiss you.

186
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,597
What?

187
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,018
Hey, don't get the wrong idea.

188
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,521
Wasn't it intentional?

189
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,231
Of course it wasn't.

190
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,399
Are you sure?

191
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,499
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached...

192
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,546
Hey, you're home. I didn't see your bike
outside so I thought you left.

193
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,216
I sent it for a tune-up.

194
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,635
Why?
Does your girlfriend not like the design?

195
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,347
I think it's me that she doesn't like.

196
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,649
I don't think she's mad at me or anything.

197
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,652
She replies whenever I text her.

198
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,487
But...

199
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,865
for some reason,
it feels like she's keeping her distance.

200
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,993
She doesn't pick up when I call her.

201
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,165
Did I do something wrong
when we went to Gangneung?

202
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,669
She's been acting odd
since we got back from the trip.

203
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,052
LET'S GO ON A TRIP TOO. I'LL TAKE CARE OF
THE PLANE TICKETS AND THE HOTEL.

204
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:55,681
Tae-o.

205
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,726
Yes?

206
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,270
If you found out that...

207
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,564
the person you care for lied to you,

208
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,941
it would hurt, wouldn't it?

209
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,740
Of course.

210
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,159
I'm sure it would.

211
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,328
It would be a huge blow
for narcissists like you.

212
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:20,748
What?

213
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,876
Song-i.

214
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,046
Emotional scars deepen

215
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,007
depending on how long the lie stays a lie.

216
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:35,179
Plus, there's nothing more hurtful
than finding out the truth

217
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,097
through other people.

218
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,726
Confessions...

219
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,690
must come from the person
who's been lying.

220
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,156
We're done. I have to be
at a construction site tomorrow.

221
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,492
Hey, wait.
Don't you have anything to say to me?

222
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,536
What? Say what?

223
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,497
Wow, you're unbelievable.

224
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,084
Hey, you know what?

225
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,878
Clean all this up before you go.

226
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,344
Is he that upset
over his relationship problems?

227
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,954
This is so embarrassing.

228
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,956
It will be humiliating

229
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,209
if I run into someone I know.
I'd better get out of here quickly.

230
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,306
DREAM SCHOOL SCORE

231
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,308
DREAM SCHOOL SCRIPT

232
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,687
Choe Hun?

233
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,942
Oh, hey.

234
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,408
What's this?

235
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,912
There's a get-together today

236
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,123
at a tripe restaurant
near our school after work.

237
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,460
I'll pass. I don't feel so good.
Maybe it's because I had beer yesterday.

238
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,047
Hey.

239
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,507
Isn't that Se-hyeon?

240
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,529
What on earth?

241
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,865
Anyone would think
that those two are dating.

242
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,535
You've seen it too, right?

243
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,747
Se-hyeon flirted
with one of the guys on our team.

244
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,708
Apparently, they watched
a movie together too.

245
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,086
He was convinced
that things were going well with her.

246
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,089
Maybe that's how she always plays it.

247
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,134
She makes them think they've got
a chance with her so she can use them.

248
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,970
Does Tae-o know this too?

249
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,391
What did you say was on the menu again?

250
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,684
Tripe.

251
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,896
I should pig out then.
I haven't had tripe in a while.

252
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,867
If you bribe them,

253
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,161
they could put in a good word
to get you cast.

254
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,873
Not in a major supporting role, but
as part of an ensemble or a swing dance.

255
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,299
-It's great meeting you.
-Thank you.

256
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,676
-Shall we clink our glasses?
-Yes.

257
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,135
All right. Guys, cheers!

258
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,428
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

259
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,763
That's a lot of meat.

260
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:05,764
Let's dig in.

261
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,813
-I need to lose weight.
-Just eat up.

262
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:13,772
Eat up, everyone.

263
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,690
-Enjoy.
-It's so good.

264
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,233
I've been here before.

265
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,528
What am I going to say to him?

266
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,698
That I think his girlfriend
is seeing someone else?

267
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,117
And that she might go on a trip
with that guy?

268
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,079
Plus,

269
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:33,125
there's nothing more hurtful
than finding out the truth

270
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,544
through other people.

271
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,006
Why did he have to say that?

272
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,597
Why fill up your own glass
when you've got us?

273
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,766
Dae-geon.

274
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,019
Finally, I get to drink with you.

275
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,854
It's really hard to
get you to drink with us.

276
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,206
You'll be a senior next year, right?
Any idea where you'll apply to?

277
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:19,087
Well, my first choice is Donggwang
Architectural Firm, where you're working.

278
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,506
After all, it's the best in this country.

279
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,343
I feel honored.

280
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,517
I need to drop by the school to pick up
some documents from the professor.

281
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,063
Let's have dinner together sometime.

282
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,482
I'll give you a few pointers
on your resume.

283
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,027
I'd really appreciate that.

284
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,238
Don't thank me.
It's the least I can do as your senior.

285
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,333
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

286
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,044
That will be 15,000 won.

287
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,299
-Here you go. Thank you.
-Let's go.

288
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,388
SONG-I: HAVING TRIPE

289
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,517
Having tripe at the get-together.

290
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,103
Don't drink too much.

291
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,896
Call me when you head home.

292
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:18,939
Excuse me?

293
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:19,940
Yes, coming.

294
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,050
HAN SONG-I

295
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,975
Hello?

296
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,184
Hello? Is it you, Song-i?

297
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,062
Dae-geon?

298
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,315
I left with your phone
because it's the same one as mine.

299
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,526
I see.

300
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,904
I'm sorry to ask you this,
but could you come to school?

301
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,322
I'll call you back in ten minutes.

302
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,992
To the engineering building?

303
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,243
Yes, thanks a lot.

304
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,688
Get in.

305
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:45,942
I'm okay. Here's your phone.

306
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,362
Here.

307
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,323
Thanks.

308
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,867
You'll take the bus, right?
I'll drop you off at the bus stop.

309
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,869
I'm all right, really.

310
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:59,039
Come on. You're making me
look like a weirdo here.

311
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,500
That's not it.

312
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,752
Save me from the embarrassment and get in.

313
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,899
I'll get out by the main entrance.

314
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:27,943
Thank you.

315
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,819
Did you drink a lot?

316
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,197
No, I feel fine.

317
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,574
You're a heavy drinker.

318
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,204
Wait.

319
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,790
I think you just passed the main entrance.

320
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,917
Let's take a quick spin.

321
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:47,712
The weather's great for a drive.
There's no need to hurry home, is there?

322
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,301
So, you want to join my company?

323
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,346
I'm well acquainted with people from HR.

324
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,355
You know, he does weird things
to girls at the observatory

325
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,148
after getting them drunk.

326
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,913

327
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,417
We'll have two servings of meat dumplings
with Coke and Sprite.

328
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,295
Okay, two servings of meat dumplings,
a bottle of Coke

329
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,005
-and a bottle of Sprite, right?
-Yes.

330
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,803
OBSERVATORY
ADMINISTRATION BUILDING

331
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,267
COME TO THE SCHOOL OBSERVATORY. QUICKLY.

332
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,901
COME TO THE SCHOOL OBSERVATORY. QUICKLY.

333
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,737
DO-HYEON, TAE-O,
HYEON-JI, MIN-SEOK

334
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,448
YU-RIM, SO-MIN,
SEUNG-JUN, MIN-AH

335
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,657
TAE-O

336
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,831
Come to the observatory.

337
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,443
I'm in front of your house.

338
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,197
I have to talk to you about something.
Please come outside.

339
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:41,993
MESSAGE FROM DUMB SONG

340
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,370
Come to the observatory.

341
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,331
That was random.

342
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,962
Hey, do you remember
my senior Lee Dae-geon?

343
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,174
That annoying jerk?

344
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,636
-What about him?
-He's a trainer for the interns.

345
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,517
She has a boyfriend.

346
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,268
I'm sure Do-hyeon will be there for her.

347
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,271
Man...

348
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,148
DUMB SONG
CALL

349
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:22,701
The number you have dialed
is not available.

350
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,452
Please leave a message after the tone.

351
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,930
It's been so long since I last came here.

352
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,641
A memorial hall will be built in its place

353
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,435
since the astronomy department's gone.

354
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,355
Which is why there are hardly
any people who come here.

355
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,410
To Hansung University, please. Quickly.

356
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,963
Did you know that this place
is a hot place for couples?

357
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,426
Is it?

358
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,344
I had no idea.

359
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,388
Why...

360
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,432
do you think I brought you here?

361
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,105
I've been expressing
my feelings for you all along.

362
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,107
And you said you wanted to work
at my company,

363
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,942
even when you knew how I felt about you.

364
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:42,697
Well, the reason I want to work there
isn't because of you, but--

365
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,907
Doesn't that mean...

366
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,202
you feel the same way?

367
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:48,870
What are you talking about?

368
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,375
I know that you like me.

369
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,006
Am I wrong?

370
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,591
What are you doing?

371
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,554
Don't make things any worse
than they already are.

372
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,847
Open the door, now.

373
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,974
Then why did you get in my car?

374
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,560
I'm regretting it more than ever.
So open the door.

375
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,645
Unlock the door before I call the cops!

376
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,607
I know that your battery died.

377
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,032
Han Song-i!

378
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,329
-Tae-o!
-Song-i.

379
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,332
Hey, are you all right?

380
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:20,128
What happened?
Why are you at the observatory?

381
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,762
Did that jerk bring you here?

382
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,395
Let's just go.

383
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,689
Come on, let's go.

384
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,649
There seems to be
a misunderstanding, but...

385
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,694
Tae-o!

386
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,654
Stop it!

387
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,406
-Hey.
-I said, stop!

388
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,116
What did you do to her here?

389
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,576
-Tell me!
-Hey!

390
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,785
I'm wearing glasses!

391
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,621
You can't hit me.

392
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,705
Don't hit me, please.

393
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,469
Thanks for the help.
It was a bit hectic, wasn't it?

394
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:10,845
It's good to have many customers.

395
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,808
Let's see...

396
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,148
Come to the school observatory. Quickly.

397
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,744
You let that jerk just go like that?

398
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,080
I'm okay, really.

399
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,375
He blurted out some nonsense,
and that was about it.

400
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,169
He shouldn't have brought you here
in the first place.

401
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,297
Are you stupid?

402
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,132
Why did you get in his car?

403
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,469
He offered to drop me off at the bus stop.

404
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,304
Why won't you listen to me?

405
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:54,847
How can...

406
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:59,310
I told you that there are dirty rumors
about him and that you should be careful.

407
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,854
He eventually brought you here, didn't he?

408
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:03,773
I'm sorry.

409
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,734
The bus stop was close by,

410
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,153
-so I didn't think he'd--
-Where's Do-hyeon?

411
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,072
What?

412
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,659
Where is your boyfriend right now?

413
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,244
You knew?

414
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:30,550
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

415
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,260
Please leave a message after the tone.

416
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,481
When did you find out?

417
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,818
When we went to Gangneung.

418
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,236
Gangneung?

419
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,531
The pool!

420
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,324
The pool...

421
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,414
You guys were together
in a wide, open space.

422
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,666
Don't you think it'd be weirder
if no one saw you?

423
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,669
Then why didn't you say anything?

424
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,713
I waited for you to tell me.

425
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,924
But you didn't say a word.

426
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,344
I'm sorry.

427
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,473
I was going to tell you
when we were in Gangneung.

428
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,725
But then Hun got really upset,

429
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,228
and it just didn't seem like
the right time to tell you.

430
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,565
And once I missed my timing,

431
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,485
it kind of felt awkward to bring up
the subject again.

432
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,571
Forget it.

433
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,949
It takes a few lies for friendships
to gradually fall apart, I guess.

434
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,997
The day I was kicked out of my house,

435
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,665
that day,

436
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,086
Do-hyeon was there as one of the movers.

437
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,212
What?

438
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:52,590
It wasn't at your place
when I first met him.

439
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,803
After getting kicked out,
I met him again at your place.

440
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,972
The next day, I bumped into him again
when I went to get

441
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,432
a part-time job at the library.

442
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,936
I wasn't lying when I said
that he was a guy I worked with.

443
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,898
Why didn't you say that it was Do-hyeon?

444
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,236
I don't know. I...

445
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,449
I guess I was drawn to him
from the very beginning.

446
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,703
I was afraid you'd notice that,

447
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,082
so I intentionally avoided mentioning him.

448
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,461
It's just like

449
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,464
when you pretend to be nonchalant
about the person you're interested in.

450
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,095
I didn't mean to lie to you.

451
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,847
Don't be mad. Please?

452
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,485
Hey, Do-hyeon.

453
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,489
Tae-o, do you know where Song-i is now?

454
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,494
She's with me right now.

455
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,206
-With you?
-I'll take her home. You should come over.

456
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,666
What happened?

457
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,585
Did something happen to her?

458
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,462
Let's talk at home.

459
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,775
Hello, this is Kim Ji-hyeon speaking.

460
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,694
I...

461
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,487
Well, I...

462
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,488
Hello?

463
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,450
I called because...

464
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,243
Please go ahead.

465
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,621
Well...

466
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,957
I... I have...

467
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,752
something...

468
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,754
to tell you...

469
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,633
regarding O Ga-rin.

470
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:00,968
I...

471
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,221
I saw her...

472
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,517
working at...

473
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,519
a supermarket.

474
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:11,646
It's called...

475
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,689
Happy Mart.

476
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,485
Are you not mad at me anymore?

477
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,363
I'm not mad at you.

478
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,991
But I still feel like
I'm walking on eggshells right now.

479
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,417
Does it make you feel uncomfortable
that I like your friend?

480
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,632
My pride was hurt.

481
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,009
Because of the fact...

482
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,720
that the first guy Song-i liked...

483
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,473
was Do-hyeon and not me.

484
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,732
-It's not that.
-What is it, then?

485
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,193
I'm such a selfish jerk.

486
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:04,865
It's because...

487
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,451
Do-hyeon is too good for you.

488
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,538
-What?
-Let me tell you something.

489
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,581
Do-hyeon's a really popular guy.

490
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,042
Not as popular as me, though.

491
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,129
Hey, I'm pretty popular too.

492
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,965
You call having a pervert stalking you
being popular?

493
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,217
You talk as if you were quite a hotshot.

494
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,220
Well, I am definitely not a coldshot.

495
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,358
Do-hyeon!

496
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:44,739
What happened?

497
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,365
Why is your phone turned off?

498
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,367
My battery died.

499
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,328
I'm sorry.

500
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,247
I got worried because I couldn't
reach you after you sent that text.

501
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,708
Why did you go to the observatory?

502
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,293
Something came up.

503
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,756
-What is it?
-Ask your girlfriend about it later.

504
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,632
Tell me, what happened?

505
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,473
You should go inside.

506
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,641
I'm going to have
a little chat with Do-hyeon.

507
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,104
Wait, he knew all along?

508
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:25,446
Hey, is that important right now?
You've been lying to me all this time.

509
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,575
I was going to tell you...

510
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,660
I'll go inside then.

511
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,246
Call me when you're done talking.

512
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,498
Okay.

513
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,175
Do you want to...

514
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,386
grab a drink?

515
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,138
What's there to have a drink for?
It's just Song-i.

516
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,772
MEN SAID,
"THIS IS WHEN IT FELT LIKE A FLING."

517
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,609
WE WERE ALL TALKING TOGETHER,
THEN SHE TOUCHED ME.

518
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,907
You must have been pretty pissed at me
back in Gangneung.

519
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:11,951
Why?

520
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,745
Because I bad mouthed Song-i's boyfriend,

521
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,497
when I didn't know it was you.

522
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,000
You did hit a nerve.

523
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,005
I might do the same in the future.

524
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,092
Regardless of the circumstances,

525
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,094
if you two get into a fight,

526
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,637
I'll side with Song-i first.

527
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,516
If she gets upset because of you,

528
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,518
I'll say bad things about you.

529
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,605
Song-i is lucky you have her back.

530
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:48,571
From your perspective, I understand
that my presence may get on your nerves.

531
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:54,285
But Song-i and I share
a 20-year-long history.

532
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,373
My history with Tae-o
is something that can't be helped.

533
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,585
As you know, you can't change history.

534
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,675
Even if I behave fastidiously
from time to time,

535
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,011
I hope you understand.

536
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,850
Let me ask you a favor as well.

537
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,146
Let go of the sense of responsibility...

538
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,315
you have towards her.

539
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,317
I'm there for her now.

540
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,988
I'd be more than happy to do that.

541
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,494
If there's anything you want
to know about her, ask away.

542
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:40,122
Such as her favorite things,
what she absolutely hates,

543
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,708
and what to do to make her
feel better when she's upset.

544
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,960
I know Song-i inside out.

545
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,545
No, that's okay.

546
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,047
I'll get to know her myself.

547
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,176
Getting to know someone...

548
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,970
is what it means to be in a relationship.

549
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,556
You're right.

550
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,478
I like Song-i a lot.

551
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,980
I want our relationship to work.

552
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,108
Okay.

553
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,443
Well...

554
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,655
I'm sure you'll do a good job.

555
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,790
DRIED POLLACK SOUP

556
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:44,728
Wow. You made all of this for breakfast?

557
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,689
It's nothing much.

558
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,358
-Set the table, will you?
-Okay.

559
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,155
You can't call this "nothing much."

560
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,741
All these dishes
take so much effort to prepare.

561
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,661
I'm considerate enough to know that.

562
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,415
Try it.

563
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,548
It's phenomenal.

564
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,426
You actually made this?

565
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,637
It's your mom's recipe.

566
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,602
I found it in the attic.

567
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,061
Her recipes are very detailed.

568
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,688
Oh, that?

569
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,732
Why did you keep this in the attic?

570
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,609
I'll cook everything
in this cookbook for you.

571
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,320
There's no need.
It's not like you're on a cooking show.

572
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:37,489
I'm serious. I always keep my promises.

573
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,160
Let's see. For dinner,

574
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:42,870
steamed conger...

575
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:46,999
This one's a bit challenging.

576
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,339
Try this, too.

577
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,965
You made bulgogi as well?

578
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,386
Come and sit down. I made breakfast.

579
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,771
Hey, Hun. Come and have breakfast.

580
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,440
Okay.

581
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,073
I'll grab something to eat later.

582
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,867
-What?
-What are you talking about?

583
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,454
Can't you see that Song-i made all this
for us this morning?

584
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,289
You should be grateful for the meal.

585
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,540
I'm sorry!

586
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,212
What was that?

587
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,089
Sorry about what?

588
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,215
I...

589
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,050
told her.

590
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,677
Told her what?

591
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,387
That night in Gangneung,

592
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,890
when you guys had
all gone off somewhere...

593
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:52,439
I told Se-hyeon that we all live together.

594
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,482
What?

595
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,025
I'm so sorry.

596
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,412
Why, you...

597
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,098
Were you waiting for me?

598
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,184
Yes. I have something to tell you.

599
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,146
That's too bad.

600
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,315
-I have to be somewhere now.
-It's regarding my place.

601
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,243
I'm really sorry.

602
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:50,080
I don't know what to say.

603
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,957
It's not that I don't understand.

604
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,085
I think I would've done the same...

605
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,756
if my friends had no place to stay
and I had rooms available.

606
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,762
Why didn't you ask me about it
when you knew?

607
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,847
I didn't want to be the one to ask first.

608
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,225
It was bad enough that my pride was hurt.

609
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,770
I didn't want to look pathetic
by bringing it up first.

610
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,064
I'm really sorry.

611
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,817
It's not that I was trying to lie to you--

612
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:22,029
My head gets it, but my heart doesn't.

613
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,826
Do you know why it hurt so badly?

614
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:31,580
Han Song-i.

615
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,420
I know you couldn't tell me
because of her.

616
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,256
No, that's not true.

617
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,134
You hid it from me because
you were worried that I'd make a fuss

618
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:48,055
if I found out
that Song-i was living with you.

619
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,390
Isn't that the real reason?

620
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,358
Apologize.

621
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:01,985
I'm sorry.

622
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,447
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

623
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,241
I don't want you to just say you're sorry.

624
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,243
I want you to show it.

625
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,037
Tell Song-i...

626
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,873
to leave.

627
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,085
I want her out of your house.

628
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,755
I'll accept your apology then.

629
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,938
