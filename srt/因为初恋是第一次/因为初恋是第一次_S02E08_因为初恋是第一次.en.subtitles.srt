1
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:33,450
-I barely managed to finish on time.
-I know. You cut it close this time.

2
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,327
Anyway, we all did a great job!

3
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,664
Labor is practically all that we do.

4
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's go and eat something delicious.

5
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,668
-What should we have?
-Pork belly?

6
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,462
-Tteokbokki?
-Let's go!

7
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,839
Congratulations!

8
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,549
-Hey, congratulations!
-Congratulations!

9
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,217
-Congratulations!
-Wow.

10
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,178
U-ju, congratulations.

11
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:58,016
Thanks. I really didn't expect this.
Too bad it's only an Excellence Award.

12
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,435
Hey, what's wrong
with an Excellence Award?

13
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,313
The prize money alone
is three million won.

14
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,190
Wow.

15
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,901
What will you do with the money?
Go on a trip?

16
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,235
A trip?

17
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,072
I'm afraid that'll have to wait.

18
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,741
-I will use this as my start-up fund.
-Start-up fund?

19
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,159
We're seniors, remember?

20
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,870
We're starting
a media production company together.

21
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,415
We agreed that whoever won the contest
would provide the prize money as the fund,

22
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,167
and it turned out to be him.

23
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,170
I shouldn't have made the promise.

24
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,464
Tae-o, join us if you're interested.

25
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,758
Really? Can I?

26
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:32,842
Of course.

27
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,887
Hold on.
Didn't you enter the contest, too?

28
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,183
Well, I did prepare for it,

29
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,353
but I couldn't submit the work,
due to personal reasons.

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,395
I see.

31
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,233
Did you and Se-hyeon really break up?

32
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,068
Well...

33
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,238
Congratulations!

34
00:01:59,077 --> 00:01:59,911
Well, then.

35
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,288
What's with the chilly vibe?

36
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,542
Were you talking about me?

37
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,210
-No, of course not!
-Gosh, no.

38
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,881
It wouldn't be a celebration
without a cake. Here.

39
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,259
Wow. Isn't she amazing?

40
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,970
She knows how to do things right.
Hey, take the cake.

41
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,014
-Let's blow out the candles.
-I can't believe you brought this for me.

42
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,392
Hey, where are the candles?

43
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,893
-Here.
-Are they here?

44
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,650
Tanzania?

45
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:34,404
Yes, I've always wanted
to visit a remote country.

46
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,907
My dad is going,
so I said I'd follow as an assistant.

47
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,242
It sounds dangerous.

48
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,619
Will you be all right?

49
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,955
I'll be part of a group.

50
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:48,209
Besides, we shouldn't be worrying
about each other anymore.

51
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:53,089
I don't need permission
to worry about others, you know.

52
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,136
I'll have a lot to talk about
with my dad this time.

53
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,390
I met a boy who seemed
liked the easiest puzzle in the world,

54
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,934
but he turned out to be
the complete opposite.

55
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,063
I'll tell my dad that
he gave me a headache,

56
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,441
but that I still had fun.

57
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,319
I'm going to give him a detailed report.

58
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,990
I feel like I'll see you someday
on TV or in a newspaper or something

59
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,075
as someone extremely famous.

60
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,827
Of course.

61
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,288
There will be no point regretting it then.

62
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,291
I'll probably be dating
men younger and hotter than you.

63
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,335
No, that might be a little hard.

64
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,088
How about we grab some coffee?

65
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,508
I've been wondering how you've been
since we broke up.

66
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,511
Maybe next time. I have other plans today.

67
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,223
Seriously?
Look at you already drawing the line.

68
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,849
I'm not lying.

69
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,561
My friend is moving today.
I need to see him off.

70
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,940
Whatever.

71
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:04,953
Mr. Seo!

72
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,788
Hey, Tae-o, it's you.

73
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,748
-Let me take that.
-How did you find out?

74
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,502
My father told me.

75
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,380
He was right about this place
being well-situated.

76
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,507
It was sold off straightaway.

77
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,883
It definitely made things easier.

78
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,344
Is there more stuff? I'd like to help.

79
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,722
It's fine. The movers are still packing.

80
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,557
We own more than I thought.

81
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,228
I'll take care of the rest.
You two go and grab a bite to eat.

82
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,314
Why not?

83
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,075
Aren't you supposed to eat jjajangmyeon
after moving, not before?

84
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,453
Is that so?
Should we order something else then?

85
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,788
It's fine.

86
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,583
So, what happened...

87
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,669
with your mom afterward?

88
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,756
Things are still awkward.

89
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,592
I still get nervous when I call her

90
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,845
and we've never talked
for more than five minutes.

91
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,555
But it's still fascinating

92
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,267
to have someone's number on my phone
under the name "Mom."

93
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,648
I've been calling you.

94
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,485
I've been busy with a lot of things.

95
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,281
Besides,

96
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,784
I knew you'd come by today.

97
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,456
You're a very straightforward person.
You're so easy to read.

98
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,915
It's quite boring for me.

99
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,376
What are you talking about?

100
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,671
You should know
that I'm a quite complicated man.

101
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,674
Want some sweet and sour pork?

102
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,259
Shall we have some?

103
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,470
Excuse me, can we have
some sweet and sour pork, please?

104
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,808
-The food is good.
-Right.

105
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,813
-That reminds me. Hun passed his audition.
-Really?

106
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,442
It's called The Adventure of Flash,
and it's a very famous musical for kids.

107
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:03,321
I don't know much about it,
but it's almost like a religion to kids.

108
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,698
The character's name suits him well.

109
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,657
Exactly.

110
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,993
Ga-rin is busy these days, too.

111
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,120
I think it was a space renting business.

112
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,290
Anyway, she's completely engrossed
and has been taking classes.

113
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,168
It's good for her that she left home then.

114
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,670
They all found something they want to do.

115
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,093
I think living in a new place
will do me good as well.

116
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,303
I even told my dad

117
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:31,766
that I'd quit studying for now
and focus on what I want.

118
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,690
To be honest, Hun and Ga-rin
used to frustrate me.

119
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,943
It just seemed
like they were being too unrealistic

120
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,778
talking of dreams and whatnot.

121
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,572
But now I think

122
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,283
those who know what they want
carry different expressions.

123
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,535
Song-i is like that, too.

124
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,998
I thought I should
at least think about it once.

125
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,752
No matter what you do,

126
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,672
you'll be good at it. I know you will.

127
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,314
It feels sad to leave this town, though.

128
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,447
We should part ways here.

129
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,617
We'll see each other again,
so don't make a big fuss.

130
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,288
That day,

131
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,457
you were there for me

132
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,711
on one of the most important days
of my life.

133
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,464
Thank you.

134
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,592
I don't think I've thanked you properly.

135
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,805
I said this back then too,
but I didn't go there for you.

136
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,016
I know.

137
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,269
Say goodbye to everyone for me.
Tell them I'm sorry I can't be there.

138
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,522
I will.

139
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,025
I wish you happiness.

140
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,445
I truly do.

141
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,496
I hope that one day,

142
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,748
everything will find its place.

143
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,736
Whenever I look at these things,
I feel like it reflects my situation.

144
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,533
They are all mixed up with other things
without having a place to call their own.

145
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,784
Still,

146
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,620
they won't be like that forever.

147
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,870
Stop. I'll do it myself.

148
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,101
Let's revisit this place when it snows.

149
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,146
The view of the snowscape
from up here is spectacular.

150
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,606
I'll look forward to it.

151
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:26,394
Tae-o, you're truly fearless, aren't you?

152
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,648
Next month, I'll be a rising star
performing all over the nation,

153
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,024
and yet you make me do chores.

154
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,568
Stop whining and just keep cleaning.

155
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:38,030
You're the one who said
you'd leave once you receive payment.

156
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,324
Hey, don't be like that.

157
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,828
Once the show begins,
we won't be able to see much of him.

158
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,289
Baby, aren't your hands cold?
Let me warm them up.

159
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,423
I've looked around,
but there isn't a place I like.

160
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,633
Not many people move around
in this season.

161
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,469
So when are you coming to Seoul, Mom?

162
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,138
Move over.

163
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,556
Right.

164
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,521
Okay, I'll call you again soon. Bye.

165
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,317
What's with you today?

166
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,903
I'm upset, that's all.

167
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,822
Why don't you just stay here?

168
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,992
I'll have to leave soon anyway.
I just hate being a nomad.

169
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,829
Jeez. Those who should leave stick around,

170
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,707
while someone who shouldn't
keeps drawing a line.

171
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,169
Who is it, for crying out loud?

172
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,397
Ga-rin.

173
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,324
The store called.

174
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,951
They wanted to know if I was aware

175
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,829
that one of our family's high-end
jewelry pieces turned up in the market.

176
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,417
I'm sorry for worrying you.

177
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,878
Did you run away from home

178
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,381
and make me worried sick
just to live like this?

179
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,967
Because you wanted

180
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,012
to live in this tiny house
with people you barely know?

181
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,607
I won't say any more.

182
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,361
Ms. Kim will come and help you pack.

183
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,529
No.

184
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,658
I can't leave yet.

185
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,911
Are you trying to drive me insane?

186
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:55,251
You saw that I'm well,
so please go back knowing that I'm safe.

187
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,169
What nonsense are you talking about?

188
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:03,050
I'm not leaving this house
until you come with me. All right?

189
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,386
Ma'am, that's...

190
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,637
Mom!

191
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,223
Ms. Kim, it's me.

192
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,060
Just so you know,
I'm staying the night here.

193
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,773
So where's your room?
It is that way?

194
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,483
-This isn't--
-Mom!

195
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,913
Is it okay to leave
Ga-rin and her mom like that?

196
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:37,835
I provided the battleground,
so I'm sure they'll work it out.

197
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,336
Do you think so?

198
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,549
What's that jacket for?

199
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,052
I have an interview
for my internship tomorrow.

200
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,513
You're going to an interview in that?

201
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,307
Why? Is it weird?

202
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,394
Not exactly, but it's for the summer.

203
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,855
This is the only suit I own.

204
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,233
I can't allow this.

205
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,069
-What?
-I can't let you go to a job interview

206
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,946
wearing that in the middle of winter.

207
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,074
Let's go shopping.

208
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,702
It's too late to go shopping.

209
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,371
Besides, I doubt it'll show
from a distance.

210
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,790
No one's that stupid, you know.

211
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,460
Anyone can tell that
the material is light and thin.

212
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,086
Song-i,

213
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,882
don't you know how important
first impressions are in interviews?

214
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,800
I'll wait outside, so come down quickly.

215
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:27,760
Hey!

216
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,386
I'm telling you, I'm fine!

217
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,103
Can't...

218
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,856
you sleep?

219
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,859
How could I fall asleep in this situation?

220
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:48,113
I'm in this silly sweater, lying on a bed
in someone else's house.

221
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,826
I slept really well in that bed.

222
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,623
Unbelievable.

223
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,920
My friends tell me that I snore.

224
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,005
What?

225
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,467
I thought that insomnia had no cure,

226
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,555
but I guess being at ease was the key.

227
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,355
Just what exactly do you have here?

228
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,692
I mean, what didn't I give you

229
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,610
for you to run away from home?

230
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,742
A life...

231
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,453
that lets me make my own choices.

232
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,333
I'm not saying I'll stay away
from home forever.

233
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:47,506
Just let me take some time
to think about how I can...

234
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,676
make more use of what I have...

235
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,594
here.

236
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,980
What kind should you buy?

237
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,441
Well, it's a job interview,
so I need something formal.

238
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,817
I see.

239
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,283
Girls sure have a lot of pretty options.

240
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,660
It's fun to be out here together, right?

241
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,455
Yes. It's nice to be out here.

242
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,835
You have big hands.

243
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,921
As if that's news.

244
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,715
Did you just realize that?

245
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,884
You have a small face for a guy, too.

246
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,303
I've always been saying

247
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,389
that I'm tall with great proportions.

248
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,224
I never realized that.

249
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,351
How can you not?

250
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,271
Well, it explains why
you've always been mean to me.

251
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,441
You're in big trouble now.

252
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:51,153
You'll keep on finding me handsome
and that'll make you nervous.

253
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,155
You'll worry about other girls wanting me.

254
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,407
As if.

255
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,784
You will.

256
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,577
Because that's how I feel.

257
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,834
I see some formal wear over there.
Let's have a look.

258
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,058
You look great in that.

259
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,435
What do you think?

260
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,521
Do I look smart and professional?

261
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,690
No, I can't allow it.

262
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,484
Why not?

263
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:34,196
You look too pretty!
What if the interviewer falls for you?

264
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,324
What's he saying?

265
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,078
Being too pretty is a problem, too.

266
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,878
How about this?

267
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,966
This is it. This is perfect for you.
You have to buy this.

268
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,051
Doesn't it look a bit dull?

269
00:18:56,135 --> 00:19:00,055
No, you look good in everything
due to your fair complexion. It's pretty.

270
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,181
Can I take a photo of her?

271
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,474
Of course.

272
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,606
Your boyfriend is so sweet.

273
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,405
My girlfriend has a job interview,
you see.

274
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,908
Not only is she pretty,
but she also gets good grades.

275
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,493
She's actually on a scholarship!

276
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,079
Why would you tell her that?

277
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,249
-I'll take the first one.
-Sure.

278
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,709
-You're unbelievable.
-What's wrong?

279
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,419
Try this one on too. Come on.

280
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,965
How about a snack?

281
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,217
Sounds great! Allow me.

282
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,969
I'm good. It's not that heavy.

283
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,847
You're clueless, aren't you?

284
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,267
Okay, fine.

285
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,437
Here.

286
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,195
This isn't enough now.

287
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,493
What's wrong?

288
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,078
Is it weird?

289
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,373
It's not that.

290
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,834
I'm just ticklish, that's all.

291
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,772
Thanks for coming shopping with me
at night.

292
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,732
It was fun.

293
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,653
Anyway, you looked amazing in those suits.

294
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,239
That's why I'm upset.

295
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,782
Why?

296
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,993
All kinds of jerks
will throw themselves at you at work.

297
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,662
You're already so beautiful in my eyes,

298
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,538
and others will find you even more so.

299
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,541
Don't you feel awkward
saying things like that?

300
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,170
-Saying what?
-Saying that I'm pretty and the best.

301
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,505
That kind of stuff.

302
00:20:56,838 --> 00:21:00,842
For 20 years, you've been
telling me I'm ugly and stupid.

303
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,887
How can you act so differently,
like flicking a switch?

304
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,556
I just can.

305
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,395
It took us a long time to get here,

306
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,189
so I don't want to waste any time.

307
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,653
I want to praise you
with every compliment there is.

308
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,075
It's weird.

309
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,702
What is?

310
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,245
Why do you...

311
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,372
seem more mature than me?

312
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,626
Jeez, did you only just realize that?

313
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,962
Hey, you shouldn't do this
to your girlfriend.

314
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,466
Hey, while we're here,
let's go and see the flowers.

315
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,552
Flowers?

316
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,599
Gosh, this place is beautiful.

317
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,351
It seems like a different world.

318
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,145
I know.

319
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,731
It's prettier at this time of night.

320
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,316
Have you been here?

321
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,900
Of course.

322
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,486
All those studying architecture
come here at least once.

323
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,115
You know, you should
make something like this someday.

324
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,617
Something that is considered a landmark.

325
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,119
It's not my thing.

326
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:12,706
I'd love to build simple
and friendly homes, just as my dad did.

327
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:13,874
That's my dream.

328
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,251
Can you guess what my dream is?

329
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,753
What is it?

330
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,421
You.

331
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,258
Holding your hand,

332
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,510
visiting beautiful places with you,

333
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:29,431
and talking about
our past, present, and future.

334
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:30,974
That's my dream.

335
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,189
I know that you're still more comfortable
with me as just a friend.

336
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:41,151
It'd be nice if you were as simple as me,

337
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,487
but you have your own ways.

338
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,489
I'll just consider this
in terms of seasons.

339
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,866
Seasons?

340
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,160
Winter doesn't turn into spring overnight.

341
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:55,832
Although it's at a very slow pace,
I know that our relationship is shifting,

342
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,459
so I'll wait patiently.

343
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,128
Until you're more comfortable

344
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,382
with me as your boyfriend
than just a friend.

345
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,060
It's not because I feel awkward.

346
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,396
It's because I like you a lot.

347
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,316
The more I'm with you,

348
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,944
the more I become attracted to you.

349
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,366
It's such a new feeling
that I'm not used to it yet. That's all.

350
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,538
You take my hand as if it's no big deal,

351
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,289
but it makes my heart explode.

352
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,210
I'm happy whenever I feel your gaze on me.

353
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,256
Every time you call me by my name,

354
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,509
I feel like I've become a flower.

355
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,514
I'll try and be more honest
with my feelings from now on.

356
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,850
It may take some time, though.

357
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,692
You were honest enough just now.

358
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,730
How am I going to look at him tomorrow?

359
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,367
Good night, my flower.

360
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:06,296
CHANGE NAME
TAE-O

361
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,343
TAE-O

362
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,412
CHANGE NAME
DUMB SONG

363
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:45,335
MY FLOWER
SAVE NAME

364
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,172
MY FLOWER

365
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,310
-She left?
-When?

366
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,645
At dawn.

367
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,147
She didn't want to wake you all up.

368
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,068
I saw her off, so don't worry.

369
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,028
What will happen next?

370
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,073
Will your bodyguards barge in here

371
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,033
and drag you back home?

372
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,660
No.

373
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,455
I told my mom I'd stay
until my dad returns to Korea.

374
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,666
She said yes.

375
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,835
That's great news!

376
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,671
I was worried that we would
be separated overnight

377
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,965
and couldn't sleep all night.

378
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,592
It's all right.

379
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,221
Anyway, I'm sorry for
making you hear an earful, too.

380
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,389
It's all right.

381
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,934
As an apology, I'll make breakfast today.

382
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,024
-Come on, Hun.
-Okay, what will you cook?

383
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,943
-What shall we cook?
-What shall it be?

384
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,487
-My gosh.
-What should I do first?

385
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,240
I want something delicious.

386
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,408
Me too.

387
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,745
Shall we have Korean or Chinese food?

388
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,706
-Food to calm the heart?
-Did you sleep well?

389
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,166
This is fun!

390
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,668
Yes.

391
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,292
I'm such a handsome lad.

392
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,672
I can do it!

393
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,396
What are you watching?

394
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,538
-Try counting our shoulders.
-Our shoulders?

395
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,125
One, two, three, four.

396
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,586
Gosh.

397
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,135
Why don't we go there, too?

398
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,852
Can I help you?

399
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,187
Oh, sure.

400
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:17,398
Is it for a friend or a girlfriend?

401
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,777
She's a friend,

402
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,570
but also my girlfriend.

403
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:28,660
Is there a flower that means
"from friend to lover"?

404
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,746
There's not one with that exact meaning.

405
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,707
Let me suggest something for you.

406
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,174
Tae-o, it's me.

407
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,220
My gosh.

408
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,847
How was work?

409
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,600
-What's with the flowers?
-You worked hard this week. That's all.

410
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,896
They're pretty.

411
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,065
Thanks.

412
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:06,030
The flowers make it seem
like spring is finally here.

413
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,034
I know you've been feeling a bit lonely
since Hun and Ga-rin left.

414
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,204
I thought this would cheer you up.

415
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,248
Right.

416
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,042
It's already been a month since they left.

417
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:22,463
By the way, these must be roses.
Are the yellow ones freesias?

418
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,049
Well...

419
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:28,386
roses, freesias, and cotton flowers.

420
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,682
Roses stand for lovers,
freesias stand for friends,

421
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,768
and cotton flowers stand
for the love of a mother.

422
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:41,941
You're not only my girlfriend,
but my friend and family as well.

423
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,279
Aren't these pretty?

424
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:52,577
-You're more sensitive than you look.
-Did you realize that just now?

425
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,872
I'm a man with an ironic charm, who's
simple and sensitive at the same time.

426
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,967
-Did you get a message from Ga-rin, too?
-Yes. What's this address?

427
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,640
Is Hun coming, too?

428
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,767
Yes, he got back from Busan yesterday.

429
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,936
He said he'll come since it's his day off.

430
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,938
Ga-rin isn't your average girl.

431
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,440
Who texts you an address
and demands your presence?

432
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,068
I think it's here somewhere.

433
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,402
Hello, my fellows.

434
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:29,864
Hey!

435
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,121
-Mr. Yun, how have you been, man?
-It's been so long.

436
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,623
How have you been?

437
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,959
Have you been captivating the little ones?

438
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,627
Of course.

439
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,838
If children could vote,
I'd be the next president.

440
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,299
Where's Ga-rin?

441
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,135
Well, we agreed to meet here.
I'll call her. Hold on.

442
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,553
Hi, guys!

443
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,138
Ga-rin!

444
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,435
Wow, Ga-rin. You look amazing!

445
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,523
When did you get here?
What were you doing inside?

446
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,400
This is my building.

447
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:06,859
-What?
-What?

448
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,792
-This is amazing.
-So,

449
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,544
you bought a building in our neighborhood?

450
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,753
Yes.

451
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,174
For a long time, I've had this vague idea

452
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,010
of doing good through living space.

453
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:33,678
Doing good?

454
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,556
If you think about it,
we were all able to meet

455
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,141
thanks to Tae-o's house.

456
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,562
I thought that what people need the most
to fulfill their dreams

457
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,606
is the right space
where they can carry out their plans.

458
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,900
Will you be in
the neighborhood often, then?

459
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:52,030
Yes, I'm going to soon
look for tenants to rent the place.

460
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:57,326
It's still being worked on,
but would you like a tour?

461
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,662
Yes, I'd love to. Let's go and see it.

462
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,497
Follow me.

463
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:09,088
And just like that, Ga-rin shocked us all

464
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,465
with her dazzling new life.

465
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,635
Hey, wait for me!

466
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,975
Can you sign this for me?

467
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,563
Hello.

468
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,440
-Hello.
-Is everything good?

469
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,399
Yes.

470
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,651
I haven't seen you in a while.

471
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,278
-Hi.
-Your work has improved.

472
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:33,529
Thank you.

473
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,573
What flowers do you have today?
Are those roses?

474
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,491
Yes.

475
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:38,785
Hello.

476
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:52,799
The space Ga-rin created
was soon packed with people.

477
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,136
My gosh!

478
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,763
This is amazing!

479
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,098
Tae-o.

480
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,769
Oh, you're here!

481
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,354
Can we really work here?

482
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,939
Of course. Take a look around.

483
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,900
-Isn't it cool?
-It's incredible.

484
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,408
We all thought it was like magic,

485
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:23,788
but the real magic was yet to happen.

486
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,753
THE ADVENTURE OF FLASH

487
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:34,048
Wow, Hun's photo is as big
as the building!

488
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,592
He really is a superstar!

489
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,679
-Come on, we'll be late.
-Hold on.

490
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:40,972
-Let me take a photo.
-Come on.

491
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,480
In the east, in the west! I am Flash!

492
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,650
Hello, young lady. How have you been?
I hope you enjoy it.

493
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,736
Look here. I'll take the photo
in one, two, three.

494
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,072
One, two, three, Flash!

495
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,616
Thank you so much.

496
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,619
-Bye, kids. I'll see you later.
-Bye.

497
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:08,875
In the east, in the west!
I, Flash, protect this planet!

498
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:09,792
What?

499
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,503
Kids, excuse me for a second.

500
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,716
Hi, my friends. You're here.

501
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,012
Hun, you have no idea
how amazing you look.

502
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,013
Thanks.

503
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:25,641
You're not a rising star, but a superstar.

504
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,518
Congratulations, Hun.

505
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,354
I'm just getting started.
You wait and see.

506
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,607
So far,
I only have little kids as my fans,

507
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,901
but I'll soon captivate everyone
regardless of their age.

508
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:38,029
People from all over the world
will be stunned by me...

509
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,248
Mom?

510
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,720
Good luck with your show.

511
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,931
You really came.

512
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,475
My son asked me to come.

513
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,018
So I came.

514
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:15,191
It'll take longer for your dad.

515
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,318
You know that, right?

516
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,489
It's all right.
The fact that you're here is enough.

517
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,532
Right.

518
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,284
Don't make mistakes on stage.

519
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,078
I'll be there in the audience.

520
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,137
Did you make it back all right?

521
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,891
Yes, and I'm swamped with things to do.

522
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,852
I knew it. I said I'd help, didn't I?

523
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,606
My mom and I will go and eat dinner soon.

524
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,191
Come by once I'm done.

525
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,403
Song-i, can you help me with the curtains?

526
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,654
Coming!

527
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,323
I'll call you back.

528
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:05,908
Okay, sure.

529
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,438
The season is over, and one day
we will look back on it

530
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,524
and think that it was nothing
but a fleeting moment.

531
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,787
Some have found their place,

532
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,500
while others are still searching for it.

533
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:18,439
And we're all preparing
for another new season.

534
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,452
Darn it.

535
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,372
You can just buy me some.

536
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,708
You didn't have to mess up the kitchen
over something frivolous like this.

537
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,669
I can't believe
you're actually complaining.

538
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,756
This is what you said you wanted
for Valentine's Day.

539
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,424
Homemade chocolate from your girlfriend.

540
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:50,054
Why do you always remember
even my passing comments?

541
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,598
Fine. I give up.

542
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,266
You can clean this up.

543
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,144
-Do you want my help?
-No.

544
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,938
I should be the one who makes it.

545
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,989
Let me help.
At this rate, we'll have to skip dinner.

546
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,533
What do we need to do?

547
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,161
All we need to do is pour the chocolate
in the molds and let it cool.

548
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,872
But it keeps brimming over.

549
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,457
Okay, hand it over.

550
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,586
So, you take this and...

551
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,631
Like this?

552
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:26,882
Hey!

553
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,634
You're so pretty.

554
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,679
Hey, come back here. Hey!

555
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,722
-Okay, fine.
-Come back here.

556
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:42,898
Damn it.

557
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,692
Okay, fine. I surrender.

558
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:49,405
-Hey, don't cross the line, all right?
-All right.

559
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,829
Friend, family, and girlfriend.

560
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,165
You are all three.

561
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,588
And you are the one I love.

562
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,865
