1
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,313
I feel really offended right now.

2
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,316
It's natural for me
to ask that as your girlfriend,

3
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,777
but you're making me look unreasonable.

4
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,781
I'm sorry for letting things get this far,

5
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,326
-but--
-I'll gladly be the excuse you need,

6
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,413
so take care of this absurd situation.

7
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,756
I can't ask Song-i to leave.

8
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,677
It's not just her.
I can't make Hun or Ga-rin leave either.

9
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,305
I missed the right timing
to do that long ago.

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,559
Instead...

11
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,733
I'll move back into my parents' house.

12
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,946
Your friends will live at your house...

13
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,200
and you'll stay at your parents' house?

14
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,869
Do you think that makes sense?

15
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,501
Don't you want...

16
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,544
to be alone with me?

17
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,423
-Of course I do, but--
-You said you liked me.

18
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,760
You said you liked me a lot.

19
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,930
So why am I not a priority to you?

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,560
If you're going to keep humiliating me...

21
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,231
don't bother coming to see me.

22
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:11,881
HIS PRIORITY

23
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,219
How can I decide right now?

24
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,720
I have a son too, remember?

25
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,680
CLOSED FOR TODAY

26
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,306
I'm hanging up. We'll talk later.

27
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,061
Are you going to school now?

28
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,356
Yes. Is the diner closed today?

29
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,359
Water will be cut off from 1 p.m.
due to maintenance.

30
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,112
Why can't they notify us sooner?

31
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,407
-The house too?
-Yes, it's for the whole building.

32
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,742
Go to the sauna
if you want to take a shower.

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,954
Actually, you might be better off
sleeping there too.

34
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,372
All right.

35
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,040
So who was that on the phone?

36
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,042
No one you need to know about.

37
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,335
Have a nice day.

38
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,104
Are you asleep?

39
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,902
I just want to fall asleep
and never wake up.

40
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,196
Why? Is there something wrong?

41
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,784
Se-hyeon found out

42
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,912
that my friends are living at my house.

43
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,872
How?

44
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,707
Ga-rin let it slip.

45
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,669
And I was only worried about Hun.

46
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,964
I should've been more thorough.

47
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,676
Well, she doesn't seem
like a narrow-minded person,

48
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,846
so she'll understand
if you explain their situation.

49
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,389
Song-i's the issue.

50
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,308
Why?

51
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,394
You know,

52
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,440
she hates that I'm living
with another girl.

53
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,235
So what? It's not like
you'll live together forever.

54
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,738
Well, since we're on the subject,

55
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,365
I'm staying there tonight.

56
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,992
-Why?
-The water's been cut off at my place.

57
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,786
I was going to stay at a sauna,

58
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,579
but then I thought of you.

59
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,457
Then just stay at a sauna.
I have no empty rooms.

60
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,292
I can share a room with someone.

61
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,628
Do you seriously want to
share a bed with me?

62
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,712
No, not you.

63
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,179
Wait, are you talking about Song-i?

64
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,305
The professor's here.

65
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,558
Hello.

66
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,852
Why, you...

67
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,660
Are you leaving for... your part-time job?

68
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,662
Yes, I'll see you later.

69
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,332
I'll help. Let me come with you.

70
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,002
Sure, let's go.

71
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,805
What? What is it?

72
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,559
I feel at ease now
after telling you guys everything.

73
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,687
Lying has never been my forte.

74
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,275
No one is born
with the ability to lie anyway.

75
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,651
You know,

76
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,697
people can lie
when they're put under pressure.

77
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,199
Thank you for being so understanding.

78
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,338
What's this?

79
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,176
Are these pills? Why are there so many?

80
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,470
They're mine.

81
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,513
Yours? Why?

82
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,224
-Are you sick?
-No, not really.

83
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,393
But I used to have a sleep disorder.

84
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,188
So I was prescribed
sleeping pills and anxiety pills.

85
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,815
-Do you still take them?
-No.

86
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,443
I've gotten better
ever since I met you all.

87
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,570
I'm throwing them out
because I don't need them.

88
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,700
There.

89
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,619
I'll get going then. Bye.

90
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,465
I'll walk you to the station.

91
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,758
Sure.

92
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,138
Was your insomnia...

93
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,182
severe?

94
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:32,892
A little bit.

95
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,562
My doctor said
it was a psychological issue.

96
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,439
I guess that was true.

97
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,401
I've gotten better
ever since I met you guys.

98
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,361
Especially you, Hun.

99
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,864
-What?
-To be honest,

100
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,450
I've always been jealous
of Tae-o and Song-i.

101
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,578
Well, now I have a best friend of my own.

102
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,210
A best friend?

103
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,547
You're my best friend, aren't you?

104
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,093
Right...

105
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,933
The most important factor
in a science-based smart city

106
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,520
is the trust between members of society.

107
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,941
With this final statement,
Team Five concludes its presentation.

108
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,735
In the present and in the future,

109
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:29,824
what determines
the dignity of living space isn't science,

110
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:34,036
but the people living in it.

111
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,300
-Song-i, good job.
-You did great.

112
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,385
-Good job.
-Song-i, that was great.

113
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,721
-How about a celebratory dinner then?
-Sounds good.

114
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,722
-I'm in.
-Me too.

115
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,806
Pork belly and soju.

116
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,558
-That'd be nice.
-We need something fatty.

117
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,976
-Sounds great.
-I can't wait.

118
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,436
Min-ah can treat us this time.

119
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,104
-Thank you in advance.
-Me?

120
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,647
Thank you in advance.

121
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,400
Goodness,
I'm so glad that it's finally over.

122
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,986
It looks like we'll get an A plus.

123
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,530
Let's hang out at my place this weekend.

124
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,781
Your place?

125
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,783
Yes, my parents are on vacation in Europe.

126
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,660
I'm free!

127
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,122
What good is it, though,
when there's no guy to enjoy it with?

128
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,415
Jeez.

129
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,338
Let's catch up later.

130
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,973
We should talk.

131
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,558
Why?

132
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,939
"We put your name on the report
even if you didn't do any of the work,

133
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,398
so be grateful."

134
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,609
-Is that what you want to say?
-It's about Tae-o

135
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:47,985
and the house.

136
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,804
Right,

137
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,472
it's all for the best.

138
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,851
The princess returns to her castle,

139
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,396
and I will go back to where I belong.

140
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,733
It's for the best.

141
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:38,452
The rest will be wired to you
once we have her back safely.

142
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,704
Thank you.

143
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,083
5,000,000 WON HAS BEEN WIRED
INTO CHOE HUN'S ACCOUNT

144
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,673
Choe Hun, you jerk!

145
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,385
What the hell have you done?

146
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,317
That day,

147
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,113
after I was kicked out of my house,

148
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,574
I had nowhere to go.

149
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,037
Is Tae-o the only friend you have?

150
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,332
Of course I have friends, but...

151
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,127
It must have been fun seeing me.

152
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:33,466
I bet you found it fun
that I was kept in the dark.

153
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,968
We didn't lie on purpose.

154
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,262
Still...

155
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,015
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,310
My mom ran away,

157
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,188
and I was kicked out of my house.

158
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,941
There was no one
I could tell my pathetic story to...

159
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,071
besides Tae-o.

160
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:01,285
I never laughed at you
or thought this was funny.

161
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,412
I'm not a monster, you know.

162
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:07,124
And I'm not a bitch who can't
sympathize with your situation.

163
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,795
Still, it was upsetting to find out.

164
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,633
Is your boyfriend fine with it?

165
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,302
Sorry?

166
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:22,598
Friends of the opposite sex
may seem harmless,

167
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,559
but it makes
everyone involved feel uncomfortable.

168
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,853
Think long and hard about it.

169
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,524
Is staying with Tae-o
really your only option?

170
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,067
Or have you been...

171
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,697
using the fact that he's your close friend
as an excuse?

172
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,711
Try some ramyeon. Hello, ma'am.

173
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,337
SIWON RAMYEON SAMPLING EVENT

174
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,047
It's really good. Please enjoy.

175
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,007
Come again!

176
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,973
Try some ramyeon...

177
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,206
Hello?

178
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,209
Hello?

179
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,627
Ga-rin, are you all right?

180
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,255
Hun, where are you?

181
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,882
Where are you? Why is your voice shaky?

182
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:38,841
I'm in big trouble.

183
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,094
I don't know how they found out,

184
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,473
but Ms. Kim
and the others are here for me.

185
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,684
I think they know I work here.

186
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,895
Stay right there. I'm coming for you.

187
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,062
Don't get caught, okay?

188
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,315
Okay. Please hurry.

189
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,693
Damn.

190
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,332
The number you have dialed is not...

191
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,922
I think it'll be really touching
if the film showed you aging

192
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,758
along with your parents.
What do you think?

193
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,941
Will this appease her?

194
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,860
NO TITLE

195
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,578
-You're here.
-Hi.

196
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,582
-What's all this?
-I'm cooking dinner today.

197
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:54,542
Lend me your kitchen.

198
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,419
Did Song-i order you
to make dinner for her?

199
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,172
Jeez, she's unbelievable.

200
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,298
That's not it.

201
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,008
I just wanted to cook for her.

202
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,304
I'm sure it was Song-i
who always cooked in this house.

203
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,724
Yes, that's right.

204
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,227
Also, she doesn't know...

205
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,438
-that I'm staying here tonight.
-Why not?

206
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,858
-It's a surprise.
-Seriously?

207
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,734
Is my house being used

208
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,987
-to fuel your romance?
-Yes.

209
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,740
Jeez.

210
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,828
Ga-rin!

211
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,707
O Ga-rin!

212
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,253
O Ga-rin!

213
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,381
Ga-rin!

214
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,967
Hun! Over here.

215
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,094
I'll come to you.

216
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,220
Okay.

217
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,601
Is this where you've been?
Are you all right?

218
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,605
My mind went blank when I saw Ms. Kim,

219
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,607
so I just ran over here.

220
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,734
I was in the middle of my shift.

221
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,328
Don't worry.

222
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,040
I'll make sure you get out of here.

223
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,291
All right?

224
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,509
Let's go.

225
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,224
Hun...

226
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,606
Did you come here to save me?

227
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,152
Let's get out of here first.

228
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,528
Sure.

229
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,168
Seo Do-hyeon.

230
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,255
Yes, I acknowledge that he's handsome.

231
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:09,343
He's manly, decisive, and smart.

232
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,931
He's a jack-of-all-trades.

233
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,560
I guess he's good enough
to be Song-i's boyfriend.

234
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,943
No, wait.

235
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,780
Being a good friend
and a good boyfriend are different.

236
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,621
He's not the type
to let his girlfriend win.

237
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,874
Also, he seems cold in some ways.

238
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,002
Are you going to keep staring?

239
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,295
What?

240
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,257
You were just in my line of sight.

241
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,219
-Can I help you with anything?
-It's fine.

242
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,222
-Do you have eggs?
-Yes, in there.

243
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,808
Help yourself to them.

244
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,568
HAN SONG-I'S

245
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,614
YUN TAE-O'S

246
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,125
HAN SONG-I'S
YUN TAE-O'S

247
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,338
HAN SONG-I'S
YUN TAE-O'S

248
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,269
I don't know how this happened.

249
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,356
They came to the supermarket I work at...

250
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,942
at that exact time.

251
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,653
It can't be a coincidence.

252
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,366
How did they know that I worked there?

253
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,124
Anyway, you got me out of that mess.

254
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,921
If it weren't for you,
I would've been dragged away on the spot.

255
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,297
Thanks, Hun.

256
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,216
Thank you so much.

257
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:22,768
It was me.

258
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,314
I was the one...

259
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,901
who told them where you worked.

260
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,236
What?

261
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,029
While you were out,

262
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,657
they came by Tae-o's place

263
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,283
with missing person flyers.

264
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,327
And...

265
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,624
the reward was too tempting.

266
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,301
At first, I was just shocked.
I never thought of selling you out.

267
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,846
But...

268
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,018
my situation right now...

269
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,776
The audition I thought I passed
ended up falling apart...

270
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,407
and I needed the money so badly.

271
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,120
I'm sorry, Ga-rin.

272
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,626
Why did you do it?

273
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,548
I thought...

274
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,050
we were friends.

275
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,013
I'm sorry.

276
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,066
I'm home.

277
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,360
-Hi.
-Hi.

278
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,656
Do-hyeon, what are you doing here?

279
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,784
His house is under maintenance,
so he's staying here for the night.

280
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,412
Really?

281
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,623
Look at her smiling.

282
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,458
Have you had dinner?

283
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,876
I made something for you.

284
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,962
Wow, did you do this all by yourself?

285
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,424
Everything looks delicious.

286
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,384
Don't expect them to taste that good.

287
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,305
I just wanted to cook for you
when I got the chance.

288
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,850
Thanks. It's been a while
since someone cooked for me.

289
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,310
Thanks so much.

290
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,519
Have a seat.

291
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,073
Is it good?

292
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,741
It's good.

293
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,201
-Really?
-Yes.

294
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,577
Try this too.

295
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:46,870
What is it?

296
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,288
A shrimp pancake.

297
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,296
-It's so good!
-Really?

298
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,675
Tae-o, come and join us.

299
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,218
Okay.

300
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,183
You should eat too.

301
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,143
Try this too.

302
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,729
-It's been boiled down.
-This is amazing.

303
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,649
I'll eat later.

304
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,110
-Dig in.
-Sure.

305
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,821
-Try this too. Eat up.
-Right.

306
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,122
What are you doing?

307
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,957
It's getting cold.

308
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,710
Some of these should be taken inside.

309
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:36,878
Where's Do-hyeon?

310
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,424
He's trying to find someone
to work his shift today.

311
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,717
I think he's on the phone.

312
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,344
He must be determined about tonight.

313
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,307
What about Se-hyeon?

314
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,517
Did you talk to her?

315
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,897
-Yes.
-What did she say? I bet she was angry.

316
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,400
Anyone would be angry in such a situation.

317
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,528
Don't worry, though. I'll take care of it.

318
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,364
Hey, how can I not worry

319
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,575
when I know why you two are fighting?

320
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,160
It's a common tragedy

321
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,495
for men who live alone.

322
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,540
There's someone else
you'd like to be alone with,

323
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,834
but only lodgers
come knocking at your door.

324
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,753
I have four tonight, don't I?

325
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,255
You're right.

326
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,382
You're dating someone,

327
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,218
but you can't invite her over
because we're here.

328
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,431
Hey, there's no need
to get all serious about it.

329
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,726
I didn't think that
I'd be staying here for so long.

330
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,397
I hate my mom even more today.

331
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,902
If I knew where she was,
I'd go over there in a heartbeat.

332
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,240
Anyway, don't think that this burden
is yours to bear alone.

333
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,201
I'll think of a solution too.

334
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,119
Forget it. A solution, my ass.

335
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,789
Stop worrying and just stay put.

336
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,962
-Ga-rin, hear me out--
-Let go!

337
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,049
Ga-rin.

338
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,426
Ga-rin!

339
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,768
Wait, what's going on? You're scaring me.

340
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,853
Calm down and talk to us. What's wrong?

341
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,647
I don't want to. I'm leaving.

342
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,358
Where would you go at this hour?
You have nowhere to go.

343
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,943
Anywhere is better than here.

344
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,364
I don't want to be near Choe Hun
for another second.

345
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,536
My mom was right.

346
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,205
She said that nothing good
comes from meeting many people

347
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,707
and that I should stay in my world.

348
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,086
I thought she was just being suffocating,

349
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,046
but she wasn't wrong.

350
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,090
He's the worst.

351
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,760
Wait, what are you talking about?

352
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,554
Explain to us so that we can understand.

353
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,056
It's all my fault.

354
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,977
Ga-rin's personal assistant
came by the house.

355
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,565
I was given a flyer,

356
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,819
and information on her whereabouts
was worth ten million won.

357
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,737
Hun, don't tell me...

358
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,031
Hey, are you out of your mind?

359
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,956
Yes,

360
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,791
I'm out of my mind, all right?

361
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,920
If I head back to my parents',
my dad will break my legs.

362
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,464
Song-i doesn't have anywhere to go.

363
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,216
That's not the case for you, though.

364
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,344
You have a family looking for you,
and you're rich.

365
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,931
If you want to find yourself,
spend your mom's money to do so.

366
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,851
Whine about your life in a hotel room.
Rich people do that!

367
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,312
Shut up!

368
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,649
You're ashamed of yourself, right?

369
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,110
That's why you're yelling at me.

370
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,532
At least I haven't been ashamed
of myself since coming here.

371
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,784
What about you, though?

372
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,787
Didn't you leave home
to live your own life?

373
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,249
Is this the life... you wanted?

374
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,421
I feel suffocated. I can't stay here.

375
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,174
Hey. Ga-rin, wait!

376
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,258
Ga-rin!

377
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,469
I'll get her.

378
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,305
-How can we trust you?
-I started it. I'll take care of it.

379
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,057
Also,

380
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,434
if Ga-rin really leaves,

381
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,520
-then I'll leave too.
-What?

382
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,771
I'll leave too.

383
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,315
Who cares about my dream?

384
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,734
I don't deserve to achieve it.

385
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,200
What do we do? Should we follow them?

386
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,702
No, they should sort it out themselves.

387
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,002
Stop following me.

388
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,629
I'm not following you.

389
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,881
I'm only going to see where you're headed.

390
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,597
Do you even have any money?

391
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,766
I know a place

392
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,102
where you can eat and rest for free.

393
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,564
Just keep it as an option.

394
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,168
I wonder if they made up.

395
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,965
How could she easily forgive him
when he sold her for money?

396
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,050
When a person is cornered,

397
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,052
they might make the wrong choice.

398
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:39,264
I know.
Hun has been having a hard time lately.

399
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,686
You two are making me look heartless.

400
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,607
Anyway, I'm heading upstairs.
I need to finish my schoolwork.

401
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,650
Okay, I'll be right up too.

402
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,496
-Tae-o.
-Yes?

403
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,248
Go to bed first.

404
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,375
I'm going to talk to Song-i.

405
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,797
But I'm not sleepy yet.

406
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,841
Tell her to come back down.

407
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,468
I want to be alone with her.

408
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,473
You have a girlfriend,
so you know what I mean.

409
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,603
Seriously?

410
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,580
I know that you're being
protective like a brother,

411
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,958
-but just end it there.
-I never did anything.

412
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,211
Have fun with her then.

413
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,255
Go to bed first.
I'll sleep when I want to.

414
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,092
Just say my name at the counter.

415
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,010
You can read or eat here.

416
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,721
You can do whatever you want.

417
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,476
I'm pretty rich here, you see.

418
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,770
Membership points.

419
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,609
I'll stay quiet in the corner,
so don't mind me.

420
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,280
Just go. I don't want you around.

421
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,533
Are you sure you'll be okay without me?

422
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,332
Just think of me as
one of these flowerpots

423
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,043
or one of the comic books on the shelves.

424
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,483
So this is your room.

425
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,903
There's nothing to see.
This is pretty much all I have.

426
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,253
Still,
I've never been in a girl's room before.

427
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,760
I'm not usually this messy.

428
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:07,180
These are things I frequently use,
so I haven't cleaned it up.

429
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,768
You had to move around a lot too.

430
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,478
It's understandable.

431
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:18,274
Whenever I look at these things,
I feel like it reflects my situation.

432
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,737
They are all mixed up with other things
without having a place to call their own.

433
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,156
Still,

434
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,784
they won't be like that forever.

435
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,705
Wait here.
I have a few photos I brought from home.

436
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,541
They're from when I was little.

437
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,336
Where did I put them?

438
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:47,929
Song-i.

439
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,556
Come over here.

440
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,213
It's my house, isn't it?

441
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,756
It's technically my attic.

442
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,137
No, that'd be wrong of me.

443
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,849
Why am I so bothered by this?

444
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,104
Do you think Ga-rin will really move out?

445
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,481
Why? Are you worried?

446
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,776
Technically, she'll be returning home,

447
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,029
-so I'm not worried.
-Then what?

448
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,616
Hun said he'll leave too if she does.

449
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,201
I'm wondering what I should do then.

450
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,584
If you find another place to stay,

451
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,586
I'd rather you go there.

452
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,008
You have no choice but to live here,

453
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,927
and I can understand that.

454
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:10,970
But...

455
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,433
now that I've seen your life
with Tae-o here,

456
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,020
I think it would bother me from now on.

457
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,362
Sorry.

458
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,156
I don't even have a solution,
but I'm saying these things.

459
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,991
No, I understand.

460
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,460
I guess being in a relationship...

461
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,755
makes you quite selfish.

462
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,677
Tae-o,

463
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,805
what's wrong with you?

464
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,057
Damn it.

465
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,112
Song-i, hold tight!

466
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,038
Song-i!

467
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:02,957
Song-i!

468
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,717
Hey, Song-i, where are you going?

469
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,555
Just...

470
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,563
Song-i!

471
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,038
Why did I have such a dream?

472
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,548
Think long and hard about it.

473
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,259
Is staying with Tae-o
really your only option?

474
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,719
Or have you been...

475
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,972
using the fact that he's your close friend
as an excuse?

476
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,562
There's someone else
you'd like to be alone with,

477
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,773
but only lodgers
come knocking at your door.

478
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,650
If you find another place to stay,

479
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,819
I'd rather you go there.

480
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,882
Ga-rin, are you up?

481
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,221
Where were you?

482
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,765
Oh, I went by the house.

483
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,976
Here are your clothes.

484
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,435
They'll be more comfortable.

485
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,607
Go and get changed.
The restroom is that way.

486
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,325
I'll get going.

487
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,451
Sure.

488
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,288
-See you at the library.
-Okay, see you.

489
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,797
Where are you headed?

490
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,924
The Multimedia Hall.

491
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,387
What did you and Do-hyeon
talk about last night?

492
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,181
You don't need to know.

493
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:24,849
Seriously?

494
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,603
It's not like I'm curious about
the details of your conversations.

495
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,397
Tae-o.

496
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,567
What?

497
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,820
If Ga-rin and Hun...

498
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:42,158
really end up moving out...

499
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,745
I'll move out too.

500
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,789
I don't know what'll happen for sure,

501
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,335
but I just thought you should know.

502
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,379
Where on earth would you go?

503
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:58,007
Those two can return
to their parents' houses,

504
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,592
but you can't.

505
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,094
I think I'll be able
to stay with Yu-rim for a while.

506
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,723
Her parents aren't home at the moment.

507
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,976
It's actually a good thing.

508
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,811
Once all the lodgers leave,

509
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,481
you can have Se-hyeon over.

510
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,984
I have a place to stay now too,

511
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,404
and you can appease your girlfriend.

512
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,407
That seems right.

513
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,702
Don't you agree?

514
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,496
Well...

515
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,081
I guess.

516
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,359
Whether you leave for good or not,

517
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,569
head back to Tae-o's place first.

518
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,617
You've been starving since this morning.

519
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,828
You were cramped on the couch

520
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,163
and woke up during the night.

521
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,416
Didn't you sleep?

522
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,126
How could I

523
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,837
when someone could've easily
taken advantage of you?

524
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:27,930
Ga-rin.

525
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,683
I know that you hate my guts right now.

526
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:34,520
I hate myself too,
so I can only imagine how you must feel.

527
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,646
If so,

528
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,565
get out of my face.

529
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:39,650
I'm sorry.

530
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,362
I did the unthinkable.

531
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,074
I've never been this desperate before.

532
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:51,829
-I must've been out of my mind.
-I've never felt this way before either.

533
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,415
I feel betrayed.

534
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:58,753
In that case...

535
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,505
what should I do?

536
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,224
I know how hard it is...

537
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,686
to trust someone who has hurt you.

538
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,314
Still...

539
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,692
give me one more chance.

540
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,403
I'll do more than my best

541
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:29,825
to earn your trust back
and be your best friend again.

542
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,376
It's actually a good thing.

543
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,294
Once all the lodgers leave,

544
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,256
you can have Se-hyeon over.

545
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,177
Do I hate the idea of an empty house
because I'm used to living with others?

546
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,304
Or...

547
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,183
is it because
I hate the idea of you leaving?

548
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,737
You're back.

549
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:53,993
Where did you sleep last night?

550
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,454
A comic book store.

551
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,123
That's a good choice.

552
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,673
So, have you made up your mind?

553
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,428
Are you really leaving?

554
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,064
Here.

555
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,319
-You're moving out?
-Yes.

556
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,405
But not right away. I'll be staying
at Yu-rim's for the time being.

557
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,907
Her parents are away for a while.

558
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,201
Where does she live?
Is it close to school?

559
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,203
It's nearby. It's close to here too.

560
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,621
Well, that's great.

561
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,207
Is it okay if I walk you home often?

562
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,542
-Yes.
-It's good for Tae-o too.

563
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,919
His girlfriend will be happy.

564
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,378
Exactly.

565
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,394
What?

566
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:06,857
Oh! There you are, my old friend, Song-i!

567
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,776
Welcome home

568
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,612
What? When did you get back?

569
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,741
I came home a while ago

570
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,119
When I'm done cleaning,
I'm going to make tteokbokki. Want some?

571
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,455
What's going on? Where's Ga-rin?

572
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,332
She's in her room. Go and see.

573
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,350
What's this? Are you going to stay then?

574
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,519
For now.

575
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,401
Did you forgive Hun?

576
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:51,485
No,

577
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,237
I'm still mad at him.

578
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,407
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

579
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,287
Seeing as I was hurt anyway,

580
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,080
I thought I should learn
how to overcome it.

581
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,875
That's what I decided to do.

582
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,295
If that's what you want...

583
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,548
Song-i, let's go and buy some beer!

584
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:16,010
How can we not celebrate, right? Come on.

585
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,847
What's he so excited about?

586
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,600
I guess he secretly liked our company.

587
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,728
He jumped for joy
when I said that I'd be staying.

588
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:38,240
Doesn't our neighborhood
look exceptionally beautiful today?

589
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:45,039
The scenery always depends on
how you feel.

590
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,458
You must be happy about something.

591
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,085
Yes, I am.

592
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:54,632
When I was alone at home earlier today,

593
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:55,841
it was weird.

594
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,927
Thinking that you could all leave

595
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,305
made me feel strange.

596
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,894
It's not ideal for me and Se-hyeon,

597
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,813
but I'll have to tackle it another way.

598
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,817
I decided to admit that...

599
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,279
I like living with you guys.

600
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,948
It's noisy and crowded at times.

601
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,118
It can be a bit annoying, but it's fun.

602
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:27,790
You know how talkative Ga-rin and Hun are.

603
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,959
They never stop talking.

604
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:32,503
That's why...

605
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,421
it'll be fine without me.

606
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,633
What?

607
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,177
Tae-o,

608
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,847
I'm going to move out of your house.

609
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,561
I'm staying with Yu-rim.
I'm not leaving now but in a few days.

610
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,065
Why?

611
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,776
Ga-rin and Hun are staying.

612
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:00,698
I thought you were only leaving
because it'd be weird if it's just us two.

613
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,616
Well,

614
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,702
the people we're dating...

615
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,620
find it uncomfortable.

616
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,083
I'll come by often.

617
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,502
I may come every day to nag you.

618
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,215
We've been joined at the hip for 20 years.

619
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:22,219
It's time we practiced
being away from each other.

620
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,599
That's the natural thing to do.

621
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,854
I do not want us to drift apart naturally

622
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,480
because...

623
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,779
Don't leave.

624
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,743
Because...

625
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:50,831
I...

626
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,040
like you.

627
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,676
