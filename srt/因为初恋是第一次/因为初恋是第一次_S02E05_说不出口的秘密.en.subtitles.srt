1
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:59,642
UNSPEAKABLE SECRETS

2
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,648
Hey. Are you zoning out?

3
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,652
I don't know.
I have no idea what I'm doing right now.

4
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,654
My point exactly. Just what are you doing?

5
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,115
At that rate, you won't finish it
by the end of the semester.

6
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,868
You know I always put things off
until the last minute.

7
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,579
I'll have to work until late tonight.

8
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,507
DO-HYEON

9
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,345
Hey, Do-hyeon.

10
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,138
Are you at the workroom?

11
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,306
Yes.

12
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,433
I have something to cheer you up.
Come out for a bit.

13
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,191
Why did you buy so many?

14
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,113
I wasn't sure what you'd like. You can
share the leftovers with your friends.

15
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,281
I'm sure they'll love it.

16
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,575
Thanks a lot.

17
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,712
Do you know when you'll be done?
Should we go and watch a movie?

18
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,549
I don't think I can make it today.

19
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,385
I have to pull an all-nighter
because I've got so much to do.

20
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,095
I'll help you with your work.

21
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,556
There are too many people
in the workroom now.

22
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,642
We're at the final stage of work,
so everyone's a bit sensitive.

23
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,652
I'll come and pick you up
when you're done.

24
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,405
That would be nice,

25
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,991
but it'll overlap with your work hours
at the store.

26
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,452
Oh, about that...

27
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,372
Regarding the convenience store...

28
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,084
I quit.

29
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:52,005
Really? Why?

30
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,633
I thought late night shifts would be
a piece of cake, but it's very exhausting.

31
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,801
Of course, it is.

32
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,928
I was actually really worried about that.

33
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,348
You had to work late in the night
almost every single day.

34
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,475
You won't need to worry anymore.

35
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,935
I'll be studying in the study room.

36
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,022
But I can't promise you
what time I'll finish.

37
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,315
Is it because...

38
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,694
you don't like me picking you up?

39
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,323
Of course not.
I don't want to burden you, that's why.

40
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,576
Why would I hate it
when my boyfriend is coming to pick me up?

41
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,956
It's just that I want to see you.

42
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,251
It won't matter even if it's late,
so don't hesitate to call me.

43
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,961
I'll be up all night if I have to.

44
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,339
Okay.

45
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,174
Finally, you're smiling.

46
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,384
You're beautiful when you smile.

47
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,387
Let's eat.

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,124
I'll come and meet you, wherever you are.
Call me anytime.

49
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,228
HANSUNG UNIVERSITY

50
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,980
You're heading back now?
I'll see you later.

51
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,773
Okay. Thanks for the cupcakes.

52
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:53,376
Hello, this is Seo Do-hyeon.
Actually, I've called you before.

53
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,922
I was wondering
if I could pay a visit today.

54
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,767
Hello. Are you the person
who called earlier?

55
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,436
Yes.

56
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,363
What?

57
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,660
Why can't I do the moves like them?

58
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,955
Should I even bother
going to this audition?

59
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,583
Jeez.

60
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,805
Hello, Dad.

61
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,682
Are you alive?

62
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,980
Well, I guess that's why
I'm able to take your call.

63
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,940
You are so cheeky.

64
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,529
I heard from your mom
that you're staying at Tae-o's place.

65
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,115
That's right.

66
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,076
You had the nerve to run out
in your underwear.

67
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,619
So, tell me what you've accomplished.

68
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,331
Well, I don't have anything
in particular...

69
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,457
Gosh.

70
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,919
Are you still practicing
your singing or acting, whatever it is?

71
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,924
Well, yes...

72
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,802
I'll set a date and let you know.

73
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,261
Let's grab some lunch.

74
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,806
-With me?
-Who else, you fool?

75
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,601
Wear something nice.
Borrow Tae-o's clothes if you have to.

76
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,468
Now that I think about it,

77
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,304
I don't see why I should be avoiding you.

78
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,195
Don't get the wrong idea.

79
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,075
I'm not sitting here because
I want to get back together with you.

80
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,618
I know that.

81
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:38,958
Say it.

82
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,836
Say whatever it is you're so eager
to tell me.

83
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,259
I'm sorry.

84
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,726
Is there nothing else you want to say?

85
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,481
I messed up.

86
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,985
You were right about
what you said that day.

87
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,823
The situation wasn't an issue.
It was me who was the problem.

88
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,993
I was oblivious to the things
I should have seen.

89
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,205
Because I turned a blind eye
to my true feelings...

90
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,708
I ended up hurting others.

91
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,338
I'm just...

92
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,132
a scumbag.

93
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,888
Do you know your feelings now?

94
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,807
Yes.

95
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,107
Does your friend know, too?

96
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,532
You're right. You really are a scumbag.

97
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,784
I don't see the point
in giving you an earful.

98
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,499
I've been the center of attention
for most of my life.

99
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,501
I sound full of myself, don't I?

100
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,628
No. I'm sure that's how it's been.

101
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,259
That is precisely
what I like about you. I mean...

102
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,761
it's what I liked about you.

103
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,722
To me, you didn't appear to have
an ulterior motive.

104
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:23,145
I think that was why your compliments
for the most trivial things...

105
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,606
made me feel special.

106
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,819
That's why I feel so betrayed.

107
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,572
You've hurt me big-time.

108
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,032
-I'm really--
-I don't want to hear it.

109
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,702
I don't want to hear your apologies.

110
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,375
You should still come to the film club.

111
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,671
To be frank, we didn't do much
as a couple, anyway.

112
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,631
Our relationship wasn't serious either.

113
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,306
But I can't just leave like this.

114
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,895
You deserve a slap in the face.

115
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,189
What?

116
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,818
Sure, if that's what you want.

117
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,793
You're cute, I'll give you that.

118
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,228
-Try to make it simpler. Okay?
-Yes, sir.

119
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,731
Be careful with that superglue.

120
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,650
-Okay.
-It might end up messing up your work.

121
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,444
Let's take a look at your models.

122
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,114
I think it would be better
to go without the roof.

123
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,949
On the whole, it's great.

124
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,077
-But it's hard to spot its key image.
-How's it going?

125
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,578
When are you going to be done?

126
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,915
It'll take a while. You should just go.

127
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,125
They're spaced out
a bit awkwardly, don't you think?

128
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,126
I'll call you later.

129
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,254
As for the first floor, they don't
have to be accurately consistent.

130
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:13,923
Look here.

131
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,911
I'm done now.

132
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,414
Did you get home safely?

133
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,125
Text me when you wake up.

134
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,302
Hello?

135
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,643
Do-hyeon.

136
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,070
Drink this. It's still warm.

137
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,034
Were you waiting outside?
You should have come inside the building.

138
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,287
I was in the study room the whole time.
Don't worry.

139
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,788
But, still,

140
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,791
I'd have told you to come in if I knew
you were still waiting for me.

141
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,339
Gosh. Your hand is as cold as ice.

142
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,429
I didn't notice the cold.

143
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,473
I couldn't wait to see you.

144
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,935
I'm glad I waited.
It feels great to see you.

145
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,688
Do-hyeon.

146
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:57,359
-Yes?
-You don't have to try too hard for me.

147
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,619
It feels like you're pushing yourself
too hard to cheer me up.

148
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,871
You don't have to do that.

149
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,207
I'm not pushing myself.
I'm simply doing what I can.

150
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,375
Don't feel uncomfortable.

151
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,173
What did the professor say
about your model? Did he praise your work?

152
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,133
Well...

153
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,512
he yelled at me when he saw my model.

154
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,596
Because it was flawless.

155
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,431
And?

156
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,351
I had to make it less perfect,
which is why it took me so long.

157
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,687
All right. Let's go.

158
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,941
It's warm. Thanks for the tea.

159
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,329
Hey! Put on something else.

160
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,206
I've been saving that
so it doesn't crease.

161
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,332
Go easy on me just once.

162
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,584
I have an important audition to go to.

163
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,920
An audition? For what role?

164
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,880
I may be worthless now,

165
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,800
but before long,
I shall become a big star.

166
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,593
Today is the day I meet my dad.

167
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,721
I don't know what got into him,
but he's buying me lunch.

168
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,266
It's today? Just relax
and have a nice lunch with him.

169
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,768
Are you going out somewhere?

170
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,562
Yes. I'm hanging out with someone.

171
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,066
Do you have anyone to hang out with
other than us?

172
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,234
Of course.

173
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,696
I've got my own friends too,
just like you guys do.

174
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,575
You haven't known them
long enough to call them friends.

175
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,661
There's this weird social workshop
she's been going to lately.

176
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,705
She's been going there
practically every day.

177
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:36,041
It's not weird, okay?
It's similar to Tae-o's house

178
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,420
in the sense that it provides
accommodation to those who need it.

179
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:43,007
To be clear, I'd say extortion
fits the description in my case.

180
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,885
Come on, I know you like having us here.

181
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,847
I should get going now.

182
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,057
Come home before dinnertime
so we can eat together.

183
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,309
I'll think about it.

184
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,436
You'll think about it?

185
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,023
Wow, is Ga-rin ditching me
for those people?

186
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,983
This is ridiculous.

187
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,027
-See you later.
-Okay.

188
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,159
Where are you?
At the liberal arts building?

189
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,290
I'm at home. I didn't go to class.

190
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,211
Are you feeling unwell?

191
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,091
I've been attending classes
too diligently these days.

192
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,801
It was about time I skipped some.

193
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,690
Oh, you're here.

194
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,651
Hello, Dad.

195
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,195
Couldn't you have been more punctual?

196
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,780
Sit here.

197
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,157
He's my son.

198
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,243
You're far more handsome than
what I was told.

199
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:54,912
Thank you.

200
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,747
Of course he does. He takes after me.

201
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,125
He's a friend of mine. Greet him properly.

202
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,377
Of course.

203
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,005
Hello. My name is Choe Hun.

204
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,507
Hi. Have a seat.

205
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,841
Thank you.

206
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,139
Your dad tells me that
you're quite a pain in the neck.

207
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,309
That expression doesn't do him justice.
He really drives me up the wall.

208
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,856
Your dad is certainly
doing everything he can

209
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,233
for your welfare, isn't he?

210
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:26,944
Pardon?

211
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,160
Taewon Cultural Foundation?

212
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,120
That's right.

213
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,580
It's a cultural foundation
run by Taewon Group.

214
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,667
-This guy here is the president.
-I see.

215
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,920
Shouldn't you be treating me
with more respect in front of your son?

216
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,088
Then what?

217
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,465
Must I call you "sir" when
we've been friends since college?

218
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,635
You need to work on
getting on my good side.

219
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,055
-Don't you know what this meal is for?
-Of course I do.

220
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,850
Don't you know how much this meal costs?

221
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,272
Your dad is quite a shameless man.

222
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,942
He hadn't called me for months,
but the first thing he asks of me

223
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,403
is to meet his son.

224
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,990
You talk as if I've completely been
out of touch.

225
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,284
I spent a lot on gifts
for your family events.

226
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,995
Can't you take a joke?

227
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,623
Anyway, let's get to the point.

228
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:28,213
Our foundation recently decided to
invest in a musical called Haeoreum.

229
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,424
-Have you heard of it?
-Yes.

230
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,802
I've heard it's a masterpiece
among all the musicals in the country.

231
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,221
You can definitely say that again.

232
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,806
The production cost was 15 billion won.

233
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,434
If you include overseas production,
20 billion won in total.

234
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,643
That's amazing.

235
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,188
You still have that habit
of intimidating people with money.

236
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,856
What do you mean? It's not even my money.

237
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,777
So, do you think you can do a good job?

238
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,322
-Pardon?
-Can you do well if I get you a role?

239
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,076
Stop hesitating and answer him.

240
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,790
As far as I know,

241
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,043
the audition for Haeoreum
ended quite some time ago.

242
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,211
How could I...

243
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,963
Well, when one comes in,
one will have to go out.

244
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,674
There's no need to worry.

245
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,676
The ensemble will consist of
at least 50 people,

246
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,638
so it's hardly noticeable
even if there is a replacement.

247
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,854
Stop filming! I need to finish it
before Dad comes back.

248
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,231
Hey, are you back?

249
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,903
-Hey!
-Are the guys not home?

250
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,203
What the... What are you doing here?

251
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,955
You're looking at me as if I'm a stranger.

252
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,543
I was just passing by.
I had something to give you, anyway.

253
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:57,928
Here.

254
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,357
Why did you bring this back?

255
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,651
You can just keep it.

256
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,945
I can't do that. It's yours.

257
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:15,946
Gosh.

258
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,241
You've always used my things
as you please anyway.

259
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,036
Not too long ago, you roamed about
this house as if you were the owner.

260
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,121
Don't you remember?

261
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,666
Well, since you're here as a guest,
I'll treat you like one.

262
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,172
-Want anything to drink?
-Anything warm will do.

263
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:38,886
What were you watching?

264
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,764
Oh, that?

265
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,605
Isn't that you?
It's when you were in high school, right?

266
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,483
Hey.

267
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,320
Your level of self-love is morbidly high.

268
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,739
I'm making a video for a contest, okay?

269
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,034
My growth diary is a means of
examining the universality of time.

270
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,118
That's the basic concept.

271
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,748
Is it the one you've been preparing
with Se-hyeon?

272
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,749
Yes.

273
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,878
I put a lot of effort into making it, but
it sucks that it all went down the drain.

274
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,673
So, I was just watching it on my own.

275
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,966
What do you mean by that?

276
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,311
-Did you guys fight again?
-We broke up.

277
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,989
Here you go.

278
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:45,911
Is it because of me?

279
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,080
Yes.

280
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,922
Aren't you overrating yourself
a bit right now?

281
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,176
Do you consider yourself
a woman with intoxicating charms?

282
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,888
Did you have to interpret it like that?

283
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,851
We broke up for other reasons.

284
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,105
It's not because of you,
so don't feel guilty about it.

285
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,276
If you're interested,
would you like to watch it?

286
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:22,406
It would be nice to have at least
one person as an audience.

287
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,952
Fine, play it.

288
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,707
Are you ready to witness my masterpiece?

289
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,793
I'm ready as I'll ever be
to make fun of your work.

290
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,676
Peekaboo!

291
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,014
Aren't you Tae-o, little one?

292
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,350
I'm going to tickle you!

293
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:55,939
Thanks for the meal.

294
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,065
Good.

295
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,776
Don't forget to do that favor
I asked of you.

296
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,528
Got it, buddy. I'll call you.

297
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,282
I wish you the best.

298
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,826
I'll contact the producer right away.

299
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,412
-Take care, sir.
-Bye.

300
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,041
-I'm counting on you.
-Don't worry about it.

301
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,792
All right, then.

302
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,970
What are you so disgruntled about?

303
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,222
Do you know how much I spent
to set up this meeting?

304
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,641
You were pouting the whole time.

305
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,728
Aren't you old enough to know
when you should be level-headed?

306
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,229
That was me being level-headed.

307
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,106
What?

308
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,693
I don't need to flatter him. I don't want
to get a job through special treatment.

309
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,905
I was actually happy
when you said you wanted to see me.

310
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,282
I wasn't expecting you
to say anything encouraging.

311
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,700
Regardless, it made me happy.

312
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,413
I wouldn't have shown up had I known
it was for something this ridiculous.

313
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,585
After everything I did,
this is the thanks I get?

314
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,504
You call this ridiculous?

315
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,839
What's so ridiculous about it?

316
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,257
Tell me!

317
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,095
All you did with the privileges I gave you
was drag them into the gutter.

318
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,263
Are you that proud of yourself?

319
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,642
Someone will be kicked out because of me.

320
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,603
It's not even someone you know.
Why should that be your concern?

321
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,939
-I've already done that before.
-What?

322
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,857
I'm telling you that...

323
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,693
I've hurt someone before
just so I could save my own ass.

324
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,862
Do you have any idea
how that drove me crazy?

325
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,116
Stop your nonsense

326
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,702
and take part in that musical
if you want to become an actor

327
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,122
so I can at least save my face.

328
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,374
-No.
-You brat!

329
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,301
I don't want to live like that, Dad.

330
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,886
Let go.

331
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,012
And...

332
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,141
don't you lay a finger on me ever again.

333
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,454
I hope we can get along.

334
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,540
When we were kids,
I thought you were so ugly.

335
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,250
But I have to say you were cute back then.

336
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,919
The stages of my growth
are practically surreal.

337
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,880
I grew up to be as stunning as ever.

338
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,715
You're ridiculous.

339
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:28,925
Lean on this.

340
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,510
Thanks.

341
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,013
All right.

342
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,226
Mission accomplished.

343
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,269
Thanks, Rosie!

344
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,148
I like the clips you've compiled,
but the editing is a bit sloppy.

345
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,358
The transition doesn't seem smooth.
It feels fragmented.

346
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,862
Some parts were edited out. That's why.

347
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,240
-What?
-All the clips...

348
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,701
had you in them.

349
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,121
The final version came out like this...

350
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,459
because I had to edit you out.

351
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,254
I see.

352
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,593
Did you delete all the clips you took out?

353
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,386
No.

354
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,389
I have them saved somewhere.

355
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,478
But I suppose I should get rid of them.

356
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,364
I should go now.
I'll come again when the others are here.

357
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,657
Okay. I'll take you home.

358
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,701
No, it's okay. I can go on my own.

359
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,202
-We also have such activities here.
-I see.

360
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,289
At first, it started off
as a small book cafe.

361
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,083
But it wasn't working out.

362
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,669
I needed something more than that
to attract people's attention.

363
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,630
So I held reading events
of their favorite authors,

364
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,923
as well as book clubs.

365
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,761
Over time, this space gradually
became a place of social gathering.

366
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,056
It's why I decided to stop
running a bookstore

367
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,268
and instead made it into a workshop where
people with the same hobbies can gather.

368
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,811
It's pretty.

369
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,196
Thank you.

370
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,245
By doing this kind of work,

371
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,165
I realized that most people
weren't so good at socializing.

372
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,917
However, by sharing their hobbies

373
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,295
and talking about their everyday lives,

374
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,380
they started to connect with each other.

375
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,304
So it's a window
of communication with the world.

376
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,847
That's correct.

377
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,517
What I'm providing isn't just some space,
but an opportunity for communication.

378
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,770
In that sense, I find it very meaningful.

379
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,774
It's not only meaningful,
but it also gives people happiness.

380
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,784
Excuse me for a second.

381
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,501
Hey, Hun.

382
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,336
What are you doing now?

383
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,962
I'm still at the workshop.

384
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,715
What about you? Did you have a nice lunch
with your dad?

385
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:56,925
Yes.

386
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,928
I went to a super fancy sashimi place.

387
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:05,725
I guess it's pointless to brag about it
since you're used to going to such places.

388
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,810
See?

389
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,479
He just wanted to treat you
to a nice lunch.

390
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,398
Wasn't it nice to catch up for a while?

391
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,818
Are you having fun?

392
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,028
Are the people there nice?

393
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,822
Yes, they're nice.

394
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,032
They did seem surprised

395
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,244
when I told them I don't go to school
and that I live with my friends.

396
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,745
It was fun.

397
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,580
Okay.

398
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:29,874
I see.

399
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,711
Are you okay?

400
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,254
What do you mean?

401
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,507
Your voice sounds a bit...

402
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,970
What about my voice?
It sounds great as usual.

403
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,431
Where are you now?

404
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,142
I'm in the neighborhood.

405
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,478
I'm on my way home.

406
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,523
I'll have some ramyeon when I get home.

407
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:58,236
It's strange. I always crave ramyeon
whenever I eat something expensive.

408
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,989
Should I cook it for you?

409
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,699
No, don't bother.

410
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,076
I can't make you come home for that.

411
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:06,995
I don't want to bother you.

412
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,080
Are you...

413
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,624
really all right?

414
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,794
Hun.

415
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,507
Enjoy your dinner.

416
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,551
I'll see you later.

417
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,052
Hello?

418
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,555
Hun!

419
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,409
CALL LOG

420
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,619
HUN

421
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,442
This feels lonely.

422
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,780
I wish you could've been by my side.

423
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,091
Hun.

424
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,051
Hun.

425
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,636
Darn it.

426
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:03,987
Hun!

427
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,411
Hun.

428
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,455
Hun!

429
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,626
Hun! Oh, dear. I'm so sorry.

430
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:21,880
Hun!

431
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,055
Hey. Ga-rin.

432
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,433
How did you...

433
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,438
Why didn't you tell me?

434
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,693
Why didn't you tell me
that you're in pain?

435
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,111
I mean...

436
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,196
how did you know I was here?

437
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,364
How did you find me?

438
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,533
You called for me.

439
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,160
What?

440
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,871
I never did.

441
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,040
You did, with your heart.

442
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,168
Why didn't you answer my call?

443
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,463
You...

444
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:05,965
heard that?

445
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,467
Yes.

446
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,219
I could totally hear you saying
that you're lonely

447
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,764
and that you're in need of my company.

448
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,642
Did you think I wouldn't know that?

449
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,272
I'm amazed.

450
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:24,984
How did you hear me?

451
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,112
I don't know.

452
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,700
I guess we have a special connection
or something.

453
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,162
-And?
-What?

454
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,414
What are you going to do for me?

455
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:45,171
Well... I haven't thought that far.

456
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,680
Gosh. That must have hurt badly.

457
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,735
You can stop.

458
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,863
-I'll take it from here.
-What?

459
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,772
-Hello.
-Hi.

460
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,694
Where's your mother?

461
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:53,781
Why don't we skip the greeting for today
and just go upstairs?

462
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,866
Why?

463
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,159
She's in a really bad mood.

464
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,875
Throw all of them out.

465
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,419
But that would be such a waste.

466
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,297
They are big and look fresh.

467
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,674
I told you to get rid of them!

468
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,010
Throw that box out as well.

469
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,804
-Yes, ma'am.
-Let's go up.

470
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:18,931
Come on.

471
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,105
MATH MOCK EXAM
YUN YEONG-HO

472
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,991
You managed to get
all the easier ones correct.

473
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,159
You did well.

474
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,120
You should keep this up
until the final exams.

475
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,706
I will only get my bonus if you do well.

476
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,168
It's fascinating to see that I'm capable
of getting the answers correct.

477
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,878
Is this the power of private tutoring?

478
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,005
Climbing up from the very bottom
isn't so hard to do.

479
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,549
Don't get too carried away.
Let's look at the incorrect ones.

480
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,343
We'll go over them
and solve them one by one.

481
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,260
Okay.

482
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,309
Why is your mother upset, by the way?

483
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,269
She seemed quite furious.

484
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,521
I don't know.

485
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,731
She got a parcel just a while ago.

486
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,067
She's been in a bad mood ever since then.

487
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,984
A parcel?

488
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,905
Yes. She does get sensitive like that
from time to time.

489
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,406
I see.

490
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,120
Keep solving it.
I need to use the bathroom.

491
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,204
All right.

492
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,054
Has everything been all right for you?

493
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:43,724
What?

494
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,645
I'm asking if things are okay with Song-i.

495
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,523
Yes, they are.

496
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,608
Tae-o and I broke up.

497
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,946
That's how much of an impact
that day had on us.

498
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:02,660
It seems...

499
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,787
it was that way for you.

500
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,040
You don't seem like the slow type.

501
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,545
There are issues
that you can choose to ignore...

502
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,299
and others you need to face head-on.

503
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,552
I did the latter.

504
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,598
I'm kind of curious
how you'll be tackling it.

505
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,809
After all, we're in the same position.

506
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,645
Well, then...

507
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,248
How long am I supposed to live
in that woman's shadow?

508
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,292
This is different from what you promised.

509
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,835
How is it different?

510
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,754
You knew that she and I would talk

511
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,506
from time to time to update
each other on how things are going.

512
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,383
You said only until
Tae-o becomes an adult.

513
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,552
How many years has it been since then?

514
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,972
Do you know how disgusted I felt
when she sent us that parcel?

515
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,224
It's called moral duty.

516
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:09,018
Doesn't a parent have the right
to know how her child is doing?

517
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,354
She gave up on that
so-called moral duty and ran away.

518
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,565
She's using her son as an excuse
to cling on to you!

519
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,858
You know that yourself.

520
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:16,943
It's nothing like that.

521
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:20,112
She'd have stormed in here and
demanded her son if that were the reason.

522
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,991
Are you taking her side?

523
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:27,245
-Are you even listening to yourself?
-This is exactly why I don't like Tae-o.

524
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,290
Whenever I see his face, I can't help
but be reminded of that woman!

525
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,965
Song-i.

526
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,345
What did you say just now?

527
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,433
Who are you referring to as "that woman"?

528
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,146
The woman you were just talking about...

529
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,691
Is she...

530
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,778
Tae-o's mother?

531
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,748
Is Tae-o's mother...

532
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,501
alive?

533
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,058
We need to talk.
I'll head over to your place.

534
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:41,736
I'm not sure where to even begin
to help you understand all this.

535
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,904
I don't understand.

536
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:50,578
This isn't a matter of understanding.

537
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,499
She's been alive all this time, yet you...

538
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,129
I did think it was odd.

539
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,924
It was odd that Tae-o's mother...

540
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:08,346
was buried in a redeveloped location
of all places.

541
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,976
It didn't add up, no matter
how much I thought about it.

542
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,106
So I just assumed that
you must have had...

543
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,067
your reasons.

544
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:24,945
Then is it also a lie

545
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,823
that Tae-o's mother used to be very ill?

546
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,828
Yes.

547
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,538
How could you?

548
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,124
She's his mother.
How could you deceive him like that?

549
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,710
It was her decision.

550
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,922
Tae-o's mother wanted to...

551
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,966
disappear from Tae-o's as well as my life.

552
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,803
It's not me who's keeping them separated.

553
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,388
Then what's the reason?

554
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,182
Her family members were not sane at all.

555
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,520
Her parents and her siblings...

556
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,564
came to this house nonstop
and demanded money--

557
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,191
It's not necessary to give such details.

558
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,402
I don't care anymore.

559
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,279
You take care of this mess.

560
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,496
Please don't tell Tae-o about this.

561
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:18,999
I'm afraid I can't do that.

562
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,835
Song-i.

563
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,628
How could you do this to him?

564
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,924
I grew up watching him
miss his mother so much,

565
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,635
when he couldn't even remember her face.

566
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,888
Did you have to go that far to lie to him?

567
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,724
How could you say she's dead
when she's alive and well?

568
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,101
It was for the best.

569
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,186
You should have thought
of a better alternative.

570
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,691
I can't lie to him.

571
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,152
I can never do something...

572
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,571
so cruel to him.

573
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:49,738
So...

574
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,199
what is your plan?

575
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,786
I will tell him the truth,

576
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,915
that his mother is still alive.

577
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,461
And are you going to add that
she abandoned him?

578
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,928
Look, I am Tae-o's dad.

579
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:17,224
What child would be okay after hearing
that he was abandoned by his own parent?

580
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,315
You may think I'm being coldhearted.

581
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,568
Tae-o is who he is now

582
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,946
because this was the best decision
we could make for him.

583
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,072
I believe...

584
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,158
he's grown into a decent man.

585
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,076
I have no regrets.

586
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,249
I know that you are his best friend,

587
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,169
but you're not his family.

588
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:52,384
It's a family matter that doesn't concern
you and deserves to be kept a secret.

589
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,264
I advise you not to cross the line,
unless you can take full responsibility

590
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,308
for your actions.

591
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,786
We need to talk.

592
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,090
What did you come
all the way here to talk about?

593
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,093
Well...

594
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,680
I couldn't think of
a better place to meet.

595
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,393
My dad suggested...

596
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,230
we close the restaurant
and move to Seosan.

597
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,441
It's where my uncle is staying.

598
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,406
My family is struggling financially.

599
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,117
It's much worse than what I'd anticipated.

600
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,955
Isn't this too sudden?

601
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,332
Moving to Seosan is
the reasonable thing to do.

602
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,335
The situation is quite urgent.

603
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,753
What about school?

604
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,006
I'll have to take a leave of absence...

605
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,050
and leave this town.

606
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,644
I wanted to know...

607
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,856
what your face would be like...

608
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,859
and what you'd say when I told you this.

609
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,407
The Tae-o I know is a person
who is very honest about his feelings.

610
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,535
I wasn't sure if you could...

611
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,079
do the same in front of me.

612
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,290
-What do you mean?
-You know what I'm talking about.

613
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,836
I'm asking about your feelings.

614
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,307
I tried getting rid of my feelings...

615
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,187
but I failed.

616
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,112
To me...

617
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,991
Song-i means too much to me.

618
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,912
So I couldn't ignore my feelings...

619
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,624
nor could I conceal them.

620
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,128
My feelings for her...

621
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,302
I can't seem to control them.

622
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,270
I'm not interested in
how you'll act upon your feelings.

623
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,857
But be sure of one thing:
Make a clear decision.

624
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,528
If you're going to deal with it head-on,
tell her how you feel.

625
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,364
I'm confident she'll choose me.

626
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:04,952
If you're going to give up...

627
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,788
do whatever it takes to do that.

628
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,457
I don't want to see you...

629
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,293
have any lingering feelings for her.

630
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,286
Is something wrong?

631
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,793
What is it?

632
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,965
I can't tell you.

633
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,222
What about you?

634
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,849
Is something wrong?

635
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,770
I can't...

636
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,482
tell you either.

637
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:04,655
Not yet.

638
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,586
