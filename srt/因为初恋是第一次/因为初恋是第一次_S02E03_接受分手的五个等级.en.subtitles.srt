1
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,980
Don't go, Song-i.

2
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:30,822
I understand why you're saying that.

3
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,492
It's because you're sorry, right?

4
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,745
Don't worry about it.

5
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,122
Yu-rim's house is close to school anyway.

6
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,337
Where will you go
when her parents come back?

7
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,758
I'll look for a place to stay.
There are lots of cheap rooms near campus.

8
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,635
Don't go to such shabby places.
Just stay at my place.

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,679
You should've treated me better then.

10
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,932
You nagged at me for not cleaning
the house and using too much water.

11
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,228
I won't do that anymore.

12
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,065
You must be serious about
not wanting me to go.

13
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,650
But I've already made up my mind.

14
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,236
I'll clean up the attic before I move out.

15
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:27,212
Everyone, delicious tteokbokki is ready

16
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,298
Ta-da! Where's the applause?

17
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,928
Hey, this looks delicious. Thanks!

18
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,429
Enjoy.

19
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:37,847
Looks good.

20
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,021
You guys are all good now?

21
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,314
-Yes.
-No.

22
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,026
Ga-rin.

23
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,280
Becoming a famous musical actor
isn't the primary goal of my life now.

24
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,616
Earning your trust back
is my first priority.

25
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,618
I'll be good to you from now on, okay?

26
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,662
We'll see about that.

27
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,333
But seriously,
this tteokbokki tastes amazing.

28
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,543
You're a good cook.

29
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,170
I'm good at anything
as long as I put my mind to it.

30
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,338
You should have some too.

31
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,257
No, thanks.

32
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,592
Why? You love late-night snacks.

33
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,302
I don't have the appetite.

34
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,305
I think I know why.

35
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,516
Se-hyeon dumped you for good, didn't she?

36
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,060
No, it's nothing like that.

37
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,520
Then what is it?

38
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,897
Could it be that...

39
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,942
she's mad at you
for letting all of us live with you?

40
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,613
No wonder you got dumped.

41
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,284
It's hard to fix a relationship
based on lies.

42
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,871
I said we didn't break up!

43
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,038
The denial phase!

44
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,083
It's the first phase you go through
before you accept the truth.

45
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,627
"We didn't break up!"

46
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,462
You refuse to accept the truth.

47
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,964
Next comes anger!

48
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,049
"How dare you do this to me?"

49
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,385
Then comes bargaining.

50
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,638
"I'll be good to you from now on."

51
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,182
After that, it's depression.

52
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:10,231
Your heart plummets to the lowest point
it can possibly reach...

53
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,568
until you finally come to terms with...

54
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,738
the fact that the breakup is real.

55
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,910
You, my friend, are in the denial stage.

56
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,872
Cut the crap
and just eat the damn tteokbokki.

57
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,373
Jeez.

58
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,626
He's way too sensitive.

59
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,837
As for Se-hyeon, don't you think

60
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,715
she should be proud of her boyfriend
for taking in his friends

61
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,926
who have nowhere to go?

62
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,512
I have to agree with that.

63
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,940
THE FIVE STAGES OF GRIEF
IN A RELATIONSHIP

64
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,191
This doesn't taste bad.

65
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,778
Right? It's all yours.
You can finish it all.

66
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,374
It was just a dream.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,254
Because that's what dreams are like.
Full of nonsensical events.

68
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,270
What the...

69
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,815
You're a mess.

70
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,858
Is my face that puffy?

71
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,319
It's because of the tteokbokki
I had before bed.

72
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,570
Move.

73
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,495
Oh, darn it.

74
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,004
It's tteokbokki sauce.

75
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,136
Is my face that swollen?

76
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,266
It's the change of season

77
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,976
that's causing the mood swing.

78
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,186
It happens to men when winter comes.

79
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,107
It must be the drop in temperature
that's making me feel...

80
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,318
Could it be due to lack of sleep?

81
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,235
Tae-o.

82
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,408
Why are you talking to yourself?

83
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,328
Oh, it's nothing.

84
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,167
I heard Song-i will be moving out.

85
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,171
She told you already?

86
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,172
Yes.

87
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,970
To be honest, I didn't like the fact
that Song-i was living at your place.

88
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,309
You might think I'm narrow-minded,

89
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,228
but as her boyfriend,
it couldn't be helped.

90
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,190
As her boyfriend?

91
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,151
I'll walk her home often.

92
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,697
I'll make sure she doesn't
go home late, so don't worry.

93
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,121
Okay.
I'm sure you'll take care of her well.

94
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:16,834
Isn't this what's best for you as well?
It'll be good news for your girlfriend.

95
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,504
I guess.

96
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,265
I brought coffee to keep you guys going.

97
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,227
I was just craving some coffee.

98
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,105
Tae-o is one quick-witted newbie.
He does his part so well.

99
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,398
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

100
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,233
Perfect timing.

101
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,359
Totally.

102
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,032
-So, basically...
-Go on.

103
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,540
Can we talk?

104
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,835
There's nothing to talk about.

105
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:00,878
It won't take long.

106
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,590
Shall we have our coffee outside?

107
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,883
-Shall we?
-Sure.

108
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,428
Hot coffee tastes better in the cold.

109
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,846
Exactly.

110
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,389
Great.

111
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,161
What is it that you want to say?

112
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,372
About the film
you asked me about before...

113
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,500
My growth diary.

114
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,712
I'll have a go at editing it.

115
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,216
-Really?
-Yes.

116
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,429
I only have clips of me
up until I was four.

117
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,348
The rest of them are from when I was 12.

118
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,142
Do you mind the big gap?

119
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,480
No, that should still be fine.

120
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,106
That's good.

121
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,484
Is that all?

122
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,405
Song-i will be moving out shortly.

123
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,119
Did you tell her to leave?

124
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,039
Not exactly.

125
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,793
She said it herself,
that she'll stay at her friend's.

126
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:24,921
Well...

127
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,590
I guess she'd feel more comfortable
that way too.

128
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,884
Since she has a boyfriend.

129
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,847
The other guys will continue
to stay at my place in the meantime.

130
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,184
There's not much I can do at this point.

131
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,812
I can understand that.

132
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,149
It wouldn't be easy for you to
have all three move out at once.

133
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,652
So...

134
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:49,862
Go on.

135
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:54,283
I hope this makes you feel less upset.

136
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,373
Did it bother you a lot?

137
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,544
Yes, because I felt sorry.

138
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,590
Let's not talk about it anymore.

139
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,594
Can you take a look at this?

140
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,512
Sure.

141
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,687
I found a video online that captures
a similar vibe to what we're looking for.

142
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:36,117
Okay, so look here.
This is the basic equation of a function.

143
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,203
If you know the slope of the linear
function and the coordinates of...

144
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,832
Hey.

145
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,542
You need to focus.

146
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,754
Can't we cut class just for today?
My parents aren't here anyway.

147
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,506
Did they go somewhere?

148
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,508
To Jeju Island to play golf.

149
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,219
You're staying in this huge house
all by yourself?

150
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,389
The helper is around,
so technically I'm not alone.

151
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,726
Why not ask Tae-o to come over?

152
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,270
You have no idea
how much he hates this place.

153
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,357
But this is his home.

154
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,485
He doesn't consider this place home.
Home is where he lives now.

155
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,362
The one he grew up in
with his birth mother.

156
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,032
Is that what Tae-o said?

157
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,117
Yes, when he moved out of here.

158
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,661
He said being there makes him
feel like his mom will return.

159
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,040
I know it doesn't make sense,

160
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,667
but I understand why he feels that way.

161
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,795
His mom isn't buried in a cemetery,
nor at a columbarium.

162
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,840
They said her ashes
were scattered on some mountain.

163
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,551
But it's gone now
because it underwent redevelopment.

164
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,307
I see.

165
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,564
How does it taste? Is it good?

166
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,157
It's really good. It's so good!

167
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,118
Do you really have to leave?

168
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,454
Why can't you stay
and continue to take care of us?

169
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,500
It's time I moved out. You guys aren't
going to stay here forever too.

170
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,760
I'll drop by often, so don't be too sad.

171
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,973
I could tell you're a good cook
after tasting the teokkbokki...

172
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,059
-Oh my gosh!
-Hey!

173
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,018
-Hey!
-Song-i!

174
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:26,977
Are you all right?

175
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,521
-I'm okay.
-Don't touch it.

176
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,480
Don't come close.

177
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,692
I'll bring the broom.
Don't touch it, okay?

178
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,776
Okay.

179
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,570
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

180
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,783
Oh, gosh...

181
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,118
What's wrong?

182
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,328
It's dangerous, so don't come close.

183
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,496
Let me see.

184
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,541
Gosh.

185
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,127
It's just a small cut. I'm all right.

186
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,545
I'll bring the first aid kit.

187
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,637
I wanted to make some side dishes
before moving out.

188
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,307
I was putting them in a bowl,
but accidentally dropped it.

189
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,310
Who asked you to make all these?

190
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,022
Cleaning the house properly
would have been enough.

191
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,108
You just made a bigger mess!

192
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,113
Tae-o, she cooked all these
for you, you know.

193
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,699
Look, I'm going to clean it up.

194
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,161
I'll clean every single piece,
so don't worry.

195
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,123
You better not leave
any trace of the mess.

196
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,551
Anger.

197
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,803
That's the second phase.

198
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,390
Don't be too upset.

199
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,643
Getting hypersensitive is what
a rocky relationship does to you.

200
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,655
Did she have to make it so obvious
that she's been wanting to leave?

201
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,662
Is anyone home?

202
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,333
Do-hyeon, what brings you here?

203
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,709
Hey, what's up?

204
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,087
My girlfriend's moving out,
so I'm here to pick her up.

205
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,922
-Your girlfriend?
-What?

206
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,008
You're here.

207
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,265
What?

208
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,891
You two?

209
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,142
Are you guys really going out?

210
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,770
Yes.

211
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,691
Hey, Tae-o. Did you know
that Do-hyeon and Song-i are dating?

212
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,651
You're up.

213
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,278
Hey.

214
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,449
I thought we were close.

215
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,202
-You. How did...
-How could you not tell me about him?

216
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,247
I'm sorry. I was going to tell you
when we were in Gangneung.

217
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,833
But things got a bit crazy
since then, so...

218
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,002
You were together even back then?

219
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,920
We were holding hands in the backseat.

220
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:40,921
Are you serious?

221
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,133
-This is crazy.
-That's so romantic.

222
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,634
Did you finish packing?

223
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:50,556
I did. If there's anything I left behind,
let me know. I'll come back for it.

224
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,349
Bye then.

225
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,189
He tries not to show it,
but you can tell he's disappointed.

226
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,193
Let's all meet up sometime later.
We'll talk more then.

227
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,780
Sure. But, really, I can't believe
you didn't drop a single hint.

228
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,741
I feel betrayed.
You should know I'm a bit upset.

229
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,993
We could have taken a cab.

230
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,245
It's fine. It's just nearby.

231
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,666
What's that, by the way?

232
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,792
This?

233
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,421
A gift.

234
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,675
It's so cute!

235
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,972
I thought it'd make you feel less lonely,
since your friends won't be around.

236
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,556
You could cuddle it when you sleep.

237
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,309
Thanks, I'll do that when I go to bed.

238
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,109
What are you going to do
after Yu-rim's parents come back?

239
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,530
I'll rent a room that's close to school.

240
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,700
I've heard there are lots of
women-only share houses these days.

241
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,784
Want me to look into it?

242
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,202
I already did,

243
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,830
but it doesn't fit my budget.
I'll figure something out.

244
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,709
As long as there's space to sleep,
I'm good. You don't have to worry.

245
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,670
How can I not be worried
when it concerns you?

246
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,215
I don't want to worry about
what hasn't even happened.

247
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,093
My mom might come back before then.
Who knows?

248
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,179
It'll work out eventually.

249
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,194
You've had these emotions before.

250
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,531
It'll pass by just like the wind.

251
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,244
These feelings are just temporary.

252
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,458
5 MILLION WON HAS BEEN DEPOSITED
TO CHOE HUN'S BANK ACCOUNT

253
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,300
Choe Hun, you idiot.

254
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,970
I should have told her about the money
before making the tteokbokki.

255
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,472
Jeez.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,185
Okay, just mention it really casually.

257
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,644
Let it flow smoothly.

258
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,313
You can do it, Hun.

259
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,315
You can do it.

260
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,707
What are you doing, Ga-rin?

261
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,710
What do you want?

262
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,802
Aren't you feeling hungry?

263
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,513
Do you want to get some air
and grab something to eat?

264
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,890
Stop trying to appease me with food.

265
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,642
I won't fall for it.

266
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,187
Besides, I don't have
much money left to eat out.

267
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,564
You? Short on money?

268
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,943
I'm pretty sure
this purse was full of money.

269
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,569
Why do I only have this much left?

270
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,408
Come to think of it, I didn't receive
my paycheck because of you.

271
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,036
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,372
Darn it.

273
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,208
How could you have used up
all that money already?

274
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,544
Ga-rin,

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,797
if you want to stand on your own two feet,
stop spending lavishly.

276
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,882
What did you do
with all that money you had?

277
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,592
Jeez.

278
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,973
And who was the person that ate
like a pig when I bought the groceries?

279
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,768
Don't you remember how you got
super excited when I bought you guys meat?

280
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,437
Did I?

281
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:18,866
Hey, Ga-rin.

282
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,452
Is all your stuff expensive?

283
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,954
I guess so.

284
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,791
I think I can help you...

285
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,502
earn emergency funds.

286
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,132
What?

287
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,683
Do people actually buy stuff
that I've used?

288
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,560
Yes, I told you already.

289
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:50,314
I sold my games and sneakers
whenever I needed emergency cash.

290
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,441
You took very good care of them.

291
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:56,278
They don't have any scratches
and look as if they've hardly been used.

292
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,781
We'd like to get top dollar
for these items.

293
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,408
You can probably tell...

294
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,078
that you'll make a lot of money
by keeping her as your patron.

295
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,542
Please wait while we determine
the appraised value of the goods.

296
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,337
In the meantime,
could you fill out this form?

297
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,630
What is this?

298
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,757
It's to keep a record of our customers.

299
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,259
We need your address and phone number

300
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,928
in case there are any issues.

301
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,143
Hold on.

302
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,355
We're going to keep one of these purses.

303
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,607
Ga-rin, pick just one.

304
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,567
Just one?

305
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,819
Yes, the one that's most precious to you.

306
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,155
We'll need it to put the money in, right?

307
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,509
Does it make you that sad?

308
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,471
It wasn't something I had expected.

309
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,557
I didn't get to say
a proper goodbye to them.

310
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,107
Come with me.

311
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,739
I'm not in the mood to look around.

312
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,034
It'll help you forget about them.

313
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,329
They're not as high quality as yours
but try picking one you like.

314
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,416
I'll get you the prettiest one.

315
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,044
-You don't have to do that.
-In that case, I'll pick one out.

316
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,548
Let's see...

317
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,514
Hey. Are you in bed?

318
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,767
Aren't you going to sleep?

319
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,268
I will, soon.

320
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,313
Does the new place feel unfamiliar?

321
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:37,981
Yes.

322
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,109
I've slept on my own all the time,
but it feels kind of lonely today.

323
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,653
Maybe because it's your first night.

324
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,449
So, I'm cuddled up with the doll
you gave me.

325
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,867
It helps.

326
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,788
Don't think too much.
Try to get some sleep.

327
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,374
-I'll call you in the morning.
-Okay.

328
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,084
Good night.

329
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,794
Okay, you too.

330
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,640
TAE-O

331
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,852
He doesn't even bother to check
to see if I moved in okay.

332
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,147
He doesn't deserve
to call me his best friend.

333
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,991
Are you heading out?

334
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,326
Yes.

335
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,495
You should come home earlier.

336
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,455
You've been out late recently.

337
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,961
By the way, you said that you met the girl

338
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,879
who used to live here before, right?

339
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,882
Why do you ask that?

340
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,093
Hold on a second.

341
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,098
We've got mail addressed to
an unknown person.

342
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,559
I think it might be for her.

343
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,477
It says, "Speeding ticket."

344
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,854
JEONJU WANSAN POLICE STATION

345
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,816
Doesn't it seem like
it's addressed to her mom?

346
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:07,195
From the way I saw it, it seemed like
she lost touch with her mom.

347
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,033
I'll hold on to this for now.

348
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,618
We go to the same school.

349
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,870
Really?

350
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,955
That's great. You can pass it on to her.

351
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,683
Don't you want a drink?

352
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,643
No, I'm fine, thanks.

353
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,277
If it's about me living at Tae-o's,

354
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,656
-I moved out.
-I didn't ask you to come because of that.

355
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,536
Regarding that,
I already heard from Tae-o.

356
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,049
I got this mail.

357
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,592
TO: KIM SEUNG-HUI

358
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,927
And I think it's for you.

359
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,554
For me?

360
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,934
Isn't your mother's name Kim Seung-hui?

361
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,229
Yes.

362
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:23,897
I was right.

363
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,609
I don't know the details,

364
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,279
but I hope it will help you
get in touch with your mom.

365
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,698
Thank you.

366
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,208
SPEEDING VIOLATION
LOCATION: PUNGNAM GATE INTERSECTION

367
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,045
I said I won't be coming.
Stop calling me for the time being.

368
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,091
Was Mom seeing someone?

369
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,638
I think I've done my part, so I should go.

370
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,145
So, where are you staying now?

371
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,065
At a friend's.

372
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,026
Her parents are currently away traveling.

373
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,154
I see.

374
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,464
-Do-hyeon.
-Yes?

375
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,757
Are you free tonight?

376
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,760
What time?
I have work late in the evening.

377
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,096
It's not that late. Around seven?

378
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,390
A high school senior of mine

379
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,475
passed his grade seven civil servant test
two years ago.

380
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,020
We're going to have some beers tonight.
You should join us.

381
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,896
You're studying for the same test,

382
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,857
so you could get some pointers.

383
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,734
-May I?
-Of course.

384
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,194
I'll text you when we decide on a place.

385
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,988
-Let me know, thanks.
-Okay.

386
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,401
Hey, Song-i.

387
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,321
Are you out?

388
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,866
Yes, I'm meeting a senior of mine

389
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,327
for some drinks before going to work.

390
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,871
A senior from our school?

391
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:45,830
Yes.

392
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,709
Do-hyeon!

393
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,419
I'll call you later.

394
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,671
Okay.

395
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,838
Bye.

396
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,635
-Hello.
-Hi.

397
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,888
-Nice to meet you.
-Same here.

398
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,391
-What time did you arrive?
-Just now.

399
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,485
My winter uniform
is finally out of the closet.

400
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,365
I have to say I look very handsome
even on camera.

401
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,076
The dog is barking out of jealousy.

402
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,078
Hey, Song-i.

403
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,290
Tae-o.

404
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,960
You look pretty good
in your winter uniform.

405
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,506
DUMB SONG

406
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,394
Hey.

407
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,562
Are you busy?

408
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,689
A bit. I'm editing some stuff.

409
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,691
Okay then.

410
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,693
I won't disturb you.

411
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,595
PROJECT: NO TITLE
GROWTH DIARY 2

412
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,763
CUT

413
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,226
CUT

414
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,846
Jeez.

415
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,059
Why are you drinking alone?

416
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:15,271
You gave me the cold shoulder and didn't
even look at me when I was moving out.

417
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,316
You must've been really bored
to come see me here.

418
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,151
Ma'am, could I get a glass?

419
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,152
Sure.

420
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,699
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

421
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,712
This isn't like you at all.
Is something troubling you?

422
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,172
Did you...

423
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,049
know?

424
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,218
About what?

425
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,511
That my mom...

426
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,972
was seeing someone.

427
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,396
Since when did you know?

428
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:03,903
Not too long ago. I found out
when I went to visit my parents.

429
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,740
If your stepmom knows,

430
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,702
then I guess everyone
in the neighborhood does too.

431
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,455
And her own daughter didn't know...

432
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,376
Hey. You shouldn't...

433
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,433
How did you find out?

434
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,354
A speeding ticket was sent
to my old house.

435
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,898
From Jeonju.

436
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:41,733
Jeonju?

437
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,067
Yes.

438
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,948
Mom was sitting
in the front passenger's seat.

439
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,910
And a man I've never seen before...

440
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,078
was driving her car.

441
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,333
I think they're both in Jeonju.

442
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,502
Or they could have been passing by it.

443
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,008
Don't stop me.

444
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,719
I'm going to keep drinking.

445
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,262
Then pour me a glass too.

446
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,651
It feels like I've been abandoned.

447
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,322
I feel betrayed.

448
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,283
My mom...

449
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,829
is still young and beautiful.

450
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,334
I have no intention of telling her
to stay single for the rest of her life.

451
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,169
I really don't.

452
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,714
I support her for pursuing happiness.

453
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,508
But not in this way.

454
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,096
This is really upsetting.

455
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,991
But I'm glad that you came.

456
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,704
I was going to drink on my own,
looking glum and pitiful.

457
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,123
But I feel better now with company.

458
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,750
That's what friends are for, right?

459
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,044
Song-i.

460
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,260
From now on,

461
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,220
call Do-hyeon instead of me.

462
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,559
If he says he's busy,
ask him to make time for you.

463
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,354
Even if there's something
that's difficult to say,

464
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,189
you should still tell him.

465
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,610
He will listen to you.

466
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,663
It's the right thing to do.

467
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,379
Ga-rin...

468
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:54,967
Do...

469
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,136
Do you remember that day...

470
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,472
when people...

471
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,974
with flyers...

472
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,853
came looking for you...

473
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,064
at our house?

474
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,277
Well, that day...

475
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,947
About the reward...

476
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,869
Jeez!

477
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,251
Hey.

478
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,300
Have you been drinking?

479
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,354
Denial.

480
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:51,899
Anger.

481
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,652
Now, it's the depression phase.

482
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,655
You're almost there, my friend.

483
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,077
You should just accept it!

484
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,794
You poor soul.

485
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:23,931
It's not for certain whether
he's her boyfriend or just a friend.

486
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,642
Let's not jump to conclusions
and get too wound up.

487
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,520
But I can't ignore the hunch.

488
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,773
She ran away without even looking back.

489
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,110
That means she had some place
she could go to.

490
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,448
Apparently, everyone in the neighborhood
knew she was seeing someone.

491
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:42,992
What kind of a daughter am I?

492
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,495
When it comes to family matters,

493
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,998
people say that family members
are always the last to know.

494
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:50,958
Is that so?

495
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,923
I'll be going to the alley where
my mom's restaurant was after class.

496
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:02,053
The people in that neighborhood
might be able to give me more information.

497
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,388
Should I come with you?

498
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,391
No, it would be embarrassing.

499
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,186
I might hear unpleasant things
from the neighbors.

500
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,441
Do what makes you comfortable.
That's what matters to me the most.

501
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,031
We won't be able to come up here often
when it gets colder.

502
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,574
True.

503
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,202
Let's revisit this place when it snows.

504
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,121
The view of the snowscape
from up here is spectacular.

505
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,082
I'll look forward to it.

506
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,167
Shall we head down?

507
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,130
In just a bit.

508
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,759
You don't want to part just yet?

509
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,470
No.

510
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,307
I don't want to send you off just yet.

511
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,497
Ga-rin. Pass it to me.

512
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,040
I'll do it. Give it.

513
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,251
Why are you mopping the floor?
I should be doing it.

514
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,794
You should get some rest.

515
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,296
Go.

516
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,882
-Going to school?
-Yes.

517
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,511
Then can you give this to Song-i?

518
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,595
She left this behind.

519
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,725
Okay.

520
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,146
See you later.

521
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,232
Go and rest.

522
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,651
BAEKYANG LAUNDROMAT

523
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,069
Hello, sir.

524
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,029
Oh, hi.

525
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,824
Did you hear anything
about my mom going to Jeonju?

526
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,117
Your mom?

527
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,120
I don't think I did.

528
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,248
I see. Thank you.

529
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,751
Come and visit next time.

530
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,550
Have you heard from my mom recently?

531
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,177
No, I haven't.

532
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,369
PAYMENT REMINDER
TO SEO DO-HYEON

533
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,624
Why didn't you tell me about this sooner?

534
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,668
I was going to tell you
after the end of your semester.

535
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,506
I thought I'd be able to
hold up until then,

536
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,216
but it wasn't easy.

537
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,009
How does school
come first in this situation?

538
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,262
Doing more part-time jobs
can't cover the amount we owe.

539
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,806
I'm sorry.

540
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,726
This is from four years ago
and it's even before I started college.

541
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,062
Why did you borrow so much money?

542
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:03,150
The land in Seosan your grandpa left us
before he passed away...

543
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,444
You know that we built
a building there, right?

544
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,988
That's what caused this issue.

545
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,574
Your brothers are the ones
who invested in the construction.

546
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,909
It has nothing to do with you.

547
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,369
The thing is...

548
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,455
I also made an investment.

549
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,499
What?

550
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:22,878
I thought rental income would be secured
once the building was up.

551
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,674
Why didn't you consult me?

552
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,301
How could I?
You were just a 12th grader then.

553
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,973
When construction began, I didn't
have doubts that it would go wrong.

554
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,768
Mostly because apartment complexes
were due to be constructed nearby.

555
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,730
But, strangely,
it became really hard to lease it,

556
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,150
so I had to keep paying interest
without income.

557
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,528
Having said that,

558
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,781
can you take a break
from school next semester?

559
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,368
-What?
-I'm not saying you should quit school.

560
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,078
I would never say such a thing.

561
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,122
It's just one semester.

562
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,834
Please help me out for just six months.

563
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,253
What are you trying to say?

564
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:08,674
Since my oldest brother is the one
who is well-off in our family,

565
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,427
he's going to open a huge
barbecue place in that building.

566
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,971
We should help with his business until--

567
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,389
Are you being serious?

568
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:17,850
What about our restaurant?

569
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,602
I'll have to shut it down.

570
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:24,023
When that's done, I'll at least
be able to pay the principal sum.

571
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,442
I should start by paying that off first.

572
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,991
Your uncle said he'll let us live
in that building if we move to Seosan.

573
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,118
It's a quiet neighborhood.

574
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:40,623
It'll be a good environment for you
to study for your civil servant test.

575
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,082
Dad!

576
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,168
I...

577
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,046
I did everything I could.

578
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,341
When Tae-o's dad said he'd raise the rent,

579
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,092
I begged him not to.

580
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,680
I worked weekdays and weekends so
we won't have to hire part-time workers.

581
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,476
There were so many other things
I had to do and wanted to do,

582
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,896
but I gave up on them all.

583
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,068
I held out, Dad.

584
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,530
But this time, I won't.

585
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,324
I'm sick and tired of...

586
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,868
being the good son.

587
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,056
-Hello, ma'am.
-Oh, it's you, Song-i.

588
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,350
-Have you been doing well?
-Yes.

589
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,143
Where are you staying now?

590
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,854
I'm staying at my friend's house.

591
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,150
Have you not heard from your mom yet?

592
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,194
No.

593
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,864
I think she could be somewhere
on the outskirts of Jeonju...

594
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,160
but that's about all I know.

595
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,371
Jeonju?

596
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,747
I could be wrong.

597
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,625
Something about Jeonju sounds familiar.

598
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,129
That's right!

599
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,757
A friend of your mom
once came here before.

600
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,094
It was a man.

601
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,892
It was around the time
when there were rumors

602
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,020
about your mom having a boyfriend.

603
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,897
As you know, it's a small neighborhood,
so rumors spread fast.

604
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:33,027
I often spotted him
at your mom's restaurant,

605
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,195
so I knew what he looked like.

606
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,989
-I'll take these.
-One day,

607
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,491
he came here and said this.

608
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,037
The name of your bakery
is the same as mine.

609
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,622
The interior is also very much alike.

610
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,206
Do you run a bakery?

611
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,167
Yes, in Jeonju.

612
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:13,442
Come to the Art and Design Building
at 4 p.m. There's a movie I want to watch.

613
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,863
Okay, I'll see you then.

614
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,384
Hey, Tae-o. It's been a while.

615
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,385
Hi.

616
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,680
This is Song-i's.

617
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,723
Can you give it to her when you see her?

618
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:45,683
Okay.

619
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,520
Is Song-i doing okay?

620
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,776
-What do you mean?
-She said she was going to meet her mom.

621
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,363
She should be on her way
to the bus terminal now.

622
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,222
Hey, Song-i.

623
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,434
You're at the bus terminal?

624
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,060
Right now?

625
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,105
Yes. I'll be leaving in 40 minutes.

626
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,817
I found out just now,
so I wasn't able to tell you in advance.

627
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,402
You're going all the way to Jeonju?

628
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,863
I'm going to put an end to this
once and for all.

629
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,116
I can't keep wandering about
like a homeless person.

630
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,118
Why not call the shop before departing?

631
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,329
If I do that, Mom might run away.

632
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,540
I don't want to take that risk.

633
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,341
The bus leaves in 40 minutes?

634
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:02,843
Yes.

635
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,722
Do you want to come with me?

636
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:12,728
SEOGA HOME-MADE DUMPLINGS

637
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:23,655
I'm sorry, Song-i.

638
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,367
Don't be, it's all right.

639
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,411
I was just asking.

640
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:31,663
You can't go all the way to Jeonju
on such short notice.

641
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,582
I have some stuff to take care of at home.

642
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,293
So I won't be able to come with you.

643
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,296
I'm really okay.

644
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,882
Go back to what you were doing.

645
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,467
I'll call you.

646
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:10,035
