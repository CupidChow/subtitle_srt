1
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,779
Aren't you going to tell me why you cried?

2
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,116
I won't say anything unless you do.

3
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,618
That's mean.

4
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,038
I honestly didn't cry.

5
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,291
My eyes only watered because of the wind.

6
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,917
As if.

7
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,837
Your voice sounded like you cried.

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,006
"I can't tell you."
That's what you were like.

9
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,508
What? When was I like that?

10
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,932
Where have you been?

11
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,230
I was at your parents' house,
tutoring Yeong-ho.

12
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,149
My parents' house?

13
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,986
Don't tell me
it was my dad who made you cry.

14
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:11,821
No.

15
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,532
Yeong-ho has his finals soon.

16
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,410
I was busy helping him prepare
for his exams.

17
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,665
I cried because...

18
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,960
Well, it was nothing.

19
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,089
I'd rather not talk about it.

20
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,598
When was the last time...

21
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,018
you saw your dad?

22
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,815
The day I went with you
on your first day of tutoring

23
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,775
was probably the last time I saw him. Why?

24
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,569
You should stop by often.

25
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,905
What business would I have there?

26
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,115
Well...

27
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,701
tell him how you are doing
and talk to him about your worries.

28
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,703
You know, things like that.

29
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,247
I had you.

30
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,418
How I'm doing and the worries I have...

31
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,171
I talked about them with you.

32
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,091
I don't need anything more.

33
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,636
Still...

34
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,429
Do you know what I think sometimes?

35
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,390
I think...

36
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,768
that you were sent to me by my mom.

37
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,272
One day, my mom saw me from above

38
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,399
and noticed that I seemed inadequate.

39
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,319
And that's when she saw you.

40
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,114
"Yes, she'll do a great job.

41
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,994
She's sweet, smart, and has a kind heart.

42
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:45,415
She'll be a perfect friend for my son."

43
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,042
That's what she thought
as she sent you to me.

44
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,629
But...

45
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,466
-there's one thing my mom didn't consider.
-What's that?

46
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,429
You're more flawed than she expected,
so I had to take care of you instead.

47
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,184
My mom must have had poor judgment
when it comes to people.

48
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,437
When I meet her someday,

49
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm going to ask her why it had to be you,
of all people.

50
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,615
Sure.

51
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,371
Make sure to ask her when you see her.

52
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:42,347
SOMETHING ONLY I CAN DO

53
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,859
A major announcement will be made.
Gather at Tae-o's house immediately!

54
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,902
What?

55
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,571
NEW MESSAGE
CHOE HUN

56
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,579
GATHER AT TAE-O'S HOUSE IMMEDIATELY

57
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,858
It's delicious.

58
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,579
You two seem awfully close this morning.

59
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,789
You're up.

60
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,916
Hold on. Breakfast will be ready soon.

61
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,586
-So what's the major announcement?
-Wait until everyone gets here.

62
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,130
Just tell me now. I'm right here.

63
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,590
An announcement is meant
for a group of people.

64
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,592
Wait until everyone's here.

65
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,720
Seriously?

66
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,140
Ga-rin, do you know what's up?

67
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,526
Hello, cuties.

68
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,570
Isn't it too early for an announcement?

69
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,071
It had better be good.

70
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,365
-What?
-What?

71
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,826
-You're dating?
-Why are you all so shocked?

72
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,786
It's natural for two good-looking people

73
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,039
living in the same house
to fall for each other.

74
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,082
Did you just call me pretty?

75
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,625
Of course I did.

76
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,211
Wow...

77
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,383
You really like Hun
as more than just a friend?

78
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,886
How can I consider him just a friend...

79
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,971
when he's this handsome?

80
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,933
Hold on.

81
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,645
Do I have to keep seeing
you two like this at home now?

82
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,689
Isn't it great?

83
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,109
You get to be with us right after
breaking up with your girlfriend.

84
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,611
The timing couldn't be better

85
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,654
since it'll teach you
to never lose faith in love.

86
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,989
No way.

87
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,200
Anyway, please enjoy your meal.

88
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,701
This is our gift to you.

89
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,412
Our?

90
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,331
I love that word.

91
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,961
-I shouldn't have taken them in.
-My gosh.

92
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,554
I'd like to help,
but I have a class to get to.

93
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,639
It's fine. Bye then.

94
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,016
Song-i, let's go.

95
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,477
You go first. I have something
I need to look for.

96
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,187
Oh, really?

97
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:38,981
Okay then. See you.

98
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,526
Bye.

99
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,528
See you around.

100
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,555
1998, JEBU ISLAND

101
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,515
Jebu Island?

102
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,989
Gosh, look at all these weeds.

103
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,491
Are you off to school?

104
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,243
Did you wait for me?

105
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,579
What? As if.

106
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,415
But we can go together.

107
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,428
What were you looking for in the attic?

108
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:55,725
Nothing important.
My books and a hair tie. Stuff like that.

109
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,356
While looking for my stuff, though,

110
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,985
I came across your old things.

111
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,406
Including a photo of your mom.

112
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,868
What would you...

113
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,664
like to do
if you got to see your mom again?

114
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,959
I don't know.

115
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,340
It's not like
I want to do something with her.

116
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:31,511
I'd just like to see her look at me.

117
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,611
Get in already!

118
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,863
I will.

119
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,281
Shall we?

120
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,537
They're so annoying.

121
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,549
I'm terribly sorry,

122
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:14,220
but could you please move over?

123
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,346
What?

124
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:20,351
We're a couple, you see.

125
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,770
It'll break our hearts...

126
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,897
if we don't sit together.

127
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,401
There are other empty seats, though.

128
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,318
Thank you.

129
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,778
Thank you.

130
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:31,821
Unbelievable.

131
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,790
-Gosh, it's cold.
-What are they doing?

132
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,668
-Can't you do something? It's freezing.
-Why did they open the window?

133
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,295
-Close the window.
-It's freezing.

134
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,297
-Who opens the window in this weather?
-It's cold.

135
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,554
I have so many awful memories
of this neighborhood

136
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,473
that I didn't think
I'd be able to come back here.

137
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,852
I'm not scared at all
now that I'm with you, though.

138
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,355
Maybe that's why
being together is better than alone.

139
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,241
THE ADVENTURE OF FLASH
OPEN AUDITION

140
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,703
LOOKING FOR THE 5TH FLASH

141
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,922
I won't say that you'll do well
or that you'll definitely get the part.

142
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:35,092
Why not?
Your encouragement works, you know.

143
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,764
Just have fun and be yourself.

144
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:41,974
All right.

145
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,102
I'll go and have fun, then.

146
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,233
-Flash!
-Good luck!

147
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,039
Good luck!

148
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,755
I'm sure you've made a wise choice.

149
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,925
I did.

150
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,011
Good. I'm glad.

151
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,057
Secrets that can't be handled
should stay buried.

152
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,309
Digging up the past now won't--

153
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,562
I'm going to tell Tae-o the truth.

154
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,650
What I know and heard...

155
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,235
he should know it, too.

156
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,236
Song-i.

157
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,530
I don't think what you said was wrong.

158
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,989
But...

159
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,325
no matter how much I think about it,

160
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,869
this should be Tae-o's decision,
not yours.

161
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,206
So tell me.

162
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,418
Tae-o's mom.

163
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,586
Where is she?

164
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,631
Is she in Korea?

165
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,383
I can't tell you that.

166
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,385
-Mr. Yun.
-Can you guarantee

167
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,429
that she wants to see Tae-o?

168
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,516
What will you do...

169
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,853
if Tae-o gets hurt again?

170
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,080
Song-i, are you leaving?

171
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,375
-Yes. Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

172
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,428
Throw all of them out.

173
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,764
I told you to get rid of them!

FROM: 401-1 HAEAN-GIL, SEOSIN-MYEON

175
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:59,111
Where did he come from? Hey!

176
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,490
Flash, Flash, Flash, Flash, it's Flash

177
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,910
North, east, south, west, here is Flash

178
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,788
Here is Flash to save the planet!

179
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,921
Goodness, sir. Welcome home.

180
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,964
How was the audition?

181
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,550
Well, as always, I have
a good feeling about this.

182
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,760
If my feelings are wrong,

183
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,762
then I guess someone is luckier than me.

184
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,391
Oh, you're more at ease
now that you're dating.

185
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,270
That reminds me.
We need to buy some side dishes.

186
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,272
We ate everything Song-i made for us.

187
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,485
Really?

188
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,029
I'll make us some ramyeon.

189
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,448
How about some beer?

190
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,158
Deal!

191
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,170
It's been a while since the last time

192
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,924
the two of us enjoyed a drink like this,
right?

193
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,384
You're right.

194
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,803
-Where's Ga-rin?
-She went out.

195
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,931
She's visiting another branch
with people from the workshop.

196
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,225
I didn't think she'd stick with it.

197
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,477
Me neither.

198
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,604
At this rate,
she might open up a branch herself.

199
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,358
So, Hun.

200
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,695
Since when did you start seeing Ga-rin
as more than a friend?

201
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,238
From the start.

202
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,325
I see all women in a romantic way.

203
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,785
Wow.

204
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,288
Jeez, look at your face.

205
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,542
We've always hung out
ever since we came to live here.

206
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,587
When things got tough for me,

207
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,214
Ga-rin was the one who gave me
the most support.

208
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,677
She's also the one I wanted to see
at the most important moments in my life.

209
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,804
I guess all those things...

210
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,266
led to her going from a friend
to a girlfriend.

211
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,563
It's not that I fell for her
at one particular moment.

212
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,481
It just happened naturally.

213
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,611
Just like you and Song-i.

214
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,924
FROM: 401-1 HAEAN-GIL, SEOSIN-MYEON,
HWASEONG, GYEONGGI PROVINCE

215
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,718
Can you guarantee

216
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,137
that she wants to see Tae-o?

217
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,739
Did you think I wouldn't know?

218
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,450
Jeez, that's--

219
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,911
"That's absurd.
What are you talking about?"

220
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,746
Don't you dare say that.

221
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,165
Just so you know,
you're terrible at acting.

222
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,835
I'm an actor.
I'm sensitive to other people's emotions.

223
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,299
You two have been acting strangely
ever since she moved out.

224
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,010
Mostly you, to be exact.

225
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,808
My suspicions were confirmed
when I saw you three this morning.

226
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,689
You and Do-hyeon wouldn't even talk to
or look at each other.

227
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,898
You were so obvious.

228
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,025
I get it, so stop.

229
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,697
I know it's complicated,

230
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,783
but I won't say that it's your fault.

231
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,120
Falling in love at first sight is easy.

232
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,040
It's like getting hit by lightning.
You can't fail to notice it.

233
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,042
But...

234
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,045
figuring out feelings
that you didn't know you had...

235
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,172
Well, that's a totally different story.

236
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,259
You don't know if you've got it right

237
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,594
and it's as confusing as hell.

238
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:57,224
You hesitate and then lose the timing.

239
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,020
You're left in a state
where you can't do anything...

240
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,188
just like you right now.

241
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,989
Are you going to tell Song-i?

242
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,491
If I do,

243
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,994
do you think she'll be able to handle it?

244
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,955
What can you do, though?

245
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,916
One of you needs to handle it.

246
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,170
Still...

247
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,757
I don't want her to suffer...

248
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,342
because of my feelings.

249
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,099
Let's just drink, then.

250
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,227
This is what alcohol is for.

251
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,222
FROM: 401-1 HAEAN-GIL, SEOSIN-MYEON

252
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,497
You're here.

253
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,165
Did you study a lot?

254
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,959
No, I'm totally cramming.

255
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,754
-What is it?
-Were you crying?

256
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,757
-What?
-Your eyes are puffy.

257
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,302
No, I just didn't get
enough sleep last night.

258
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,931
Let's study for a couple more hours
and get lunch.

259
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,225
Sure.

260
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,028
I asked the librarian,

261
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,656
but they don't need part-timers
during the school break.

262
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,411
It's too bad. It was nice
spending time with you during work.

263
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,249
Are you even listening to me?

264
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,551
That expression of yours
makes me anxious.

265
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,762
You look like someone who'll leave soon.

266
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,474
You seem far away.

267
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,476
I'm sorry.

268
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,395
I was lost in thought.

269
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,147
About what?

270
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,399
I was just thinking about the exams.

271
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,291
Good luck with your exam.
I'll pick you up after your shift.

272
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,545
I'll tell you not to,
but you'll say it's fine.

273
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,505
Then I'll probably just agree. Right?

274
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,176
-You know us so well.
-Then I'll skip all that. See you tonight.

275
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,053
Sure.

276
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,879
So have you decided?

277
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,676
I'm asking because I don't know
how I should act around you.

278
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,511
Whatever my answer may be,

279
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,472
that should be for Song-i to hear,
not you.

280
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,558
Whatever it may be.

281
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,437
See you around.

282
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,493
-I'll come for this tomorrow.
-With the purse's owner?

283
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,246
Yes, she studies architecture,

284
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,164
so she'll love looking around this place.

285
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,751
Your girlfriend is so lucky
to have such a sweet boyfriend.

286
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,593
Excuse me.

287
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,470
I've been served the wrong drink.

288
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,766
I'm sorry. I'll bring you the right drink
straightaway.

289
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,018
Sure.

290
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,778
I'm sorry, everyone.

291
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,286
Are you all right?

292
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,339
I'll clean this up. You go ahead.

293
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,008
Song-i.

294
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,345
Table three's order went in wrong.

295
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,722
The order was a risotto, not a pasta dish.

296
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,766
I'm sorry.

297
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,601
You keep making mistakes today.

298
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,312
If you're not feeling well,
just head home.

299
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,584
What's going on?

300
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,796
You've been absentminded all day.

301
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,298
Even when I'm with you,

302
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,050
you seem far away.

303
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,929
Can't you tell me what it is?

304
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,264
I may be able to help you.

305
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,726
Can we sit and talk for a bit?

306
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:26,988
Is it...

307
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,283
regarding your house?

308
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,164
I looked into it,

309
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,001
and there are many spare dorms
during the break.

310
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,711
It's cheaper than
during the semester, too.

311
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,589
They don't accept everyone
that applies for one,

312
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,383
but you have good grades so--

313
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,802
Thanks for looking into it...

314
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,180
but that's not it.

315
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,308
Let's say...

316
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,940
you know what your friend
desperately wants

317
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,317
and you have it.

318
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,030
What would you do
if you couldn't give it to him, though?

319
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,241
Why can't you give it to him?

320
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,535
Because it could bring him...

321
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,288
either a huge amount of joy

322
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:21,126
or an excruciating heartache.

323
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,963
In one way or another,

324
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,799
that friend will be heartbroken.

325
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,010
Should I still...

326
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:35,557
give him what I have, knowing that?

327
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,393
I can't decide.

328
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,230
So...

329
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,899
It's about Tae-o, right?

330
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,947
The person you've been
thinking about all day...

331
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,783
is Tae-o?

332
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,621
What does he desperately want?

333
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,665
Why can only you give it to him?

334
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,959
It's not something I can give.

335
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,296
I have to take him somewhere.

336
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,631
Take him somewhere?

337
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,841
Where?

338
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,479
Where do you have to go with Tae-o?

339
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,357
Do you have any idea
what you're saying to me?

340
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,443
You're saying you'll spend time with him,

341
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,405
the two of you at a place I don't know,
just like you did in Jeonju!

342
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,244
I tried to bury it.
I trust you and I trust Tae-o,

343
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:41,665
so I convinced myself that
there was nothing to be worried about.

344
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,293
It tortured me to see you get upset
because I was angry,

345
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,297
and I hated myself for being a jerk
who didn't trust his girlfriend.

346
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,341
That's why I didn't say anything.

347
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,009
It's not because I wasn't angry!

348
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,555
Do-hyeon...

349
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,682
Whatever that heartbreaking story is,

350
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,394
I don't want to know and I don't care.

351
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,690
If Tae-o needs to go somewhere...

352
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,485
ask someone else to take him or--

353
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,071
It's something only I can do.

354
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,289
Then you're saying it's over between us.

355
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,041
I'm leaving.

356
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,768
FROM: 401-1 HAEAN-GIL

357
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,526
Song-i.

358
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,198
You telling me you had to go with him...

359
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,161
it felt like you were saying
that you were leaving me.

360
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,791
IT FELT LIKE YOU WERE SAYING
THAT YOU WERE LEAVING ME

361
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,670
I shouldn't have talked to you that way,

362
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,547
and I shouldn't have stormed off.

363
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,640
Song-i...

364
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,267
SONG-I...

365
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:08,770
Don't go.

366
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,853
Hey, when did you get here?

367
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,438
A while ago.

368
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,148
You're up early.

369
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,566
Right.

370
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,861
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

371
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,031
Are Hun and Ga-rin out?

372
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,534
They're probably on a date
since it's the weekend.

373
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,203
Drink this. I made coffee.

374
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,792
What's this all of a sudden?
You're acting weird.

375
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,464
Tae-o.

376
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,134
Yes?

377
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,972
If you don't have any plans today,

378
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,350
let's go somewhere together.

379
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,729
Now?

380
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,024
Yes. Go and get changed.

381
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,944
-Where are we going?
-I'll tell you on the way.

382
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,668
What is it?

383
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,505
You're wearing that?

384
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,343
How about the outfit you wore
to your dad's birthday dinner last year?

385
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,054
What did I wear that day again?

386
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,188
This.

387
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,483
Yes, this is much better.

388
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,861
Why do I have to dress up, though?

389
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,197
Are we going to an event?

390
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,368
Well, not exactly.

391
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,039
You just feel good
when you wear nice clothes, you know.

392
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,461
Okay, fine.
I'll get changed, so wait for me outside.

393
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,547
Okay.

394
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,095
Make sure you look smart, all right?

395
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,346
Okay.

396
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,189
Where's your girlfriend?

397
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,108
She's not here yet.

398
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,402
She'll be here soon.

399
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,957
Where are we going? Can you tell me now?

400
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,669
Jebu Island.

401
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,462
Jebu Island? Right now?

402
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,341
The winter sea is great.

403
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,136
I like it better than the sea in summer.

404
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,265
Song-i,

405
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,809
I followed you out here,

406
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,729
but I need to know what's going on
so I can get ready.

407
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,981
You don't have to worry about anything.

408
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,900
What on earth is our plan for today?

409
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,485
I won't go anywhere until you tell me.

410
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,779
You asked me...

411
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,242
why I cried that night.

412
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,330
This is my answer.

413
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:02,879
Even if you don't come with me,
this is a place I need to go to.

414
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:23,066
SEOUL, HWASEONG, JEBU ISLAND

415
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,400
DO-HYEON

416
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:47,173
The receiver cannot be reached.
Please leave a message after the beep.

417
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,906
JEBU ISLAND ENTRANCE

418
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:12,865
Where to next?

419
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,327
We just got here. What's the rush?

420
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,555
It's all right. You'll get cold.

421
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,557
I'll take it back when I get cold.

422
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,808
Keep it on until then.

423
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,775
So what were you planning on doing
once we got here?

424
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,195
Were you going to go to that place
you said you wanted to visit?

425
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,240
Not really.

426
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,618
I wanted to enjoy the sea view

427
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,662
and have some coffee...

428
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,166
before heading there.

429
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,754
Let's do that then.

430
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,427
We've enjoyed the sea view,
so let's get some coffee.

431
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,936
OCEAN FOREST

432
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,622
People are already
getting ready for Christmas.

433
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,332
It's less than a month away.

434
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,251
What did we do last Christmas?

435
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,756
I stayed all night at school
taking down a senior's project.

436
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,384
You got super drunk with your friends
and woke up the next day.

437
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,387
You're right.

438
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,474
It was such an unromantic Christmas.

439
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,393
Yes, look over here. One, two, three.

440
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:11,984
Hello.

441
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,279
If it's all right with you,
I'll take a couple photo for you two.

442
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,573
No, we're not a couple.

443
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,828
The thing is, she follows me around

444
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,287
and annoys me so much.

445
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,748
When did I ever do that?

446
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:29,001
It's true though. You asked me
to come here with you this morning.

447
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,503
Hey.

448
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,296
Let me take one for you anyway

449
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,965
as a token of your friendship.

450
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:37,969
Should we?

451
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:39,720
Whatever.

452
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,265
We even have props.

453
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,226
Gosh, how childish can you get?

454
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,477
Here we go then.

455
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,564
One, two, three.

456
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,778
Here you go.

457
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:56,821
Right.

458
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,742
Thank you.

459
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,202
Enjoy your time here.

460
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,253
We both look good.

461
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,676
Can I keep it?

462
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,304
Go ahead.

463
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,939
Have we been here before?

464
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:38,529
We haven't.
It's too far from where we live.

465
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,034
Since we're here, though,
we should see what we can.

466
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,204
Hold on.

467
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,962
There's a coastal walking path.
Do you want to check it out?

468
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,382
There's a huge lighthouse here, too.

469
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,676
It'll look pretty in a photo.

470
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,972
-Is it far from here?
-Well...

471
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,309
No, it's nearby.

472
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,488
Gosh, being here with you...

473
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,531
is nice.

474
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,286
Yes, it's nice.

475
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:36,689
TAE-O'S DINER

476
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,777
So this was it?

477
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:45,531
You're so random sometimes,
do you know that?

478
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,825
You dragged me all the way here
to show me this?

479
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:50,953
Let's go inside.

480
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,372
I bet they serve this and that.

481
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:15,269
TAE-O'S DINER

482
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,120
YUKGAEJANG, POLLACK SOUP,
SPICY SEAFOOD STEW

483
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,705
They're all the dishes that I like.

484
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,209
Excuse me!

485
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,460
Yes!

486
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,589
Coming!

487
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,345
Isn't it cold outside?

488
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,213
