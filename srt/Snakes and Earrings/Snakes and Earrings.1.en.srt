1
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,280
Ever heard of a split tongue?

2
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,490
What's that? Like when it's forked?

3
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,740
Yeah, like a snake or a lizard.

4
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,660
People can have that done too, y'know.

5
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,140
Wow.

6
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,760
Want to try "body modification"?

7
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,000
Mind if I come?

8
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,980
Hey.

9
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,070
I meant on my stomach.

10
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,320
Sorry... my timing was off.

11
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,660
If you can't do it right,
use a condom.

12
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,420
Hey there...

13
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,340
Ama, long time no see.

14
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,930
This is Shiba-san. It's his store.

15
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,810
My girlfriend...

16
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,770
Oh, yeah?

17
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,520
You scored a cute one.

18
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,690
We want to get her tongue pierced.

19
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,530
Do bimbo's do that?

20
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,700
I'm not a bimbo.

21
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,450
She even mentioned
having it split.

22
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,540
Stick your tongue out.

23
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,380
Quite thin. Shouldn't hurt too much.

24
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,310
But at Korean restaurants
tongue's as tough as tripe.

25
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:16,400
Is it okay to make holes
in something that hard?

26
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,400
Good question, sister.

27
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,360
It's worse than doing your ears.

28
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,070
Think about it...

29
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,240
Making a big hole, it'll hurt.

30
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,750
Shiba-san, please don't scare her.

31
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:37,090
Lui, don't worry.
I went through it okay.

32
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,670
What are you talking about?

33
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,760
You practically fainted.

34
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,430
Whatever... Come on back.

35
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Classic <i>irezumi</i> tattoos...

36
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,370
Maybe I'll get one.

37
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
Sit down.

38
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,260
Rinse your mouth.

39
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,310
Thanks.

40
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,250
Further out...

41
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,780
Hold it there.

42
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,540
Where do you want it?

43
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,600
Here we go.

44
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,260
Show me.

45
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,900
Good job.

46
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,070
It's in straight. Perfect position.

47
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,490
Right. Great, huh?

48
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,920
Lui-chan, is it?

49
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,130
You're good with pain.

50
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,010
They say women bear this stuff best.

51
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,680
When it's the tongue... the genitals...

52
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,190
soft membranes...
some people faint, y'know.

53
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,530
Shiba-san, what do you think
of split tongues?

54
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,030
Split tongues?

55
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,790
Not like piercings and tattoos...
it's changing body shape.

56
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,380
An interesting idea
but nothing I want to try.

57
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:41,850
Modifying our form
is a right reserved for god alone.

58
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,230
If you were god, what kind of people
would you create?

59
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,400
I wouldn't change our shape.

60
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,740
I'd just create idiot people.

61
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,580
As stupid as chickens.

62
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,590
So they'd never figure out
the existence of god.

63
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,260
Would you show me your
tattoo designs sometime?

64
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,930
Sure.

65
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,070
Call me if you like.

66
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,580
About piercing or whatever.

67
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,080
Whenever you want.

68
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,340
I owe you for my tongue.

69
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,460
Forget it.

70
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,640
Looking at you
brings out the sadist in me.

71
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,310
I'm a masochist so
I must emit that vibe.

72
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,280
I want to push needles in here.

73
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,120
Isn't that verging on "savage"?

74
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,830
I guess it is.

75
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,750
You know the English word, "savage"?

76
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,290
When it comes to cruelty
I got a wide vocabulary.

77
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,680
Hey, hands off another man's girl.

78
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,550
I'm just checking her skin.

79
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,180
For when it takes the needle.

80
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,480
<i>There's something twisted
about this guy's smile.</i>

81
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,950
No way. Oh my god...

82
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,870
It looks really painful.

83
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,450
What's got into you?

84
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:15,960
Why a tongue stud? It's not as if
you like rock or the Harajuku look.

85
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,050
But I got to know this punk
the other day.

86
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,840
Maybe he influenced me
or something...

87
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,550
What kind of guy?

88
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,810
He's punk-looking but inside
he's kind of new-age.

89
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,810
Doesn't make sense.

90
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,690
What do you think of <i>irezumi</i>?

91
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,810
You mean a tattoo? They're okay.

92
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,530
Butterflies, roses... cute.

93
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,490
No. More like, dragons, <i>ukiyoe</i>...
the not-so-cute stuff.

94
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,910
What's up with you?

95
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,040
The punk told you to get it done?

96
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,420
You going out with him?

97
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,710
Lui, don't tell me he brainwashed you.

98
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,840
Brainwashed...

99
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,590
Maybe that's it.

100
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,060
I want to follow through and
discover why I'm so turned on by this

101
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:17,400
so my mind's fixated
on getting my tongue split.

102
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,440
Hey Maki, want to meet him?

103
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,030
Here he is.

104
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,700
Are you joking?

105
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,120
The red-headed monkey.

106
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,710
I'm terrified...

107
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,210
Hello.

108
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,880
Sorry, I look so scary.

109
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,600
No worries. Maybe a little.

110
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,640
This is Ama.

111
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,890
I'm Ama. Nice to meet you.

112
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,890
This is Maki.

113
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,560
You're the new-age guy
she told me about.

114
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,440
Walking with you,
everyone gets out of the way.

115
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:10,320
You're right. No-one hits on us.
No tissue-pack flyers, either.

116
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,330
So I come in handy?

117
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,790
A really useful guy.

118
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,830
Here we go.

119
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,300
It's really cool.

120
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,840
So you pierce your tongue,
then gradually enlarge the hole...

121
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,640
then thread it with string
until it splits...

122
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,850
Lui, you're going to do that?

123
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,650
Yeah, we're gonna be a pair.

124
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,480
Lui, do your eyebrow and lip
so we'll be identical.

125
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:51,490
No way. I just want a split tongue
and <i>irezumi</i>, that's all.

126
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:56,000
Please don't turn her into
too much of a punk.

127
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,370
She and I pledged a lifelong
bimbo alliance.

128
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,920
I didn't. And I'm not a bimbo.

129
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,550
You are a bimbo.

130
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,710
Stop it.

131
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,180
Maki, you can take your drink.

132
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,180
Not really.

133
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,220
How come I had to pay?

134
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,390
It was fun anyhow...

135
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,140
To celebrate our new acquaintance.

136
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,690
'Cause we're worth it, right?

137
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:47,550
Why are you on our turf?
What's with the piercings?

138
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,090
Where you going, honey?

139
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,180
Is that your boyfriend?

140
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,260
I doubt it.

141
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,350
Mind him, he's got VD.

142
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,230
Best to wait 'til he's cured.

143
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,560
Hang with us.

144
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,790
Ama, stop it!

145
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,430
I'm sorry.

146
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,810
Forgive me.

147
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,730
I'm really sorry.

148
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,380
Maki, get out of here, quick!

149
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,140
I'll see you around.

150
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,850
That's enough... for chrissakes.

151
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,640
The cops are coming.

152
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,390
What've you done, you jerk.

153
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,190
I got revenge for you.

154
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,570
Why would I want that?

155
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,210
It's proof of my love.

156
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,670
That's not proof.
Not in this country, anyway.

157
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,150
Sorry, eh?

158
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,030
I can't control myself.

159
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,870
I think I'm the gentle type but...

160
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,540
once I get my blood up

161
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,710
I got to see it through
until the guy's dead.

162
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:45,050
Ama, you're an adult now.
Kill someone and you go to jail.

163
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
You know that?

164
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,060
Actually, I'm still a minor.

165
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,060
Don't be stupid.

166
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,520
It's true.

167
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,820
When we met you said you were 24.

168
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:05,110
'Cause I figured that's how old you were.

169
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,530
I didn't want you thinking I was a kid.

170
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,410
In which case, how old are you?

171
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,660
I'm still underage.

172
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,580
No way! For real? Honest?

173
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,550
That makes me so happy.

174
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,880
We both look old for our age.

175
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,220
Ama, what's your real name?

176
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,100
Amano? Suama?

177
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:38,440
"Suama"? There's no such name.
Ama is short for Amadeus.

178
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,610
First name is Deus and last Ama.

179
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Like Zeus. Cool, huh?

180
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,160
If you don't want to tell me, that's okay.

181
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,620
It's the truth. What about you?

182
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:57,580
Me? I bet you think
it's Louis XIVth, right?

183
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,250
Actually, it's "Louis Vuitton".

184
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,760
Really? A woman
of expensive tastes.

185
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,720
- Time for my feed.
- Get lost.

186
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,280
Choosing a dragon?

187
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,240
I guess so.

188
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,330
Is this the one Ama got?

189
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,830
Yeah.

190
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,130
Same design but a little different.

191
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,600
He doesn't know, right?

192
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,680
That you're here.

193
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,810
No, he doesn't.

194
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,650
Don't tell him I gave you
my cell number.

195
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:06,110
Hey, is Ama...

196
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,370
You want to know about him?

197
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,840
Forget it.

198
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,510
Maybe I don't want to know.

199
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,550
Yeah?

200
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,720
What? What is it?

201
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Closing shop for an important client.

202
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,890
Oh...

203
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,730
Y'know, in truth, I'm really torn.

204
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,980
A tattoo is for life, right?

205
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,950
If I do it, I want
the best design there is.

206
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,620
Basically, there's no going back.

207
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,950
In my case though,

208
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:43,290
if I grow my hair, it's hidden.

209
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,920
That's not your only one, right?

210
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,970
Want to see?

211
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,010
<i>Inoshikacho...</i>

212
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,680
I like traditional card designs.

213
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,490
What's this?

214
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,030
A <i>kylin</i>.

215
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,870
This one

216
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,710
is my favorite of them all.

217
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,880
It's a sacred creature.

218
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,180
It neither tramples on
nor consumes other living things.

219
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,890
Like it's a god amid the animal world.

220
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,060
That's what I want.

221
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,700
This was done
by a top-class tattooist.

222
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,910
He burned himself to death
clutching this design.

223
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:54,920
Make use of the sacred <i>kylin</i> lightly,
you may end up cursed.

224
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,920
It's what I want.

225
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,760
Shiba-san, please.

226
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,430
Design it for me, at least.

227
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,400
Alright, then...

228
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,780
Great. Thank you, Shiba-san.

229
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,400
I'll sketch out a design first.

230
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,240
Any requests for the background?

231
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,620
This...

232
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,460
I want you to combine it
with Ama's dragon.

233
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:41,640
Something about that size
done on my back.

234
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,760
How much will that cost?

235
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,270
One fuck.

236
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,320
That'll be enough?

237
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,660
Strip off.

238
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,180
You're skinny.

239
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,980
Put on weight later,
skin stretches and it'll look crap.

240
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,980
Don't worry.
I've been this weight for years.

241
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,210
Nice... that pained look on your face.

242
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,380
It gets me so hard.

243
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:15,580
What kind of sex do you have with Ama?

244
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,790
Normal, I guess...

245
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,300
Doesn't leave you frustrated?

246
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,590
Not really. I get off okay like that.

247
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:34,100
What? You're implying
I can't get off normally?

248
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,310
Can you?

249
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,940
No, I can't.

250
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,780
'Cause you're a crazy sadist, yeah?

251
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,450
I get off with guys, too.

252
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:56,500
I reckon I'm quite eclectic
in the ways I get off.

253
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,000
Are you wet?

254
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,160
That taste gross?

255
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,060
Can't breathe?

256
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,360
Please, put it in me.

257
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,940
Shut up.

258
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,450
More tears.

259
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,800
I'm coming.

260
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,650
When the design's ready
will you call?

261
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,320
Sure.

262
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,330
Come with Ama.

263
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,700
You can both take a look at it.

264
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:28,670
Call in the daytime
when Ama's at work.

265
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,170
Yeah, yeah, I know.

266
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,970
I'm a descendant of god, maybe.

267
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,810
Descendant of god?
Sounds like a band.

268
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:48,730
Whoever gave life to man
has got to be a sadist.

269
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,860
Does that make the Virgin Mary
a masochist?

270
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,230
Definitely.

271
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,860
Hey, want to grab a bite?

272
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,820
Ama will be home soon.

273
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,490
I see.

274
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,910
See ya'.

275
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,910
You okay?

276
00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:00,300
<i>I hate existing in this world. I want
to burn out in the realm of darkness.</i>

277
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,000
<i>Our next news item...</i>

278
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:40,590
<i>on 11th at 1:00am,
in Tokyo's Shibuya ward</i>

279
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,340
<i>a man, bleeding from the head
was found by passersby.</i>

280
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:49,640
<i>Although taken to hospital
he died 2 hours later.</i>

281
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:57,270
<i>The deceased was a 25 year old
member of the Toryu yakuza group.</i>

282
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,820
<i>Cerebral contusion following
skull fracture was the cause of death.</i>

283
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:05,870
<i>The fugitive suspect was described
as male in his mid 20's</i>

284
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:09,700
<i>of medium height, slight build</i>

285
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:14,670
<i>with red hair and dressed in dark clothing.</i>

286
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:21,010
<i>The Shibuya precinct police
are searching for this suspect...</i>

287
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:35,900
Good evening.

288
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,490
Ama, get up.

289
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,080
What's up?

290
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,870
Come here.

291
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,040
What?

292
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,040
Quickly.

293
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,250
What's going on?

294
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,880
Nothing's going on. Sit down.

295
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,010
We're dying your hair.

296
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:09,600
I've never liked that ugly red hair.

297
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:13,270
For starters, red looks scruffy on you.

298
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,270
You've got no sense of taste.

299
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,020
You're so good to me.

300
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,610
I'll try to have good taste.
You'll help me, right?

301
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:29,700
Of course.

302
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,220
I'm grateful, y'know.

303
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,760
I'd shave my head if you wanted.

304
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:55,430
Dress up smart and fancy
like you.

305
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,980
Bleach my skin if you told me.

306
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:02,980
Give me a break.

307
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,610
Ama...

308
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,200
From tomorrow, my orders
are that you wear long sleeves.

309
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,330
Why?

310
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:18,790
Listen. The constant tank tops
make you look like a thug.

311
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,580
Yes, Ma'am.

312
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,340
Do you understand?

313
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,050
I do.

314
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,460
You promise?

315
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:29,680
I promise. Anything for you, honey.

316
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,470
Quit it. That's creepy.

317
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,520
Care for some more, sir?

318
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,440
Thank you.

319
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:00,960
What a shock...

320
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,960
A tongue stud, of all things...

321
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,210
Some guy's involved, right?

322
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:12,720
Kinda. I fell for the tongue
rather than the guy himself.

323
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:19,060
Hello?

324
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:22,810
<i>Lui, where are you?
What you doing?</i>

325
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:26,730
Sorry. I got a call
for a companion gig.

326
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,900
<i>What? I didn't know you worked.
What kind of "companion"?</i>

327
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:36,870
For chrissakes, it's above board.
Nothing shady.

328
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:40,580
Anyways, I'll call you later. Bye.

329
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,210
Sorry.

330
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,090
So he keeps you on a tight leash?

331
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:51,380
He's like a big kid.
Sometimes he doesn't get it.

332
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,510
That can be cute.

333
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,390
If only that were all he is...

334
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,440
There you are!
You mustn't goof off.

335
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,730
Sorry, sir.

336
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,980
Your hair looks better like this.

337
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:48,650
Really?

338
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:50,570
Looks cool.

339
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,440
You reckon?

340
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,570
You look good, too.

341
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:58,990
I know.

342
00:45:59,160 --> 00:45:59,950
You do?

343
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,540
Look... a split tongue.

344
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,840
Oh, yeah. Split tongue.

345
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,800
<i>Everything's okay. He's laughing
and happy.</i>

346
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:23,850
<i>His hair's no longer red. We've
nothing to worry about. It's all fine.</i>

347
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:29,610
I'm going to buy cigarettes.

348
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:45,540
Hello.

349
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,330
<i>It's me. The design's ready.</i>

350
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:53,670
<i>A dragon and a kylin.
It was tough to get it right.</i>

351
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,840
Really.

352
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,050
<i>I want to show it to you.</i>

353
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,510
Okay.

354
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:01,640
<i>See ya', then.</i>

355
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:03,390
See ya'.

356
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,560
Who was that?

357
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,440
Maki. She said we should party.

358
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,230
Right, let's party...

359
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,740
That's amazing.

360
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:21,700
It's good, huh?

361
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:22,870
Do this on me.

362
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,080
Okay.

363
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,410
Isn't that great?

364
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:29,750
No drinking alcohol tomorrow.

365
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,290
And get a good sleep.
You'll need your strength.

366
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,420
Don't worry. I'll look after her.

367
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,690
Walking with you, everyone stares.

368
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:54,770
You stand out more.

369
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,110
What do you mean?

370
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:58,610
You're both scary-looking.

371
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,950
If you think about it,
we're a strange combination.

372
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:06,080
I want a beer. Let's go eat.

373
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,410
It changes when I breathe deep.

374
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,290
It looks so cool.

375
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,590
Sorry.

376
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,470
I love this butterfly.

377
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,720
It's good, huh?

378
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,470
In the perfect place.

379
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:27,720
I'm going to the toilet.

380
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,150
No complaints about the design?

381
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,820
Of course not.

382
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,330
I'll make it so beautiful.

383
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:52,460
In your hands,
it's a piece of cake, right?

384
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,500
My divine hands...

385
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:13,100
But what if I want to kill you
in the middle of it?

386
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,360
If that's what happens, so be it.

387
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:25,280
I've never wanted to kill anyone
so badly before.

388
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:33,040
The toilet was covered in puke.
Made me feel sick.

389
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,210
You threw up too, right?

390
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:35,330
No, I didn't.

391
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,380
Yeah, I bet you did.

392
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,210
What are you talking about?

393
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:43,300
Time for a toast.

394
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:44,550
Cheers.

395
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:50,890
Wow, it's so good.

396
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:58,480
Shiba-san, this is tasty, too.

397
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:05,860
<i>Amadeus, who beat
a man to death for me</i>

398
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,370
<i>and the Descendant of God
who desperately wants to do me in.</i>

399
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:13,910
<i>I wonder if one day
one of them will kill me.</i>

400
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:29,180
Can I go with you tomorrow?

401
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:33,770
What are you talking about?
You've got work.

402
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:41,190
It's not that I don't trust Shiba-san...

403
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,280
But I'm worried.
It'll just be you two, right?

404
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:57,710
It'll be fine. He's a total pro.

405
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:00,540
He wouldn't do anything like that.

406
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:07,880
Okay. But be careful... really.

407
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:15,810
Sometimes I don't understand
what goes through his mind.

408
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,900
Not everyone's as easy
to understand as you.

409
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,840
This time tomorrow,
there'll be a dragon here.

410
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,970
And a <i>kylin</i>, too.

411
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:03,770
Your skin's so perfectly white,
it's almost a shame.

412
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,190
But with a tattoo,
you'll be even sexier.

413
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:23,210
You had a proper sleep?

414
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:27,460
Ama put me to bed by 8pm.

415
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,220
Today we just do the outline.

416
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:37,890
But it locks in the design

417
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,560
so tell me if you want any changes.

418
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:46,570
Just one request.

419
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:52,240
I don't want you to do their eyes.

420
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,530
You mean the actual pupil?

421
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:02,660
Yeah, the eyeball itself.

422
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,080
Why not?

423
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,920
The old story of the priest
painting the dragon.

424
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,340
He finished the eye
then it flew away.

425
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:26,100
Okay, I see.

426
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,780
I won't do their eyes then.

427
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:36,110
But to keep their expressions
balanced

428
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,620
I'll do a vague outline,
if that's okay?

429
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,120
Thank you, Shiba-san.

430
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,380
Such a demanding woman.

431
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:03,870
How's that?

432
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:44,660
Look.

433
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,910
I used a gauge 10.

434
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:51,750
That's coming along nicely.

435
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:55,920
But don't overdo it.

436
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:00,760
Unlike an earlobe, an infected
tongue's a real nuisance.

437
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,050
Okay.

438
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,020
It hurt, right?

439
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:19,860
Okay, I'm ready to begin.

440
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,620
Here I go.

441
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,100
Tell me if it hurts.

442
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,460
You really don't mind
the pain, do you?

443
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:01,710
First-timers usually bug me
with their whining.

444
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:06,890
I guess I must be frigid.

445
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:10,010
Hardly. You got off fine
the other day.

446
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,450
You're sweet.

447
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:09,780
The first drag's the best.

448
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:13,410
No way. It's the second one.

449
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:22,290
So, did you feel like killing me?

450
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:28,090
Yes. So I kept my mind on the job.

451
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:41,900
If you ever want to die
let me do the killing.

452
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:47,610
Can I screw your corpse?

453
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:53,160
After I'm dead, what do I care.

454
00:59:56,410 --> 01:00:01,000
Without your look of pain
I probably couldn't get it up.

455
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:02,370
Lui... I'm here.

456
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:09,540
We just finished.

457
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:13,380
What about your job?

458
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:16,050
Left early. Said I was constipated.

459
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,350
Your job lets you do that?

460
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:23,140
The store manager was mad
but so what...

461
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,070
Fantastic...

462
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,900
Shiba-san, thank you.

463
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:39,950
But you didn't try anything weird
with her, did you?

464
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:46,500
Don't worry. I have no desire
for skinny women.

465
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:53,000
Hang on...

466
01:02:57,090 --> 01:03:01,100
You didn't do their eyes.

467
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,180
That's what I asked for.

468
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,520
Not to complete the eyes.

469
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:08,690
Why?

470
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,770
They might fly away
after the finishing touch.

471
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:16,440
I see.

472
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:22,200
But my dragon's got eyes
and he's still here.

473
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:26,540
- You keep quiet.
- Ouch. Don't hurt me...

474
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:29,120
Don't have a bath for a while.

475
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:34,050
It'll scab for about a week.
You mustn't scratch it.

476
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,970
When the swelling's gone
we do the next session.

477
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:42,720
In any case, call me
when the scabs come off.

478
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,480
Shiba-san, want to go eat?

479
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:51,150
Not at this time of day.

480
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:57,900
Come over here.

481
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,160
Why are you in a dress?

482
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,740
You were just wearing your panties.

483
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:09,660
I figured something loose
would be easier afterwards.

484
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:19,880
Am I being pathetic?

485
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:23,760
Kind of.

486
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:37,030
You hate pathetic guys?

487
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:39,940
Kind of.

488
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,950
I'm so sorry.

489
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,290
I guess you know already but,
I do love you.

490
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:16,270
Let's go.

491
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,660
<i>Then I went and got leglessly drunk.</i>

492
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:29,450
<i>Ama was so happy to take care of me.</i>

493
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:34,580
<i>It's a month after that "incident"
and Ama's still by my side.</i>

494
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:54,640
<i>Each time I make it bigger
it hurts so bad, I don't want to go on.</i>

495
01:05:55,770 --> 01:05:57,860
<i>I vent my frustrations on Ama.</i>

496
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:01,440
<i>On these days, I just feel
like I want everyone to die.</i>

497
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:05,280
<i>Thoughts, values, all forgotten.
No better than a beast.</i>

498
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:39,750
<i>When the irezumi
and the split tongue are done</i>

499
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,750
<i>how am I going to feel, I wonder?</i>

500
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:48,630
<i>I've lived life not owning much,
worrying little, caring less.</i>

501
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:56,310
<i>No meaning anywhere. Not in
the future, the tattoo or this tongue.</i>

502
01:09:14,510 --> 01:09:16,550
Maybe I'll quit being a tattooist.

503
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:23,850
Like Ama, try sticking with one woman.

504
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:29,030
What's that got to do with quitting?

505
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:32,070
The "making a new start" thing.

506
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:36,530
I created my best ever <i>kylin</i>.

507
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:44,040
So I'd have no regrets.

508
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:57,510
<i>The beasts dancing on my back
will never leave me.</i>

509
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:04,100
<i>We are locked together,
unable to betray or be betrayed.</i>

510
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,900
<i>And without eyes, they can't escape.</i>

511
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:22,120
<i>Maybe because the tattoo is done,
I'm sapped of all energy.</i>

512
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:26,000
<i>I spend each day wishing time faster.</i>

513
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,130
- You mustn't drink.
- Get lost.

514
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:32,920
<i>Ama worries about me
and my constant drinking</i>

515
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:36,130
<i>and I want to respond to him</i>

516
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:42,140
<i>but defeated by self-loathing
I just turn back to the booze.</i>

517
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:45,600
<i>Anyway, my life is devoid of light.</i>

518
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:51,440
<i>Inside my head, my life, my future
nothing but total darkness.</i>

519
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:58,990
<i>The only time I really feel alive
is when I'm in pain.</i>

520
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:06,750
Ever feel like you want to die?

521
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,670
All the time.

522
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:26,180
I won't stand for anyone taking
your life. Not even you yourself.

523
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:34,650
If you're going to kill yourself,
let me be the one to do it.

524
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,370
I couldn't bear it...

525
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:49,540
the thought of anyone but me
having control over your life.

526
01:11:56,550 --> 01:12:01,720
<i>When the need to die possesses me
who will I ask to kill me?</i>

527
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,220
<i>Who would make the best job of it?</i>

528
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:34,840
<i>It's me. Can you talk?</i>

529
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:38,340
Yeah. Is something up?

530
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:42,760
<i>Well, it's about Ama.</i>

531
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:45,350
What?

532
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:48,930
<i>Back in September, did he get
into some kind of trouble?</i>

533
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:55,270
I have no idea.

534
01:12:57,610 --> 01:12:58,610
Why?

535
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:03,780
The police just came, had me
show my client list.

536
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,620
Wanted to know about
a dragon tattoo.

537
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:11,960
I don't think it's Ama but...

538
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:16,750
<i>It can't be him. He was
always with me.</i>

539
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:21,090
That's what I thought.

540
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:29,970
They mentioned red hair.
Remember, it used to be red?

541
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:32,730
So I was a bit worried.

542
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:35,150
Oh...

543
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:49,160
I just thought I'd call to check.

544
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,080
Coming over, today?

545
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,290
Oh... thanks.

546
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,460
Not today. But next time.

547
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:07,470
Won't you please come?
I need to talk to you.

548
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,980
Okay... if I get in the mood.

549
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Good afternoon.

550
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:18,580
You're being formal.

551
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:26,420
Are you tired?

552
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,230
I'm not joking... something's wrong.

553
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:41,270
What is?

554
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:44,940
When did we last meet?

555
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:50,240
Maybe 2 weeks ago?

556
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:52,660
How much weight did you lose?

557
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:56,580
No idea. Ama doesn't have scales.

558
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,420
It's creepy how skinny you got.

559
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:05,750
You're really pale.
You stink of booze.

560
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:24,320
Isn't Ama feeding you properly?

561
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,490
He's always nagging me to eat.

562
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:32,450
All I need is alcohol though.

563
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:37,120
You'll starve before you get
to commit suicide.

564
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,460
I won't commit suicide.

565
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:50,630
I'm going to buy something.
What do you want?

566
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:53,470
A beer, then.

567
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:58,810
Beer's in the fridge. Anything else?

568
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:06,860
Shiba-san, ever killed someone?

569
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:23,500
Yeah, I have...

570
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,840
How did you feel?

571
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:40,220
I felt great.

572
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,900
Yeah?

573
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:01,910
Take off your clothes.

574
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:07,210
Not going shopping?

575
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:12,590
Seeing you cry made me hard.

576
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:29,670
Will you marry me?

577
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,550
That's why you wanted to talk?

578
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:35,920
I guess.

579
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:42,810
Ama's too much for you to handle.

580
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:47,480
And you're too much for him.

581
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:49,980
You're not a good match
for each other.

582
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,360
So I have to marry you?

583
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:59,030
That's nothing to do with it.

584
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:02,030
I just felt like getting married.

585
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:28,230
In any case I made a ring.

586
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:35,070
You made this?

587
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,530
It's a hobby of mine.

588
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:42,070
Probably not your style at all...

589
01:20:44,530 --> 01:20:45,870
It's amazing.

590
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:49,910
But kind of grim-looking.

591
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:57,880
Thank you.

592
01:21:04,930 --> 01:21:06,430
I'm going shopping.

593
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:36,650
<i>The number you called
may not be in the service area</i>

594
01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:39,820
<i>or may be turned off.
Your call cannot be completed.</i>

595
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:32,330
Excuse me.

596
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:36,250
Can a non-relative report
a missing person?

597
01:23:36,410 --> 01:23:37,870
Yeah, they can.

598
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,210
Want to?

599
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:42,710
I do.

600
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:44,590
Their name?

601
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,110
<i>I don't know his real name.</i>

602
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:09,570
<i>Not knowing his name, I can't even
file a missing person report.</i>

603
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:23,130
What's Ama's real name?

604
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:26,090
Why, all of a sudden?

605
01:24:28,550 --> 01:24:32,140
He didn't come home.
I want to report him missing.

606
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:37,100
What? You don't know his name?

607
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:39,270
No, I don't.

608
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,980
You're living together, right?

609
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,980
Yes, of course...

610
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:46,270
Stop crying.

611
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:53,410
Look at his mailbox
or at his letters.

612
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:57,620
He didn't put his name on it.

613
01:24:57,950 --> 01:25:02,330
And it's stuffed full of flyers.
We never even opened it.

614
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:05,090
He went to work
as usual yesterday, right?

615
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:09,170
So he didn't come back last night?

616
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:13,180
Right. He didn't come home
since leaving for work.

617
01:25:13,970 --> 01:25:17,760
Why lose your head over 1 day?

618
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:19,930
Nothing to worry about.

619
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:26,360
Don't get in a panic
about a single day. He's not a child.

620
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:31,030
Since living together, he's never once
stayed away from home.

621
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:34,870
He's the kind of guy who calls
if he's 30 minutes late.

622
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:36,830
So what...

623
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,790
He might've killed someone.

624
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,170
That gangster the police mentioned?

625
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:51,050
It was my fault.

626
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:55,680
If I'd ignored that guy
he wouldn't have punched him.

627
01:25:56,510 --> 01:25:59,180
I never thought anyone would die.

628
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:05,020
Even on the news, I never thought
it was the same guy.

629
01:26:06,690 --> 01:26:08,900
I figured it was someone else for sure.

630
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:10,900
Nothing to do with Ama...

631
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:19,870
If you file a report, he might be arrested.

632
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:26,540
If he's on the run 'cause of the fight

633
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:32,420
and we just play dumb,
he might be able to make it.

634
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:34,930
But I'm worried about him.

635
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:41,560
It kills me not to know where he is.

636
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:48,730
He wouldn't try to run away by himself.

637
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:53,280
He'd talk to me, for sure.

638
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:57,280
I'm sure he'd ask me to go with him.

639
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:04,540
I understand.

640
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:07,920
Let's go.

641
01:27:21,930 --> 01:27:24,100
So you had a picture of him?

642
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:30,980
We got carried away when I did the tattoo.

643
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:34,780
Mr. Kazunori Amada, right?

644
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:47,250
Not Amadeus, at all...

645
01:27:52,630 --> 01:27:54,590
Are you okay?

646
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:51,730
Where the hell are you?

647
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:57,900
Why did you leave me?

648
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:13,080
How come you disappeared?

649
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:19,670
You said you cared for me.

650
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:26,260
Then why'd you leave me behind?

651
01:29:28,850 --> 01:29:33,940
Why... why?

652
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:00,420
What are you doing?

653
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:03,550
Show me your tongue.

654
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:09,310
That's a 0 gauge, right?
Yesterday you only had a 4...

655
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:12,270
Stop it.

656
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:18,610
Take it out.

657
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,660
I said don't overdo it, right?

658
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:41,920
When I'm at 00, I'm cutting it.

659
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:46,590
Okay, I get it. Calm down.

660
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,480
Ama...

661
01:30:54,770 --> 01:30:59,270
What would he say if he saw it?

662
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:04,990
"Wow, that's amazing"

663
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:10,620
and he'd laugh...

664
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:15,370
"Nearly there"...

665
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:19,040
That's what he'd say...

666
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,380
I know it...

667
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:29,550
He'd be happy for me.

668
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:46,570
<i>The number you called
may not be in the service area</i>

669
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:49,570
<i>or may be turned off.
Your call cannot be completed.</i>

670
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:03,590
You know where Ama works?

671
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,050
Don't you know?

672
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:07,840
No, I don't.

673
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:13,390
We don't know much about each other.

674
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:17,390
A vintage clothing store.

675
01:32:18,690 --> 01:32:21,100
You really don't know anything.

676
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,570
So you didn't call them yet?

677
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:46,710
It's me. I'm calling about Ama.

678
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:54,430
Skipped work? What about yesterday?

679
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,770
I'll call if I find out anything.

680
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,990
They say he turned up for work
as usual, yesterday.

681
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,320
Today, he skipped work.

682
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,660
They were angry he hadn't called.

683
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:24,670
He works at my friend's store.

684
01:33:27,090 --> 01:33:29,590
I had to beg them to employ him.

685
01:33:33,930 --> 01:33:36,260
Has Ama got any family?

686
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:40,480
I don't know.

687
01:33:42,270 --> 01:33:44,150
I think he might have one parent.

688
01:33:45,610 --> 01:33:49,940
He mentioned a father once, I think.

689
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:51,780
Oh...

690
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:19,470
Jesus. Nothing but booze.

691
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:24,230
Phone's ringing.

692
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:39,200
Yes, I understand.

693
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:00,180
They found a body in the suburbs.

694
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:07,400
They don't know if it's him
but there's a dragon on the body.

695
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:15,570
They want us at the morgue
to identify it.

696
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:18,170
<i>Ama is dead.</i>

697
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:21,180
<i>Asphyxiation by strangulation.</i>

698
01:36:21,930 --> 01:36:25,520
<i>His body covered in cigarette burns.</i>

699
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:30,190
<i>All his nails cleanly plucked off.</i>

700
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:33,690
<i>Something like an incense stick
stuck in his penis.</i>

701
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:40,320
<i>It's like they had their fill of sport
before killing him.</i>

702
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:47,620
<i>The body I regarded as my own
possession, trifled with and killed...</i>

703
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:52,460
I'm off then, Lui.

704
01:36:54,800 --> 01:37:00,380
<i>The last time we spoke
I practically ignored him</i>

705
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:03,050
<i>as I thought about
going to see Shiba-san.</i>

706
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:04,970
See you later.

707
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:43,590
When will you find the killer?

708
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:46,260
We're making a full investigation.

709
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:50,020
Huh? You think I'm out of line?

710
01:37:50,930 --> 01:37:55,730
At the funeral but you didn't catch
the guy, how come?

711
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:58,860
You think I'm a pain-in-the-ass?

712
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:02,280
You've no authority anyway.

713
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:07,410
So what? Is it pushy of me
to demand that you catch him?

714
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,790
You're not trying 'cause Ama
killed someone, right?

715
01:38:12,210 --> 01:38:18,460
You all fuck off and die.
That'd be a big help.

716
01:38:18,590 --> 01:38:21,130
Behave, Lui. You're just ranting.

717
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:24,430
Fuck off. You jerks can all die.

718
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:58,830
Let's just hang out in the store.

719
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,670
The doctor said take it easy, right?

720
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:34,790
<i>After moving out of Ama's place
and living with Shiba-san</i>

721
01:39:35,790 --> 01:39:40,460
<i>he tried so many times to make love
to me, but he couldn't...</i>

722
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:46,970
<i>because I didn't make that look of pain
even when he throttled me.</i>

723
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:05,570
Shiba-san...

724
01:40:07,820 --> 01:40:11,820
Won't you stop putting -san on my name?

725
01:40:14,330 --> 01:40:16,660
My name is Kizuki Shibata.

726
01:40:18,330 --> 01:40:20,080
Sounds like a woman's name, right?

727
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:26,760
Don't know why but everyone
calls me, Shiba.

728
01:40:29,010 --> 01:40:30,680
What should I call you?

729
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:32,350
Kizuki will do.

730
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:38,390
What?

731
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:42,440
It's full... no space for more.

732
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:46,440
Just cram them in.

733
01:40:55,290 --> 01:40:59,250
Lui, can I ask your name?

734
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:01,790
You want to know?

735
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,750
I'm asking 'cause I want to know.

736
01:41:06,210 --> 01:41:07,960
Lui, as in "Louis Vuitton"...

737
01:41:08,130 --> 01:41:10,260
Your real name.

738
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:14,100
Lui Nakazawa.

739
01:41:15,470 --> 01:41:17,930
So Lui is your real name...

740
01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:25,310
Lui, you got family... parents?

741
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:32,070
People think I'm an orphan
but my parents are around.

742
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:36,120
In the suburbs somewhere, I guess.

743
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,660
Not what I expected.

744
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:43,580
I should go introduce myself.

745
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:54,590
Ama and I never got to talk like this.

746
01:41:58,270 --> 01:42:02,600
Wish I'd had normal conversations
with him.

747
01:42:03,690 --> 01:42:06,190
About family...

748
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:12,610
about names and ages...

749
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:21,450
I first heard he was 18 at the funeral.

750
01:42:24,790 --> 01:42:31,300
For the first time in my life
dating a guy younger than me...

751
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,630
then only finding out after he died.

752
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:41,140
The sort of thing we should've
talked about when we met.

753
01:42:56,450 --> 01:43:04,210
The cigarettes stubbed on his body
were all "Marlboro Menthol".

754
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:07,540
Saliva analysis is still underway.

755
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:19,550
The incense inserted into his privates

756
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:25,350
"Extasy" brand imported from America,
Musk scented...

757
01:43:25,890 --> 01:43:28,400
Incense is sold everywhere.

758
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:34,280
Well, yes.
Mainly the Eastern regions...

759
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:45,450
Also, there's one thing we'd like
to ask you, Ms. Nakazawa.

760
01:43:48,750 --> 01:43:55,130
Was there any indication
of Mr. Amada being bisexual?

761
01:43:56,970 --> 01:44:00,090
You're saying he was raped as well?

762
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:06,640
It was discovered at the autopsy.

763
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:13,270
There was no sign of that. I swear.

764
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:15,940
He wasn't that way inclined.

765
01:44:17,950 --> 01:44:19,610
Is that right?

766
01:45:03,490 --> 01:45:05,490
Zero progress.

767
01:45:06,370 --> 01:45:07,660
Really...

768
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:48,200
Take a rest.

769
01:46:46,090 --> 01:46:48,600
Where did you go?
I was worried.

770
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:54,940
I bought some incense. I hate musk.

771
01:46:59,610 --> 01:47:01,610
I got coconut.

772
01:47:21,170 --> 01:47:22,500
What's the problem?

773
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:24,340
Nothing.

774
01:47:24,470 --> 01:47:29,140
Hey, Kizuki. Why not grow your hair?
I love long hair.

775
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:34,680
Maybe. It's worth trying some time.

776
01:51:17,570 --> 01:51:23,580
<i>The proof of Ama's love
dissolves and becomes part of me.</i>

777
01:51:53,230 --> 01:51:58,070
Kizuki, I've got a favor to ask.

778
01:51:58,410 --> 01:51:59,570
What?

779
01:52:05,290 --> 01:52:06,540
You're sure it's okay?

780
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:23,060
Here we go.

781
01:53:02,350 --> 01:53:06,680
<i>Now I can be sure
that the tattoo finally means something.</i>

782
01:53:07,350 --> 01:53:13,310
<i>I had the eyes drawn
so that I myself might have life.</i>

783
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:15,360
Will they fly away?

784
01:53:16,190 --> 01:53:18,030
They just might do that.

785
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:43,840
<i>Everything's fine. Even if
Shiba-san was the one who killed Ama.</i>

786
01:53:44,010 --> 01:53:48,350
<i>Even if he was the one
who raped Ama. It's fine.</i>

787
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:27,970
<i>Is this really what I was after?</i>

788
01:56:28,180 --> 01:56:32,010
<i>Was this ugly, gaping hole
really what I was chasing?</i>

789
01:57:41,420 --> 01:57:42,790
What are you doing?

790
01:57:44,750 --> 01:57:46,960
There's a river inside me.

791
01:57:54,970 --> 01:57:56,640
I just had the strangest dream.

792
01:57:58,270 --> 01:57:59,640
What about?

793
01:58:03,150 --> 01:58:06,440
I was supposed to hang out
with a bunch of old friends.

794
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:11,320
But I turned up really late.

795
01:58:13,110 --> 01:58:19,290
They showed their anger
by singing at me.

796
01:58:22,790 --> 01:58:28,130
Me, surrounded by 5 or 6 of them
as they sang... a song of anger.

797
01:58:35,140 --> 01:58:41,310
<i>When I put in the 00 gauge
will the river flow full flood?</i>
