[Love Between Fairy and Devil]

00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,000
[Episode 19]

4
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,080
Now,

5
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,940
you look like a girl of Moon Tribe.

6
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:59,170
No one can tell you're a fairy from Shuiyuntian.

7
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,950
What do you thank me for?

8
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,260
Thank you

9
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,070
for changing me.

10
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,750
I'm like a different person now.

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,710
In the past,

12
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,930
no matter how many people I killed,

13
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:18,860
or whom I killed,

14
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,010
even if it was to kill my father and brother,

15
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,520
I felt no guilty at all.

16
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,190
Although I'm alive,

17
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,960
I'm like a walking corpse.

18
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,940
But now,

19
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,470
I'm completely different.

20
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,270
I knew it.

21
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,410
You've changed.

22
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,010
Of course.

23
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,650
I used to be ignorant.

24
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,450
But now,

25
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,190
I understand my father's love for me

26
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:48,720
and the sufferings of our people.

27
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
I also understand

28
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,670
your kindness to me,

29
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,040
and your pain of not being able to go home.

30
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,850
So

31
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,700
I've decided

32
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,390
to destroy Shuiyuntian

33
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,870
and kill those scumbags, including Lord Yunzhong.

34
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,350
I want to kill all those who have insulted you,

35
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,820
take your home back,

36
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,950
and return it to you.

37
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,560
By then, you can go back to Shuiyuntian,

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,410
and return to the real Arbiter Hall.

39
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,680
You can even enjoy the sunshine at Yunzhong Water Pavilion

40
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,020
and watch the sunrise there.

41
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,750
You can do whatever you want...

42
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,780
I'm not feeling well.

43
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,240
I'll go back to have a rest.

44
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,110
Did you catch a cold

45
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,210
because of the coldness of Memory Loss River?

46
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,720
I'm just tired.

47
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,060
I'd like to take a rest.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,180
You stayed up late every day to decoct medicine for me.

49
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,180
You must be tired.

50
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:58,990
What are you doing?

51
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,870
I want to be with you

52
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,000
and take care of you.

53
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,180
No need.

54
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,450
I want to rest alone.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,930
Have a good rest.

56
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,150
Why?

57
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,000
I thought everything would be different

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,060
when his emotional root recovers.

59
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,320
But...

60
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,450
Orchid,

61
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,640
you're too full of yourself.

62
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,940
How dare you think

63
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,400
the Moon Supreme will change because of you?

64
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,200
My lord,

65
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,710
I'm guilty.

66
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,090
What did you do wrong?

67
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,880
Today is the deadline

68
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,430
for finding the fragments of Chengying Sword.

69
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:32,980
But

70
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,909
I haven't found the last fragment.

71
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,340
Please punish me.

72
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,290
I won't punish you.

73
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,020
Thank you for your generosity.

74
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,650
Anything else?

75
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,380
Since I followed you,

76
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,770
I have spared no effort in doing everything

77
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,280
I was ordered

78
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,810
and have never slacked off.

79
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,360
But for the case of finding the fragments of the Chengying Sword,

80
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,330
I actually...

81
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:02,710
actually...

82
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,680
What?

83
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,000
Actually, I didn't do my best.

84
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,860
Because if I find all the fragments

85
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,330
and rebuild the Chengying Sword,

86
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,590
you will kill Fairy Orchid immediately.

87
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,030
Whenever I thought about this,

88
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,670
I felt very sad.

89
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,970
So I slacked off.

90
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,740
Please punish me.

91
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,000
Since you can't find it,

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,190
maybe the last fragment

93
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,080
has long been destroyed.

94
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,180
I don't think this sword can be forged.

95
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,480
You don't need to look for it anymore.

96
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,080
Go and work on other matters.

97
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,170
Yes.

98
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,490
How about the fragments found?

99
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,420
Throw them away.

100
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,390
Yes.

101
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,340
Greetings, Your Highness.

102
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,010
Wait.

103
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,610
What is this?

104
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,930
These are the fragments

105
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,790
of the ancient sword of Chengying?

106
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,160
Good eye, Your Highness.

107
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,400
However,

108
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,630
the last fragment is still missing.

109
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,690
I can't rebuild it.

110
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,010
The Lord asked me to throw them away.

111
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,960
Throw them away?

112
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,740
Isn't it a pity to throw them away?

113
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,710
Since my brother doesn't want them,

114
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,310
why don't you give them to me?

115
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,820
Maybe I can find

116
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,670
the last piece.

117
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,120
What?

118
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,409
You can't give me anything my brother doesn't want?

119
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,640
Do you have any respect for me?

120
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:55,690
Yes.

121
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,430
But the Lord said

122
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,440
the last fragment

123
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,950
has already been turned into powder.

124
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,210
We can't find them all.

125
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,290
I don't think you should waste your time on it.

126
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,170
[Shuiyuntian Haotian Tower]

127
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,360
I thought the persuader my brother sent

128
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,660
would be Lord Liyuan.

129
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,950
I didn't expect it to be you.

130
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,030
No.

131
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,220
I really miss you.

132
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,080
I'm worried that you would suffer in Haotian Tower.

133
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,530
That's the reason why

134
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:38,700
I begged Lord Yunzhong to let me visit.

135
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,870
Save your breath.

136
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,530
Go back and tell him

137
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,040
my love for Orchid

138
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,440
will never change.

139
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,160
Since she willingly colluded with the Moon Tribe,

140
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,060
why do you still care so much about her?

141
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,850
She was deceived by Dongfang Qingcang.

142
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,370
It's my fault.

143
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,970
I was too cowardly.

144
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,290
I didn't dare to approach her

145
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,810
and protect her.

146
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,430
I let her be disappointed with

147
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,420
me and Shuiyuntian.

148
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,030
Lord.

149
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,230
Although you've recovered from the wounds,

150
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,160
your Immortal Pond hasn't been recovered.

151
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
You can't stay in the tower anymore.

152
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,440
I can see that

153
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,350
Lord Yunzhong didn't mean to imprison you.

154
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,730
He let me enter the tower

155
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,530
because he left a way out for you.

156
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,490
As long as you apologize to him,

157
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,000
you can get out.

158
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,580
Apologize?

159
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,080
What mistake did I make?

160
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,280
Do you think

161
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,090
loving someone and wanting to protect her

162
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,140
are mistakes?

163
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,720
If it is,

164
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,760
I'd rather keep making mistakes.

165
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,560
Lord Changheng,

166
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,590
don't be sad.

167
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,160
She...

168
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,970
will come back with you.

169
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,410
I saw you getting married

170
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,140
with Orchid in the Tianji Mirror.

171
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:48,520
Really?

172
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,370
The Tianji Mirror is a destiny tool.

173
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,980
The prophecy it makes

174
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,100
will definitely come true.

175
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,790
But I'm engaged to the goddess.

176
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,220
How can I marry Orchid?

177
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,820
It's in...Yunmeng Lake.

178
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,680
What I saw is that

179
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,280
you became a mortal

180
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,180
and married Orchid.

181
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,030
Danyin.

182
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,670
I'm begging you.

183
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,300
Since you can enter the tower,

184
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,110
you can help me out, right？

185
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,070
Please help me.

186
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,450
What are you going to do?

187
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,690
Jump from the Shenshui Hall

188
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,000
to experience hardships in the mortal world.

189
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,680
Lord Changheng,

190
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,780
are you crazy?

191
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,670
The calamities are unpredictable.

192
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,490
If you can't complete your fate,

193
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,850
you may turn into ashes

194
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,620
and will never be able to come back to Shuiyuntian.

195
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,210
Danyin.

196
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,390
This is my only chance.

197
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,400
Please help me.

198
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,190
I don't understand.

199
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,590
You don't understand my feeling

200
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,890
because you've never loved someone

201
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:07,770
like I do.

202
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,210
Danyin. I beg you.

203
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,180
Please help me.

204
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,960
[Shuiyuntian Shenshui Hall]

205
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,280
Danyin.

206
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,090
Thank you.

207
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,330
If we can meet in our next lives,

208
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,770
I, Changheng will repay you with my life.

209
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,880
You said

210
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,350
I didn't know how it feels to love someone.

211
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,440
You're wrong.

212
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,040
I know it.

213
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,520
I know it better than anyone else.

214
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,630
I have no parents.

215
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,770
Why do I keep having these dreams lately?

216
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,840
So you're an old friend.

217
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,940
I read it in a book.

218
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,170
You know all the living creatures

219
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,560
in this world.

220
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,130
You are special.

221
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,010
Me?

222
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,740
Who am I?

223
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,510
Who am I?

224
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,000
It's strange.

225
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,940
Why do I feel cold today?

226
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,500
My lord,

227
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,240
you are possessed by Hellfire.

228
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,700
Why do you feel cold?

229
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,910
Orchid, stop it.

230
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,960
Let's go.

231
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,990
It's not time yet.

232
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,390
If I leave now,

233
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,070
the coldness I bore this morning

234
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,580
will be in vain.

235
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,090
What do you want?

236
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,730
You want to freeze yourself to death?

237
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,260
I want to check my true form.

238
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,750
I must find out

239
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,230
what I am.

240
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,040
Detect your true form just because you freeze yourself for a few hours?

241
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,260
How is that possible?

242
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,500
Miss, I beg you.

243
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,350
If anything happens to you,

244
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,010
the Moon Supreme will kill me.

245
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,560
I've thought about it.

246
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,160
I'm neither an orchid

247
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,720
nor a member of the Moon Tribe.

248
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,560
Maybe...

249
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,830
Maybe I was from the ice of Northernmost Ocean,

250
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,240
which was just recovered by Lord Changheng, so hasn't been registered

251
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,080
and listed in the eight immortal system of Shuiyuntian.

252
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
Maybe I a rhodiola rosea from there.

253
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,230
What a mess!

254
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,830
Stop messing around.

255
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,540
Look at you.

256
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,000
Your face is badly frozen.

257
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,950
Let's go.

258
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,510
What are you doing here?

259
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,590
You don't have to do this even though you want to die.

260
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,510
I'm not a rhodiola rosea either.

261
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,200
Then what am I?

262
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,470
You are a Xishan orchid.

263
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,190
Didn't I tell you earlier?

264
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,290
I took good care of you according to the book.

265
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,720
It worked.

266
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,650
That means you are an orchid plant.

267
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,240
But...

268
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,859
But the Great Turtle didn't show my true form.

269
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,130
Maybe there's a mistake.

270
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:19,050
The Great Turtle never makes mistakes.

271
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,680
I've seen my true form.

272
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,700
It's weird.

273
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,970
What's wrong with my leaves and stems?

274
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:27,890
I don't know

275
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,340
what it was.

276
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:32,640
At first,

277
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,110
I thought

278
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,080
I was just an ordinary grass.

279
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,680
But now,

280
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,180
Moon Supreme,

281
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,520
can you tell me

282
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,450
what I am?

283
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,590
I don't care what you are.

284
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,320
I only know

285
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,330
you're not a nameless grass.

286
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,810
You are the most important person,

287
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,580
the person I care the most

288
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,710
in the three realms.

289
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,080
No one can take you from me.

290
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,350
From now on,

291
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,950
you must stay with me

292
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,550
and be with me forever.

293
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,100
No.

294
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,360
You're the Moon Supreme.

295
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,070
You want to destroy the fairy realm

296
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,380
and kill everyone in Shuiyuntian.

297
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,040
They treated you as a traitor.

298
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,770
but you still treat them as your people.

299
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,400
As long as I know

300
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,260
I'm not a traitor, that's enough.

301
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,440
Even if I die,

302
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,750
I won't betray Shuiyuntian.

303
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,860
Are you going to betray me?

304
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,090
What do you want?

305
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,710
Tell me.

306
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,730
What do you want?

307
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,340
There's a giant gap between us.

308
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,860
How can I betray you?

309
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,470
You are the high-ranking Moon Supreme.

310
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,980
But I...

311
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,450
I'm just

312
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,910
someone who doesn't even know her identity.

313
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,420
How can we have affection

314
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,140
and loyalty?

315
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,810
So please stop putting effort on me anymore,

316
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,900
Moon Supreme.

317
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,840
I don't deserve this honor.

318
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,240
You said there was no affection and loyalty between us.

319
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,780
Then why do you always stay by my side,

320
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,420
and do so many things for me?

321
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,450
You made my seven feelings revived.

322
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,380
And you made me worry about others.

323
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,370
Why are you like this now?

324
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,250
I'm sorry.

325
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,930
Why are you saying these now?

326
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,730
You're the leader of the Moon Tribe.

327
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,940
You're carrying the mission of the Moon Tribe.

328
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,260
I'm the same.

329
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,790
Shuiyuntian is my home.

330
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,650
I just want to return your home to you.

331
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,040
And you just said

332
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,320
you might not be a fairy.

333
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,850
But the people I care about,

334
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,530
besides you,

335
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,680
are all there.

336
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,040
Let me ask you.

337
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,960
When you step into the Spirit Lock Gate,

338
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,690
if Changheng stops you there,

339
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,190
what will you do?

340
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,660
Kill him.

341
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,990
What will you do

342
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,470
if my master stops you?

343
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,030
Since she's your master,

344
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,390
if she's willing to surrender,

345
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,020
I will spare her life.

346
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,000
What if she refuses to surrender

347
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:37,030
and insists on defending Shuiyuntian even if she has to die?

348
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,830
Can't you give up the fairy realm

349
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,850
for me?

350
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,810
Can you give up the hatred of the Moon Tribe,

351
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,460
and your promise to your father and your people?

352
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:37,600
[The ancient battlefield Xuanxu Realm]

353
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:38,650
Brother.

354
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,840
I've confirmed the Hellfire wound on her body.

355
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,100
She's the reincarnation of Chidi woman.

356
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,500
After today,

357
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,120
we are able to take revenge.

358
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,570
Brother.

359
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,720
I knew

360
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,120
you've changed.

361
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,130
Why are you hesitating?

362
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,320
Stop!

363
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,500
This... Why?

364
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,230
Why didn't the primordial spirit vanish

365
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,590
after being taken out?

366
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,680
Regardless of immortals or mortals,

367
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,530
they all have their one-page destiny in the Destiny Books.

368
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,710
Their destiny is written in the Destiny Books.

369
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,280
I used to sit there every day to fix the Destiny Books.

370
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,580
But not here.

371
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,170
These are all fake.

372
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,820
The real fate tree is in Shuiyuntian.

373
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,490
I know.

374
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,210
Don't interrupt.

375
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,890
Go on with how immortals experience hardships.

376
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,990
When immortals experience hardships as mortals,

377
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,040
there are different fates in each life.

378
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,850
They must follow the fate poem

379
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,070
in the book,

380
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,960
and let what should happen happen.

381
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,480
Then the hardship can be considered a success.

382
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,160
It's so complicated.

383
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,010
Not really.

384
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,190
Let me give you an example.

385
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,000
The Destiny Books are like

386
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,550
the novels of Yunmeng Lake.

387
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,110
Fate poem is the story in the novel.

388
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,000
In the novel, it records

389
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,850
when a mortal was born,

390
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,240
when he will be a number one scholar,

391
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,590
and when he'll get married and have children.

392
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,600
Although the fate poem

393
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,480
is not as detailed

394
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,120
as the stories in the novel,

395
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,960
it still shows the key things

396
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,290
that one must experience in his lifetime.

397
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,370
Hence,

398
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,840
if a person is written to be

399
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,260
a number one scholar

400
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,150
and a high-ranking officer on this day,

401
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,760
but there is an accident on his way to the exam

402
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,810
causing him to miss the exam,

403
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,450
so he can't become the number one scholar.

404
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,920
Then this will be considered a failed hardship?

405
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,760
Yes.

406
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,740
So what if one fails?

407
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,090
It will damage his cultivation at least,

408
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,690
or he will be turned into ashes.

409
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,450
A senior immortal with more powerful cultivation

410
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,510
will face more dangerous hardships.

411
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,110
That means

412
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,960
if a senior immortal goes to experience hardships,

413
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,930
but he dies when he's still a baby,

414
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,370
the his primordial spirit will vanish?

415
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,210
Yes.

416
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,130
That's why

417
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,230
unless there is a reason why they must go,

418
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,090
generally speaking, senior immortals won't experience hardships.

419
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,090
Jieli,

420
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:13,770
when did you

421
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,120
start to be interested in these things?

422
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,960
I remember

423
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,350
you never listened to me

424
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:23,260
when I complained to you how complicated it is to fix the Destiny Books.

425
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:23,850
You know,

426
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,320
that room hasn't been cleaned yet.

427
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,180
Go and clean it.

428
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,550
I just did.

429
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,400
Come on, clean it again.

430
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,030
Hurry up.

431
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,700
Hurry up.

432
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,850
Hurry up.

433
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,650
Clean it up.

434
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,490
Okay.

435
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,100
Greetings, my lord.

436
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,520
I see.

437
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,960
My lord,

438
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,980
I've asked everything

439
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,280
you wanted to know.

440
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,840
My lord,

441
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,650
can you stop thinking about killing me?

442
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,690
Half a lifetime of glory, half a lifetime of dust.

443
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,000
A magnificent dance stunned the whole Lucheng City.

444
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,150
Her beauty was just like the willow.

445
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,080
Hearing the flute on the night the Lantern Festival.

446
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,220
She was heartbroken and about to end her life.

447
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,610
She met her Mr. Right who understood her so well.

448
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,050
They were destined to get married.

449
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:45,310
Her life would be ended on the wedding night by her husband.

450
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:51,040
If the poem is right,

451
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,960
we'll have to wait

452
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,770
until the wedding day

453
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,990
when she is killed by her husband

454
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,880
so that we can get her primordial spirit.

455
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,850
Is the fairy

456
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,280
lying to us

457
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,170
to buy some time?

458
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,700
I asked Jieli to ask around

459
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,830
to prevent her from being suspicious.

460
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,650
Since she knew nothing,

461
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,750
she wouldn't have deceived her on purpose.

462
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,720
Besides,

463
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,450
the primordial spirit almost turned into ashes.

464
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,460
That matches her words.

465
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,610
It can't be fake.

466
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,290
Brother,

467
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,390
I still have a question.

468
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,840
You kept that fairy

469
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,370
to repair the Destiny Book.

470
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,610
Since the Destiny Book has been fixed,

471
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,680
why didn't you kill her?

472
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,800
I can't kill her.

473
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,100
Why?

474
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,840
I have my reasons.

475
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,530
Send the baby to Lucheng City immediately.

476
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,130
Don't delay her from experiencing hardships.

477
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,240
Yes.

478
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,500
Jieli only does things that are beneficial to her.

479
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,030
Why did she ask about experiencing the hardships for no reason?

480
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,510
If it wasn't Jieli who's curious about it,

481
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,970
it must be someone else who asked her to do so.

482
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,880
Who can order Jieli to work for him?

483
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,570
Experiencing hardships?

484
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,970
Oh,

485
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,100
the Destiny Book...

486
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,880
It's Dongfang Qingcang.

487
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,810
Jieli asked about the senior immortals.

488
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:34,730
Could that mortal

489
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,500
Xie Wanqing

490
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,430
be a senior immortal who is experiencing hardships?

491
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,120
But

492
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,810
there are a few senior immortals in Shuiyuntian.

493
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,700
How would I not know

494
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,900
if one senior immortal was sent to experience hardships?

495
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,070
Master never told me about that.

496
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,510
And why was the Destiny Book

497
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,610
hidden in Haishi City?

498
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,200
Half a lifetime of glory, half a lifetime of dust.

499
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,440
A magnificent dance stunned the whole Lucheng City.

500
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,280
Her beauty was just like the willow.

501
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,180
Hearing the flute on the night the Lantern Festival.

502
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,300
She was heartbroken and about to end her life.

503
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,420
She met her Mr. Right who understood her so well.

504
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,910
They were destined to get married.

505
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:44,580
Her life would be ended on the wedding night by her husband.

506
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,640
She died under the bridegroom's sword on the wedding night.

507
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,360
No.

508
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,700
To be more exact,

509
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,930
she will be killed repeatedly by the ones she loves forever.

510
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,650
What a tragic fate.

511
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,260
Hide yourself well.

512
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,480
Xie Wanqing.

513
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,750
Who are you?

514
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Why do I seem to have seen you before?

515
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,010
Who am I then?

516
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,070
Xie Wanqing.

517
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,050
If she is really a senior immortal,

518
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,240
whose Destiny Book Dongfang Qingcang cares so much,

519
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,800
then he must want to find her through the fate poem.

520
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,480
He also asked Jieli to ask me

521
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,140
about the primordial spirit.

522
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,270
Is he going to take the primordial spirit of this senior immortal?

523
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,700
Orchid,

524
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,390
what are you doing?

525
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,190
Jieli,

526
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,540
didn't you go to play chess with Shangque?

527
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,550
Why are you back?

528
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,730
He went to Yunmeng Lake with the Moon Supreme

529
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,320
to make the Lord feel better.

530
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,180
They won't be back until tonight.

531
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,230
I'm so bored.

532
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,010
The time in the three realms are different.

533
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,190
If he leaves for a few hours,

534
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:23,660
wouldn't he

535
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,920
stay in the mortal world for a few months?

536
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,540
Yunmeng Lake?

537
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,170
Yes.

538
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,810
I think

539
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,070
you made him angry.

540
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,250
So he wants to be away from you.

541
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:35,960
Besides,

542
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,260
Lucheng City is bustling with activities.

543
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,590
It's more fun than the Silent Moon Palace.

544
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,130
Lucheng City.

545
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,360
A magnificent dance stunned the whole Lucheng City.

546
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,090
It's the Lucheng City where Xie Wanqing experienced her hardships.

547
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:47,890
Jieli.

548
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,290
Which year and month is Yunmeng Lake in now?

549
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,320
It's the first month of the Year Yi Si.

550
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,620
What's wrong?

551
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,130
Lucheng City.

552
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,470
The Lantern Festival.

553
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,900
The night of the Lantern Festival.

554
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,160
Meeting her Mr. Right.

555
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,720
By the way,

556
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,030
at the Lantern Festival, Xie Wanqing will meet the one

557
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,690
who is destined to be with her.

558
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,440
His target must be Xie Wanqing.

559
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,650
What is he going to do?

560
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,630
Hey.

561
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,230
What are you thinking about?

562
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,660
Jieli.

563
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,500
Pack up.

564
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,300
We're going to Lucheng City too.

565
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,110
Really?

566
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,620
Are we really going to Lucheng City?

567
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,270
[Yunmeng Lake Lucheng City]

568
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:50,970
Jieli.

569
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:51,770
Let's go.

570
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,780
It's been a long time

571
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,000
since last time I came here.

572
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,330
There are more new things in Yunmeng Lake.

573
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,140
What are you doing? Let me have a look.

574
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,060
Stop looking at it.

575
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,570
They are gone.

576
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,450
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

577
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,450
I still want to...

578
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,230
Who allowed you to come?

579
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,750
Didn't I tell you that

580
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,020
you could't go out without my order?

581
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,489
Since I am

582
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,719
the "high-ranking Moon Supreme",

583
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,320
why didn't you obey my order?

584
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,090
Go back.

585
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,080
Shangque.

586
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,530
Take them back to the Silent Moon Palace immediately.

587
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:06,950
Yes.

588
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:10,430
She wants to take a walk with you, my lord.

589
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,680
Orchid kept sighing

590
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,320
in the garden just now.

591
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,160
She said that

592
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,630
she shouldn't have made you angry a few days ago.

593
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,850
She felt guilty.

594
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,240
Seeing you being upset,

595
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,330
she was very worried.

596
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,510
So she wanted to take a walk with you.

597
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,560
Yes.

598
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:36,980
My lord.

599
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,650
Since Fairy Orchid cares about you,

600
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,590
how about

601
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,650
we let her come with us?

602
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,220
My lord,

603
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:03,940
can I walk around?

604
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,440
Me too.

605
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,750
I want to walk around too.

606
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,420
No, no, no.

607
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,410
Don't...

608
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,400
I'm leaving.

609
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,600
Here you go.

610
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,460
Thank you, sir.

611
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,950
Sugar figures.

612
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,800
Come and see the sugar figures.

613
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,680
Sugar figures.

614
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,410
Come and see the sugar figures.

615
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,110
Want some sugar figures?

616
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:44,730
Boss,

617
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,530
how many spirit stones does this cost?

618
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:46,950
What?

619
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,330
How many spirit stones does this cost?

620
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,690
Are these enough?

621
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,040
He looks smart,

622
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,760
but I didn't expect that he's a fool.

623
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,160
He's buying sugar figures with jewellery.

624
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,050
Your spirit stones are too small.

625
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,060
They're not enough.

626
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,190
The sugar figures I made are

627
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,330
ancestral craftsmanship.

628
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,550
You can't find another booth that sells this

629
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,730
in Lucheng City.

630
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,880
Are these enough now?

631
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,760
Yes. Yes.

632
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:20,130
How dare you cheat in front of me?

633
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,940
He wanted to buy it

634
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,580
himself.

635
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,850
A sugar man

636
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,590
only costs three to five cents.

637
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,720
Give them back to me.

638
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,100
I won't return

639
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,400
the money.

640
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,900
Come here.

641
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,000
Come here.

642
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,160
Please judge for me everyone.

643
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,740
This liar pretended to sell sugar figures,

644
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,580
and cheated a dozen western gems

645
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,390
from my brother.

646
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,770
Please look at him.

647
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:52,700
I bet all of you can tell that my brother is silly just by his appearance.

648
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,730
He has brain disease since childhood.

649
00:37:59,150 --> 00:37:59,570
Well,

650
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,710
isn't this bullying? Right?

651
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,810
Yes. It's bullying.

652
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,740
Please judge for me.

653
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,290
Bullying a sick person,

654
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,460
you're heartless.

655
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,660
Give me back the gems!

656
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:15,470
Here you go.

657
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:17,710
Bad luck.

658
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,740
Wait.

659
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,630
You have lied to us. How can you leave now?

660
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,310
What else do you want?

661
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,830
To compensate my brother.

662
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,640
Two sugar figures. Give them to me.

663
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,930
Give them to her.

664
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:32,540
That's right.

665
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,660
Give them to her.

666
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:35,370
Give them to her.

667
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:35,930
Hurry.

668
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,100
Dismiss.

669
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,250
Thank you, everyone.

670
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,830
It's all solved here. You can go.

671
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,560
Good for you.

672
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:55,820
Of course.

673
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,480
He wanted to trick me?

674
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,090
He was just playing tricks in front of his master.

675
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,730
Stupid Black Dragon,

676
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,990
you used to be imposing in the Silent Moon Palace.

677
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,930
Why didn't you use your brain this time?

678
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,440
How could this stupid sugar man

679
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,200
cost so many spirit stones?

680
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,840
I think that sugar figure is interesting.

681
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,700
I've never seen it in Cangyan Sea.

682
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,430
I remember you like sweets,

683
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,800
so I just wanted to buy it for you.

684
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,060
Forget it.

685
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,160
Since you're so thoughtful,

686
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,960
from now on,

687
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,680
you can only be deceived by me.

688
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,150
If anyone dares to deceive you,

689
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,830
I won't let him off the hook.

690
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,630
Where are Shangque and Jieli?

691
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,920
Being attracted by the interesting things in mortal world,

692
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,150
he even left his post without permission.

693
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,150
I must punish him.

694
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,370
Moon Supreme,

695
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,330
thank you.

696
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,240
I made you angry.

697
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,630
You didn't blame me.

698
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,950
You still allow me to walk around and play here.

699
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,570
No need.

700
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,920
Since you said

701
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,390
you and I are not friends,

702
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,120
I have nothing to blame you for.

703
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,920
With you here,

704
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,180
there will be one more person to serve me.

705
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,630
Since you and I are not friends,

706
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,360
don't say these empty words anymore.

707
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,580
I don't like to hear.

708
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,180
Oh.

709
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,040
Can you say anything else

710
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,170
besides "Oh"?

711
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,830
I'm afraid that if I say too much,

712
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,030
I will make you angry.

713
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,260
Yes.

714
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,740
It's good to keep yourself silent.

715
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,020
I told you it's right to take me with you.

716
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,960
Otherwise, your dragon scales will be stripped off to make clothes,

717
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,940
and your dragon tendons will be taken away as a belt.

718
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,070
You even need to help them count money.

719
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,720
Why are you laughing?

720
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,440
Let me ask you.

721
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,820
Do you know copper coins?

722
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,970
Do you know how much copper coins you can get from one ingot of silver?

723
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,500
How much can you buy with it?

724
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,690
Since we are in the Yunmeng Lake,

725
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,210
we have to do as the mortals do.

726
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,480
We should follow the rules of mortals.

727
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,530
Do not attract too much attention of others.

728
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,100
I am the rule.

729
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,840
No.

730
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,100
My master said

731
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,540
Yunmeng Lake has its own destiny.

732
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,590
Neither the Moon Tribe nor the fairy realm

733
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,570
are allowed to interfere.

734
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,420
If we act impulsively

735
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,310
and disturb the fate of mortals,

736
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,780
it will lead to their primordial spirits

737
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,340
being turned to ashes.

738
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,950
In that case,

739
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,550
if we affect the Chidi woman,

740
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,880
it will be complicated.

741
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,720
Jieli.

742
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,050
This is your fault.

743
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,470
Yes.

744
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,210
The Moon Supreme was born with great talents

745
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,660
and amazing power.

746
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,370
Who doesn't respect him?

747
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,690
You let him to be an ordinary mortal,

748
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,660
this may be too hard on him.

749
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,010
Yes.

750
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,740
I overstepped the line.

751
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:47,980
Hard?

752
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:49,780
Nothing is more difficult

753
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,840
than subduing ancient monsters

754
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,440
and ruling the three armies.

755
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,960
Even if I am a mortal,

756
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,430
I can be the best one.

757
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:00,490
Jieli.

758
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:01,840
Yes!

759
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:03,730
Go ahead.

760
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,110
How do mortals do?

761
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,430
The most important thing

762
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,610
of being a mortal is that

763
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:11,960
you can't use your power freely.

764
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,960
Especially, you can't be seen by others when using it.

765
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:15,990
What else?

766
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:17,970
Also,

767
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:20,780
you have to change your title

768
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,910
to avoid suspicion.

769
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,990
You will be no longer the Moon Supreme here.

770
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:28,300
This...

771
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,070
This...

772
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,920
The Supreme Lord of Yunmeng Lake

773
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,070
is the emperor.

774
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,010
Then I am the emperor.

775
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,490
You may not know this,

776
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:48,790
but there can only

777
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:49,930
be one emperor.

778
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,610
This is simple.

779
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,920
I'll kill him.

780
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,140
No, no.

781
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,190
It's fate.

782
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:58,450
We can't change their fate.

783
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,220
The mortals will turn into ashes.

784
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,140
Then tell me

785
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,160
who should I be?

786
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,870
With your bearing,

787
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:10,270
you must be rich or noble.

788
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:13,150
Normal status is not suitable for you.

789
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,010
In my opinion,

790
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,670
you should be a landlord,

791
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,820
from Jinling,

792
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,210
Mr. Dongfang.

793
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:26,000
You're a genius in business,

794
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,260
and you're super rich.

795
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,530
That means you're more powerful than the emperor.

796
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:30,830
Even the shoulder pole used by your servant

797
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:31,960
is made of pure gold.

798
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,770
Recently, you brought your family

799
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,230
to settle in Lucheng City.

800
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,450
What do you think, my lord?

801
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,620
And Orchid,

802
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,620
you can't be a fairy of Shuiyuntian.

803
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:50,740
You are the gardening maid

804
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,270
in the mansion of the landlord, Mr. Dongfang.

805
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,550
As for me,

806
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,740
I'm just the accounting maid

807

who is charge of money.

808
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:04,350
I'm not a fairy.

809
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:06,990
He's not the Moon Supreme.

810
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:13,000
That would be good if it could really be like that.

811
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,140
Shangque is still

812
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,070
a guard of Mr. Dongfang's mansion.

813

How is it?

814
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:20,720
That's all I have to say.

815
