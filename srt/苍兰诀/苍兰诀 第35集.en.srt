4
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,729
Hao,

5
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,700
I...

6
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,740
What did I do?

7
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,100
Hao.

8
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,540
What did I do?

9
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,900
What did I do?

10
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,600
Master.

11
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,860
What's wrong, my old friend?

12
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,340
Looks like you are not satisfied.

13
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,870
What happened to my master?

14
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,260
She's staying by your side

15
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,920
all real and alive, isn't she?

16
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,570
And the way she is now

17
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,780
is what you asked from me, no?

18
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,900
Nonsense!

19
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,160
30,000 years ago,

20
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,300
weren't you the one to beg me to gather

21
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,490
a string of primordial spirit for her with evil spirit

22
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,460
and send her into the mortal world to experience hardships.

23
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,360
Those who touched the evil spirit become totally different.

24
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,460
You saw it with your own eyes.

25
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,260
But why did the others only

26
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,480
lust for blood for a short while?

27
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,790
No one was ever

28
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,800
so miserable

29
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,150
and insane like her

30
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,380
longing for the evil spirit endlessly.

31
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,579
Her primordial spirit has been nourished by the evil aura

32
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,390
for 30,000 years and damaged by it gravely.

33
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,420
If she wants to keep living,

34
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,850
she has to keep absorbing the evil spirit

35
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,460
until her primordial spirit was completely occupied by the evil.

36
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,020
She would lose her power,

37
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,030
memory

38
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,870
and consciousness.

39
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,010
In the end, she would become

40
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,820
a monster worse than animals.

41
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,880
How could it be?

42
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,070
It's you.

43
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,460
I've already found

44
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,300
the Goddess for you

45
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,560
and unlocked the seal.

46
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,530
I did everything

47
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,530
you asked me to do.

48
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,820
But why did you break your promise

49
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,950
and harm my master like this?

50
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,380
Do not rush, old friend.

51
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,570
I'm one step away

52
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,580
from what I promised you.

53
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:39,810
What step?

54
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,909
After I take your master's immortal body

55
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,840
and merge with her primordial spirit,

56
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,360
she will be free.

57
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,680
If your primordial spirit occupies master's immortal body,

58
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,540
my master would become

59
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,210
a senseless puppet.

60
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,090
How dare you treat me as a string of primordial spirit?

61
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,300
You underestimate me.

62
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,370
I am Tai Sui, the ancient Evil God.

63
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm different from any living beings in the Three Realms.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,860
In other words,

65
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,700
I'm not any ordinary living creature.

66
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,960
Then what are you?

67
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,970
I told you before

68
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,740
I am the darkest desire

69
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,590
in everyone's heart.

70
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,490
I was born in the heart of all beings in the Three Realms.

71
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,690
Naturally that includes your master as well.

72
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,790
Even if I merge with her,

73
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,980
she's still the Chidi woman.

74
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,870
She still remembers all her past with you,

75
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,800
except that

76
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,230
she won't be so painful anymore.

77
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,090
She can live in seclusion with you

78
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,220
and play the zither, practice swords.

79
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,159
No.

80
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,230
I will never trust you again.

81
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,630
You will.

82
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,700
Because you don't have other choices.

83
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,780
I used

84
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,710
to comb your hair a lot.

85
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,950
Your black hair is like silk.

86
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,010
It seems that you will never grow old.

87
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,150
Hao.

88
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,010
Kill me.

89
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,070
Master, do you remember

90
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,950
that I made a mistake when I was young?

91
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,530
And you didn't punish me,

92
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,500
instead you...

93
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,180
Hao, let me die.

94
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,490
End my pain.

95
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,820
I don't want to live like this anymore.

96
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,340
Master.

97
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,390
I've thought it through.

98
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,940
From now on,

99
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,290
I will help you

100
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,990
refine the evil spirit everyday.

101
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:53,990
Anyway,

102
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,260
Just like what I did

103
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,260
for the past 30,000 years.

104
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,120
It's easy.

105
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,510
Right?

106
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,800
Have you made up your mind,

107
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,350
Rong Hao?

108
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,210
If you take master's immortal body

109
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,770
and merge with her primordial spirit,

110
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,430
will she be no longer in pain?

111
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,570
She will not.

112
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,440
And I get to stay by her side

113
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,580
forever.

114
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,430
That's right.

115
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,940
You and her

116
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,420
will never be apart again.

117
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,220
You'd better keep your promise.

118
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,090
I never break my promise.

119
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:42,670
Hao,

120
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,060
It's time.

121
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,110
Master.

122
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,280
Tai Sui will find this place soon.

123
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,360
From now on,

124
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,480
you will never be in pain.

125
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,470
Hao, what are you doing?

126
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,640
As long as Tai Sui merges with your primordial spirit

127
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,310
and takes your immortal body,

128
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,600
you will be free.

129
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,040
You'll no longer suffer

130
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,430
and never leave me again.

131
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,070
No.

132
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,400
Your mortal heart is too strong.

133
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,289
That's why you were bewitched by Tai Sui

134
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,350
and couldn't see the fate of life and death.

135
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,400
I beg you.

136
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,360
Don't make more mistakes.

137
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,110
I was originally mortal.

138
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,770
My mortal heart is always there.

139
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,530
As for the matter life and death,

140
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,240
I can't see through it

141
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,300
and I don't want to.

142
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,470
Hao.

143
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,810
Master's intelligence is unparalleled.

144
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,300
You were born a Goddess.

145
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,120
You only care about the Three Realms

146
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,890
and don't understand what I am thinking.

147
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,150
The only mortal heart I have left

148
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,970
is to save master's life.

149
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,000
As long as you are alive,

150
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,660
I'm willing to do anything.

151
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,750
Why is such a simple

152
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,840
and insignificant wish so hard to fulfill

153
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,670
even if you destroy the world?

154
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,570
Hao,

155
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,200
I once had a mortal heart.

156
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,570
That lady

157
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,210
has been sitting by the window for three days.

158
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,010
Yes.

159
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,320
It's freezing outside.

160
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,330
I'm afraid that blind boy

161
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,250
won't survive today.

162
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,430
He'd better not die at the door.

163
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,810
That would be unlucky.

164
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,480
Move.

165
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,760
But you still have a kind heart

166
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,720
and saved me in that snowy day.

167
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,510
I asked the Arbiter

168
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,620
to teach me how to change the fate.

169
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,230
The Dead cannot be revived.

170
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,440
That is the law.

171
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,630
If you must bring back someone who's dead,

172
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,960
it will bring disaster.

173
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,860
Even if you are a Goddess,

174
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,060
you are no exception.

175
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,420
God Chidi.

176
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,390
Have you

177
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,850
really made up your mind?

178
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,300
Yes.

179
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,450
Please help me.

180
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,970
Whatever the price is,

181
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,120
I'll take it.

182
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,060
If one day,

183
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,250
the price will doom you.

184
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,530
Will you regret it?

185
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,060
Master had this mortal heart

186
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,110
for me?

187
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,050
Yes.

188
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,360
It's for you.

189
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,510
What are you doing?

190
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:46,860
What do you mean?

191
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,250
Didn't we agree on this?

192
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,480
From now on,

193
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,370
my master will no longer be in pain.

194
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:54,920
You...

195
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,190
You planned all this.

196
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,990
How dare you lie to me?

197
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,830
That's right.

198
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,310
I lured you here

199
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,930
so that I can detonate my primordial spirit

200
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,730
and die with you.

201
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,700
Rong Hao,

202
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,810
I'm only one last step away

203
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,060
to be with my master forever

204
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,390
and never be apart.

205
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,260
You overestimate yourself.

206
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,730
I will not die.

207
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,960
Back then, the First Goddess Wuqi detonated her primordial spirit

208
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,810
and just sealed me.

209
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,570
A mere nobody

210
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,260
trying to die with me.

211
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,140
Master.

212
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,750
I'm sorry.

213
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,030
It's Tai Sui.

214
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,690
He...

215
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,540
seems furious.

216
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,270
Rong Hao,

217
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,930
now that you and your master are buried together,

218
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,130
you've got your wish.

219
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,600
From now on,

220
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,420
every time I visit you,

221
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,330
I'll bring you some wine.

222
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:14,569
Chidi,

223
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,510
you are my only opponent in my life.

224
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,839
Unfortunately, we have no chance to fight again.

225
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,790
Tai Sui has appeared

226
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,990
and wrecked havoc everywhere.

227
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,200
Changheng.

228
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,090
What we have to do

229
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,320
can't be delayed any longer.

230
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,410
Magical Firefly Stone.

231
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,430
Goddess,

232
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,210
you are really knowledgeable.

233
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,110
I once thought it would be nice

234
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,090
if I could pick a star

235
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,820
and carry it as a lantern at night.

236
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,210
At that time,

237
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,890
an old friend told me

238
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,400
that a magical jade in the Northernmost Ocean

239
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,910
is just like a star.

240
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,100
So are you the Goddess Xi Yun,

241
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,960
or Orchid?

242
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,210
I'm the Goddess Xi Yun

243
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,270
and also Orchid.

244
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,250
I remember everything

245
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,970
in my two lives.

246
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,660
Since you remember everything,

247
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,670
why?

248
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,500
Could it be

249
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,680
that you no longer love him?

250
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,560
Or

251
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,060
you love me.

252
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,940
You still love him.

253
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,500
Then,

254
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,730
why did you agree to marry me?

255
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,170
The Founder Lord Dong

256
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,370
has made a covenant with the Xilan clan.

257
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,040
Only by marriage,

258
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,640
can you activate your power.

259
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,270
Therefore,

260
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,600
the two clans protected the Three Realms for generations.

261
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,610
That's why we are betrothed.

262
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,970
This is our irrevocable destiny.

263
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,870
Now that Tai Sui has broken his seal,

264
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,950
the Three Realms are in danger.

265
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,250
I need the supreme power

266
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,140
to destroy him completely.

267
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,370
Whether you like it or not,

268
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,970
this is the only way.

269
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,430
What's next?

270
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,890
What do you mean?

271
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,530
The Goddess Wuqi drained her primordial spirit

272
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,960
in order to kill Tai Sui.

273
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,960
If you want to destroy Tai Sui completely,

274
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,240
what will happen?

275
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,060
Why did you pretend to know nothing

276
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,790
and refuse to reunite with Dongfang Qingcang?

277
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,230
You will die,

278
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,130
right?

279
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:14,830
Yes.

280
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,090
You and Dongfang Qingcang love each other.

281
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,210
You would rather lie to him

282
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,740
than let him suffer any more.

283
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,520
What about me?

284
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,010
How could you...

285
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,100
How could you let me marry you

286
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,570
and then watch you die?

287
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,820
Have you considered me?

288
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,460
Changheng.

289
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,460
I'm sorry.

290
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,960
I don't need an apology.

291
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,670
You know I don't want an apology.

292
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,030
Are you going to tell me

293
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,630
you also don't have a choice?

294
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:58,840
No.

295
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,070
I have chosen

296
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,840
to be the Goddess of Xishan.

297
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,140
From the moment I reincarnated,

298
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,230
I chose to let go of my personal feelings

299
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,690
and protect the people.

300
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,020
Changheng,

301
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,850
only you can help me.

302
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,570
But you're asking me to sacrifice your life.

303
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,080
I can't do it.

304
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,810
I can't.

305
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,110
Changheng,

306
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,210
you must help me.

307
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,380
Besides Chidi,

308
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,190
Dongfang Qingcang is the only one

309
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,910
who's compatible with Tai Sui's immortal body.

310
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,920
Now Chidi is dead.

311
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,970
I'm afraid his next target

312
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,160
is Dongfang Qingcang.

313
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,090
Yes.

314
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,750
Are you really going to sacrifice yourself

315
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,610
to protect him?

316
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,460
I love all the people.

317
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,090
I also love one person.

318
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,660
Goddess.

319
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,630
What is it?

320
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,100
Don't worry.

321
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,960
I've figured it out.

322
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,940
You are not Orchid.

323
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,870
Little Orchid

324
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,560
is really gone.

325
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,940
Tomorrow is you and Changheng's wedding.

326
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,410
I won't bother you after that.

327
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,230
But before I leave Xishan,

328
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,750
I want to ask you

329
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,980
one last favor.

330
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,630
This Lovesickness Bridge

331
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,870
was the place where Orchid and I fell in love.

332
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,970
Why did you bring me here?

333
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:11,110
[Orchid]

334
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,530
Legend has it that

335
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,490
if two people hang the Love Lock on this bridge,

336
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,100
they can be together forever

337
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,750
in the entire life.

338
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,590
That night,

339
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,110
we were going to hang this lock.

340
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,400
Unfortunately, we failed.

341
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,330
So I hope you don't mind me asking you

342
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,480
to hang this lock with me.

343
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,470
In this way...

344
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,680
She's gone.

345
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,000
And she can't be with you together.

346
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,360
There's no meaning of hanging the lock.

347
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,080
There is.

348
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,780
Although she's gone,

349
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,110
I will never forget her.

350
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,090
[Orchid]

351
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,590
I will keep the memories of the two of us.

352
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,710
That's also a way of being together.

353
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,810
You have a long life ahead of you.

354
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,420
There are thousands of beauties

355
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,550
in the Three Realms.

356
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,060
Is there no one else

357
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,370
to your liking?

358
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:33,850
No.

359
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,310
Never.

360
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,960
Not in this life,

361
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,140
or other lives.

362
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,110
Only her.

363
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,810
She's just an orchid.

364
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,920
Why can't you forget her?

365
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,680
You don't understand.

366
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,330
You will never understand

367
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,070
the feelings between us.

368
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,570
In this world,

369
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,710
people hate me,

370
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:20,890
fear me,

371
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,230
rely on me

372
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,950
and admire me.

373
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,570
Only she's the one

374
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:31,740
who loves me.

375
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,010
She helped me through the difficulties.

376
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,930
She helped me recover my love.

377
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,140
She will follow me

378
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,920
even if she'd stand against the world.

379
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:47,520
And I...

380
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,530
I'm full of thorns.

381
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,670
I will only make her sad.

382
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:53,980
I'm a jerk.

383
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:56,840
But she

384
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,170
is a fool.

385
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,810
She knew I was so bad

386
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,990
but she made every excuse to forgive me

387
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,730
and hold me tight,

388
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,400
even if it hurt.

389
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:16,960
I wanted her to know so much

390
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,180
that I'm not that jerk anymore.

391
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,740
I will love her

392
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,380
and protect her

393
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,320
and not let her suffer any more.

394
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,430
But there is no chance.

395
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,530
Stop talking.

396
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,510
I...

397
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,370
I shouldn't have asked you to come.

398
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,110
Although you look like her,

399
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,830
you are not her.

400
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,560
I can hang the lock myself.

401
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,810
She will always be in my heart.

402
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,650
She and I

403
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,550
will never be apart.

404
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,480
[Orchid]

405
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,080
Now you will never know

406
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,070
that I'm not that evil anymore.

407
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,340
That Bone Orchid was absorbing your primordial spirit.

408
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,340
The only way

409
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,100
to break the Bone Orchid and save you

410
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,990
was to stop you from loving me.

411
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,240
That's why I lied to you

412
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,710
and humiliated you

413
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,230
so that you would not love me.

414
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,230
Why do you love me until the day you die?

415
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,570
I've stayed long enough.

416
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,460
I should go back to Cangyan Sea.

417
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,140
I wish you a very happy wedding, Goddess.

418
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,120
Goodbye.

419
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:13,730
Wait.

420
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,880
Is there anything else?

421
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,790
See?

422
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,380
You look good when you smile like this.

423
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,790
Like this.

424
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,150
Remember?

425
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,210

Destiny Book.

443
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,270
It's Orchid's.

444
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,880
When Xilan was destroyed,

445
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,240
her clansmen sealed her into a seed

446
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,570
and entrusted her to me.

447
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,720
But I...

448
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,690
I could only forge the form of an orchid

449
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,510
but not shake her fate.

450
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,790
There's a new fate

451
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,480
in her Destiny Book.

452
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,790
But she clearly told me

453
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,360
the fate of Gods are the most stable.

454
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,470
It won't change easily.

455
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,440
Her fate is broken.

456
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,650
She wants to die with Tai Sui.

457
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,800
At the end of the end,

458
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,740
the one who can change her fate

459
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,380
is you,

460
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,520
Dongfang Qingcang.

461
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,870
I understand.

462
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,990
I will do anything

463

to revive her.

No.
