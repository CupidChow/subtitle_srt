Qingchuan.

5
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,720
Lord, what can I do for you?

6
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,820
How's it going outside?

7
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,100
There are still full of spies outside.

8
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,500
They are sent by Lord Yunzhong to spy on you.

9
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,960
Lord, we'd better stay at home

10
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,660
and let Lord Yunzhong remove his suspicion.

11
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,200
After all,

12
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,590
Lord Yunzhong has been suspecting that

13
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,660
the spy of the Moon Tribe and you...

14
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,380
So you think she is a spy for the Moon Tribe too?

15
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,450
Of course I do.

16
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,500
She was rescued by the Moon Supreme.

17
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,740
Now everyone

18
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,220
in Shuiyuntian

19
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,950
is pretty sure that she is a spy.

20
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,960
Leave.

21
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,090

Orchid is not a spy.

24
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,880
Although she is timid

25
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,600
and a little annoying,

26
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,700
she is kind.

27
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,730
Besides,

28
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,760
she even saved my life without resentment.

29
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,050
I don't believe she's a spy for the Moon Tribe.

30
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,320
Do you really think so?

31
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,500
If you have any way to save her,

32
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,640

Please enjoy the meal, Lord.

35
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,140
It is said that people in the Moon Tribe like eating living creatures.

36
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,420
What does Dongfang Qingcang usually eat?

37
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,750
Might they be all bloody internal organs?

38
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,970
They look

39
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,260
even more delicious

40
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,060
than the dishes in Shuiyuntian.

41
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,380
You can leave now.

42
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,300
I don't like to be watched while I'm dining.

43
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,120
Yes.

44
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,580
Wrong again.

How are you still in the mood to eat?

48

If I have to be cruel and heartless,

49
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,150
I may never make it or learn it

50

You can't learn it well?

Once you give yourself away,

54
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,860
I will definitely be killed.

55

You can't blame anyone for it!

Ah!

68
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,280
You are isolated,

69
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,960
and you're living from hand to mouth.

70
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,440
How can you have the mood to eat?

71
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,830
You've committed so many sins.

72
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,909
You should bear the hunger

73
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,310
and reflect on yourself.

74
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,659
My lord,

75
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,930
lord Xunfeng and the Kings of Southern and Northern Youxian County are here to meet you.

Why are you following me?

77
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,780
If I don't follow you

78
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,240
and you give yourself away later,

79

who will clean up the mess for you?

80
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:27,420
You want me to turn into you?

81
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,670
That's right.

82
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,800
There are spies outside the Fountain Palace.

83
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,190
If we want to hide it from Lord Yunzhong,

84
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,630
escaping from Shuiyuntian

85
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,270
and going to the Moon Tribe to save Orchid

86
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,330
is the only way now.

87
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,830
Since I promised to help,

88
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,380
I won't refuse.

89
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,490
You look exactly like me.

90
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,620
Don't worry.

91
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,670
When you go to the Moon Tribe...

92
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,300
Take care.

93
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,580
I'll always remember

94
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,980

95
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,340
Greetings, My Lord.

96
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,740
Rise.

97
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,900
My lord.

98
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,620
She...

99
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,800
I'm used to her company.

100
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,870
Now I don't want her

101
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,380
to leave my sight.

102
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,190
It's a small issue

103
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,400
if you like a fairy.

104
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,880
But it's inappropriate for her to enter

105
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,400
the palace and take part in our state affairs.

106
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,220
What?

107
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,660
Are you questioning the Lord?

108
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,830
My lord, you are wise.

109
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,900
I didn't mean that.

110
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,740
By the way,

111
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,340
why do you want to meet me?

112
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,170
As for the plan

113
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,300
to counterattack the heavenly realm,

114
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,540
today is the deadline you set.

115
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,820
Okay.

116
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,500
Of course I know.

117
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,150
But I didn't expect

118
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,880
you to come early in the morning

119
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,430
To counterattack the heavenly realm?

120
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,270
You've been thinking about war the moment you came back.

121
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,230
Cunning! Despicable! Shameless!

122
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,350
My lord, please take a look.

123
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,660
Shuiyuntian is surrounded by the Xiao, Xiang, Li, and Yuan four Waters.

124
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,830
Water Li and Water Yuan are full of spiritual powers.

125
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,060
It's easy to defend but hard to attack.

126
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,580
And there are Li Yuan's former soldiers

127
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,180
stationing there for years.

128
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,540
Water Xiang is foggy.

129
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,980
The terrain is hazy and complicated.

130
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,920
Therefore, we think...

131
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,120
My lord.

132
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,290
My lord.

133
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,500
What are you waiting for?

134
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,460
Continue!

135
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,620
We think

136
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,500
we should attack

137
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,290
from Shuiyuntian's weakest point Water Xiao.

138
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,260
Break the defense from inside and kill all the guards,

139
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,900
so that we can defeat Shuiyuntian completely.

140
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,380
Kill everyone in Shuiyuntian.

141
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,580
Don't spare any grass.

142
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,480
What?

143
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,650
Say it again!

144
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,500
We should attack

145
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,180
from Shuiyuntian's weakest point Water Xiao.

146
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,180
Break the defense from inside and kill all the guards.

147
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,130
Your last sentence!

148
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,860
Kill everyone in Shuiyuntian.

149
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,960
Don't spare any grass.

150
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:02,910
My lord.

151
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:03,630
My lord.

152
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,200
My lord.

153
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:06,970
My lord.

154
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,130
My lord.

155
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:09,890
My lord,

156
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:10,350
this...

157
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,340
You are the Kings of Southern and Northern Youxian County.

158
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,380
You were given three days.

159
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,640
But you handed over such a useless thing.

160
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,660
Today, the Lord only burned your plan

161
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,440
and spare your lives.

162
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,940
If you still can't hand over

163
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,480
anything decent tomorrow,

164
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,360
your primordial spirit will be burned.

165
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,420
My lord, please forgive me.

166
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,950
My lord, please forgive me.

167
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,930
Rise.

168
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,340
I don't think you need to

169
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,480
revise this plan.

170
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,340
Recently,

171
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,720
I've been reflecting on my sin of killing my father.

172
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,810
I felt guilty

173
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,230
and couldn't fall asleep at night.

174
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,440
Hence,

175
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,910
from today onwards,

176
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,740
I've decided not to be cruel

177
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,240
and stop killing.

178
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,860
I need to keep a low profile.

179
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,460
We'll fight for the peace of the three realms

180
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,560
and the peace of our Moon Tribe.

181
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,560
You can still think of father these days?

182
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,960
But the guilt seems to be

183
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,770
too late.

184
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,660
Yes, it is.

185
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,140
But if you don't think it's late,

186
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,280
then it's not.

187
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,860
I'm tired.

188
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,260
I need to go back and rest.

189
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,040
All of you, just leave.

190
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,610
Leave.

191
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,200
Yes.

192
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,960
Leave.

193
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,290
Yes.

194
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,080
Nonsense!

195
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,540
What you said just now

196
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,980
was absolutely absurd.

197
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,820
Also, how could those words

198
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,700
come from me?

199
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,900
I was helping you to redeem your image.

200
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,780
But you ruined

201
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,160
my reputation!

202
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,320
Humph!

203
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,730
It's because of your majestic image,

204
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,880
your younger brother Xunfeng doesn't like you.

205
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,900
I'm the Moon Supreme that everyone fears.

206
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,760
I don't need anyone to like me.

207
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,840
How dare you mention Xunfeng?

208
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,220
He grew up with me.

209
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,220
He is mostly likely the person who

210
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,780
can figure out the body-switching secret between us.

211
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,460
If we are discovered by him,

212
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:47,900
you and I...

213
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,980
I know! I know!

214
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,100
You and I will both die.

215
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,800
You've said it many times.

216
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,620
Forget it.

217
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,780
There will be lightning tomorrow night anyway.

218
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,600
Before that,

219
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,380
you can never leave my side.

220
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,340
Let's switch back our bodies

221
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,640
when it's time!

222
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,300
I can't leave you for even a moment?

223
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,360
Including when you're taking a bath?

224
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:28,960
Lord.

225
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,220
Lord. Lord Liyuan is here.

226
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,420
He said he has something to discuss with you.

227
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,210
Lord.

228
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,610
Dad...

229
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,860
Why are you being blundering like this?

230
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,020
Go and bring me the Tuoyanzui that was rewarded from my brother

231
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,580
when I pacified Shazhou in the south.

232
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,340
It's also Lord Liyuan's favorite.

233
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:52,980
Yes.

234
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,060
Thank you for remembering

235
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,730
my preference.

236
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,590
Where's Danyin?

237
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,980
She's been treating you

238
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,510
as her brother since young.

239
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,500
She insisted on coming here.

240
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,340
She must have caused you trouble.

241
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,180
Brother?

242
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,330
Dad, you are such a liar.

243
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,610
You're too modest.

244
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,020
Danyin has always been nice and kind.

245
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,460
She is also generous

246
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,700
and reasonable.

247
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,630
Everyone in the Fountain Palace likes her very much.

248
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,820
I spoiled her.

249
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,860
She doesn't know how to deal with matters.

250
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,100
She will cause trouble sooner or later.

251
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,580
How about

252
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,240
I take her back today?

253
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,460
You want to take me back?

254
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,620
Dad, you're really tricky.

255
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,490
Luckily it is me today.

256
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,970
That won't do.

257
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,460
Fountain Palace

258
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,040
needs Danyin.

259
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,400
Please.

260
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,080
Okay.

261
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,780
You came here today

262
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,540
not just for Danyin, right?

263
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,480
Of course not.

264
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,000
I...

265
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,860
You may leave.

266
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,590
Yes, my lord.

267
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,530
I feel uneasy.

268
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,280
I'm here to talk to you.

269
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,940
Since Dongfang Qingcang has been resurrected,

270
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,099
I'm afraid there will be changes in the three realms.

271
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:18,010
I'm afraid it'll be another catastrophe.

272
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,020
I didn't expect that

273
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,300
there is a spy for Dongfang Qingcang in Shuiyuntian.

274
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,290
She fooled everyone.

275
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,880
It's not decided yet

276
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,880
whether she is a spy.

277
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,760
But it seems that something's wrong.

278
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,220
The Fairy Orchid of Arbiter Hall

279
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,660
didn't enter the eight immortal system.

280
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,650
Could she be

281
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,900
the Xilan clan that was wiped out 30,000 years ago?

282
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,880
Impossible.

283
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,130
I am 50,000 years older than you.

284
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,300
I know both of the former fairies,

285
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,980
Xi Yun's mother and grandmother.

286
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,140
I've also seen lots of the Xilan holy grass.

287
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,540
On the day of the ceremony,

288
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,000
I had carefully examined.

289
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,880
That spirit's true form is very strange.

290
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,380
I've never seen

291
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,900
the same root, leaves, and stem before.

292
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,660
So it can neither be the Xilan holy grass,

293
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,560
nor from the Xilan clan.

294
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,820
I thought too much.

295
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,240
How could Orchid be the fairy of Xishan?

296
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,100
How can she be

297
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,140
the fiancée of Lord Changheng!

298
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,620
Tianji Mirror?

299
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,540
Destiny can't be changed?

300
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,080
She probably made it up to coax me.

301
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,920
I see.

302
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,010
That spirit's identity is unknown.

303
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,470
It's better to be careful.

304
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,740
I haven't drank the Tuoyanzui for a long time.

305
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,320
Hey, Changheng.

306
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,060
You're drinking with Lord Liyuan here

307
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,260
without inviting me.

308
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,320
Is this how you treat your friend?

309
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,620
You...

310
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,620
Don't take it off.

311
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,790
How can I take a bath with clothes on?

312
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,570
If you take it off,

313
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,020
I...

314
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,020
You...

315
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,590
You'll see all of me.

316
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,180
You can't leave.

317
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,040
You want me to be suspected because of not taking a bath?

318
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,830
I won't give myself away

319
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,980
for such a trivial matter

320
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,090
and die in vain.

321
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,390
Then, cover your eyes

322
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,120
and let the maid help you bathe.

323
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,850
Isn't that more suspicious?

324
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,510
Let me help you then!

325
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,090
Up.

326
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,890
Left.

327
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,570
Which side is left?

328
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,130
Tyrant.

329
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,390
Harder.

330
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,290
You...

331
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,440
Don't push your luck.

332
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,390
Then, let me do it myself.

333
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,850
No.

334
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,370
Let me do it.

335
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,660
The Moon Supreme is

336
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,320
helping a woman with the bath?

337
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,340
Xunfeng is your sibling.

338
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,300
It's reasonable to confer him a king.

339
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,430
But what about the title of Kings of Southern and Northern Youxian County?

340
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,380
there were many Canyan Sea tribes.

341
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,560
Among them, the Southern and Northern Youxian County are the most powerful.

342
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,970
They never obeyed the commander of Ninth Youxian County.

343
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,830
In my grandfather's generation,

344
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,560
in order to prevent civil unrest,

345
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,190
he agreed to their request for conferring the title.

346
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,280
That's why there are Kings of Southern and Northern Youxian County.

347
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,410
30,000 years ago,

348
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,500
Cangyan Sea had internal and external problems.

349
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,430
The two kings were trying to rebel.

350
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,910
After my suppression,

351
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,020
they surrendered to me again.

352
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,620
So they are afraid of you,

353
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,560
not Xunfeng.

354
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,540
Seeing you gone,

355
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,540
they wanted to break away from the Ninth Youxian County.

356
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,940
They even wanted to compete with Xunfeng for the position of the  Moon Supreme.

357
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,850
That's right.

358
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,860
Since you are so cruel,

359
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,460
why didn't you execute them

360
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,980
with the excuse of their rebellion

361
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,040
when you came back?

362
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,920
To catch the mole.

363
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:25,960
A mole?

364
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,280
Who?

365
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,570
[Memory Loss River]

366
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,260
He left.

367
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,450
Stop pretending.

368
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,020
Others are easy to deal with.

369
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,260
Except for Rong Hao.

370
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,050
He might probably be the only person

371
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,380
who knows Lord Changheng better than I do.

372
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,980
I must be careful in front of him.

373
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,910
Don't think too much

374
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,290
these days.

375
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,820
Don't get sick.

376
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,980
You're right.

377
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,420
I thought too much.

378
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,020
I should rest early.

379
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,820
Hence,

380
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,020
I may not be able to drink with you today.

381
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,510
You want me to leave?

382
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,140
Tonight,

383
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,490
you asked me to get drunk with you.

384
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,020
Have you forgotten?

385
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,100
Of course I remember.

386
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,440
But I'm really tired today.

387
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,970
So please leave.

388
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,930
Why are you staring at me?

389
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,600
I see.

390
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,980
No wonder you always refused me

391
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,140
when I invited you to drink with me these days.

392
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,620
Are you reluctant to offer me

393
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,780
the fine green flame wine

394
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,640
you brought from the Northernmost Ocean last time?

395
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,960
You are too greedy.

396
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,740
You've almost drank all the liquor up today.

397
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,490
Please leave the fine green flame wine to me

398
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,280
for a few more days.

399
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,520
Danyin?

400
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,680
What happened?

401
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,950
Where is Changheng?

402
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,380
Lord Rong Hao.

403
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,150
You're Lord Changheng's best friend.

404
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,210
You must help him hide this.

405
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,930
Don't let Lord Yunzhong know.

406
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,510
Tell me everything.

407
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,680
Where is Changheng?

408
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,660
Dongfang Qingcang

409
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,000
served that fairy to a bath in person?

410
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,660
Did you really see it?

411
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,420
Yes, your Highness.

412
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,020
I saw it.

413
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,420
I didn't lie.

414
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,500
Moreover,

415
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,460
the Moon Supreme also eats and sleeps with that fairy,

416
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,620
and indulged her badly.

417
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,900
Even cups and chopsticks can be shared.

418
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,430
That fairy is favored a lot.

419
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,800
Dongfang Qingcang grew up alone.

420
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,140
He never touches dishes

421
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,770
left by others.

422
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,220
No matter how much he likes the fairy,

423
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,860
it's still impossible for him to be so.

424
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,450
Especially when

425
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:55,650
he allowed that fairy to take part in and manage state affairs in the palace.

426
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,530
This is really strange.

427
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,820
Yes.

428
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,420
I also find it strange.

429
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,060
In the past, the Moon Supreme never looked us.

430
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,210
But when I went to serve tea yesterday,

431
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,660
he thanked me.

432
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,460
Besides, regardless of what matters,

433
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,300
he had to react according to that fairy's opinion.

434
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,660
He always let her make the decision.

435
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,320
He's like a different person.

436
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,930
A different person?

437
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,480
You want a duel?

438
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,570
Exactly.

439
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,500
You haven't returned for 30,000 years.

440
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,060
It's been a long time since you've checked my progress.

441
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,500
It's rare that I'm available today.

442
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,720
Why don't we

443
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,520
have a duel?

444
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,500
Today...

445
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:40,470
Today, I have official affairs to deal with.

446
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,730
I can't fight with you.

447
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,120
Then I'll wait for you here.

448
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,090
A duel is a small issue.

449
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,650
But Your Highness has important affairs to deal with.

450
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,410
The Moon Supreme is powerful.

451
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,050
He's afraid that he might hurt you

452
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,110
and you'll delay important affairs.

453
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,780
We're talking.

454
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,910
It's none of your business.

455
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:07,810
Brother,

456
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,490
according to the rules of Moon Tribe,

457
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,670
you can't refuse

458
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,020
a duel with me.

459
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,820
And outsiders are not allowed to be here,

460
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,320
as our ability might be learned secretly by others.

461
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:20,870
Brother,

462
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,840
ask her to leave.

463
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,880
Shangque.

464
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,220
What?

465
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,970
You've lived in Shuiyuntian for 30,000 years.

466
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,630
Have you forgotten our rules?

467
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,640
I...

468
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:04,850
Brother.

469
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,200
Please.

470
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,300
If I want to check your progress,

471
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,460
I don't need to do it myself.

472
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,990
Shangque.

473
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,080
Yes.

474
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,530
Go

475
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,610
and practice with Xunfeng later.

476
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,680
Yes.

477
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,220
Brother.

478
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,420
When I was young,

479
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,340
you taught me

480
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,640
the Black Slash,

481
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,970
which is very powerful.

482
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,550
I wonder if you have any power to break it, Shangque.

483
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,480
Otherwise,

484
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,250
I'm afraid I may seem to be bullying him.

485
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,580
Your Highness Xunfeng,

486
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,240
let's try it out.

487
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,580
See?

488
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,970
I told you he can.

489
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,570
Please.

490
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,370
You've exposed yourself?

491
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,520
Who am I?

492
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,400
I could totally act based on the situation

493
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,540
and get through it.

494
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,020
You actually understood my hint.

495
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,110
You're not that stupid.

496
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,890
As a trusted subordinate,

497
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,250
you're indeed powerful.

498
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,020
Your Highness Xunfeng is better.

499
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,320
I admire you.

500
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,960
He is not Dongfang Qingcang.

501
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,500
He is disguised by someone else.

502
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,120
How did you know?

503
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,930
The Black Slash.

504
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,960
He had never taught me this move.

505
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,350
When I was young,

506
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,620
I begged him every day

507
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,880
to teach me this move.

508
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,730
But he always said

509
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,160
he would teach me

510
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,040
when I grow up.

511
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,440
But before I grow up,

512
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:20,210
he killed our father.

513
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,780
Since then,

514
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,670
we have never

515
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,200
been close with each other.

516
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,470
He didn't even know this.

517
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,990
So he cannot be Dongfang Qingcang.

518
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,500
Where is the real Moon Supreme?

519
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,510
He must be

520
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,200
keeping an eye on that pretender by his side

521
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,420
at all times.

522
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,630
He'll be afraid that the pretender would give himself away.

523
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,810
Because he knows

524
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,600
once the pretender gives himself away,

525
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,380
he will die for sure.

526
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,350
What is this?

527
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,290
This is a weapon

528
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,290
that can help you kill Dongfang Qingcang.

529
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,730
This is indeed something evil.

530
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,270
This is the evil spirit.

531
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,340
Normally,

532
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,630
Dongfang Qingcang can still resist it.

533
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,090
But when he is weak,

534
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,220
we can inject the evil spirit into him.

535
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,620
Then it's easy

536
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,550
to kill him.

537
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,780
That's great.

538
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,450
When I supported you to build Haishi City,

539
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,870
I was making the right choice.

540
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,560
Will it work out?

541
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,370
Look at the moon.

542
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,590
Is there going to be a thunderstorm?

543
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,940
That's what the astronomical phenomena showed.

544
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,280
It shouldn't be wrong.

545
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,830
Just wait.

546
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,550
If we switch back,

547
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,030
will you lock me up again?

548
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,550
If you obey me,

549
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,210
you don't need to be locked up.

550
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,790
Really?

551
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,680
What if you lie to me?

552
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,000
I am the Moon Supreme.

553
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,930
You have my words.

554
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,490
I will keep my promise.

555
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,500
Then swear.

556
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,060
If you lie to me,

557
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,910
you can't take a bath for 10,000 years.

558
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,150
Sure.

559
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,430
Deal!

560
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,320
What about you?

561
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,820
If you still want to run away

562
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,140
after we switch back,

563
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,680
how should I deal with you?

564
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,650
Can't you just let me go back to Shuiyuntian?

565
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,790
What's so good there?

566
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,050
Shuiyuntian is my home.

567
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,390
Will you care about whether your home is good or not?

568
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,050
Yes, I will.

569
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,460
If my home is not good,

570
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:13,300
I'll take others' good spots.

571
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,440
All you know is fighting, killing,

572
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,449
and taking.

573
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,880
I'm not like you.

574
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,080
I just want to go home.

575
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,989
Just give up.

576
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,219
As long as you are alive,

577
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,250
you must stay in Cangyan Sea.

578
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,210
Even if I die,

579
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,870
I'd like to be buried in the soil of Shuiyuntian.

580
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,230
The lightning is coming!

581
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,199
Go to the Dark Pine Forest.

582
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,060
There will be lightning falling.

I don't want to kill you now.

588
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,310
You should escape as soon as possible.

Shut up!

00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,910
Stop pretending.

The current Moon Supreme

592
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,000
is just a useless fairy.

What should we do now?

594
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,020
