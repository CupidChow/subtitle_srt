[Episode 22]

4
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,940
In order to see the first God of War,

5
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,930
you can give up your life.

6
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,660
But if you...

7
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,090
What should I do?

8
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,490
[Thirty thousand years ago]

9
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,579
Master.

10
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,350
Rong Hao is useless.

11
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,500
Although I tried my best

12
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,600
to save master's primordial spirit,

13
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,700
I still couldn't save you.

14
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,899
She sealed 100,000 demon soldiers with her death

15
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,100
and her primordial spirit will perish.

16
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,579
Even if you sacrifice yourself to go with her,

17
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,220
you can't reunite with her in the Realm of Return to Ruin.

18
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,980
Who is it?

19
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,420
Who?

20
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,340
Who are you?

21
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,260
It doesn't matter who I am.

22
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,659
What matter is that

23
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,460
I can save her.

24
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,720
Do you have a way to save my master?

25
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,420
You know

26
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,340
the way to save her.

27
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,820
It's just that

28
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,970
you don't want to do it.

29
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:04,940
I do.

30
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,020
As long as I can save my master,

31
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,550
I'm willing to do anything.

32
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,530
But the fairy of Xishan

33
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,530
has guarded Xishan for generations

34
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,460
and suppressed the Evil God Tai Sui.

35
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,660
She contributed a lot to the three realms.

36
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,820
Master.

37
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,950
She maintained a close relationship with the Xilan clan

38
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,660
She watched the fairy grow up.

39
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,860
Liar!

40
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,390
You are willing to do anything?

41
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,580
You knew how to save her,

42
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,900
but you found so many excuses.

43
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,100
You just cherish yourself.

44
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,020
You don't want to be sinful

45
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,780
and fear the consequences.

46
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,220
No.

47
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,540
No.

48
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,260
The fairy of Xishan has special power.

49
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,540
It can grow everything.

50
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,340
She is the only way to revive the high immortal.

51
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,460
Take her primordial spirit,

52
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,520
and save a life at the cost of another.

53
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,820
Your master died to save Shuiyuntian

54
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,460
and all beings.

55
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,100
What's wrong with sacrificing a little fairy

56
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,940
to save her?

57
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,620
Before the battle, master said that

58
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,340
sacrificing her life

59
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,340
to save all beings

60
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,260
was her destiny.

61
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,780
If I disobey my master,

62
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,720
it would be disrespectful to her.

63
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,010
Destiny?

64
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,570
If it weren't for those immortals in Shuiyuntian

65
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,140
who were greedy for life and feared death,

66
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,000
how could your master

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,820
give up the carefree days

68
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
with you

69
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,300
in Xishan?

70
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,060
No.

71
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,180
Let me ask you.

72
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,020
Except you,

73
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,220
did anyone shed a tear

74
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,900
for your master's death?

75
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,860
They pretend to be sad,

76
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,180
but they are happy in their heart.

77
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,140
Because for them, the death of your master

78
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,340
is the good news of the end of the war,

79
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,900
and the beginning of their continued survival.

80
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,860
They won't be grateful

81
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,380
for your master.

82
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,980
You are the only one who is sad.

83
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,180
Master.

84
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,220
On the riverside,

85
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,220
in front of the bamboo forest,

86
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,500
brandishing swords under the flowers,

87
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,220
and drinking in the snow.

88
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,860
Your master left.

89
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,220
Who do you play music for?

90
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,420
Rong Hao.

91
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,900
Rong Hao.

92
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,740
To get your master back to you,

93
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:02,020
all you need is the fairy of Xishan.

94
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,020
I said

95
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,260
I only want the fairy.

96
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,540
Stop forcing me to do it.

97
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,100
The God of War had great love

98
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,380
and sacrificed her life for justice.

99
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,690
If she knew

100
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,420
her disciple killed Xilan clan

101
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,700
and forced the fairy to death to

102
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,690
save her...

103
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,420
If it weren't for her,

104
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,900
everyone in the fairy realm,

105
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,130
including the fairy,

106
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,340
would be long dead.

107
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,500
I just need a fairy

108
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,100
in exchange for my master.

109
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,940
Why not?

110
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,140
Madam.

111
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,810
The fairy of Xishan,

112
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,410
you are gifted and powerful.

113
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,630
you are supposed to protect the world

114
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,220
but suffered this calamity.

115
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,060
Today,

116
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,790
the Xilan clan will seal your divine power,

117
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,300
memory,

118
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:08,730
and appearance

119
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,990
to avoid disasters.

120
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,330
From now on,

121
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,640
you are just an ordinary spirit in the three realms.

122
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,440
Even if your relatives meet you,

123
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,420
they won't recognize you.

124
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,350
There is no fairy

125
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,860
in the world.

126
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,320
I'll keep her alive with the evil spirit.

127
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,130
But her primordial spirit is unstable.

128
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,100
Before you find the fairy,

129
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,710
you need to throw her into Yunmeng Lake,

130
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,570
where she become a mortal to experience hardships.

131
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,660
Who are you?

132
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,230
Why are you helping me?

133
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,760
Isn't it too late to ask me?

134
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,050
Yes.

135
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,620
As long as I can save my master,

136
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,890
even you are

137
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,290
the Evil God Tai Sui who once tried to devour the three realms,

138
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,590
I don't care.

139
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,460
I like dealing with smart people.

140
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,250
I don't understand.

141
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,320
Didn't you get killed by the Xilan clan

142
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,040
in ancient times?

143
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,360
They can't kill me.

144
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,390
They can only destroy my body

145
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,670
and seal me in the Spirit-Shattering Abyss

146
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,130
with the power of the fairy.

147
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:21,790
I can

148
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,250
really feel a surging spiritual power here.

149
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,790
That's right.

150
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,260
This place is controlled by the power of the twelve fairies.

151
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,480
Everyone only knows that

152
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,660
the Xilan clan can heal.

153
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,600
The fairy of Xilan can also make everything grow

154
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,200
and revive the dead.

155
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,090
But they don't know

156
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,900
the Xilan clan had guarded Xishan for generations

157
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,730
to keep an eye on me

158
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,960
and to completely destroy me.

159
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,930
From ancient times to the present,

160
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,350
at least hundreds of thousands of years have passed.

161
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,240
They can't

162
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,590
kill you completely.

163
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,360
I said

164
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,800
I wouldn't be killed so easily.

165
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,320
But if I don't have the evil spirit to heal,

166
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,590
I'm afraid I won't last long.

167
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,450
What is the evil spirit?

168
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,510
The Xilan clan has pure spiritual power.

169
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,320
The power of the fairy is most pure.

170
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,650
It must be the most evil spirit in the world to fight against it.

171
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,750
But I'm trapped here.

172
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,110
The evil spirit is about to run out.

173
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,920
So you want me to help you

174
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,310

That's right.

What if I don't want to?

180

Your master

181
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,980
will die with me.

182
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,910
What did you do to my master?

183
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,480
She lives with my evil spirit.

184
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,280
If I'm fine,

185
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,200
she will still be alive.

186
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,110
If there's no evil spirit, I will die.

187
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,390
And her primordial spirit will be destroyed.

188
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,200
You should know

189
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,470
what you should do?

190
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,150
In order to save you,

191
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,520
even if I go astray, and so what?

192
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,850
Even if the three realms will be destroyed, and so what?

193
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,450
Rong Hao.

194
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,720
To heal you,

195
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,580
I don't have much evil spirit left.

196
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,730
If I'm swallowed by the fairy's formation,

197
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,890
the remaining spirit of your master

198
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,810
will disappear completely.

199
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,600
What about the evil spirit?

200
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,800
Why don't you give him some evil spirit?

201
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,790
My lord,

202
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,440
we have no evil spirit anymore.

203

Then he returned to the Cangyan Sea

206
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,040
and stopped the internal war of the Moon Tribe.

Don't worry.

209
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,770
I'll go out and

210

refine the evil spirit for you now.

211

I get angry whenever I see Xiao Run.

Although this restaurant claims to be the best restaurant in Lucheng City,

237
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,130
the private brewing may not be as good as mine.

238
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,890
I brought some private brewing.

I have never

met a close friend for many years.

Today, I am really happy that

I can drink and have fun with you.

257

Although I just arrived in Lucheng City,

I know you're famous everywhere.

259

How could you not have a confidant?

260
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,920
They approached me

261
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,339
just to use my reputation to

262
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,810
cling to the powerful,

263
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,210
but in their hearts, they despised my status as a prostitute.

264

There are

265
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,599
very few people

to tell you.

272

Please don't think I'm annoying.

No, no.

00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,910
I was born with a good appearance.

I thought I was talented.

276

Over the years,

277
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,110
there have been countless descendants of the nobility who have pursued me,

278
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,910
but no one has ever impressed me.

279
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,230
But a few days ago,

280
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,830
I met someone on the night of the Lantern Festival.

281

I'm sorry.

282

Lady Wanqing, please continue.

284
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,080
That man...

285
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,060
He came on the moon.

286
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,090
He said a few words to me,

287
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,070
but I forgot everything cause I was drunk.

288
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,130
He came and left like a wind.

289
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,980
He had no trace left

290
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,460
but

291
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,680
filled my heart.

292

293
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,050
Isn't that...

294
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,400
These days

295
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,370
I always see him

296

whether I open my eyes or close my eyes.

297

It's like grabbing a red thread from a previous life.

298
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,470
But I asked many people

299
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,860
and they all said no one came that day.

300
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,330
It's so strange.

301

Why do you say that too?

But if it was really a dream,

306
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,230
why would I remember it so vividly?

307
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,920
When he approached me,

308
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,390
even the pain of the birthmark on the back of my neck

309

347
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,940
destined to be together.

348
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,920
So I decided

349
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,670
to marry only her in this life.

350
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,470
Is he talking about

351
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,310
Xie Wanqing?

352
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,620
Brother Dongfang,

353
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,380
do you also think

354
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,220
I was too reckless?

355
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,900
No, no, no.

356
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,160
One hundred years of life

357
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,220
will pass quickly.

358
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,150
Of course, it is necessary to indulge yourself.

359
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,500
Since you've made up your mind,

360
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,930
just do it.

361
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,060
I'll support you.

362
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,990
I knew it.

363
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,790
Brother Dongfang knows me best.

364
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,760
Xiao Run.

365
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,360
Everything is ready.

366
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,080
Ready for what?

367
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,820
You'll see.

368
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,060
Let's go.

369
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:57,980
That man approached you

370
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,790
in the middle of the night.

371
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,260
Even if that person exists,

372
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,440
he's not a good person.

373
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,300
Be careful not to be fooled by him.

374
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,090
Lady Orchid.

375
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,180
Please forgive me.

376
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,490
I'm just worried about you.

377
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,310
Don't worry.

378
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,870
If he's really a bad guy,

379
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,250
it's good that we know.

380
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,270
I'll give up him as soon as possible.

381
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,240
But if it's true,

382
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,460
I'll regret it

383
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,320
for the rest of my life if I miss it.

384
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,050
Lady Orchid,

385
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,110
can you help me?

386
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,340
Big wood.

387
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,470
What did you do?

388
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:24,670
This...

389
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:26,640
Isn't this

390
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,740
Fairy Orchid?

391
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:30,760
Be quiet.

392
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,290
Be quiet.

393
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,540
Listen to me.

394
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,270
Shh.

395
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,300
The woman in this painting

396
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,770
is the love

397
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,610
I've identified of my life.

398
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,370
Today,

399
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,800
I hung this painting in the restaurant.

400
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,270
If anyone of you

401
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,910
knows this lady

402
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,880
please tell us her whereabouts.

403
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,190
As long as the clues are true and reliable,

404
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,660
there will be a reward of a hundred pieces of gold.

405
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,840
A hundred pieces of gold?

406
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,720
Really?

407
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,580
Impossible.

408
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,290
I have clearly erased the memory of

409
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,300
him with Orchid.

410
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,920
Why does he still remember it?

411
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,390
Thank you.

412
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,180
Thank you.

413
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,540
Who is so noisy?

414
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,350
Lady, please sit here.

415
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,810
I'll go out and take a look.

416
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,380
Xiao Run.

417
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,730
Your show to save the prostitute hasn't ended yet.

418
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,000
And now you're acting as a beauty seeker.

419
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,890
You're a real flirt.

420
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,870
Yes.

421
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:43,170
Yes.

422
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,470
If you are looking for someone,

423
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,640
you should at least tell us

424
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,160
the name of the woman in this painting.

425
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,210
Where does she live?

426
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:49,890
Right?

427
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:50,810
Yes.

428
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,490
To be honest,

429
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,500
I don't know

430
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,190
her name and family background.

431
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,830
On the night of the Lantern Festival,

432
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,390
maybe I stole Chang'e's pen,

433
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,490
or maybe I was possessed by the matchmaker.

434
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,170
I doodled at will.

435
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,730
I didn't expect that

436
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,580
I could draw the woman I like most.

437
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,230
My lord,

438
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,090
it is important to experience the hardships.

439
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:15,690
Calm down.

440
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,950
Lady Orchid.

441
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,870
Who is outside?

442
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,800
No one.

443
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,600
Just a bunch of alcoholics.

444
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,020
Let's continue.

445
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,160
Absolutely not.

446
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,250
I have a feeling

447
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,640
that I will find her.

448
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,560
Let me pour it for you.

449
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,190
Maybe

450
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,430
she is waiting for me too.

451
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,170
Xiao Run.

452
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,600
Everyone in Lucheng City knows that

453
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,610
your family stopped giving you money.

454
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,290
If we really find her,

455
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,310
how will you get

456
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,860
the hundred pieces of gold?

457
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,450
Yes.

458
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,710
Yes.

459
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,110
Wouldn't it be on credit?

460
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,250
Yes.

461
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,510
Yes.

462
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,710
How is that possible?

463
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,490
Although I have no money,

464
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,220
my brother Dongfang has a lot of money.

465
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,310
So don't worry.

466
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,400
As long as you find her,

467
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,060
go to the Night Stream Building to ask for money.

468
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:04,640
I knew.

469
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,440
Sir Dongfang.

470
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:07,840
Brother Dongfang!

471
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,220
Thank you for your kindness.

472
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,730
If you hadn't encouraged me,

473
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,530
I wouldn't have dared to do that.

474
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,850
As long as I find her,

475
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,200
I will pay you back.

476
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:20,940
My lord.

477
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,100
If you can't bear it, you'll ruin your plan.

478
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,000
No problem.

479
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,680
No problem.

480
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,580
Brother Dongfang.

481
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,310
Although I'm good at many games,

482
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,820
I don't have the courage.

483
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,470
When my brother was at home,

484
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,110
he shouldered everything for me.

485
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,370
I didn't need to worry.

486
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,560
But he never let me make the decision.

487
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,420
My brother never understands me.

488
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,090
Brother Dongfang.

489
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,300
You are more like my brother

490
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,730
than my brother.

491
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,570
Brother Dongfang.

492
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,500
Since we are so close,

493
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,400
why don't we become brothers with different surnames today?

494
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,000
Brother Dongfang, don't you want to?

495
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,630
Yes, I do.

496
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,320
Let's pick another auspicious day.

497
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:35,950
Let's do

498
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,580
it today.

499
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,760
Today,

500
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,490
we didn't prepare anything.

501
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,170
What should we prepare?

502
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,340
We share the same heart.

503
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,400
Isn't that enough?

504
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,950
Wait a moment.

505
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:51,320
Wait.

506
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,630
Brother Dongfang, hurry up.

507
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,500
Here.

508
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,290
From now on,

509
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,050
Dongfang

510
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:41,970
and I

511
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,740
will be brothers with different surnames.

512
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,960
We'll share blessings

513
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,020
and difficulties.

514
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,840
Brother Dongfang.

515
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,260
Me too.

516
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,460
Good brother.

517
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,840
Good brother.

518
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,520
Good brother.

519
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,980
It's better to be a mortal.

520
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,340
After eating all the delicious food,

521
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,970
they'll finish their life.

522
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,630
They can't live so long.

523
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,890
There's nothing for them to worry about.

524
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:31,870
Bad news!

525
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:37,290
Look.

526
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,640
Xiao Run did it?

527
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,400
No.

528
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,830
What are you waiting for?

529
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,900
If Lady Wanqing sees this painting,

530
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,830
our plan will be ruined.

531
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,120
Yes.

532
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,050
Make way.

533
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,070
What are you doing?

534
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,700
This is the painting of my young master.

535
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,300
It is not allowed to be moved.

536
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,360
What are you looking at?

537
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,980
What's your name?

538
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,790
Have we

539
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,300
met somewhere before?

540
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,760
Don't try to be friendly with me.

541
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,020
My master said

542
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,280
no one is allowed to touch this painting.

543
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,570
He's Xiao Run's servant, Qu Shui.

544
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,360
Your name is Qu Shui, right?

545
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,830
I don't think you are

546
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,300
really loyal to your master.

547
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,480
Nonsense.

548
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,570
I can

549
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,000
go through fire and water for him.

550
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,220
If you really care about him and wish him well,

551
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,480
why didn't you stop him from doing such a stupid thing

552
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,840
to harm others and himself?

553
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,360
What do you mean?

554
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,160
The absurd thing he did to marry a prostitute

555
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,720
with the royal coral tree was not over yet,

556
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,790
and today he was making such a scene

557
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,470
in the busiest restaurant in Lucheng City.

558
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,610
This matter will definitely be known to his father,

559
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,330
and there will inevitably be another beating.

560
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,970
It's fine if you get a beating,

561
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,200
but Xiao Run

562
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,540
is tender.

563
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,510
But I can't disobey Xiao Run's order.

564
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,040
Xiao Run trusts me the most.

565
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,400
He told me

566
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,130
to keep an eye on this painting.

567
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:24,970
He said

568
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,330
this painting concerns his lifetime happiness.

569
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,730
If you really care about the lifetime happiness of him,

570
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,860
then you should remove the painting as soon as possible.

571
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,350
What do you mean?

572
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,570
Think about it.

573
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,220
If the painting is of a serious and innocent woman,

574
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,730
publicized by him

575
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,280
and made known to everyone,

576
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,670
she would have been ashamed.

577
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,350
How can she meet him again?

578
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,700
And what about lifetime happiness?

579
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,890
Xiao Run is ridiculous.

580
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,820
I think you're a fool too.

581
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,030
You're right.

582
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,730
Advice most needed is least heeded.

583
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,360
Even if

584
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,630
Xiao Run will blame me,

585
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,680
I have to do it for his good.

586
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:08,900
Move it!

587
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,640
Stupid Black Dragon.

588
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:16,810
Come here.

589
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,270
This man

590
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,990
seems more stupid than you.

591
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,000
Interesting.

592
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,830
What's so interesting about him?

593
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,010
Look what happened.

594
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:36,880
Oh no!

595
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,690
It's useless to just remove this one.

596
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,700
Before Xiao Run came here,

597
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,290
he asked someone to make hundreds of copies.

598
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,600
As soon as he gives the order,

599
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,150
they will be posted all over the city.

600
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,280
Now, I'm afraid the entire Lucheng City has been posted.

601
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:56,950
[Memory Loss River]

602
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,910
My lord,

603
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,130
I'm willing to take the risk

604
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,010
to go to the Cangyan Sea again.

605
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:04,720
No need.

606
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:08,110
After Dongfang Qingcang and Xun Feng reconciled,

607
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,440
I'm sure Xunfeng will tell Dongfang Qingcang

608
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,640
about the details of our relationship.

609
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,220
If Dongfang Qingcang

610
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,040
knows we are refining the evil spirit,

611
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,590
he'll surely send someone to ambush us.

612
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,980
And he'll be waiting for us to get ourselves caught.

613
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,910
Since Dongfang Qingcang is well prepared,

614
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,090
our plan to kill the Moon Tribe and get the primordial spirit

615
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:25,380
will probably...

616
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,180
Lord Rong Hao.

617
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,050
I thought I mistook you for someone else.

618
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,270
You're indeed Lord Rong Hao.

619
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,190
You are...

620
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,710
You don't remember me?

621
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,760
When I was in danger while experiencing hardships,

622
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,520
it was you who saved me.

623
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,860
You're kind-hearted.

624
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,060
You may not remember.

625
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,340
But Lord,

626
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,640
what are you doing

627
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,300
at the border of the two races?

628
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,310
Changheng was hurt by Dongfang Qingcang.

629
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,530
I heard that

630
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,790
there are elixirs here.

631
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,770
So I came to look for them.

632
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,030
Do you want to go to our station to have a look?

633
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,880
We have thousands of immortal soldiers at the border.

634
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,600
Tell them what elixirs

635
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,570
you want.

636
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,500
They can help you to look for it when patrolling.

637
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,800
If that's the case,

638
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,940
that's great.

639
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,989
Lord, this way please.

640
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:10,449
Please.

641
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,080
Brother Dongfang.

642
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,790
Do you know

643
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:36,409
the feeling that there is someone in your heart,

644
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:38,630
but you can't understand her mind,

645
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,850
and you can't

646
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,750
express your love to her?

647
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:47,020
Do you understand, Brother Dongfang?

648
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:48,920
Brother Dongfang.

649
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,670
Where is the liquor?

650
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,020
I want to drink.

651
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,460
Sit down.

652
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,860
I'll get you some liquor.

653
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,010
Lady Orchid.

654
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,020
You promised me.

655
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,510
How can I refuse you

656
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,150
if you beg me like this?

657
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,320
Lady Orchid.

658
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,420
If I really meet my lover in the dream,

659
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,420
I really don't know how to thank you.

660
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,410
Here.

661
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,860
Here.

662
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,650
Take a seat.

663
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,290
I'll get some more liquor.

664
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:46,840
Okay.

665
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,590
Follow me.

666
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,150
What are you doing?

667
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,030
Let go of me!

668
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,120
You make me hurt.

669
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,580
Let me ask you.

670
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,850
Did you secretly go to see him again later?

671
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,780
Who?

672
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,490
Who else...

673
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,720
Who else can it be?

674
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,160
Xiao Run, Changheng.

675
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,450
No.

676
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,450
Then why did he paint your portrait

677
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,170
so clearly?

678
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,060
How would I know?

679
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,280
I haven't seen him

680
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,870
since the night of the Lantern Festival.

681
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:28,920
Besides,

682
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,140
it was you who

683
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,530
erased his memory.

684
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,370
Why are you asking me

685
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,830
when you didn't do it well?

686
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,780
Forget it.

687
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,140
It doesn't matter if you have seen him or not.

688
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,450
I have erased his memory.

689
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,960
He still remembers you.

690
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,100
You two are really destined.

691
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,960
Lord Moon Supreme.

692
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,550
Stop crying "Stop thief" when you're the thief yourself.

693
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,520
What about you?

694
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,690
What did you do to Lady Wanqing

695
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,540
on the night of the Lantern Festival?

696
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,430
She really cares about you

697
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,410
and talks about you all the time.

698
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,610
I didn't do anything.

699
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,100
Who would believe that?

700
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,940
Now,

701
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,070
you are Lady Wanqing's

702
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,590
lover in the dream now.

703
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,010
She just begged me to

704
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:07,980
help her to look for you.

705
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,150
You...

706
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,820
What do you think?

707
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,250
Are you happy?

708
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,290
Brother Dongfang.

709
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,760
Brother Dongfang!

710
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,780
Brother Dongfang!

711
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,000
Brother Dongfang!

712
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,650
Don't change the topic.

713
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,580
I think you're addicted to being the fairy in the painting.

714
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,590
Who is addicted? I think

715
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,890
you're the one who's happy... I think...

716
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,750
Where are you, Brother Dongfang?

717
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,630
Brother Dongfang!

718
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,780
Lady Orchid,

719
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,750
where are you?

720
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,950
Brother Dongfang!

721
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:02,960
What should we do?

722
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,920
How would I know?

723
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,930
Where's Jieli?

724
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,150
If her plan fails,

725
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:06,740
I will kill her.

726
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,750
Lady Orchid!

727
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,180
Lady Orchid,

728
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,880
where are you?

729
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,550
I'm doomed.

730
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,520
Don't let her see you.

731
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,280
Otherwise, our plan will be ruined.

732
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:17,740
Go!

733
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,410
Hide!

734
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,130
Go!

735
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,540
Brother Dongfang!

736
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,630
Lady Orchid.

737
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,790
Brother Dongfang!

738
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,990
Where are you?

739
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,950
Shh.

740
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,230
Brother Dongfang.

741
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,120
Brother Dongfang.

742
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,090
Lady Orchid!

743
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,660
Be quiet.

744
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,700
It's too small here.

745
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,540
Get out.

746
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,270
I came in first.

747
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,660
You get out.

748
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,600
Brother Dongfang!

749
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,690
Where are you?

750
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,620
Lady Orchid.

751
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,220
Brother Dongfang!

752
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:50,850
Lady Orchid.

753
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,840
If they keep looking for us,

754
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,940
will they meet each other?

755
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,220
It's not in vain.

756
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,450
Brother Dongfang.

757
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,590
Keep drinking, Brother Dongfang.

758
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,590
Lady Orchid.

759
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,770
Please go upstairs.

760
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,350
Be careful.

761
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,250
This...

762
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,920
You...

763
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,760
Why don't we

764
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,740
hide somewhere else?

765
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,230
Don't fail.

766
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,110
I'm starving to death

767
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:10,950
after a busy day.

768
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,080
Brother Dongfang!

769
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,270
Where are you?

770
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,650
Have you seen...

771
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,780
The fairy in the painting?

772
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,060
The lover in the dream?

773
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,590
[Love Between Fairy and Devil]
