4
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,580
Orchid!

5
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,410
Lord Changheng!

6
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,730
Lord Changheng!

7
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,780
Lord Changheng!

8
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,320
Lord Changheng, where are you?

9
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,510
Lord Changheng!

10
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,840
Didn't I tell you to run as far as possible?

11
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,620
Why are you back here?

12
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,710
Let go of me!

13
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,950
Lord Changheng is in danger.

14
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,060
I have to find him.

15
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,350
You're in my body now.

16
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,470
I'm afraid

17
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,670
before you talk to him,

18
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,670
you would be killed under his sword.

19
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,100
Let's switch back first.

20
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,670
What will happen after we switch back?

21
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,310
Are you going to

22
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,890
take the opportunity and kill Lord Changheng?

23
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,070
Even if he hurt me by mistake,

24
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,329
I won't give you the opportunity to do so.

25
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,780
Orchid!

26
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,530
Orchid!

27
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,710
Orchid! Where are you?

28
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,060
Lord...

29
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,750
Shut up.

30
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,540
Lord Changheng!

31
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,430
Orchid!

32
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,100
Stay here.

33
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:13,900
Orchid!

34
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,730
Let go!

35
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,100
Fine, go.

36
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,829
He'll kill you as soon as he sees you.

37
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:20,430
Then, he'll take me back to Shuiyuntian as you.

38
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,750
As long as I can get close to him

39
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,990
and stay by his side,

40
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,210
I can kill him sooner or later.

41
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,980
Orchid!

42
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:29,500
Orchid!

43
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,260
Orchid.

44
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:45,730
You!

45
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,450
Hide.

46
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,670
Promise me

47
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,730
you won't hurt him.

48
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,579
Hurry up.

49
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,060
If you... if you break your promise,

50
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,310
I'll kill myself,

51
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,570
and you'll be trapped in my body forever.

52
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,900
Orchid,

53
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,330
I finally found you.

54
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:27,940
Let's go.

55
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,900
I'll take you back.

56
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,390
Orchid,

57
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,980
don't be afraid.

58
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,280
I'm here to take you back.

59
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,740
I believe you are not a spy.

60
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,909
Lord Changheng trusts me.

61
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,240
He even came to Cangyan Sea to save me.

62
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,590
But I'm nobody.

63
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,450
Why is he so kind?

64
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,909
My Lord, please leave.

65
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,990
I'm used to living in Cangyan Sea's Silent Moon Palace.

66
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,190
I don't want to leave.

67
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,090
You...

68
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,350
What do you mean?

69
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,870
Orchid,

70
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,300
is someone threatening you?

71
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,160
Don't be afraid. Tell me.

72
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
I'll protect you.

73
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,900
No one is threatening or forcing me.

74
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,830
It's my own choice.

75
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,490
Since I came to Cangyan Sea,

76
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,650
I've been eating well and living well.

77
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,510
The doctors used the best medicine

78
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,060
to heal my whip wounds.

79
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,240
I am not the lowly spirit

80
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,880
in your eyes.

81
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,820
I'm also not a traitor or spy who colluded with the Moon Tribe.

82
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,260
I can be myself happily.

83
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,490
Compared to the days

84
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,670
where everyone in Shuiyuntian can bully me,

85
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,390
it's hundred times better.

86
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,750
Don't talk nonsense.

87
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,370
That's not what I think.

88
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,140
Orchid,

89
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,290
you're just mad, aren't you?

90
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,090
That day at Yunzhong Water Pavilion,

91
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,100
my brother hurt you because

92
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,280
he misunderstood you.

93
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,080
If I go back with you,

94
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,550
can you guarantee

95
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,270
to clear my name?

96
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:00,530
I...

97
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,700
If your Lord Yunzhong

98
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,550
refuses to pardon me,

99
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,940
do you dare disobey him?

100
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,210
If he uses the Heavenâ€™s rules

101
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,850
to question you and force you,

102
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,820
can you protect me?

103
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,640
If anyone dares to hurt me or blame me,

104
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,650
can you turn them into ashes?

105
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,880
My brother has always been impartial.

106
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,910
I believe he will

107
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,710
find the truth.

108
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,110
I knew you couldn't do it.

109
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,830
You wouldn't even tell me

110
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,390
something nice.

111
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,250
But the Moon Supreme Lord

112
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,840
can do all these.

113
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,470
He is willing to protect me

114
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,830
and not let anyone hurt me.

115
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,420
So I'm willing to stay here.

116
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,900
You just called him...

117
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,040
the Moon Supreme Lord?

118
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,330
Are you really colluding with the Moon Tribe?

119
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,580
Impossible.

120
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,940
You're a fairy of Shuiyuntian.

121
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,110
No matter what,

122
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,500
I will take you back to Shuiyuntian.

123
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,030
Let's go.

124
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,060
I said I'm not leaving.

125
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,820
Orchid!

126
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,970
Who is it?

127
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,700
Stop!

128
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,360
Rong Hao?

129
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,830
Why are you...

130
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,210
How can I be at ease

131
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,080
when you sneaked out of Shuiyuntian alone?

132
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,760
Don't kill me!

133
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,429
Are you really Orchid?

134
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,720
I finally found you.

135
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,870
I knew you weren't a spy.

136
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,800
Don't be afraid.

137
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,470
I'll break the spell for you.

138
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,520
Wait.

139
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,130
I'm afraid even you can't break it.

140
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,160
Even if there is a way to break it,

141
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,130
you can't do it.

142
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,010
Because...

143
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,510
Because this way, Dongfang Qingcang

144
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,720
will regain his power.

145
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,610
She's right.

146
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,500
If Dongfang Qingcang regains his power,

147
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,390
with both of our powers,

148
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,850
we won't be able to escape.

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,090
What should we do?

150
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,980
You risked your life to save me.

151
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,370
I'm grateful for that.

152
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,260
I dare not drag you down.

153
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,400
Why don't you take this opportunity

154
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,570
to leave.

155
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,450
No.

156
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,300
I got an idea.

157
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,550
As long as we extract your spirit

158
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,020
and bring it back to Shuiyuntian,

159
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,840
we can use the self-renewing soil to create a new body and

160
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,380
turn you back

161
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,810
into Orchid safely.

162
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:51,560
Good idea.

163
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,650
This way,

164
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,710
we can seal Dongfang Qingcang

165
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,850
in Fairy Orchid's old body.

166
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,210
As long as we destroy this body,

167
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,310
Dongfang Qingcang will die.

168
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,310
Then, Dongfang Qingcang will be gone from this world.

169
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,360
No!

170
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,910
No!

171
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,430
Oh no!

172
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,060
They switched back.

173
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,710
You promised me

174
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,890
you won't hurt him.

175
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,120
You are injured.

176
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,340
It's not fair for me to win without a fight.

177
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:40,930
Get lost.

178
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,880
Lord Changheng!

179
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,520
What are you doing?

180
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,600
I...

181
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,530
Don't follow me!

182
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,770
My Lord!

183
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,000
My Lord!

184
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,900
His Highness Xunfeng led an army, broke into the palace at night,

185
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,100
and started a mutiny.

186
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,710
Due to its urgency,

187
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,350
I acted on my own and mobilized Dayu's

188
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,550
Iron Feather Forces.

189
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,540
They've surrounded Silent Moon Palace.

190
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,300
Now, with your order,

191
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,060
I'll attack

192
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,760
and take back Silent Moon Palace.

193
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,840
No need.

194
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,770
I can do it alone.

195
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,540
My Lord,

196
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,230
I couldn't find you just now.

197
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,150
What happened?

198
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,310
Xunfeng,

199
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,670
how dare you sit on my throne?

200
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,900
Stop pretending.

201
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,190
Dongfang Qingcang?

202
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:40,470
[Shuyu Forest, Shuiyuntian]

203
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,260
Changheng.

204
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,200
Changheng.

205
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:55,710
Changheng!

206
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,070
Hang in there.

207
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,580
We're almost there.

208
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,100
[Fountain Palace]

209
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,170
My Lord,

210
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,610
you've locked yourself in the room all day.

211
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,450
You haven't taken the elixir yet.

212
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,920
Previously, you used a lot of power

213
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,440
to repair the Four Water Pearl.

214
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,780
You have to heal.

215
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,040
My Lord?

216
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,520
I'm coming in.

217
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:29,400
[Fountain Palace]

218
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,300
My Lord?

219
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,840
Changheng is sick.

220
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,560
Aren't you in...

221
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,890
Go and get the medicine.

222
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,780
Danyin?

223
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,660
Lord Rong Hao,

224
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,500
I beg you.

225
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,320
You must save Changheng.

226
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,440
Do you still have

227
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,820
the Immortal Pills?

228
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,380
No.

229
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,480
I've taken all of

230
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,920
the Immortal Pills.

231
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,090
How about Guangfu Pill?

232
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,990
My father has lots of medicine.

233
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,080
I'll go and get some now.

234
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,640
Wait.

235
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,450
Do you want everyone in Shuiyuntian to

236
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,130
know that Changheng disobeyed the Lord's order

237
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,460
and went to Cangyan Sea?

238
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,820
Then what should we do?

239
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,980
When he repaired the Four Water Pearl,

240
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,450
his vitality was damaged.

241
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,090
This time at Cangyan Sea,

242
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,510
he was attacked by the evil spirit

243
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,280
and was hurt by Dongfang Qingcang,

244
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,500
causing his Immortal Pond to disappear.

245
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,600
To save him,

246
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,510
we can only use the life-prolonging cultivation method.

247
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,410
I'm willing to cultivate him.

248
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,900
You don't have enough cultivation.

249
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,930
If we want to cultivate Changheng,

250
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,510
we need more cultivation.

251
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,290
But

252
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,150
I heard that the cultivation method will damage one's cultivation badly.

253
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,010
My Lord, you...

254
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,680
It's been tens of thousands of years.

255
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,280
I drank so much good wine from Changheng.

256
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,670
Consider this as my compensation.

257
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,480
It's the evil spirit again.

258
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,670
My Lord, it's been investigated.

259
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,250
His Highness Xunfeng secretly colluded with Haishi City.

260
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,510
This mutiny

261
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,770
was their conspiracy.

262
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,870
They wanted to assassinate you

263
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,240
and be the Moon Supreme.

264
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,230
I'm not surprised that

265
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,780
Xunfeng wants to kill me.

266
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,380
But why does the Lord of Haishi City want to kill me?

267
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,710
Could he have

268
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,180
coveted Cangyan Sea?

269
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,880
He can use the evil spirit.

270
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,720
He can use it to

271
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,360
control Xunfeng and the Kings of Southern and Northern Youxian County.

272
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,800
If he just wants to be the leader of the Moon Tribe,

273
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,730
he could have replaced me

274
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,750
before I came back.

275
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,530
He secretly kept the primordial spirit and Destiny Book of Chidi Woman

276
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,090
while helping Xunfeng

277
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,290
to fight against you.

278
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,620
What does he want?

279
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,240
Keep an eye on Xunfeng.

280
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,900
I'll interrogate him myself.

281
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,430
Yes.

282
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,800
Shangque.

283
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,890
Yes.

284
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,960
When did you know I was weak and

285
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,880
had no power?

286
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,980
I knew it since the first day.

287
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,320
When she pretended to be you,

288
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,980
she told me her power was weak.

289
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,320
But at that time, I didn't know about the body-switching incident.

290
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,420
When I saw it with my own eyes yesterday,

291
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,190
I finally understood everything.

292
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,740
Why didn't you kill me?

293
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,560
The one who kills me

294
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,690
can be the Moon Supreme.

295
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,640
Why would I kill you?

296
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,910
In my heart, you are the most important person.

297
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,440
You are like a brother to me.

298
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,870
I would never betray you.

299
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,380
I don't think so.

300
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,440
I think

301
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,750
Shangque is your friend.

302
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,600
He will never betray you.

303
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,690
What do you know?

304
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,700
I just know.

305
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,670
You don't understand the human heart.

306
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,680
You don't understand emotions.

307
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,850
So you don't know.

308
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,230
You may leave.

309
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,110
I'll take my leave then.

310
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,270
My Lord.

311
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,980
In order to save Changheng,

312
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,910
you lost half of your cultivation.

313
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,710
Your hair turned grey.

314
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,000
I want to turn you back into your previous self.

315
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,200
Even if you use up all your cultivation,

316
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,990
it won't work.

317
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,580
Don't be silly.

318
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,310
I understand.

319
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,280
But for you,

320
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,080
it's worth it.

321
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,270
You don't have to do this.

322
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,720
You also don't have to prolong Changheng's life.

323
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,370
I know

324
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,890
you're not a heartless person.

325
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,320
You risked your life to save Changheng

326
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,720
because you've known him for 30,000 years.

327
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:09,850
The same goes for me.

328
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,350
Enough!

329
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,280
I've already...

330
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,420
I saved Changheng

331
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,990
because I still need him.

332
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,460
I need him to fight against Cangyan Sea

333
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,660
and to destroy Dongfang Qingcang.

334
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,140
That's all.

335
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,260
How's Silent Moon Palace?

336
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,970
Xunfeng was defeated

337
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,730
and captured by Dongfang Qingcang.

338
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,060
He is being imprisoned in the Wind Prison.

339
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:45,930
My Lord.

340
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,150
Should we send someone to kill him?

341
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:48,910
No need.

342
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,650
Dongfang Qingcang is very cruel.

343
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,870
He even killed his biological father.

344
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,440
Why would he care about Xunfeng?

345
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,690
Yes.

346
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,350
Orchid.

347
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,670
Orchid!

348
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,830
Orchid!

349
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,890
Lord Changheng,

350
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,690
you're awake.

351
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,070
Don't move.

352
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,270
You haven't recovered yet.

353
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,290
My Lord,

354
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,550
where do you want to go?

355
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:49,680
Danyin,

356
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,120
bring me my armor.

357
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,220
No.

358
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,400
Are you going to Cangyan Sea again?

359
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,620
I already blamed myself

360
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,130
for helping you earlier.

361
00:22:59,130 --> 00:22:59,680
Do you

362
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,240
know how badly injured you are now?

363
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,770
In order to save you,

364
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,240
Lord Rong Hao used half of his cultivation.

365
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,130
Can you...

366
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:10,760
Rong Hao,

367
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,320
he...

368
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,390
You haven't recovered yet.

369
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,520
Where are you going?

370
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,670
You don't care about yourself,

371
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,140
but I care about my power.

372
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,110
I've made up my mind.

373
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,930
When I come back,

374
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,500
I'll bring you the best wine in the Nine Lands.

375
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:00,950
[Fountain Palace]

376
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,760
Lord Yunzhong has

377
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,640
summoned Lord Changheng

378
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,170
to Yunzhong Water Pavilion for questioning.

379
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,200
Changheng,

380
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,560
you secretly went to Cangyan Sea.

381
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,810
Do you admit your mistake?

382
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,250
Just for that

383
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,980
Moon Tribe's spy who hid Dongfang Qingcang.

384
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,840
She's not a spy.

385
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,850
You're wise, Lord Yunzhong.

386
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,200
Dongfang Qingcang lurked in Shuiyuntian and

387
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,130
even saved that unknown spy.

388
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,390
He must be up to something.

389
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,160
Changheng sneaked into Cangyan Sea alone

390
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,750
to catch the spy

391
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,890
and to figure out Dongfang Qingcang's plot.

392
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,420
Although this is reckless,

393
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,630
he's just eager to kill the enemy.

394
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,560
Yes.

395
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,330
Lord Changheng cares about the safety of Shuiyuntian.

396
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,920
Switching bodies

397
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,520
was Danyin's idea.

398
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,280
Punish me if you want.

399
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,540
Changheng,

400
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,640
answer me.

401
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,670
As Rong Hao said,

402
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:21,970
I was...

403
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,730
just eager to kill the enemy.

404
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,300
I was reckless.

405
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,270
For now, I've sealed your power.

406
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,900
Go back to Fountain Palace to reflect on your mistake.

407
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:55,650
Remember,

408
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,470
don't repeat your mistake.

409
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,940
Orchid, Orchid.

410
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,370
You finally got a chance to go back to Shuiyuntian,

411
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,420
but you gave it up.

412
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,480
Look at you.

413
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,700
Your crime of colluding with the Moon Tribe

414
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,340
is completely proven.

415
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,800
Lord Changheng must be disappointed in you.

416
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,580
He won't come to save you again.

417
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,240
He will never trust you again.

418
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,420
I let Lord Changheng down.

419
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,270
Orchid,

420
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,990
you think too much.

421
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,540
You are just

422
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,300
an unknown lowly spirit.

423
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,820
Now, you're even labeled as a traitor.

424
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,300
Lord Changheng is the God of War.

425
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,110
He came to save you

426
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,330
out of responsibility and kindness.

427
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,060
Why would he protect you so much?

428
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,080
Could it be...

429
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,130
Am I...

430
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,520
Impossible.

431
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,110
He is Dongfang Qingcang, the Moon Supreme.

432
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,910
Shuiyuntian's greatest enemy.

433
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,750
Anyway, I'm telling you

434
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,550
the person I like is Lord Changheng,

435
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,730
not you.

436
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,070
I also hope it's Lord Changheng who is

437
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,000
staying by my side,

438
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,590
not you.

439
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,150
Do you understand?

440
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,950
The person I want to see is Lord Changheng.

441
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,170
The real Lord Changheng,

442
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,770
not the one disguised by you.

443
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,370
You promised me

444
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,540
you won't hurt him.

445
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,220
My Lord.

446
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,200
How is she?

447
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,630
I've been observing her the whole afternoon.

448
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,020
After Fairy Orchid moved back,

449
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,150
she's quite honest.

450
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,960
She either walked under the tree

451
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,260
or sighed.

452
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,520
Nothing special.

453
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,620
I see.

454
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,840
You may leave.

455
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:52,680
Yes.

456
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,020
Wait.

457
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,560
What did you call her?

458
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,860
Fairy Orchid?

459
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,030
When did you start to

460
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,030
respect this little flower spirit?

461
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,830
My Lord, you don't know this.

462
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,010
Although no one knew

463
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,160
about the body switched incident between you and her,

464
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,090
the palace maids secretly said that

465
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,770
when His Highness Xunfeng broke into the palace yesterday,

466
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:22,290
it was she who stood up against him and saved you.

467
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,260
In order to thank her for saving you,

468
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,390
they call her Fairy Orchid in private.

469
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,270
I'm also used to calling her that

470
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,870
and forgot the difference between the two tribes.

471
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,500
It seems that

472
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,830
she has become a distinguished guest of Silent Moon Palace.

473
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:37,940
Exactly.

474
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,480
To thank her, the palace maids want to

475
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,940
arrange a banquet for her.

476
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,560
But I don't know if you'll allow it.

477
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,870
After all, you personally placed

478
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,170
the restraining order on her.

479
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,900
The people dare not disobey it.

480
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,840
Remove the restraining order.

481
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:54,890
By the way,

482
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,810
not only the restraining order is lifted.

483
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,070
Pass on my message.

484
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,460
From now on, she can move freely

485
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,010
in Silent Moon Palace and

486
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,520
Cangyan Sea.

487
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,080
No one can stop her

488
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,550
or be rude to her.

489
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,730
No one can hurt her.

490
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,290
Otherwise, they will be killed without mercy.

491
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,550
Aren't you afraid that she will run away?

492
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,380
She has openly helped me in front of Changheng.

493
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,500
It's no different from betraying Shuiyuntian.

494
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,950
Other than Cangyan Sea,

495
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,720
where else can she go?

496
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,210
My Lord, you're really intelligent.

497
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,970
Fairy Orchid has always wanted to escape.

498
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,440
But she gave up such a

499
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,540
good opportunity yesterday to

500
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,420
save you.

501
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,740
It shows that...

502
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,050
What?

503
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,910
It shows that...

504
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,340
It shows that she's sincerely convinced.

505
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,680
She has become a loyal subordinate like me

506
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,360
who cares for you

507
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,700
no matter what.

508
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:58,590
What do you know?

509
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,440
I'm stupid.

510
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,380
Please enlighten me.

511
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,980
If what she did was

512
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,750
not loyalty, then what was it?

513
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,650
Since you came back,

514
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,620
Silent Moon Palace is finally lively.

515
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,550
Would you like to go to the banquet?

516
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,070
It's a good sign of the unity of the Moon Tribe and

517
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,750
the revival of Cangyan Sea.

518
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,510
Ridiculous!

519
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,520
It's a gathering of women.

520
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,070
It's inappropriate for

521
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,780
me to go.

522
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,010
Yes.

523
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,350
Yes.

524
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,910
I'm sorry.

525
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,450
Fairy Orchid!

526
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,310
You're so beautiful.

527
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:47,560
Yes.

528
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,760
You're so beautiful.

529
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:49,660
It's beautiful.

530
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,420
This is nice.

531
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,010
This is really something else.

532
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,110
So beautiful.

533
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,260
You look so elegant.

534
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,650
This is too pretty.

535
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,330
It's so rare.

536
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,460
I envy you.

537
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,820
Try this on.

538
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,010
Let me see it.

539
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,070
I didn't expect Cangyan Sea's most fashionable outfit

540
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,040
to look so beautiful

541
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,210
on you.

542
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,060
If a stranger sees this,

543
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,200
they would think she's a daughter of the Moon Tribe.

544
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,530
Who would have thought that she's a fairy from Shuiyuntian.

545
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,140
It's so beautiful.

546
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:39,770
It's so nice.

547
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,200
It's so beautiful.

548
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,760
â™« Fall in love with your clear eyes â™«

549
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,560
Come, together.

550
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,230
â™« It's the most unforgettable scenery along the way â™«

551
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,200
â™« No one can ever replace what we've been through â™«

552
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,890
â™« It's as bright as the stars â™«

553
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,930
â™« Every decision I make for you â™«

554
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,380
â™« The story goes on and on â™«

555
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,200
â™« Stories in the past play in my head â™«

556
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,200
â™« I will remember it to the end of my life â™«

557
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,410
â™« Don't think, don't miss, don't listen to it â™«

558
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,450
â™« No more ripples in my heart â™«

559
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,920
â™« The sky lights up, be together and apart â™«

560
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,960
â™« People come and go, it always changes â™«

561
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:36,310
â™« Tramp over hill and dale to search for you â™«

562
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,050
â™« Act worthily of this life and our encounter â™«

563
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:44,310
â™« Act worthily of my trip to a sea of woes â™«

564
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:49,170
â™« Only in order to save you â™«

565
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:53,250
â™« Blaze a way through brambles and thorns to search for you â™«

566
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,270
â™« Make light of traveling from afar for days with you â™«

567
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:05,460
â™« I will never betray you even if I betray the world â™«

568
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:12,960
