[Mansion of Dongfang]

Left.

6
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,920
Left?

7
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,420
No, no, no.

8
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,620
A little to the right.

9
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:51,340
Like this.

10
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,140
Yes.

11
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,620
Right here.

12
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,030
Okay.

13
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,580
Madam.

14
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,310
The beans and saddle are ready.

15
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,460
Put them inside.

16
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,039
Yes.

17
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,570
What are these for?

18
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,520
Those beans and saddle.

19
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,330
These are the customs of marriage in the mortal world.

20
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,259
To sprinkle beans and cross the saddle.

21
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,100
Beans are used to ward off the evil spirits.

22
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,160
Crossing the saddle means safety.

23
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,860
These are wishes to the couple

24
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,250
for a happy life after marriage.

25
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,260
But

26
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,860
we don't have much time,

27
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,320
we can only make it simple.

28
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:25,579
Otherwise, we'll have to send betrothal goose and pass bags,

29
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,260
and make match, choose an auspicious day and greet the bride.

30
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,680
There are many customs.

31
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,380
I see.

32
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,180
There are so many customs in the mortal world.

33
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,860
In that case,

34
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,720
there is also a custom for us dragons to get married.

35
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:39,160
A man will scrape the hardest dragon scale

36
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,190
and give it to his wife.

37
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,640
A dragon scale?

38
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,460
That is too cruel.

39
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,810
Without the protection of the dragon scale,

40
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,870
it's like exposing the most fragile part

41
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,130
to the person he loves.

42
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,480
It means

43
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,150
he will listen to her

44
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,870
and be bullied by her,

45
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,570
or be cheated by her.

46
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,520
I'm going to check

47
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,410
the wedding dress.

48
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,630
I'm very busy today.

49
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,090
I don't have time to listen to your weird custom of the dragons.

50
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,670
[Orchid Residence]

51
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,100
We've searched the house,

52
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,430
but we couldn't find it.

53
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,010
We've searched everywhere outside,

54
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,540
but still couldn't find it.

55
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,620
That's a premium bead from the East Sea.

56
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,480
I'll deduct your annual salary if you can't find it.

57
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,560
Jieli.

58
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,079
This is a fake wedding.

59
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,250
Don't be so angry.

60
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,180
Although the wedding is fake,

61
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,780
the bead is real.

62
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,180
It's worth a lot of money.

63
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,180
I need to keep it for

64
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,330
the landlord.

65
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,360
You guys

66
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,040
go to the east yard with me.

67
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,130
Yes.

68
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,910
It's almost time.

69
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,130
Why haven't you changed into the wedding dress?

70
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,690
Lady Wanqing.

71
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,070
Why are you here?

72
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,260
I heard you lost your jewelry.

73
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,270
I don't know if you can find it.

74
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,040
So I brought you all my jewelry

75
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,350
to you.

76
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,030
Take a look.

77
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,930
Is there anything you like?

78
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,640
The wedding is a huge occasion to all girls.

79
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,770
You need to dress up to look beautiful.

80
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:44,890
Sit.

81
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,300
This one looks nice.

82
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,150
It suits you well.

83
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,240
Let me put it on you.

84
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,370
You don't have to...

85
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,580
Thank you.

86
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,890
You're welcome.

87
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,340
After tonight,

88
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,320
you should call me sister-in-law.

89
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,710
Logically speaking,

90
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,590
I should have cared more

91
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,570
about your wedding.

92
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,540
Although Mr. Dongfang is your brother,

93
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,350
he is a man.

94
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,360
He is not that thoughtful.

95
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,640
If you have any worries or difficulties,

96
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,530
which you can't tell him in the future,

97
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,960
just let me know.

98
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,850
Let's go.

99
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,400
Brother-in-law, hurry up.

100
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,120
I told you I have no family or friends in Lucheng City.

101
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,130
No one will send me gifts.

102
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,300
Just go.

103
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,730
It's not necessarily like that.

104
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,400
Congratulations, Xiao Run.

105
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,580
Congratulations, brother-in-law.

106
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,120
Thank you.

107
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,380
Here are two purple jade bracelets.

108
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,980
One for each of you.

109
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,010
Thank you.

110
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,060
Please come in.

111
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,610
Please.

112
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,160
Congratulations, Xiao Run.

113
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,300
Congratulations, brother-in-law.

114
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,480
This is the Youyang scroll for you.

115
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,360
Thank you.

116
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,090
And two jars of Cuihu wine.

117
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,650
Thank you.

118
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,070
Please come in.

119
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,930
Have a nice day.

120
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,520
What's going on?

121
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,790
Didn't you say

122
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,300
you don't have friends in Lucheng City?

123
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,560
You're wrong.

124
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,310
First,

125
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,820
we are sworn brothers.

126
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,280
Second,

127
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,300
after this wedding,

128
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,300
you need to call me brother-in-law.

129
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,909
So?

130
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,970
So,

131
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,200
I made it clear on the wedding invitation.

132
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,460
If they send a gift to me,

133
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,680
they need to send you one.

134
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,470
From now on,

135
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,570
my friends

136
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,780
are your friends.

137
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,840
They have to call you brother-in-law

138
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,930
as I do.

139
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,860
Are you touched?

140
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,210
It's nothing.

141
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,170
Look.

142
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,690
Over there.

143
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,280
As long as I have it,

144
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,080
you,

145
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,260
my brother-in-law,

146
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,600
must have it too.

147
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,120
Congratulations, Xiao Run. Congratulations, brother-in-law.

148
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,380
Thank you.

149
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:12,980
Come in, please.

150
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,150
-Congratulations. -Please come in.

151
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,570
Congratulations.

152
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,120
You wait here.

153
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,520
I'll go in and greet them.

154
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,410
Let's go inside.

155
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,210
Congratulations, Xiao Run.

156
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,070
Please come in.

157
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,240
Please come in.

158
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,610
Let's go.

159
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,970
Why are you hiding here?

160
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,440
That's my question.

161
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,500
You should greet the guests now.

162
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,720
Why are you here?

163
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,060
I...

164
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,780
I'm going now.

165
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,480
Wait.

166
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,010
I'm in a bad mood.

167
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,900
Talk to me.

168
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,880
In the Arbiter Hall,

169
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,510
I had to organize a lot of mortals' Destiny Book every day.

170
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,100
But at that time,

171
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,650
their life, death,

172
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,910
happiness and sadness

173
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,630
in my eyes

174
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,980
are just like a red leaf

175
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,870
on the fate tree.

176
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,950
The leaf blooms, and it falls.

177
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,539
It falls and then blooms.

178
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,669
Everything is predestined.

179
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,520
But now,

180
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,720
after these few days,

181
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,250
in the mortal world,

182
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,560
in Lucheng City,

183
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,410
I found that

184
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,060
marriage, funeral,

185
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,410
happiness and sadness

186
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,470
are the most important things.

187
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,530
Just now Lady Wanqing came to me happily

188
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,250
and picked the hairpin for me.

189
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,390
I feel really sad.

190
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,750
Although I know she is destined to die tonight,

191
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,180
at the thought of that

192
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,530
we lied to her

193
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,260
and she's going to die tonight,

194
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,530
I feel so...

195
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,630
Forget it.

196
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,320
I've told you so much,

197
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,490
but you don't understand.

198
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,160
I do.

199
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,750
This is my first time feeling like this.

200
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,670
Xiao Run told me that

201
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,860
his friends

202
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,790
are my friends.

203
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,020
I feel guilty for a mortal...

204
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,860
No.

205
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,690
An enemy.

206
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,370
I feel guilty.

207
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,520
He is Xiao Run.

208
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,940
He's not Changheng.

209
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,590
He is not your enemy.

210
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,580
Tonight,

211
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,140
can we...

212
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,160
forget about the Fairies,

213
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,320
forget about the Moon Tribe?

214
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,160
Forget it all.

215
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,130
You are not the Moon Supreme,

216
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,690
nor am I a fairy.

217
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,480
Let's be mortals for a day,

218
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,790
okay?

219
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,180
Okay.

220
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,220
Here.

221
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,070
Enjoy.

222
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,610
Excuse me.

223
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,580
Congratulations.

224
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,640
Congratulations.

225
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,340
Qu Shui.

226
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,620
You are back.

227
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,040
Where have you been?

228
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,140
It's my wedding day.

229
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,800
Why are you looking like this?

230
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,810
Whatever.

231
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,570
Let's go.

232
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,300
Get changed.

233
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,790
Qu Shui,

234
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,180
tell me honestly.

235
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,440
Where did you go today?

236
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:18,970
Say it.

237
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,440
Qu Shui.

238
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,100
Qu Shui.

239
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,740
What are you doing?

240
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,710
Qu Shui.

241
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,050
Qu Shui.

242
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,250
Why are you crying?

243
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,570
Did you get dumped

244
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
or are you in debt?

245
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,190
I know.

246
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,160
Do you think I'll leave you

247
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,340
after I get married?

248
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,820
Don't worry.

249
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,830
We've known each other since childhood.

250
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,790
We are like brothers.

251
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,990
How could I leave you?

252
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,690
Look.

253
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,330
Today is my wedding day.

254
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,560
After I get married,

255
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,240
I'll find you a beautiful girl from a good family.

256
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
What do you think?

257
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,630
Don't cry.

258
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,240
Get dressed.

259
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,840
Qu Shui.

260
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,240
Isn't this the bead on the phoenix crown?

261
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,200
Why is it here?

262
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,130
Send it to Lady Orchid.

263
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,850
She is putting on makeup

264
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,400
in the west yard with Lady Wanqing.

265
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,120
Hurry up.

266
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,870
Go.

267
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,540
You are

268
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,850
the servant of Xiao Run.

269
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,810
What are you doing here?

270
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,340
There was a bead on Lady Orchid's phoenix crown

271
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,610
left in my young master's wedding dress.

272
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,340
I came to send it.

273
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,990
So it was left at his place.

274
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,330
Follow me.

275
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,830
Strange.

276
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,180
She was here just now.

277
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,710
Qu Shui.

278
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,720
Why are you here?

279
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,560
Run asked me to give this to you.

280
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:52,980
He has some words

281
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,290
for you.

282
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,190
They'll be husband and wife in a few hours.

283
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,660
He is so attached.

284
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,830
Forget it.

285
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,530
I can't hear

286
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,880
his words for you.

287
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,500
Orchid.

288
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
You look good in your wedding dress.

289
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,250
It took you so much effort

290
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,890
to finally marry him.

291
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,230
Are you happy now?

292
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,820
Qu Shui.

293
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,210
No.

294
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,610
Are you Danyin?

295
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,220
What?

296
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,150
Are you afraid I'll ruin your plan?

297
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,510
This expression.

298
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,730
This tone.

299
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,990
You were like this

300
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,120
when you bullied me.

301
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,800
Fairy Danyin.

302
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,730
It's really you.

303
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,800
What are you doing?

304
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,100
It's just that I haven't seen someone from Shuiyuntian

305
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,150
for a long time.

306
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,410
I'm a little excited.

307
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,020
By the way,

308
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,710
why did you and Lord Changheng come to the mortal world to experience hardships?

309
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,010
Can you explain it to me?

310
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,440
You should tell me

311
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,570
why you are hanging out

312
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,380
with Dongfang Qingcang.

313
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,520
And you two look close.

314
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,590
It's a long story.

315
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,220
Forget it.

316
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,620
We'll talk about it later.

317
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,010
The most important thing now

318
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,310
is to find a way to save Lord Changheng.

319
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,830
Lord Yunzhong has known about

320
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,090
the hardship experience.

321
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,320
In order to stop Dongfang Qingcang,

322
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,210
he asked me...

323
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,230
What did he ask you to do?

324
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,000
He asked me to kill the mortal body of the former God of War

325
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,050
to stop the hardship experience.

326
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,770
Kill Lady Wanqing?

327
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,990
Why?

328
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,680
Wasn't the former God of War a hero of Shuiyuntian?

329
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,690
Besides, if we do this,

330
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,830
Lord Changheng will disappear too.

331
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,920
His Majesty said

332
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,200
we have to sacrifice Changheng

333
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,370
for Shuiyuntian.

334
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,560
But I don't want to.

335
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,110
Of course you don't.

336
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,870
Fairy Danyin.

337
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,140
We must find a way to protect them.

338
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,140
Of course!

339
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,820
Even if I die,

340
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,280
I will protect Changheng.

341
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,720
Orchid,

342
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,770
tell me

343
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,900
how to help them go through hardships?

344
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,150
According to the fate poem,

345
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,160
only on the wedding night,

346
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,180
Xiao Run kills Lady Wanqing,

347
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,510
then they can go through it successfully.

348
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,590
With Xiao Run's personality,

349
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,020
how could he kill people?

350
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't know.

351
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,860
You don't know?

352
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,820
Then what are you doing here?

353
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,870
To try your luck?

354
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,220
Calm down, Fairy Danyin.

355
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,820
I've read so many Destiny Books.

356
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,210
There are more weird fate poems.

357
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,650
But before it happens,

358
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,830
I can’t figure it out.

359
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,050
Let's wait and see.

360
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,520
We can't just stand by.

361
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,390
He cares about you the most now.

362
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,240
If there is no way,

363
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,510
I will hold a knife on your neck

364
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,690
and force him.

365
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,420
Are you serious?

366
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,300
Of course.

367
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,190
If it doesn't work,

368
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,490
I'll cut you.

369
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,609
I don't believe he won't do it.

370
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,819
No time for talking.

371
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,420
Let's play it by ear tonight.

372
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,050
Fairy Danyin.

373
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,280
Lord Ronghao.

374
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,170
Lord Ronghao.

375
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,520
Why are you here?

376
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,780
Changheng is in danger.

377
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,110
I can't leave him alone.

378
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,110
Even if Changheng can go through this time,

379
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,670
if he wants to leave safely,

380
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,930
there is one person we must keep an eye on.

381
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,240
Do you mean

382
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,050
Dongfang Qingcang?

383
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,910
Dongfang Qingcang is powerful.

384
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,710
In the three realms,

385
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,020
the only one that can fight with him is Changheng.

386
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,860
Tonight,

387
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,750
it's a good chance to get rid of Changheng.

388
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,820
Dongfang Qingcang will definitely kill him.

389
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,080
We need to find a way to lure him away.

390
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,800
Fairy Orchid.

391
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,030
You are the only one who could do it.

392
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,540
Because he doesn't believe anyone,

393
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,840
except you.

394
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,440
Only you

395
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,250
can get close to him.

396
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,210
I...

397
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,350
But...

398
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,400
But what?

399
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,000
Orchid,

400
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,140
do you want to save Changheng or not?

401
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,530
Of course I do.

402
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,540
That's it.

403
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,650
There's something

404
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,580
that you don't know yet.

405
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:31,600
Fairy Orchid,

406
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,940
don't you want to know

407
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,930
why Changheng risked his life

408
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,530
to experience hardships in Shenshui Hall?

409
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,060
You don't understand.

410
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,610
It's because you've never

411
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,810
loved someone as I do.

412
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,790
Lord Changheng is experiencing hardships

413
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,100
because of me.

414
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,190
Because you have always been the one

415
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,080
he loves.

416
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,280
Changheng had an engagement with the Goddess.

417
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,880
That's why he can't tell you.

418
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,940
Over the years,

419
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,630
he had looked for the Goddess everywhere

420
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,760
and wanted to break off the engagement

421
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,780
so you can be together.

422
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,370
And that Firefly Stone.

423
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,070
He traveled around

424
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,080
and found it

425
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,640
for you.

426
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,410
I shouldn't

427
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,710
say these things.

428
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,380
But now, the situation is critical.

429
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,830
I have to say it.

430
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,220
Fairy Orchid,

431
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,660
Changheng loves you so much.

432
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,460
I don't know if

433
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,590
you will accept him.

434
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,160
But what happened to him today

435
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,250
was caused by you.

436
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,680
Orchid,

437
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,160
what are you hesitating about?

438
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,710
If Lord Changheng is gone,

439
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,240
who else can fight with him?

440
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,460
Dongfang Qingcang is not a bad person.

441
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,700
He is not what you think.

442
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,590
How dare you speak for him!

443
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,060
Are you crazy?

444
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,960
Fairy Orchid.

445
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,270
You know what?

446
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,530
If Dongfang Qingcang

447
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,590
took my master's primordial spirit,

448
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,340
not only can't I see my master,

449
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,620
but the three realms would be in misery.

450
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,770
Many people will lose their families.

451
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,850
Lord Ronghao,

452
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,880
what are you talking about?

453
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,120
Don't you know that?

454
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,680
What does

455
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,320
Dongfang Qingcang want?

456
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,530
Please tell me.

457
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,170
Dongfang Qingcang

458
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,110
wants to take my master's primordial spirit

459
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,750
to break the seal of the Shuofeng Sword

460
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,410
and regain 100,000 soldiers.

461
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,980
Then he will fight against Shuiyuntian.

462
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
It's impossible.

463
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,310
It's impossible.

464
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,120
It's true.

465
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,120
In the war 30,000 years ago,

466
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,110
the former God of War

467
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,630
sealed 100,000 soldiers

468
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,100
with the Shuofeng Sword.

469
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,700
There is my master's spiritual mark

470
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,040
on the Shuofeng Sword.

471
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,930
The seal will be broken

472
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,940
only with my master's primordial spirit.

473
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,310
Are you here

474
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,870
just to relax?

475
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,240
Or is there something else?

476
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,810
Nothing.

477
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,700
Are you lying to me?

478
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,920
No.

479
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,930
I'm just here to relax.

480
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,500
Lord Ronghao,

481
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,690
what should I do?

482
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,270
This is a bottle

483
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,700
of poison.

484
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,300
It can weaken his power temporarily.

485
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,350
Stall him for a while.

486
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,490
Just for a while,

487
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,540
I can take my master's primordial spirit

488
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,850
and leave with Changheng safely.

489
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,160
I'm counting on you.

490
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,690
Lady Orchid.

491
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,550
It's almost the auspicious time.

492
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,770
Where are you?

493
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,100
-Orchid. -Lady Orchid.

494
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,300
Make sure he takes the poison.

495
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,700
And make sure nothing goes wrong.

496
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,580
Got it?

497
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:27,390
Yes.

498
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,690
I believe

499
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,640
you will not ignore Changheng's life

500
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,570
and watch the three realms

501
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,880
suffering from the war.

502
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,160
Okay.

503
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,730
Congratulations.

504
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,950
Congratulations.

505
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,810
It's so lively.

506
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,060
Congratulations.

507
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,290
Run, we are going to propose a toast to brother-in-law.

508
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:39,820
Let's go.

509
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,150
Mr. Dongfang.

510
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,960
Brother-in-law, congratulations.

511
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,290
May you have a baby soon.

512
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,430
Let me fill your cup.

513
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,780
How about I get a pot of wine?

514
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,280
Okay.

515
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,000
Here.

516
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,840
Xiao Run is a good drinker.

517
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,100
Mr. Dongfang, here is a toast to you.

518
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,280
A toast to you.

519
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,330
Here.

520
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,290
Congratulations.

521
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,820
Let me fill you another cup.

522
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,480
This way.

523
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,320
Be careful.

524
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,310

May you have a baby soon.

Don't you think

552
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,370
it feels a little familiar tonight?

553
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,530
At that time, you just arrived at the Cangyan Sea.

In order to switch back,

Just like now,

557
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,360
there were just the two of us.

558

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,160
Yes.

563
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,820
You were so silly

564
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,000
and thought I would kill you.

565
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,350
It’s weird.

00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,430
We've only known each other for three months,

567
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,690
but I feel like I have known you for 30,000 years.

568
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,960
I've seen you in the Fairies' clothes.

I've seen you in the Moon Tribe's clothes.

Then I've seen you in mortals' clothes.

571
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,190
But the most beautiful clothes on you

572
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,920
are the wedding dress tonight.

Leave now.

694
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,150
Orchid!

695
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,080
No!

696
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,090
Don't come over!

697
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,940
You will get hurt.

698
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:57,100
I won't let you go.

699
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,280
You took him away.

700
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,760
You took him away.

701
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,080
No!

702
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,010
Don't come over. You will get hurt.

703
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,690
Go.

704
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,980
Lady Wanqing.

705
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,880
Lady Wanqing.

706
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,550
This is the evil spirit.

707
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,350
What's wrong?

708
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:59,180
I've seen it in the examination for immortals.

709
00:37:59,180 --> 00:37:59,980
What's wrong?

710
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,430
Wooden Head.

711
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,480
Don't come over.

712
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,620
You will get hurt.

713
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:43,940
Be careful.

714
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,500
Lady Wanqing.

715
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,230
You can't die.

716
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,380
You'll be gone if you die.

717
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:24,900
You won't die.

718
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,790
As long as you make it,

719
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,480
you'll ascend back to Lord Changheng.

720
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,330
Lord.

721
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,310
Hang in there.

722
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,210
Qu Shui,

723
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,220
why are you

724
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,710
still calling me Lord?

725
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:47,750
I am Xiao Run.

726
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,630
Xiao Run.

727
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,080
Xiao Run.

728
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,810
Xiao Run.

729
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,880
Wooden Head.

730
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,740
You...

731
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,460
Are you okay?

732
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,660
It's just the evil spirit. Don't worry.

733
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,290
The poison wine and the bead

734
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,560
were made by the same person, right?

735
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,230
Who is it?

736
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,470
Lord Ronghao.

737
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,870
Chidi woman's one and only disciple.

738
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,860
You're injured.

739
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,950
Where are you going?

740
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,800
To do what I should do.

741
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:04,730
Wooden Head.

742
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
Wooden Head.

743
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,750
My Lord.

744
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,350
My Lord.

745
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,580
You are injured.

746
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,130
What happened?

747
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:19,010
It doesn't matter.

748
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,210
Did Xiao Run and Xie Wanqing disappear?

749
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,290
Go find them.

750
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:30,350
The primordial spirit of Chidi woman is the key to unlocking the seal.

751
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:32,700
It decides whether 100,000 soldiers will come back or not.

752
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,960
No mistake is allowed.

753
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:34,890
Yes.

754
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,140
Xiao Run.

755
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,660
I’ll avenge you.

756
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,860
Wooden Head.

757
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,500
Wooden Head.

758
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,770
Wooden Head.

759
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,170
Where are you?

760
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,170
Lady Wanqing.

761
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,810
What are you doing?

762
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:11,780
Lady Wanqing.

763
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,060
Why did you choose her

764
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,360
over me?

765
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:20,260
You betrayed me for this woman!

766
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,990
Give my husband back!

767
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,370
You took him away.

768
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,880
You took him away.

769
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:26,900
What?

770
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,130
You took him away.

771
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,230
It's the evil spirit.

772
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,400
Lady Wanqing.

773
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,210
You're poisoned by the evil spirit.

774
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,130
Let go of me!

775
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,360
Lady Wanqing, wake up.

776
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:55,420
