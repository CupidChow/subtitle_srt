After I went back,

132
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,740
I was worried every night.

133
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,140
Is there a way that

134
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,450
can lift my brother's Heart Curse?

135
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,790
If I knew it, would I hurt my brother?

136
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,920
Of course you won't.

137
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,530
Then why are you hesitating?

138
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,350
Actually,

139
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,160
the only way to break the curse

140
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,440
is to kill Orchid

141
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,500
with the ancient sword of Chengying.

142
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,050
But as you know,

143
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,110
I've been searching for it in the three realms under the order of the Lord.

144
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,910
But I still couldn't find the last fragment.

145
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,680
Even if we know how to lift the curse,

146
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,730
it's useless.

147
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,260
So that's why

148
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,620
you went to search for the fragments of Chengying sword.

149
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,380
Yes.

150
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,620
Your Highness,

151
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,410
have you found the last fragment?

152
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,420
No.

Look at them.

165
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,360
Why are there so many love lock sellers suddenly?

166
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,000
The streets are lively too.

167
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,380
Yes.

168
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,810
Seven days later

169
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,200
is the Mountain and Moon Festival once in a thousand years.

170
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,800
Mountain and Moon Festival?

171
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,370
Do you see the moon-shaped mountain?

172
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,760
Every 1,000 years,

173
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,180
the full moon in Cangyan Sea

174
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,360
will meet it.

175
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,250
By then,

176
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,720
the full moon will be fully inserted

177
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,150
in the mountain.

178
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,950
If they meet,

179
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,220
will it be a bigger full moon?

180
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,040
This is the origin of the Mountain and Moon Festival.

181
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,190
What does it have to do with buying the love locks?

182
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,540
Why does everyone buy the locks?

183
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,760
I don't know.

184
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,020
Maybe it's a new custom

185
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,830
in the past 30,000 years here.

186
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:01,930
Jieli.

187
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,850
Orchid.

188
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,250
My lord.

189
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,420
Good.

190
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,360
No wonder I haven't seen you all day.

191
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,220
So you went on a date with the Lord?

192
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,690
Jieli.

193
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,870
My lord.

194
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,040
What are these?

195
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,590
You bought two locks?

196
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,210
Why did you buy them?

197
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,490
You have no idea, my lord.

198
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,690
It is said that

199
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,670
if couples who are in love

200
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,630
carve each other's name

201
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,440
on the love lock,

202
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,200
and hang them on the bridge of love

203
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,010
on the night of the Mountain and Moon Festival

204
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,360
when the Mountain and Moon meet,

205
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,180
then they will be...

206
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,590
What will they be?

207
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,930
They will be together forever and ever.

208
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,390
Really?

209
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,130
It's just nonsense.

210
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,640
It's just some groundless saying

211
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,110
without evidence.

212
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,170
It's not strained at all.

213
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,550
How wonderful it is.

214
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,480
I won't be interested in those activities

215
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,290
to cheat kids.

216
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,390
Neither am I.

217
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,110
So the Mountain and Moon Festival

218
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,420
is the lovers' festival

219
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,280
in Cangyan Sea every 1,000 years.

220
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,950
I grew up in the Haishi City.

221
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,170
I didn't even know

222
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,640
there was such a festival in our Moon Tribe.

223
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,940
I almost missed it.

224
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,150
Brother Shangque.

225
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,410
Are you available at the Mountain and Moon Festival?

226
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,330
I wonder if you have any instructions that day, my lord?

227
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,170
My lord,

228
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,390
please lend me Shangque

229
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,320
at the Mountain and Moon Festival.

230
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,880
Approved.

231
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:02,800
Thank you, Lord.

232
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,600
Thank you, Lord.

233
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,480
Great.

234
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,520
Just leave.

235
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:08,600
Go.

236
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,130
I'll look around.

237
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,180
Look at those merchants.

238
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,240
They are not good at doing business at all.

239
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,710
They're all selling locks.

240
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,370
How much can they earn though?

241
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,700
Let's set up a stall

242
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,090
to sell sharp gravers.

243
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,910
What?

244
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,210
Think about it.

245
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,470
On the day of the Mountain and Moon Festival,

246
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,110
almost all lovers in the Cangyan Sea will come.

247
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,670
So all of them will be

248
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,560
our potential buyers.

249
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,450
By then,

250
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,310
we can also sell some rouge, cosmetics and ornaments

251
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,960
with high price.

252
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,350
In such a romantic atmosphere,

253
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,080
men will not hesitate to spend money for women.

254
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,150
You'll be in charge of purchasing and running errands.

255
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,950
I'll be responsible for attracting customers.

256
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,420
We'll make a fortune.

257
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,100
I'm going to be rich.

258
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,300
So you're not going to

259
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,340
admire the moon with me?

260
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,190
Are you crazy?

261
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,450
How can you miss the chance to earn money

262
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,710
but to admire the moon?

263
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,870
Don't worry.

264
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,840
Your benefit is guaranteed.

265
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,690
If you come to help me,

266
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,340
I'll give you 10% of the profit.

267
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,750
What? Is it too little?

268
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,350
Then 15% of the profit.

269
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,330
That's not what I mean.

270
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,060
20%.

271
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,830
You're still not satisfied?

272
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,920
Black Dragon!

273
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,520
Boss.

274
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,740
You wanna buy the lock, Miss?

275
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,670
Show me your most beautiful locks please.

276
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,340
They are all here.

277
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,350
Pick one.

278
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,540
So beautiful.

279
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,940
So beautiful.

280
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,000
Sir, do you want a lock?

281
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,860
What kind of locks do you want?

282
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,860
Lower your voice.

283
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,850
The style doesn't matter.

284
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,060
I want the hardest and strongest one.

285
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,570
Okay, I got it.

286
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,310
The stronger the better.

287
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:39,920
Okay.

288
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,270
I'll take this.

289
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,610
No. No.

290
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,370
I'll take these two.

291
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,170
Okay.

292
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,310
They cost one stone.

293
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,170
See you.

294
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,589
Please take a look.

[Orchid]

298
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,820
Brother,

299
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,370
What is it?

300
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,990
Since the fairy is related to your life,

301
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,870
she should be strictly guarded.

302
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,130
Nothing must go wrong.

303
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,450
Why did you still

304
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,170
take her around?

305
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,660
Why do you indulge her so much?

306
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,680
As long as I am with her,

307
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,150
how can things be wrong?

308
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,680
Brother,

309
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,590
you can't use Hellfire now.

310
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,080
You're not like before.

311
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,560
I will recover in a few days.

312
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,140
And my Hellfire will be recovered soon.

313
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,860
Brother,

314
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,310
that fairy will be a disaster sooner or later.

315
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,230
Since you know how to break the curse,

316
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,260
why don't you reforge the Chengying sword and kill her

317
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,590
to prevent any trouble?

318
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,070
Not to mention the last piece of Chengying sword couldn't be found,

319
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,420
even it's successfully reforged,

320
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,600
I won't kill my beloved one.

321
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,320
Beloved one?

322
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,260
You keep saying

323
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,160
you're ashamed of the 100,000 soldiers in Xuanxu realm.

324
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,260
But now you're turning the culprit

325
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,070
as the one you love!

326
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,750
She is not the culprit,

327
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,870
but me.

328
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,480
The primordial spirit of the Chidi woman has been destroyed.

329
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,120
I will find another way to unseal them.

330
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,180
At this point,

331
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,410
I will do my best to help you find another way.

332

the people of Moon Tribe and I

334
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,390
will never agree our Moon Supreme to be with

335

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,650
Rong Hao used the evil spirit to trap me.

339
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,830
Rong Hao?

340
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,090
You mean

341
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,690
the evil spirit that hurt you was from Rong Hao?

342
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,450
Yes.

343
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,270
Are you sure?

344
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,200
Of course.

345
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,530
Rong Hao must be closely related to that Lord of Haishi City.

346
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,490
Yes.

347
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,430
The Lord of Haishi City captured me in the Thousand Dreamland

348
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,780
and transformed out of the Arbiter Hall.

349
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,250
He even imitated Lord Changheng

350
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,670
and asked me to fix the Destiny Book.

351
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,310
He must have been to Shuiyuntian.

352
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,420
Otherwise, how could he be so familiar with the Arbiter Hall?

353
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,390
And he was so good at imitating Lord Changheng.

354
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,860
It was so alike.

355
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,580
Could it be that Lord Rong Hao told him?

356
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,610
[Crane Pavilion]

357
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,920
[Crane Pavilion]

358
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,440
You're here.

359
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,770
I've been waiting for you for three days.

360
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,290
I knew you would find me.

361
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,850
I wonder

362
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,830
who is the one waiting for me?

363
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,590
Is it that carefree

364
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,610
and open-minded Lord Rong Hao,

365
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,160
or the Lord of Haishi City,

366
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,720
who is cunning

367
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,700
and plays tricks

368
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,490
in order to manipulate the fairy realm and the Moon Tribe?

369
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,640
[Crane Pavilion]

370
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,450
When did you start suspecting me?

371
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,350
I never suspected you.

372
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,280
But I don't know

373
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,050
how do you get the evil spirit to trap Dongfang Qingcang.

374
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,930
And why did the Lord of Haishi City, who has never been to Shuiyuntian

375
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,610
turn into me,

376
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,920
and created a fake Arbiter Hall

377
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,350
to cheat Orchid.

378
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,860
How do you explain

379
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,830
all these things?

380
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,830
Why?

381
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,140
That day,

382
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,850
when you insisted to save Orchid in Cangyan Sea,

383
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,930
you should have already known the answer.

384
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,640
If I could save my master,

385
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,060
what do you think I would do?

386
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,260
You will definitely fight to death.

387
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,800
Even if you will be betrayed by all the people,

388
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,530
or go against the law of heaven,

389
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,390
You'll do anything you can.

390
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,510
Do you know where this place is?

391
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,390
Once,

392
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,080
there was a mortal child.

393
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,390
He was born blind.

394
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,610
He had no parents.

395
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,750
He could only make a living

396
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,600
by playing the flute.

397
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,540
That year,

398
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,890
the winter in Yunmeng Lake

399
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,210
was freezing cold.

400
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,920
That blind child

401
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,440
hadn't found food for three days.

402
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,170
His body was freezing.

403
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,740
Only his fingers could move.

404
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,550
He sat there,

405
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:10,000
kept blowing the flute.

406
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,250
Gradually,

407
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,850
he lost consciousness.

408
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,410
He thought

409
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,430
he might be frozen to death.

410
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,360
But when he woke up,

411
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,050
he saw a person.

412
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,820
Yes.

413
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,550
He could see the world.

414
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,060
The first thing he saw

415
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,120
was a very dazzling

416
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,390
and beautiful lady.

417
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:54,230
But she looked so sad.

418
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,400
That blind child

419
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,840
is you.

420
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,440
Before I met my master,

421
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,260
I lived in endless darkness.

422
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,990
After my master died,

423
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,300
she took away all the brightness in my heart.

424
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,600
There's only

425
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,610
a hollow skin left.

426
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,050
To revive her, I became a hollow-minded person

427
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,630
who only knows...

428
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,340
And the Lord Rong Hao you know,

429
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,030
who is easy-going

430
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,880
and carefree

431
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,100
is just a mirage

432
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,660
outside this body.

433
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,390
Did you really kill

434
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,960
the 3,000 soldiers?

435
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,590
That day,

436
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,840
although I could save half of the primordial spirits of my master,

437
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,100
the 30,000 years of hardship experience

438
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,950
made her fragile primordial spirit

439
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,420
weaker.

440
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,230
Only the evil spirit

441
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,900
can stabilize her primordial spirit.

442
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,910
So I set up the Haishi City,

443
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,350
and instigated the internal strife of the Moon Tribe

444
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,870
to absorb plenty of spirits of the Moon Tribe

445
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,820
and refine the evil spirit.

446
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,190
But after Dongfang Qingcang returned to the Cangyan Sea,

447
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,110
I couldn't do anything to the Moon Tribe.

448
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,720
I could only...

449
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,430
The late God of War was upright

450
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,490
and tried her best to protect the people.

451
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,830
If she knew

452
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,770
you kept killing your fellows to make her resurrection

453
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,830
how would she feel?

454
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,380
People?

455
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,380
How can the people compare to her?

456
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,620
I just want my master to come back to life.

457
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,680
As long as I can see her again,

458
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,120
even if I will be killed by her,

459
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,790
I still feel no regrets.

460
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,450
We've known each other for ten thousand years.

461
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,680
You were my best friend.

462
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,200
But now I realize

463
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,590
I know nothing about you.

464
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,160
How foolish I am.

465
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,240
For the past 30,000 years,

466
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,660
on each anniversary of my master's death,

467
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,380
I would go to the monument to condole with her.

468
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,870
And the only person I met there

469
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,360
was you.

470
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,690
Changheng.

471
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,830
For the past 30,000 years,

472
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,480
I've been disguising

473
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,880
and lying.

474
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,650
But being friends with you is something I did

475
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,540
from the bottom of my heart.

476
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,040
I trust you.

477
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,690
I know you trust me too.

478
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,310
In order to save Orchid,

479
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,780
you are isolated and betrayed by others.

480
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,630
You and I are the same.

481
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,510
Otherwise,

482
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,370
how could we be friends?

483
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,850
But you've committed a crime.

484
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,150
Your sin is unforgivable.

485
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,520
Let's go.

486
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,480
I'll go back with you.

487
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,560
Li Yuan.

488
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:53,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

489
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,980
The matter of the sinner Rong Hao

490
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,700
is related to the three realms.

491
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,340
Each of his sin is horrifying.

492
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,570
He needs to be interrogated carefully.

493
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,810
Put him in the karma jail for now.

494
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,810
You are asked to strictly guard him.

495
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,760
Don't let anything go wrong.

496
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,640
Yes.

497
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,260
Although you committed a serious crime for the sake of a traitor,

498
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:46,250
you did a great job catching the criminal, Rong Hao.

499
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,550
She is not a traitor.

500
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,290
At this point, you are still stubborn

501
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,590
and disregarding the overall situation.

502
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,850
The overall situation

503
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,930
is just your big picture.

504
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,410
In your eyes,

505
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,670
our mother and I,

506
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,200
and your closest relatives

507
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,770
are all chess pieces on your overall situation.

508
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,550
You...

509
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,070
Why are you still pretending?

510
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,060
The power of Heaven is like millions of soldiers.

511
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,450
At the Memory Loss River,

512
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,420
I have openly defied you.

513
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,310
If you didn't kill me,

514
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,870
how will you rule the fairy realm in the future?

515
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,920
Besides,

516
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,150
if I die,

517
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,910
you can completely get rid of

518
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,440
the shame of our mother's sin of running away.

519
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,400
Isn't that a win-win situation?

520
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,930
Changheng,

521
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,870
do you really think I won't kill you?

522
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,610
Since I'm back,

523
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,540
I am ready to be killed.

524
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,990
Just for a traitor who colluded with the Moon Tribe,

525
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,090
you truly desire to die?

526
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,940
She's not a traitor!

527
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,670
I have been obeying the rules since childhood.

528
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,860
My long life

529
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,540
is like the frozen Northernmost Ocean

530
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,340
doesn't have any waves.

531
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,790
After I met Orchid,

532
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,450
my world began to have colors.

533
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,600
Now she has someone in her heart,

534
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,550
and is willing to stay at Cangyan Sea.

535
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,140
The rest of my life is too long.

536
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,500
I really don't know how to spend my days.

537
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,160
Only after I die,

538
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,560
you can defend your authority.

539
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,910
In the three realms,

540
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,050
only you

541
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,280
can compete with that Dongfang Qingcang.

542
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,440
You are the God of War of Shuiyuntian.

543
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,960
How can you abandon your duties?

544
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,970
Changheng,

545
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,040
as long as you admit your mistake to me,

546
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,840
and be punished in front of everybody...

547
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,510
No need.

548
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,010
I'm tired of war.

549
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,570
From now on,

550
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,060
I won't fight for you anymore.

551
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,150
Fine.

552
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,630
I...

553
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,400
grant your wish.

554
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,080
Before I came here,

555
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,060
I've seen the fate of Changheng in this life.

556
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,120
The hardship he is supposed to experience

557
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,580
is not to kill Xie Wanqing.

558
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,600
In this life,

559
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,120
he should die for the one he cares.

560
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,620
Lord Changheng has successfully experienced hardships.

561
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,620
It meant I was the one he cared about.

562
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,530
But

563
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,670
the one he cared about was Cricket,

564
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,850
not Danyin.

565
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,610
Besides,

566
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,100
Lord Changheng loves Orchid.

567
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,179
One of the two weddings Tianji Mirror predicted

568
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,690
has come true.

569
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,969
Will the second wedding come true as well?

570
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,300
If he knows that Orchid

571
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,500
might be the Goddess of Xishan

572
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,440
who is his fiancée.

573
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,219
If I tell him,

574
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,679
there will be no turning back.

575
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,389
They will definitely get married.

576
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,739
But if I don't tell him,

577
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,350
no one will know that Orchid is a goddess.

578
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,870
Will Lord Yunzhong punish Lord Changheng

579
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,929
for committing a crime of collusion?

580
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,060
He'll has to be sent to the fairy guillotine.

581
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:51,770
Not necessarily.

582
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,340
After all, they are siblings.

583
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,310
No matter what, Lord Yunzhong will care about his sibling.

584
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,640
Fairy Danyin, bad news!

585
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,870
Fairy Danyin!

586
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,440
Lord Changheng offended His Majesty.

587
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,050
He...

588
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,740
What's wrong with him?

589
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,710
Tell me.

590
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:13,570
He's sentenced to a crime of committing a crime of collusion.

591
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,080
Seven days later,

592
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,220
he will be executed at the fairy guillotine.

593
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,090
Wooden Head, time to take the medicine.

594
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,610
You haven't recovered yet.

595
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,540
Why are you using your power again?

596
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,910
I've recovered 60%. I'm fine.

597
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,770
You start to act tough since you only recovered 60%.

598
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,840
Take the medicine.

599
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,550
Are you still worried

600
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,440
about your Hellfire?

601
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,230
In order to purify the primordial spirit,

602
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,690
you've wasted much of your energy and power.

603
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:30,100
You need to recuperate first.

604
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,200
We still don't know how to unseal the soldiers.

605
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,070
If my Hellfire can't be restored,

606
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,170
how can I protect the people of Cangyan Sea?

607
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,140
I'm afraid that I'm going to give birth the baby.

608
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,970
I'll get someone to deliver the baby for you.

609
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:33,730
You can't go.

610
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,690
You can't go.

611
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,420
I'm a woman from the Moon Tribe.

612
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,430
Our child

613
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,980
can't be found.

614
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:42,380
I'm fine.

615
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,050
Xing Luo.

616
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,060
But...

617
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,790
But...

618
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,140
What should we do with our child?

619
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,750
Neither the Moon Tribe nor the fairies will accept her.

620
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,740
I'm afraid

621
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,330
she'll need to hide all her life.

622
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,220
No, she won't.

623
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,140
No, she won't.

624
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:03,920
Xing Luo.

625
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,520
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

626
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,310
There's a trace of the Moon Tribe nearby.

627
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:10,980
Search!

628
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,340
Xing Luo.

629
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,580
Star Luo, are you alright?

630
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,940
Lord Rong Hao.

631
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,410
She is a member of the Moon Tribe?

632
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,570
Lord Rong Hao.

633
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,990
have you seen a woman of the Moon Tribe

634
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,450
who is about to give birth?

635
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,160
A woman of the Moon Tribe?

636
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,760
I think I saw a pregnant woman

637
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,810
went that way.

638
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:03,440
Thank you.

639
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,110
Let's go.

640
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,330
Thank you for saving our lives.

641
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,350
You should leave now.

642
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,820
Go.

643
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,930
I didn't expect that Rong Hao is the Lord of Haishi City.

644
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,660
He's about to be interrogated.

645
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,460
What if he leaks the identity of Danyin?

646
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,510
Father, please save Changheng.

647
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,710
Danyin.

648
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,260
This is...

649
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:48,310
Father, why do you have something from the Moon Tribe?

650
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,440
Don't make a fuss.

651
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,250
This is just something I got

652
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,590
when I was on patrol.

653
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,360
Why didn't you submit it after it was confiscated?

654
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,800
It's a complicated matter. I forgot.

655
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,490
Father, tell me.

656
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:05,010
Lord Changheng will be executed in seven days

657
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,730
for committing a crime of collusion,

658
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,900
is it true?

659
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,670
Yes.

660
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,450
Lord Yunzhong

661
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,770
doesn't even show mercy to the Lord Changheng.

662
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,880
If he knows

663
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,320
you've been keeping the stuff from the Moon Tribe with you,

664
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,680
you'll get in big trouble.

665
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,310
Father.

666
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,000
You must be careful.

667
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,770
My dear daughter.

668
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,380
Don't worry.

669
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,180
I will be fine.

670
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,220
I won't let anything happen to you, too.

671
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,890
Father.

672
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,280
What's wrong?

673
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,740
I'm fine.

674
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,110
Xing Luo.

675
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,040
I'm sorry.

676
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,410
Not only did I fail to protect you,

677
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,090
but also your only belongings.

678
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,950
But I have no choice.

679
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,600
For the safety of our daughter,

680
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:52,990
I can't let her identity

681
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,710
be exposed.

682
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,950
Xing Luo.

683
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,620
I'm sorry.

684
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,910
Why is this black dragon's name

685
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,290
so hard to curve.

686
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:32,720
It's eight times harder than

687
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,780
the work Orchid does for the Lord.

688
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,770
Pavilion Master.

689
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,640
Greetings, Pavilion Master.

690
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,230
Lord,

691
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,530
I just received a report

692
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:57,580
there was a suspicious movement.

693
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,240
I'm afraid someone has sneaked into the palace.

694
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,410
Go.

695
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:11,360
Find a chance

696
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,490
to drop this blood

697
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,630
on the Bone Orchid worn by Orchid.

698
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,780
Whose blood is this?

699
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:19,550
Will this hurt Orchid?

700
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:27,700
