[Episode 5]

4
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,620
He's gone?

5
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,420
He's really gone?

6
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,180
Is he hiding?

7
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,060
Oh!

8
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,100
Stop looking.

9
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,180
I've looked for him.

10
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,420
He is really not here.

11
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,460
He's really gone.

12
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,500
I was always expecting it.

13
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,980
He's really gone.

14
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,900
Great!

15
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,020
Great!

16
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,620
Great!

17
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,740
-He's gone. -Great!

18
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,259
Great!

19
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,900
Thank goodness.

20
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,450
He is a sinful immortal.

21
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,460
Once someone finds out,

22
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,700
you will definitely be charged

23
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,060
with hiding an escaped prisoner.

24
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,140
Arbiter is not here.

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,540
Who will protect you then?

26
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,780
Protect me?

27
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,940
If master finds out,

28
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,620
she won't forgive me.

29
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,820
These days,

30
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,660
I've been worried all day.

31
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,980
He's finally gone.

32
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,900
Even the air becomes more comfortable.

33
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,970
How would I care about

34
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,140
the likes and dislikes of the small grass?

35
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,780
When I think about it,

36
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,660
the time Daqiang was here,

37
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,020
was quite lively.

38
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,980
Since my master left,

39
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,090
no one has been with me all day

40
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,460
for a long time like this.

41
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,290
I've only lived for 1,000 years.

42
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,300
But he has been locked up on his own in the Haotian Tower

43
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,900
for tens of thousands of years.

44
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,100
He must be lonely.

45
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,660
The Haotian Tower is empty

46
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,420
with nothing.

47
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,300
There isn't even a blade of grass in the tower.

48
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,060
If he goes back this time,

49
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,780
I don't know how much longer he is going to be jailed alone?

50
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,140
A sinful immortal is a sinful immortal.

51
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,620
He deserves it.

52
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,940
Orchid, stop thinking about it.

53
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,300
But I think he is not bad.

54
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,020
We met and knew each other.

55
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,140
How could he...

56
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,620
Even if we're not friends,

57
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,579
he should at least say goodbye.

58
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,060
He just left saying nothing.

59
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,570
Forget it.

60
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,140
It's a good thing after all.

61
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,220
I'm not used to it yet.

62
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,220
Can you chat with me?

63
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,140
No, Orchid.

64
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,300
It's almost 1 p.m.

65
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,420
We're going to sleep.

66
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,500
No, no.

67
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,100
Can you chat with me?

68
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,500
I'm alone again.

69
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,580
Daqiang, didn't you leave?

70
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,900
Where have you been?

71
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,420
I couldn't find you anywhere.

72
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,620
This is morning dew.

73
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,980
You disappeared for the whole morning

74
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,060
just to collect the morning dew?

75
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,620
Yes.

76
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,930
The morning dew is rootless water.

77
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,140
It's good for your primordial spirit of grass and wood.

78
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,380
From now on, I will collect it for you.

79
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,700
Daqiang, let me ask you a question.

80
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,060
Why are you so nice to me?

81
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,460
Cut the crap. Drink it.

82
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,100
The morning dew is too cold

83
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,860
with the chill of the night.

84
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,060
I can't drink it.

85
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,260
What do you want then?

86
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,980
I'm not being picky.

87
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,900
You know

88
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,500
my immortal root is burned.

89
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,100
So my body is afraid of cold.

90
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,500
I used to drink

91
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,780
heated water.

92
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:02,860
Here.

93
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,460
It's too hot.

94
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,580
I can't drink it.

95
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,820
I can't.

96
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,380
It shouldn't be cold or hot.

97
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,500
What do you want?

98
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,260
It's not cold or hot now.

99
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,780
You can drink it, right?

100
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,530
Wait.

101
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,060
You made efforts to collect this water.

102
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,700
I can't just drink it

103
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,980
directly.

104
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,140
What?

105
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,340
Do you want to play the gong and the drum

106
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,500
and get changed?

107
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,740
The water looks tasteless.

108
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,660
I'll get some honey.

109
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,170
Add it to the water and drink it.

110
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,860
Greetings, brother.

111
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,020
You recently fought here and there, have you ever heard of

112
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,220
the whereabouts of the fairy?

113
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,900
Brother,

114
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,540
I haven't heard of her.

115
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,260
It's been 30,000 years.

116
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,500
I'm afraid the fairy has already...

117
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,060
How is she?

118
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,700
She has already died.

119
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,130
The Xilan clan sealed the Evil God Tai Sui for generations.

120
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,580
If the fairy really had died,

121
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,740
Tai Sui would have broken through the restriction

122
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,260
and caused chaos to the three realms.

123
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,539
Tai Sui's story

124
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,500
is just a legend.

125
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,620
I'm afraid even you have never seen Tai Sui.

126
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,660
How can you be sure she is still alive?

127
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,540
How dare you!

128
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,860
The Xilan clan has guarded Tai Sui for generations.

129
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,180
They made great achievements.

130
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,780
How dare you talk nonsense?

131
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,540
I didn't mean to offend the fairy.

132
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,340
I also hope

133
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,300
I can find the fairy soon.

134
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,340
After that,

135
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,020
what will you do?

136
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,780
Of course, I will complete the engagement.

137
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,300
Do you really think

138
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,620
you've deceived the whole Shuiyuntian?

139
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,980
Why did you say that?

140
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,460
After you find the fairy,

141
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,100
you want to break off the engagement

142
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,300
and have an affair with the owner of this handkerchief,

143
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,530
right?

144
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,410
Brother, Changheng has nothing to do with

145
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,460
the owner of this handkerchief.

146
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,660
Please investigate.

147
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,020
Whether you have relations or not,

148
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,580
I will find it out.

149
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,660
But you ignored your destiny to marry with the fairy.

150
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,940
It is a fact.

151
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,340
Please calm down.

152
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,700
In the future,

153
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,260
I will remember the engagement with the fairy.

154
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,700
I will never be disloyal.

155
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,690
Considering your military merits,

156
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,410
I won't mention this matter.

157
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,700
But you'd better remember to

158
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,820
abide by the destiny.

159
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,060
Don't make any mistakes.

160
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,860
This is your duty.

161
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,620
I added

162
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,820
six kinds of herbs

163
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,660
and seven kinds of honey.

164
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,620
It's delicious.

165
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,060
Daqiang, do you want to try it?

166
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,500
I know.

167
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,580
I'll drink it myself.

168
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,930
Don't stare at me like that.

169
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,420
It's delicious.

170
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,180
Daqiang, is it enough?

171
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,300
No, finish it.

172
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,540
My Lord.

173
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,180
You stay here and protect her.

174
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,020
Don't make any mistakes.

175
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,620
I'll be back soon.

176
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,100
Yes.

177
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:45,270
[Five hundred years ago]

178
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,260
Have you always been bullied before?

179
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,300
Don't be afraid. I'll protect you from now on.

180
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,780
Protect me?

181
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,780
My power is weak,

182
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,820
but I'm good at running away.

183
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,620
If you are in danger,

184
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,260
I'll take you far away from here.

185
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,660
I used to protect others.

186
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,180
No one...

187
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,900
No one said he would protect me.

188
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,700
I don't need protection either.

189
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,980
No.

190
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,420
Everyone needs protection,

191
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,260
no matter who he is.

192
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,130
My brother taught me

193
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,660
don't show my weakness to others.

194
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,820
It's okay that no one has protected you before.

195
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,500
I'll be the first one.

196
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,340
Do you think I'm too weak?

197
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,540
Lord.

198
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,580
What's up?

199
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,580
Fairy Danyin asked me

200
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,180
to give this box of pastries to you.

201
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,340
She said she made it herself.

202
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,780
Did I tell you

203
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,900
not to accept gifts from them?

204
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,380
Yes.

205
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,900
But Fairy Danyin insisted that I must

206
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,580
take this box of cake...

207
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,580
Whose subordinate are you?

208
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,460
Who do you work for?

209
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,580
I know I was wrong.

210
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,530
Send it back tomorrow.

211
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,780
By the way,

212
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,100
tell her that she doesn't need to send gifts.

213
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:50,900
Yes.

214
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,340
Wait.

215
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,580
Take this away.

216
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,100
It's useless now.

217
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,580
Why are you back so late?

218
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,300
I left your dinner in the kitchen.

219
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,220
Go get it yourself.

220
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,180
I'm going to bed.

221
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,620
What are you doing?

222
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,620
Your room is really cold.

223
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,340
It's colder at night.

224
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,740
What is this?

225
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,970
The kindling of eternal fire.

226
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,500
Eternal fire?

227
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,660
Could it be the one written in the book?

228
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,740
It is said that it has been burning since ancient times

229
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,820
and will never go out.

230
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,460
That's right.

231
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,860
In the legendary,

232
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,500
eternal fire is from the magma of the Cangyan sea.

233
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,900
Where did you get it?

234
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,530
It's so warm.

235
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,100
Your true form is orchid,

236
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,820
which likes warmth and hates cold.

237
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,580
Warm room is good for you.

238
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,220
Did you

239
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,500
go to the magma of the Cangyan sea

240
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,620
because of me?

241
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,220
Why are you so reckless?

242
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,860
It's okay for me to feel cold.

243
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,340
Do you know how dangerous it is?

244
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,060
Even the Moon Tribe dare not approach it.

245
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,140
You are just a sinful immortal.

246
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,700
What if you lose your life?

247
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,100
Cut the crap.

248
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,900
For me,

249
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,100
it's so easy.

250
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,420
He loves me so much.

251
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,819
Why are you staring at me?

252
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,300
Daqiang.

253
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,500
There is someone I like.

254
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
I told you, right?

255
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,780
Didn't I tell you?

256
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,060
You can like anyone,

257
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,460
but you belong to me.

258
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,420
No. No.

259
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,260
Orchid.

260
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,940
You can't be bewitched by his sweet words.

261
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,820
Daqiang, you are so nice to me.

262
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,900
Why don't you...

263
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,290
You should...

264
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,580
Just say it.

265
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,980
You should confess your crime as early as possible.

266
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,140
Then get out of prison as soon as possible and live a new life.

267
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,410
Oh! I am

268
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,660
really bad at talking.

269
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,130
The Xilan holy grass

270
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,580
is born in the south of Xishan.

271
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,170
It's beautiful with the sunshine,

272
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,300
especially the sunshine from the rising sun.

273
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,540
The rising sun?

274
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,380
Does it mean the first sunshine in the morning?

275
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,060
I guess so.

276
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,540
I never thought

277
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,300
raising grass

278
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,180
is so troublesome.

279
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,780
My Lord,

280
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,540
please wait a little longer.

281
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,530
When she fixes the Destiny Book,

282
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,210
we will succeed.

283
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,340
I can do everything

284
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,220
in this world.

285
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,340
As for raising grass,

286
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,940
how can it be difficult for me?

287
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,140
You are great, my lord.

288
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,420
The Arbiter Hall faces north.

289
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,780
It's remote and dark.

290
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,100
There's not enough morning light.

291
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,860
I see.

292
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,220
No wonder that little flower spirit is so weak and useless.

293
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,180
Other plants can hardly become human.

294
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,860
Then I'll take her to the best place with abundant sunshine in the Shuiyuntian

295
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,220
to enjoy the sunshine.

296
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,500
Get up and come with me.

297
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,020
Daqiang, are you crazy?

298
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,300
It's not dawn yet.

299
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,690
Where are you taking me?

300
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,820
You'll know when you get there.

301
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,700
How long will you hold me?

302
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,220
Where is this place?

303
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,140
I've never been here.

304
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,460
You took me to fly for so long.

305
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,660
This place must be very high.

306
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,180
The highest place in Shuiyuntian is...

307
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,100
Yunzhong Water Pavilion.

308
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,620
Daqiang, you want to kill me?

309
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,780
Yunzhong Water Pavilion is the hall of Lord Yunzhong.

310
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,580
Even the Senior Immortal can't come without summon,

311
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,900
even the Senior Immortal can't come without summon.

312
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,700
let alone you and me.

313
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,540
Let's go.

314
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,770
Hurry up.

315
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,460
If you don't leave, I'll leave.

316
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,300
I'm doomed.

317
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,490
I'm doomed.

318
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,020
We seem to have been discovered.

319
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,060
Dear immortal soldiers,

320
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,500
please arrest me.

321
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
I know I'm sinful.

322
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,780
But we really didn't mean it.

323
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,900
Please.

324
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,540
Daqiang, what are you doing?

325
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,460
Kneel together.

326
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,700
Dear immortal soldiers,

327
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,940
or you catch me to

328
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,020
the Haotian Tower

329
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,460
for 300 to 500 years.

330
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,980
I really don't want to be banished to Shenshui Hall.

331
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,340
It's not easy for us to...

332
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,420
They...

333
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,380
What are they...

334
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:09,980
They...

335
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,090
Why are they ignoring us?

336
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,300
Hello?

337
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:18,860
Hello?

338
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,900
They can't hear us.

339
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,620
Are we...

340
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,340
We're invisible!

341
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,500
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

342
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,100
I almost thought

343
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,780
I will be banished to Shenshui Hall.

344
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,020
You scared me.

345
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:48,820
Follow me.

346
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,980
From the high place of Shuiyuntian,

347
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,620
the scenery is so beautiful.

348
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,180
Oh, my!

349
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,380
I've been there for a long time.

350
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,810
But I've never seen such a beautiful scenery.

351
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:18,940
No,

352
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,900
let's go, quickly.

353
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,780
Even if we can hide with invisible magic to avoid immortal soldiers,

354
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,860
when the Senior Immortal comes,

355
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,380
we'll still be discovered.

356
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:27,980
Hurry up.

357
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,340
As long as I want,

358
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,500
no Senior Immortal will

359
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,860
find us.

360
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,340
You're bragging.

361
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,580
Are you really so powerful?

362
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,700
Why are you still so unknown?

363
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,220
Why did I never hear of

364
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,820
Dongfang Qiang?

365
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,460
It is coming.

366
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,940
Coming?

367
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,260
What is coming?

368
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,300
The immortal soldiers

369
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,300
or Senior Immortal?

370
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,140
Sunrise.

371
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,300
You did this just to

372
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,020
take me to see the sunrise?

373
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,180
You are so lazy.

374
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,780
♫ Fall in love with your clear eyes ♫

375
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,210
You get up at noon every day.

376
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,940
Have you ever seen the rising sun before?

377
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:26,090
♫ It's the most unforgettable scenery along the way ♫

378
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,240
♫ No one can ever replace what we've been through ♫

379
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,060
No wonder your power is so weak

380
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,540
after your transformation a thousand years ago.

381
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,100
♫ It's as bright as the stars ♫

382
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,220
I told you

383
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,580
my power is weak because my immortal root is damaged.

384
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,300
♫ Every decision I make for you ♫

385
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,660
Besides,

386
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,660
the rising sun is the same as the sunset.

387
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:43,440
♫ The story goes on and on ♫

388
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,420
They are all red and round.

389
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,260
I've seen the sunset.

390
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,730
♫ Stories in the past play in my head ♫

391
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,980
It means I've seen the rising sun.

392
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,020
Nonsense.

393
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,660
Focus on your sunbathing.

394
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,660
♫ I will remember it to the end of my life ♫

395
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,940
♫ Don't think, don't miss, don't listen to it ♫

396
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,830
♫ No more ripples in my heart ♫

397
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:04,150
♫ The sky lights up, be together and apart ♫

398
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,330
♫ People come and go, it always changes ♫

399
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,620
So beautiful.

400
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,890
♫ Tramp over hill and dale to search for you ♫

401
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,300
Are you so happy?

402
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,720
♫ Act worthily of this life and our meeting ♫

403
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,460
Of course.

404
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,500
It's so beautiful.

405
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,820
I can never be here

406
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:20,790
♫ Act worthily of my trip to a sea of woes ♫

407
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,180
with my identity.

408
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,700
♫ Only in order to save you ♫

409
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,980
The fairy realm is so hypocritical.

410
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,380
The leopard cannot change his spots.

411
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,700
They talk about benevolence and morality.

412
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,700
♫ Blaze a way through brambles and thorns to search for you ♫

413
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,260
In fact, they are greedy and domineering

414
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,900
and they occupy the best place.

415
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,260
♫ Make light of traveling from afar for days with you ♫

416
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,300
But they

417
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,500
determine the class of others just because of their backgrounds.

418
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,180
Daqiang.

419
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:42,560
♫ I will never betray you even if I betray the world ♫

420
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,780
Thank you.

421
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,340
Cloud...

422
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,700
Look, it's cloud whales.

423
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:12,810
♫ Act worthily of my trip to a sea of woes ♫

424
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:17,470
♫ Only in order to save you ♫

425
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,630
♫ Blaze a way through brambles and thorns to search for you ♫

426
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:27,010
♫ Make light of traveling from afar for days with you ♫

427
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:34,550
♫ I will never betray you even if I betray the world ♫

428
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,660
These days,

429
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,090
I have been taking care of her and nurtured her according to details in the book.

430
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,380
I never make her tired.

431
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,130
I worked hard to collect  morning dew for her

432
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,380
and take her to bask.

433
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,900
But why hasn't her power

434
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,740
improved?

435
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,930
Why is this happening?

436
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,020
It hurts badly.

437
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,500
I nursed her according to the book.

438
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,540
Why is she getting worse?

439
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,340
I'm dying.

440
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,260
What did you eat today?

441
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,380
You stole it from my room.

442
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,460
I hid it for your own good.

443
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,140
Your true form is wood and it is afraid of fire.

444
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,780
How dare you take the medicine of extreme yang?

445
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,210
Aren't you afraid that you'll burn yourself to ashes?

446
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,540
Daqiang, I think I'm dying.

447
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,860
Am I going to die?

448
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,170
Yes.

449
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,420
I don't want to die yet.

450
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,260
Daqiang.

451
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,780
I find that although you have a bad temper,

452
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,820
and are sharp-tongued,

453
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,860
you are not bad in nature.

454
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,860
In the three realms,

455
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,740
nobody is worse than me.

456
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,260
You even strive for the worst people.

457
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,740
I am the worst one.

458
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,820
No need to strive for it.

459
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,970
Daqiang.

460
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,900
After I die,

461
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,540
you should confess your crime as early as possible.

462
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,620
Losing your freedom is better than losing your life.

463
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,020
There are some spirit stones in my drawer.

464
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,540
After I die,

465
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,380
you can take them away

466
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,020
and buy something you like

467
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,740
to the Haotian Tower.

468
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,180
You won't die if I'm here.

469
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,060
Don't comfort me.

470
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,020
Even if you die,

471
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,780
it's because of your own stupidity.

472
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,420
I have

473
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,420
expelled all the yang fire from your body.

474
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,620
It doesn't hurt anymore.

475
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,660
What's wrong?

476
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,940
Are you still feeling uncomfortable?

477
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,700
Much better.

478
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,930
Then why do you want to cry?

479
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,620
When I was sick,

480
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,900
my master would cook flower soup to let me drink.

481
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,500
I miss my master.

482
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,780
Stop thinking about it.

483
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,540
You feel sad, I feel sad, too.

484
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,100
Rest early.

485
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,220
How long will she be sad?

486
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,050
Master.

487
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,020
Master.

488
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,490
Here, my good disciple.

489
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:14,970
Open your mouth.

490
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,900
If the curse doesn't break,

491
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,100
I have to have the same feeling with her.

492
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,100
Daqiang.

493
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,620
Daqiang, what are you doing?

494
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,220
What are you doing?

495
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,620
Are you going to burn down the Arbiter Hall?

496
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,700
What are you doing?

497
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,050
Why did you cook on the rooftop?

498
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,860
Drink.

499
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,700
Is... Is this medicine you made for me?

500
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,540
This is the flower soup I cooked for you.

501
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,260
Flower soup.

502
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,300
Drink it.

503
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,140
Don't be sad and miss your master after drinking it.

504
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,930
Did you cook it

505
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,980
to make me happy?

506
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,420
Don't cry.

507
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,659
Daqiang, thank you.

508
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,300
You...

509
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,100
You are not sad anymore?

510
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,820
Then why are you crying?

511
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,540
People

512
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,290
cry when they are sad.

513
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,500
People also cry when they are happy

514
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,380
or excited.

515
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,860
There are many kinds of human feelings,

516
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,300
tears are different too.

517
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:59,420
Have you stayed in the Haotian Tower for a long time?

518
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,020
You even don't  know that?

519
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,660
Having emotional root is really troublesome.

520
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:06,780
You...

521
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,340
Cry less.

522
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,650
Drink it.

523
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,740
Is it good?

524
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,420
Yes.

525
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,860
Here's more.

526
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,390
I...

527
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,900
I'm full.

528
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,820
I'm so sleepy.

529
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,780
I'm going to bed.

530
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,420
Good night.

531
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,780
She finished it in one sip.

532
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,340
I am good at

533
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,860
practicing magic.

534
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,180
Do I also have

535
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,780
the talent for cooking?

536
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,890
This garden is connected with her primordial spirit.

537
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,260
The secret of nursing her

538
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,340
is not taking care of her body,

539
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,580
but her heart?

540
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,380
How can I make her happy?

541
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:38,250
