[Episode 32]

4
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,400
My lord is in a very dangerous situation now.

5
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,860
His primordial spirit is trapped in a dream.

6
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,500
A dream?

7
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,620
Yes.

8
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,260
This dream

9
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,860
was made by my lord with all his primordial spirit.

10
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,660
And, to maintain this dream,

11
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,300
my lord is burning his inner heat

12
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,300
and exhausting his primordial spirit.

13
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,139
If he continues like this,

14
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,270
he will probably...

15
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,440
He will probably what?

16
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,780
My lord will

17
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,820
probably

18
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,900
destroy his primordial spirit.

19
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,340
Then do something.

20
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,140
No.

21
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,550
My brother is immortal.

22
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,000
How could he be trapped by a dream?

23
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,020
What if he don't want to wake up?

24
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,790
What do you mean?

25
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,460
Brother.

26
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,660
Oh no.

27
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,560
My lord's primordial spirit is burning faster.

28
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,540
I...

29
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,260
You...

30
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,880
Give my primordial spirit to my lord.

31
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,560
Maybe it can delay for a while.

32
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,860
General, you can't.

33
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,740
If the spiritual power backfires,

34
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,860
you will die too.

35
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,700
My lord gave me my life.

36
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,820
Consider it as my return.

37
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,290
Me too.

38
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,540
Master.

39
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,260
What's wrong?

40
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,380
Rong Hao,

41
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,700
your sword intent is getting worse.

42
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,940
In the past,

43
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,380
your sword intent

44
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,130
always had a mortal heart.

45
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,020
But why is there more killing now?

46
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,270
Since you were seriously injured,

47
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,400
I've been full of resentment toward the Moon Tribe.

48
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,400
I want to destroy the Cangyan Sea.

49
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,980
Maybe that's why there is more killing

50
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,380
in the sword intent.

51
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,740
Rong Hao,

52
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,940
I told you that

53
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,380
as a warrior,

54
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,659
no matter what you have encountered,

55
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:48,860
or lost,

56
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,220
you must not be blinded by hatred.

57
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,140
Otherwise,

58
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,060
the war will never stop.

59
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,659
Got it.

60
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,540
Lord Changheng.

61
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,500
Right now,

62
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,630
Lord Yunzhong is taking the immortals

63
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,590
to the memorial tablet to mourn the fairy.

64
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,100
Aren't you going?

65
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,620
The fate you saw in the Tianji Mirror

66
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,820
hasn't come true yet.

67
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,600
Orchid will come back to life.

68
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,060
But...

69
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,780
Lord.

70
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,420
Danyin.

71
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,610
Thank you

72
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,420
for telling me everything

73
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,620
in the Tianji Mirror.

74
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,900
But Orchid

75
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,040
will come back to life.

76
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,940
Even if I must go to the heaven, enter the earth

77
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,580
and exhaust the three realms.

78
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,110
No matter what the price is,

79
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,760
I will definitely bring her back.

80
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,980
Why are all the Destiny Books

81
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,940
lovers who are separated from each other

82
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,420
and never see each other?

83
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,660
Look.

84
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,780
This one too.

85
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,700
This one too.

86
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,180
Yes.

87
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,450
Fortunately,

88
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,900
we'd better stay together

89
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,330
and never be apart.

90
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,260
Never be apart.

91
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,620
Big wood.

92
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,900
Promise me

93
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,740
you will never leave me, okay?

94
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,860
I promise you that

95
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,840
I will never leave you.

96
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,860
Your Highness. General.

97
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,700
His inner heat is getting stronger.

98
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,940
Retract your power,

99
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,380
or you will die.

100
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,850
General.

101
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,000
Your Highness!

102
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,100
General! Your Highness!

103
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,490
Retract your power!

104
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,200
Changheng.

105
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,740
The war between the two races has ended.

106
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,340
How dare you harm my brother?

107
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,610
Do you really think there's no one in the Moon Tribe?

108
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,740
I'm here to save him.

109
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,060
You...

110
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,780
You're an immortal.

111
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,180
Your Highness.

112
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,780
Dongfang Qingcang is dying.

113
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,440
I don't need to harm him again.

114
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,300
If you stop me and waste time,

115
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,530
he must die.

116
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,230
Your Highness.

117
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,390
It's important to save my lord now.

118
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,980
I will enter his dream to wake him up.

119
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,010
If he doesn't wake up

120
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,510
before the incense burns out,

121
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,440
there's nothing we can do.

122
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,300
Changheng.

123
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:34,980
You...

124
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,500
What did you see?

125
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,070
It's none of your business.

126
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,100
Get out of here!

127
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,340
Tell me.

128
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,940
What did you see in the Tianji Mirror?

129
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,420
I asked you to leave here.

130
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,420
Otherwise...

131
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,020
Dongfang Qingcang,

132
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,280
how long are you going to lie to yourself?

133
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,250
Everything is fake.

134
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,420
It's all a dream.

135
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,300
Nonsense.

136
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,440
You really didn't notice?

137
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,150
This is just a dream.

138
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,260
You don't want to accept that

139
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,420
Orchid is dead,

140
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,060
so you escape from reality

141
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,820
and hide in your dream

142
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,860
like a coward.

143
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,700
Shut up!

144
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,100
She can come back to life.

145
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,350
Didn't you see it in the Tianji Mirror?

146
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,450
This is foresee.

147
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,990
The foresee hasn't come true yet.

148
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,900
She won't die.

149
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,400
She will come back to life.

150
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,660
Dongfang Qingcang,

151
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,380
I need your help.

152
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,370
Only if you help me,

153
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,940
can we save her.

154
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,220
Go out with me.

155
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,580
As long as you walk out of the Arbiter Hall,

156
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,540
you will wake up.

157
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,340
Big wood.

158
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,470
Where are you going?

159
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,660
See?

160
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,940
Orchid is still alive.

161
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,220
She is my wife now.

162
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,580
Dongfang Qingcang.

163
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,740
She is not Orchid.

164
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,260
The real Orchid is dead.

165
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,670
But as long as you go out with me,

166
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,100
we can save her.

167
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,940
Don't listen to him. I'm not dead.

168
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,690
I'm still here.

169
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,700
Dongfang Qingcang.

170
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,620
Wake up!

171
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,980
She is not Orchid.

172
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,260
She is just your obsession, and she is bewitching you.

173
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,060
If you keep staying in the dream,

174
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,100
you will only die because your primordial spirit is exhausted.

175
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,820
Big wood.

176
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,110
We've been married for 500 years.

177
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,260
We've never

178
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,580
been apart.

179
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,220
Do you also suspect me?

180
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,590
The incense is burning.

181
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,460
All we can do now

182
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,820
is to wait.

183
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,230
Get lost!

184
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,650
He refuses to wake up.

185
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,580
Don't go.

186
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,820
Please.

187
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,690
Don't go.

188
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,820
Don't go anywhere.

189
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,420
Didn't you promise me

190
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,220
you would never leave me?

191
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,300
I promised you

192
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,620
I will never leave you.

193
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,100
My lord will never come back.

194
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,740
Your Highness. General.

195
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,360
Don't be so sad.

196
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,940
Brother, wake up.

197
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,870
My lord.

198
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,330
Dongfang Qingcang, wake up.

199
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,550
Do you hear me?

200
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,100
My lord.

201
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,020
My lord.

202
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,620
Wake up!

203
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,420
You must wake up, my lord.

204
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,660
Big wood.

205
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,180
Don't go.

206
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,220
Don't go.

207
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,660
Look at me.

208
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,220
I'm real.

209
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,220
Touch me.

210
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,060
Touch me.

211
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,540
I'm real.

212
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,420
I'm not a dream.

213
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,340
Wake up!

214
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,260
My lord.

215
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:15,980
My lord.

216
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,820
Brother.

217
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,540
My lord.

218
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,370
My lord.

219
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,140
Brother.

220
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,050
My lord.

221
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,890
I...

222
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,780
-Shangque.
-Shangque.

223
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,820
Calm down.

224
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,680
Your Highness.

225
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,380
Brother.

226
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,100
My lord.

227
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,340
I knew from the beginning

228
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,220
you were not real.

229
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,980
♫ Waiting for the moment when the sky collapses and the ground cracks ♫

230
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,420
I know it's just a dream.

231
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,520
♫ When it collapses and shatters, open your eyes ♫

232

♫ There is nowhere to put the soul but only to land ♫

233
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,540
So,

234
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,380
I'm leaving.

235
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,420
Don't go.

236
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,750
♫ If our souls get to know each other in the world ♫

237
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,020
Don't abandon me, okay?

we will never be apart.

291

Rong Hao.

292

Are you afraid?

293
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,420
Why are you here?

294
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,820
This place

295
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,940
was built when I was pure-minded.

296
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,380
It's my true love for my master.

297
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,460
You can't come in.

298
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,510
Really?

299
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,750
Let me tell you.

300
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,270
I did everything you asked me to do.

301
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,420
From now on,

302
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,340
don't disturb me and my master again.

303
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,300
You just need to answer me.

304
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,540
You...

305
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,420
Are you afraid?

306
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,540
Afraid?

307
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,780
What am I afraid of?

308
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,100
You should be afraid that she'll find out the truth.

309
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,300
But she will find out it sooner or later.

310
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,850
She will find out that her good disciple

311
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,180
has done all the bad things for her.

312
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,020
She was covered with sin and filth.

313
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,660
She can't be cleaned anymore.

314
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,100
No.

315
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,180
No.

316
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,060
No.

317
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,140
Master.

318
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,860
Rong Hao.

319
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,600
Are you having a nightmare again?

320
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,300
I just dreamed that you were leaving me.

321
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,990
You're talking like a child again.

322
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,700
Go to sleep.

323
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,710
What are you talking about?

324
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,060
I killed Orchid.

325
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,760
It was me.

326
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,220
I took her to the Xuanxu Realm.

327
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,280
I gave her the Chengying sword.

328
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,980
I saw her commit suicide.

329
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,830
What does it have to do with you?

330
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,540
But the Fairy Orchid

331
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,860
was killed by the Lord of Haishi City.

332
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,340
Weird.

333
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,620
I am drinking.

334
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,180
Why are you drunk?

335
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,360
Are you telling the truth?

336
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,980
Why would I lie to you?

337
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,920
She has never stepped out of the Silent Moon Palace.

338
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,140
Didn't Jieli take the fairy away?

339
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,900
She tricked me.

340
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,460
But I...

341
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,920
General, you can't drink.

342
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,110
You've just recovered from the butterfly poison,

343
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,510
and you've saved my lord.

344
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,310
Your primordial spirit is exhausted now.

345
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,540
You can't drink.

346
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,640
You should rest well.

347
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,120
Butterfly poison?

348
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,820
What butterfly poison?

349
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,060
Don't you know?

350
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,220
A few days ago,

351
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,730
when I was treating you,

352
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,610
I found a scar on your nape.

353
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,590
The Butterfly poison is very fierce.

354
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,740
Fortunately, it has been resolved.

355
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,700
So I never mentioned it again.

356
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,700
Jieli.

357
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,980
Where have you been?

358
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,910
I didn't mean it.

359
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,980
I...

360
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,760
Why did you take off my collar?

361
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,740
She knew it.

362
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,900
Did she detoxify my poison?

363
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,140
She saved me?

364
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,300
Impossible.

365
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,740
But she's from the Haishi City.

366
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,780
Bone Orchid's matter

367
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,820
is only possible for her.

368
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,500
Why?

369
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:53,660
Rong Hao.

370
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,150
What are you hiding from me?

371
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,900
Nothing.

372
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,620
What's wrong?

373
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,750
The music you played before

374
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,080
is the purest in the three realms.

375
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,410
But now, it's full of vicissitudes.

376
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,510
What have you been through?

377
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,570
Maybe

378
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,790
I've been

379
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,280
worrying about your injury these days.

380
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,360
So...

381
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,240
Liar.

382
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:24,560
Tell me.

383
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,620
What are you hiding?

384
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,260
I can't tell you.

385
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,230
Please stop asking.

386
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,680
You don't even listen to me?

387
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,440
I just don't want you

388
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,640
to remember the pain you've forgotten.

389
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,400
Master, didn't you say

390
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,290
you were tired of killing everywhere

391
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,550
and you want to back to the bamboo forest?

392
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,570
Now I have fulfilled it for you.

393
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,010
From now on,

394
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,610
you and I will live a good life

395
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,690
in the bamboo forest, isn't it okay?

396
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,490
Where am I?

397
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,800
This is home.

398
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,650
How could this happen?

399
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,670
Master, do you know

400
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,650
this sword is

401
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,440
30,000 years with one swing.

402
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,630
30,000 years?

403
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,940
What happened?

404
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,470
Young Master, you betrayed me.

405
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,640
I'll kill you!

406
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,860
You betrayed me!

407
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,670
Why are you doing this to me?

408
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,190
I love you.

409
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,740
Master.

410
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,210
Master.

411
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:08,970
Master.

412
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,540
Master, don't listen.

413
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,640
These are your painful memories for over a thousand lives.

414
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,030
I wanted you to forget,

415
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,370
but when the illusion ends,

416
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,130
it will appear again.

417
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,390
Master, don't listen.

418
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,990
Master! Master!

419
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:51,860
My bad disciple Rong Hao

420
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,580
has committed a heinous crime.

421
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,710
He is unforgivable.

422
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,060
I failed to discipline him well.

423
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,710
I should be punished as well.

424
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,180
Lord,

425
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,720
please send us to the fairy guillotine.

426
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,510
Give an explanation to the Fairy of Xishan,

427
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,250
the innocent Xishan clan

428
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,790
and all the living beings affected by the war

429
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,920
in the three realms.

430
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,810
It was

431
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,170
all my fault.

432
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,750
It has nothing to do with the first God of War.

433
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,380
Shut up!

434
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,480
The fairy was dead.

435
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,420
We can't lose the God of War again.

436
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,230
Now,

437
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,290
the two races have stopped fighting,

438
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,860
but the 100,000 enemy soldiers have been out.

439
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,510
I hope the God of War

440
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,850
put the overall situation first.

441
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,490
Bear the responsibility

442
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,010
and continue to protect Shuiyuntian.

443
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,790
God of War.

444
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,070
Please rise.

445
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,880
As for the sinful immortal, Rong Hao,

446
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,280
take him to karma jail and wait for his punishment.

447
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,150
You can't die yet.

448
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,280
You're useful again.

449
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,250
As expected, lord, you are here.

450
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,260
Where is my daughter?

451
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,080
Didn't you ask me here

452
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,470
to give me back

453
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,260
my another daughter?

454
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:02,730
Yes.

455
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,070
But

456
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,670
I have a condition.

457
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,980
I have let Rong Hao go once,

458
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,330
and I have also repaid his kindness.

459
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,760
We are even now.

460
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,290
Give me back my daughter.

461
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,640
How can

462
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,200
such a great kindness be canceled?

463
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,390
If you don't save him,

464
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,610
I'm afraid

465
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,450
you'll never see your daughter again.

466
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,160
As the God of Shuiyuntian,

467
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,760
how can I let you control me?

468
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,020
Today,

469
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,030
I will kill you.

470
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,800
Only I can cure her poison.

471
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,480
If you kill me,

472
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,460
she won't live.

473
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,080
Save the lord for me.

474
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,530
Look.

475
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,170
I gave her back to you alive.

476
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,070
Her mother died for you.

477
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,670
Do you still want to see your daughter

478
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,020
die in front of you?

479
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,680
Father.

480
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,910
She is your daughter.

481
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,680
Am I not your only daughter?

482
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,530
So we are sisters.

483
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,850
Don't touch me.

484
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,810
No wonder I felt cordial

485
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,870
when I saw you in Lucheng City before.

486
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,050
Father said

487
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,850
you were born fifteen minutes earlier than me.

488
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:43,850
You are my sister.

489
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,560
Father.

490
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,980
Didn't you tell me that

491
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,180
my mother is a mortal?

492
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,550
This Moon Tribe is full of nonsense.

493
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,810
Take her to karma jail

494
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,670
and lock her up.

495
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,040
She...

496
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:08,260
[Destruction of Heaven]

497
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,130
The Destruction of Heaven

498
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,830
have an Arbiter Hall.

499
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,110
Is Arbiter really inside?

500
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,550
1000 years ago,

501
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,490
the Arbiter released the guilty dragon Changyuan

502
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,920
and married him.

503
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,840
They violated the heaven rules.

504
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,950
My brother imprisoned the two of them here forever

505
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,170
to promote justice.

506
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,400
Few people know this secret.

507
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:37,700
Even Orchid thought

508
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,930
her master was just fond of the outside world

509
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,130
and was away on a trip.

510
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,100
But you lied to her.

511
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,480
The Destruction of Heaven is beyond the three realms.

512
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,740
Where karma is silent,

513
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,970
there is no exit for living beings,

514
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,480
and only the star river is always there.

515
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,360
Even I don't know

516
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,160
if Arbiter is still alive or not.

517
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,980
I didn't tell Orchid

518
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,390
because I don't want her to be sad.

519
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,180
If she doesn't know,

520
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,040
there's still a hope.

521
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,680
Orchid once told me that

522
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,400
her master had a soul-painting pen.

523
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,680
It can draw everything in the three realms

524
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,410
and make everything come true.

525
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,410
The Arbiter Hall

526
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,470
should be drawn by her.

527
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,150
She drew it?

528
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,310
Then the fireflies that guided us

529
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,700
and the boat that crossed us

530
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,960
were all drawn by her?

531
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,940
Also,

532
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,380
the flower cakes on the boat

533
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,830
are the same as the ones

534
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,950
by Orchid made for me.

535
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,610
She knows.

536
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,230
She knows everything.

537
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,800
It seems that

538
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,350
the Arbiter knows you're coming.

539
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,450
The fireflies are the token you gave to Orchid.

540
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,340
Arbiter knew you would come.

541
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,670
Let's go.

542
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,640
You are coming.

543
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,680
You are Arbiter?

544
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,980
[Changyuan]

545
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,150
Changyuan.

546
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,719
[Lord Arbiter]

547
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,469
Beat him up!

548
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,360
You are the Moon Supreme,

549
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,350
why didn't you hide?

550
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,790
It was my fault.

551
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,770
A slap is nothing.

552
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,120
As long as I can resurrect her,

553
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,180
even let me give up my life and so what?

554
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,760
The future is ever-changing.

555
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,700
There is still a chance in a desperate situation.

556
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,430
If you can have this awareness,

557
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,390
Orchid

558
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,040
will have a chance to be resurrected.

559
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,730
Please enlighten me.

560
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,000
This opportunity

561
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,560
had been planted

562
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,310
when you guys first met.

563
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,440
The first time

564
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,790
when we met.

565
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,660
At the Haotian Tower,

566
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,240
she used her fairy power

567
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,590
to gather your primordial spirit.

568
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,350
So she has been saving me

569
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,410
when we first met.

570
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,190
But I've been hurting her.

571
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,930
What's the use

572
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,030
of you saying this now?

573
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,550
Fortunately,

574
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,320
Orchid still has a ray of primordial spirit

575
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,850
in your primordial spirit.

576
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,020
To resurrect her,

577
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,960
we need to peel off her primordial spirit,

578
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,850
put it in the Holy Land of Xilan

579
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,170
and wait for her transformation.

580
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:00,640
All right.

581
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:03,240
Go.

582
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,930
One more thing.

583
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,150
Please enlighten me.

584
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,730
Go ahead.

585
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:15,250
Dongfang Qingcang and Fairy Danyin

586
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,550
once saw

587
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,840
the scene of

588
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,850
Orchid and I getting married

589
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,370
by the Memory Loss River.

590
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,590
I've been there so many times,

591
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,850
but I've never seen it.

592
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,190
There's nothing in the Tianji Mirror.

593
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,690
Everything in the mirror

594
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,770
is a prophercy.

595
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,210
Those who can see the prophercy

596
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,220
can definitely

597
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,750
make this marriage happen.

598
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,670
Can the future in the Tianji Mirror

599
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,060
not be changed?

600
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:47,720
No.

601
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,490
It can't be changed.

602
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,660
Changheng.

603
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,430
Next time you come,

604
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,850
remember to bring some more good wine.

605
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,370
Thank you, Arbiter.

606
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:13,880
You...

607
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,350
Come here.

608
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,430
Take this.

609
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,230
The Destiny Book.

610
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,970
This is Orchid's Destiny Book.

611
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,610
Don't be silly.

612
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,560
You're not ordinary at all.

613
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:00,460
Even if I put you in 100,000 orchids,

614
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,010
I can

615
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,540
find you at once.

616
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:20,280
