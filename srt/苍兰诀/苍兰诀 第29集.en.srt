[Episode 29]

4
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,060
Orchid.

5
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,539
My lord.

6
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,140
Didn't you already drink Fairy Orchid's

7
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,740
Dream of the Nine Mysteries?

8
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,620
Why are you still in pain?

9
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,940
Since we decided to be a couple,

10
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,700
we must live and die together,

11
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,400
share the honor and disgrace.

12
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,940
Even though

13
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,100
I can't take it for her,

14
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,180
how can I let her suffer alone?

15
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,140
My lord.

16
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,540
My lord.

17
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,780
My lord.

18
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:20,980
My lord.

19
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,190
Where is she?

20
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,940
Where is the Fairy woman?

21
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,980
Come out!

22
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,140
Come out!

23
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,220
Let her out!

24
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,980
Your Highness.

25
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,150
Unless the tortured person

26
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,680
voluntarily gives up,

27
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,430
the punishment cannot be stopped.

28
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:03,980
Give up!

29
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,900
You can't hold on anymore.

30
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,630
Come out now!

31
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,620
Answer me!

32
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,020
She has no more strength to speak.

33
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,260
Open the sarcophagus now.

34
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,460
Fairy Orchid.

35
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,100
I'll count to ten.

36
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,470
If you don't give up,

37
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,779
knock twice on the sarcophagus.

38
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:23,900
One.

39
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:25,780
Two.

40
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,740
It's beautiful.

41
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,200
What are you doing?

42
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:34,030
♫ Hold a light wind and leave it in moon's reflection in water ♫

43
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:40,990
♫ Who hides himself in memory and refuses to leave ♫

44
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,540
Three.

45

♫ Pick up a dream while the moon is hazy ♫

46
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,250
Four.

47
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,820
Five.

48
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,700
Six.

49
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,290
Seven.

50
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:55,150
♫ Before he wakes up, there is an end ♫

51
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,020
Eight.

52
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,740
Nine.

53
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,700
Look.

54
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,760
It's a cloud whale.

55
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,310
♫ She's seen the mountains that cover everything ♫

56
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,980
♫ Snow tinted with red ♫

57

♫ She crossed the day and the night, brushing against the fallen star ♫

00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,780
♫ Seeking the unseen leaves ♫

59

♫ She survived the long winter to meet you ♫

60

♫ Loneliness is entangled into a red thread ♫

61
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,330
♫ She was so drunk that the past came to her mind ♫

♫ Whose face is it? ♫

63

My lord.

65
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,659
My lord.

66
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,460
Get up.

67
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:55,500
♫ Pick up a dream while the moon is hazy ♫

68

♫ Who hides himself in memory and refuses to leave ♫

♫ She survived the long winter to meet you ♫

♫ A trip to the world is like a flash in the pan ♫

♫ She hid half a piece of jade in her hand when boating on the Memory Loss River ♫

78
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,940
The three-day sentence is up.

79

♫ Drink a bowl of the old days ♫

80
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,280
Open up the casket.

81
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,140
Greetings to Moon Queen.

82
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,300
Greetings to Moon Queen.

83
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,580
Greetings to Moon Queen.

84
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,570
Greetings to Moon Queen.

85
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,580
Greetings to Moon Queen.

86
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,380
Greetings to Moon Queen.

87
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,380
Greetings to Moon Queen.

88
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,860
Greetings to Moon Queen.

89
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,900
Greetings to Moon Queen.

90
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,140
Greetings to Moon Queen.

91
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,500
Greetings to Moon Queen.

92
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,820
Greetings to Moon Queen.

93
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:16,970
Your Majesty.

94
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,140
As the War God of Shuiyuntian,

95
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,740
the sinful immortal Changheng

96
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,820
has disregarded his duties,

97
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,180
disobeyed heaven's rules,

98
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,300
broken the marriage contract

99
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,700
and connected with a spy,

100
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,180
who, however, refuses to admit his guilt.

101
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,580
The law will not allow it.

102
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,750
He should be sent to the Fairy Guillotine immediately.

103
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:39,820
Wait.

104
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,660
After all, Changheng is the son of our father, Lord Dong.

105
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,020
Before execution,

106
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,480
I need to give an explanation.

107
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,780
From now on,

108
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,540
Changheng will be stripped of his immortal position

109
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,820
and be deposed.

110
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,390
You're no longer the son of our father, Lord Dong.

111
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,660
You'll have no clan, no surname

112
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,700
and will not be worshipped after death,

113
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,470
or be included in the Heavenly Tablet.

114
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,340
Your name will be removed forever

115
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,270
from the genealogy of the immortals in Shuiyuntian,

116
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,420
just like your mother who deserted the battle.

117
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,640
The fault lies with me.

118
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,640
Lord Changheng is not guilty.

119
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,190
Danyin.

120
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,100
Get down.

121
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,300
Orchid is the Goddess of Xishan

122
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,430
who has been missing for 30,000 years.

123
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,740
Xilan Sacred Seal

124
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,360
purifies the evil spirit.

125
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,240
She is indeed the Goddess.

126
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,860
Lord Changheng

127
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,460
went to Cangyan Sea many times to save Orchid.

128
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,780
It's not in disregard of heaven,

129
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,580
or out of lust for personal love.

130
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,020
It's because of the destined marriage.

131
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,580
Danyin knew Orchid was the Goddess of Xishan

132
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,460
long ago.

133
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,220
I once saw

134
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,220
Changheng and Orchid's wedding

135
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,180
two times

136
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,580
from the Tianji Mirror in the Arbiter Hall.

137
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,260
One was when they experienced the reincarnation in the mortal world.

138
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,520
The other was when Lord Changheng and the Goddess of Xishan

139
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,700
got married by the Memory Loss River

140
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,920
surrounded and blessed by the immortal beings.

141
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,180
The Tianji Mirror reveals destiny.

142
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,740
It never makes a mistake.

143
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,540
Orchid is the Goddess of Xishan.

144
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,830
Why did you wait till now to tell it?

145
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,880
I am in love with

146
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,530
Lord Changheng.

147
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,980
I didn't want him to find the Goddess

148
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,350
to fulfill the marriage contract.

149
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,780
So I hid it.

150
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,220
It's all because of my selfishness,

151
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,600
not caring about the overall situation,

152
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,570
and disobeying the heavenly order,

153
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,040
which has led to a big mistake.

154
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,080
Please, Your Majesty.

155
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,020
Spare Lord Changheng.

156
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,400
The one who should go to the fairy guillotine

157
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,940
is me.

158
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,240
Danyin.

159
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,060
Get up.

160
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,390
Lord Changheng.

161
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,340
I'm sorry.

162
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,780
You're not wrong.

163
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,900
What Changheng said is true.

164
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:43,290
Fairy Danyin has found the Goddess.

165
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,500
She has made up for her mistake.

166
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,070
The Goddess of Xishan has been guarding the evil gods

167
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,350
for the three realms for generations.

168
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,300
Changheng risked his life many times

169
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,860
to save the Goddess.

170
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,700
It was a righteous act.

171
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,900
Fate and heaven rules

172
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,500
are indeed unfathomable.

173
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,140
Changheng is not guilty.

174
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,620
He should return to his position as God of War.

175
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,340
Welcome to the return of Changheng to the position of God of War!

176
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,470
Your Majesty.

177
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,870
This is the confession written by the sinful immortal Ronghao in prison.

178
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,320
According to Ronghao,

179
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,180
the Moon Tribe has rampantly invaded our borders

180
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,500
and slaughtered 3,000 of our immortal soldiers.

181
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,820
If this is not avenged,

182
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,700
how can the souls of the soldiers rest in peace?

183
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,460
Please send troops to the Cangyan Sea.

184
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,420
Avenge our clan.

185
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,140
Avenge our clan.

186
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,620
to avenge our clan.

187
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,190
Ronghao.

188
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,360
Why did you lie?

189
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,670
You're here.

190
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,580
Why did you blame the Moon Tribe

191
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,140
for the death of 3,000 soldiers

192
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,580
and start a war between immortals and Moon Tribe?

193
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,700
There's only plain tea in the prison.

194
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,300
Do you want to have a drink with me?

195
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,170
Answer me.

196
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,060
You already know the answer.

197
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,910
Why do you need to ask me?

198
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,190
Does it really matter why the 3,000 immortal soldiers were slaughtered

199
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,660
to your brother?

200
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,900
I just offered

201
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,859
a reason

202
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,099
he wanted.

203
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,580
It wouldn't do him any good

204
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,550
if he executes an unauthorized immortal like me.

205
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,220
But if

206
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,780
it was Dongfang Qingcang who killed 3,000 immortal soldiers,

207
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,980
he would be able to unite people in Shuiyuntian

208
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,380
under this excuse to dispatch troops.

209
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,940
Your Brother

210
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,550
can thus send troops

211
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,980
to the Cangyan Sea

212
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,140
and crush it from now on.

213
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,660
I won't let him win.

214
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,590
The Moon Tribe has suffered from

215
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,750
years of civil war.

216
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,330
Their army is weak.

217
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,420
But Dongfang Qingcang is very powerful.

218
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,190
He can manipulate hellfire,

219
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,130
whose power alone can defeat ten thousand troops.

220
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:09,890
So

221
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,730
if you, the God of War, don't go to the war,

222
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,710
your Brother

223
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,820
would absolutely not act rashly.

224
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,240
Is that so?

225
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,180
What's your point?

226
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,740
Dongfang Qingcang

227
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,880
can't no longer operate the hellfire.

228
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,550
What?

229
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,710
On the day of the Memory Loss River,

230
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,440
he was just seriously injured.

231
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,660
How can he not be able to operate the hellfire?

232
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,260
So whether you want to or not,

233
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,030
this war is going to happen.

234
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,530
And you

235
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,890
will definitely join it.

236
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,610
You're destined to fight too.

237
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,650
Because we are both the same.

238
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,190
I don't have a choice.

239
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,930
You don't have a choice either after all.

240
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,260
You don't have a choice?

241
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,800
You chose to conspire with my brother

242
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,140
to disturb the current situation

243
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,400
and stir up the biggest war in the three realms for tens of thousands of years.

244
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,040
Ronghao.

245
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,940
If you still think of me as a friend,

246
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,330
tell me

247
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,550
what you're hiding.

248
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,940
Is everything you've done

249
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,340
really just to resurrect the Former God of War?

250
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,510
Smart people don't always end up well.

251
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,810
Changheng.

252
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,430
I can lie to the world.

253
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,020
But I will never lie to you.

254
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,930
It might be good for you

255
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,070
not to know the reason.

256
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:01,440
Jieli.

257
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,860
I have things to do.

258
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,210
Why do you keep following me?

259
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,100
Then why are you avoiding me all the time?

260
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,690
I'm not.

261
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:07,530
Yes,

262
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,160
you are.

263
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,370
Every time I call you lately,

264
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,050
you're either busy

265
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,310
or you have to go to bed.

266
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,950
Even if we see each other, we can't talk long.

267
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,170
I feel that

268
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,570
we're becoming distant.

269
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,530
I really have something to do.

270
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,200
I have to look at wedding dress materials for Orchid.

271
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,880
I can't afford to be late.

272
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,430
Wait a minute.

273
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:26,890
Jieli.

274
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,590
I have something very important to say to you today.

275
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,930
What is this?

276
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,030
This is the key to my cellar.

277
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,280
I have all the money I've saved over the years in there.

278
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,680
And my future salary too.

279
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,160
It's all yours.

280
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,970
What's wrong with you?

281
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,700
Take it back.

282
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,870
Hear me out.

283
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:57,800
I know

284
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,790
I have very little money.

285
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,470
You may look down on that.

286
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,030
But I want you to understand today

287
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
I want to give you everything I have.

288
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,800
I want to give you all the good things in this world.

289
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,870
Because I, Shangque,

290
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,820
want to marry Jieli.

291
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,510
You don't have to be embarrassed.

292
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,860
I know I may not be able to achieve what you want.

293
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,970
But it'll be much easier for me to bear

294
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,720
if I spit it out today.

295
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,170
Your salary

296
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,700
can't even buy a nice house.

297
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,210
That's true.

298
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,320
But My lord has said

299
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,460
he's going to help me increase my salary.

300
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:51,980
You can never, ever afford a bride price

301
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,450
with your salary alone.

302
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,660
How can you marry me?

303
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,340
That's right.

304
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,990
So,

305
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,990
after we get married,

306
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,730
I'll go into business.

307
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,020
♫ Listen to you ♫

308
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,000
You'll be in charge of buying, running errands, helping out

309
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,600
and soliciting business.

310
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:15,410
♫ I'm not scared with you ♫

311
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,090
And I won't give you a cut anymore.

312
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,480
All profits will go to me.

313
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,100
♫ The moment when we encounter ♫

314
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,610
Black Dragon.

315
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:20,290
Do you hear me?

316
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,440
♫ It's like I've found a beam of light ♫

317
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,560
When we get married?

318
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,140
♫ It's laugh, it's tears, it's him ♫

319
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,940
Jieli.

320
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,990
♫ Portray with every stroke ♫

321
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,350
You've promised to marry me?

322
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,430
What else could I mean?

323
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,390
♫ The fate ♫

324
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,470
♫ Has kept us together ♫

325
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,260
-Watch out your strength. -Great.

326
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,260
You've promised to marry me?

327
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,220
♫ It's laugh, it's tears, it's him ♫

328
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,730
Put me down, Black Dragon!

329
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,800
♫ Everything is so unforgettable ♫

330
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,920
I'm fainting.

331
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,530
The big war is coming.

332
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,950
You've been preparing all night.

333
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,450
You must be exhausted.

334
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,280
It's you.

335
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,250
You once promised

336
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,410
to repay His Majesty for saving your family's life.

337
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,550
Now His Majesty is in trouble,

338
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,150
it's time for you to fulfill your promise and repay his kindness.

339
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,470
I did make a promise.

340
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,840
But it was made to the unauthorized immortal Ronghao,

341
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,280
not Lord of Haishi City.

342
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,780
Not only will I not help the evildoer,

343
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,380
but I shall also capture you, the evil of Haishi City.

344
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,960
I've already destroyed it with my own hands.

345
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,560
How did it end up in your hands?

346
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,790
Could it be…

347
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,070
Both the immortal world and the Moon Tribe

348
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,730
can't even accommodate them.

349
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,800
Now, we can only

350
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,030
make one an immortal

351
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,460
and the other

352
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,580
a member of the Moon tribe.

353
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,140
After that night,

354
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,680
I've been searching for Xing Luo.

355
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,970
But I never heard from her.

356
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,330
It was you…

357
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,230
It was you who hid Xing Luo

358
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,960
and the other daughter of mine.

359
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,010
Your wife was frightened in childbirth

360
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,100
and became weak.

361
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,420
She died on the way to escape.

362
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,840
It was His Majesty who took the child away and raised her.

363
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,630
Now you have the whereabouts of your daughter,

364
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,940
you should be happy.

365
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,960
You…

366
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,330
You've lied to me for so many years!

367
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,230
What does he want me to do?

368
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,880
This should not be a difficult task for you.

369
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,020
Bring His Majesty out of the Karma Jail.

370
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,030
Greetings, Moon Queen.

371
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,920
Greetings to Moon Queen.

372
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,980
Greetings, Moon Queen.

373
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,330
You guys get up first.

374
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,860
Shangque.

375
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,590
Greetings, Moon Queen.

376
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,300
Shangque, why are you doing this too?

377
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,690
Get up.

378
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,960
Shangque.

379
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,100
Get up, do you hear me?

380
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,540
Get up.

381
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,470
Yes, Moon Queen.

382
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,180
And them too.

383
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,640
You guys go down first.

384
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:19,880
Fairy.

385
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,220
Have you seen Jieli?

386
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,680
She just went out.

387
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,450
Okay.

388
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,440
Then, fairy, get some rest.

389
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,750
Wait a minute.

390
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,270
Do you have the feeling

391
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,170
that Jieli has been acting strange lately?

392
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,030
Now that you mention it,

393
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,910
I think

394
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,360
she treated me to sugar cakes yesterday

395
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,670
and paid for it.

396
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,250
And

397
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,350
on the day of the Mountain and Moon Festival,

398
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,950
she gave me 50% of the spirit stones she earned.

399
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,580
So it wasn't my imagination.

400
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,520
Look.

401
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,080
This is the dowry she gave me.

402
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,630
For nothing. Free.

403
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:12,810
And she said

404
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,910
I'm free of all my previous debts.

405
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,700
That's so nice of her.

406
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:18,860
Fairy.

407
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,310
Do you know what the strangest thing is?

408
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,700
It's…

409
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,630
I asked her to marry me.

410
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,010
She said yes.

411
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,810
But she didn't even accept my bride price.

412
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,850
Really?

413
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,140
Shangque.

414
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,240
Do you think Jieli is possessed?

415
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,710
Possessed?

416
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,220
With My lord here,

417
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,400
no evil thing

418
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,950
dares to haunt the Silent Moon Palace.

419
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,980
That's right.

420
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,910
I get it.

421
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,800
Jieli grew up

422
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,280
alone in the Haishi City

423
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,870
with no one to turn to.

424
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,220
She's suffered so much.

425
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,860
Only lots of money

426
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,720
can bring her a sense of security.

427
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,920
So before

428
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,480
she had to calculate every single penny.

429
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,790
But now it's different.

430
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,660
She has someone she loves

431
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,410
and a good friend like me.

432
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,700
From now on, Silent Moon Palace will be her home.

433
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,610
Now that the situation is different,

434
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,170
the way she feels is also different.

435
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,700
Naturally, she can change.

436
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,120
Then...

437
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,190
I must treat her better than ever.

438
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,690
Of course.

439
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,420
If you dare to treat Jieli badly,

440
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,280
I'll be the first to hunt you down.

441
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,570
I won't.

442
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,260
Look, the hairpin Jieli gave me.

443
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,780
Isn't it beautiful?

444
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,300
It is.

445
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,490
Your Highness.

446
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,490
How are you?

447
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,770
How dare you come here?

448
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,790
Your Highness, don't you want to know

449
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,650
why the Moon Supreme's hellfire is not recovering?

450
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,330
Fairy.

451
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,180
My lord invites you to a banquet.

452
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,380
The time is almost up.

453
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,590
Greetings, My lord.

454
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,220
Orchid.

455
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,790
Here comes my sweety.

456
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,540
What's wrong with you?

457
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,090
Sweety...

458
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,290
You've kept me waiting.

459
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,530
You are not Orchid.

460
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,040
Who are you?

461
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,130
Brother.

462
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,670
Xunfeng has something important to report.

463
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,340
Your Highness.

464
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,470
My lord says he doesn't want to see you.

465
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,170
Greetings, Brother.

466
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,870
Greetings to Moon Queen.

467
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,710
Why?

468
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,500
Why are you always bothering us?

469
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,180
My lord.

470
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,920
Why is it becoming like this?

471
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,520
This Bone Orchid is made of my blood.

472
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,620
If she is not deeply in love with me,

473
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,580
it'll just be an ordinary protection device.

474
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,040
But if she is

475
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,180
devoted to me,

476
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,620
the Bone Orchid can no longer be taken away.

477
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,760
If I were to take it by force,

478
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,100
it will hurt her life.

479
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,620
I can't believe Fairy is already so in love with you, My lord.

480
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,730
The spirit of the Chidi woman is still alive,

481
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,130
right in the Bone Orchid.

482
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,410
Brother.

483
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,140
We'll be able to welcome back

484
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,600
the 100,000 soldiers from the Xuanxu Realm.

485
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,900
But Brother...

486
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,810
Why don't you pick the Bone Orchid?

487
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,870
Do you think I don't want to pick it?

488
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,550
The fragmented spirit of the Chidi woman

489
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,690
is feeding on her spirit power through the Bone Orchid.

490
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,460
If I don't take it off,

491
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,930
in less than ten days

492
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,040
when the Chidi woman's spirit is restored,

493
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,700
she will die of exhaustion.

494
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,040
What…

495
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,410
Does this mean

496
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,890
that Moon Queen won't live long?

497
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,640
If her life is not preserved,

498
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,550
then My lord, your life will also…

499
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,460
Brother.

500
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,560
I have a way.

501
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,660
The last fragment of Chengying Sword

502
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,520
has been found.

503
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,690
The sword has been recast.

504
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,330
How can it be?

505
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,190
The Moon Queen has a deep love for you.

506
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,200
She will definitely kill herself with Chengying Sword

507
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,420
to save your life.

508
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,020
Give me the Chengying Sword!

509
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,760
Do you want to destroy it?

510
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,490
Hand it over.

511
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,930
I cannot do it.

512
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,650
You are the last hope of the Moon Tribe.

513
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,950
Your life must not be compromised.

514
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,000
Hand it over!

515
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,840
Brother!

516
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,810
Only by obtaining the spirit of the Chidi woman

517
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,800
can we save the 100,000 soldiers in Xuanxu Realm.

518
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,750
We've already failed once.

519
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,830
We can't fail the second time!

520
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,400
Today, a spy reported

521
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,760
that Shuiyuntian has already raised troops,

522
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,560
ready to start a full-scale war.

523
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,170
If the 100,000 soldiers can't return,

524
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:00,120
the Moon tribe will face the disaster of annihilation.

525
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,920
Moon Supreme.

526
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,650
If I could die to protect you,

527
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,100
I would go through the hell.

528
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,610
If Orchid is to be the Moon Queen,

529
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,630
she should have the stronger sense to sacrifice herself.

530
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,980
That's what I call a graceful death.

531
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,730
Shut up!

532
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,500
I will never sacrifice her.

533
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,460
I will think of another way.

534
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,030
No wonder.

535
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,960
No wonder our father had to

536
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,929
make you free of love with his life.

537
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:40,900
Please be careful of what you say, Your Highness.

538
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,960
If I had known this,

539
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,449
I should have died under your sword of hellfire.

540
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,290
It's better than seeing you

541
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,350
become trash who can't tell a priority.

542
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,210
Your Highness.

543
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,160
Dongfang Qingcang.

544
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,280
Take your time to think about your strategy here.

545
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,780
I, Xunfeng, will leave.

546
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,970
I almost forgot.

547
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,990
I've already found out

548
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,460
your hellfire

549
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,460
was cultivated with the end of love.

550
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,360
Now that you're addicted to love,

551
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,690
the love tree restored,

552
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,580
the hellfire naturally would disappear.

553
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,160
The current you

554
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,290
is no longer the supreme admired by the three realms

555
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,340
and worshipped by all.

556
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:40,830
My lord.

557
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,660
His Highness Xunfeng was just being impulsive.

558
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,190
He just said about hellfire

559
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,160
in the heat of the moment.

560
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,680
I've already guessed it.

561
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,180
I just don't want to face it.

562
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,170
I dare not imagine

563
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,420
how I should protect the people of Cangyan Sea

564
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,320
as well as her

565
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,140
without the hellfire.

566
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,540
Stupid Black Dragon.

567
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,200
Why is he still not showing up?

568
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,210
So annoying.

569
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,310
Greetings, pavilion master.

570
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,510
Where is the Goddess?

571
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,810
What you don't know is

572
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,060
Qingcang has recently made more men

573
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,990
protect Orchid.

574
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,540
I'm afraid that if I act rashly,

575
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,800
I would be exposed.

576
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,480
It will ruin the master's plan instead.

577
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,340
That's enough.

578
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,370
You've repeatedly excused yourself.

579
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:59,030
I'm afraid you've forgotten what it's like to be poisoned by the Heart Eroding Pill.

580
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,990
Pavilion master, please spare my life.

581
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,790
If you bring the Goddess out,

582
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,660
I'll completely cure you of the poison.

583
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,630
You would rather die?

584
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,200
What a sisterly love.

585
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,880
But I'd like to see

586
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,450
if you had to choose one person,

587
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,790
would you choose your friend

588
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,020
or would you choose your man?

589
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,350
What did you do to Shangque?

590
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,010
Where is he?

591
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,450
He was just poisoned by my butterfly poison.

592
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,220
Jieli.

593
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,170
Jieli.

594
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,930
Why are you here?

595
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,970
I'll give you the antidote to the Heart Eroding Pill for three more days.

596
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:10,970
After three days,

597
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,200
if you don't bring the Goddess out,

598
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,720
you and your man

599
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,960
will be poisoned together.

600
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,950
And

601
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,210
he will die more painfully than you.

602
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,170
Jieli.

603
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,220
Jieli.

604
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:47,790
Jieli.

605
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,370
Where have you been?

606
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,570
What took you so long?

607
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,400
I'm sorry.

608
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,980
I didn't mean to do it.

609
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,780
I just…

610
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,710
Why did you pick my collar?

611
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,440
A shoulder mole brings poverty for life.

612
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,360
I was checking if you have any luck in your life.

613
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,950
Nonsense.

614
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,790
What's wrong with you?

615
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,710
Why are your eyes swollen?

616
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,100
It's all because of you.

617
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,550
You took it so long here.

618
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,310
The sand blew into my eyes.

619
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,500
I'm sorry.

620
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,700
I'm late because

621
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,010
I just saw a candy store on the road.

622
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,880
I wanted to buy some for you.

623
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,260
But the candy wasn't ready yet.

624
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,360
So I waited there for a while.

625
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,330
Let me tell you.

626
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,770
This candy must be eaten while it's hot.

627
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,050
Why is it all broken?

628
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,120
It's nothing.

629
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,920
It tastes the same.

630
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,500
It's still sweet.

631
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,140
What's wrong with you?

632
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,560
Nothing.

633
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,160
I just feel like

634
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,110
I carried it carefully in my arms,

635
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,740
protecting it all the way.

636
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,000
But it's still broken.

637
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,030
It didn't feel like a good sign.

638
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,830
You said I was talking nonsense.

639
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,010
I think you're the one who's trapped in random thoughts.

640
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,130
Maybe it's just random thoughts.

641
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,690
But I really hope

642
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,220
My lord and the Fairy,

643
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,040
you and I

644
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,730
can all stay well

645
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,690
and lucky recently.

646
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,620
What's wrong with Orchid?

647
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,100
Nothing.

648
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,340
Bad Black Dragon.

649
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,750
You don't know how to lie.

650
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,830
You've been preoccupied for the past several days.

651
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,880
You even said

652
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,610
it didn't feel like a good sign.

653
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,480
I want to hear the truth.

654
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,300
Jieli.

655
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,260
I really can't tell you.

656
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,200
Don't ask.

657
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,340
Since you agreed to marry me,

658
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,730
I was so happy that I couldn't sleep the first couple of days.

659
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,860
But lately, I don't know what's wrong.

660
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,560
I always feel depressed.

661
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,340
Maybe this is all too pleasing.

662
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,010
It doesn't feel real.

663
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,060
What are you talking about?

664
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,430
Bad Black Dragon.

665
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,940
Are you regretting it?

666
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,500
Do you think I'm tight on money or spending too much money?

667
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,550
How could it be?

668
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,790
Maybe it's because that I feel like

669
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,150
I have to go to war at any time recently.

670
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm afraid that if I don't come back,

671
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,220
I won't be able to protect you.

672
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:29,950
Take it back.

673
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,760
What are you talking about?

674
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,010
Bad Black Dragon.

675
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,940
I'm telling you.

676
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,820
You must live in peace

677
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,040
until old age.

678
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,760
Do you hear me?

679
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,590
You promise me.

680
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,170
I'll keep you safe.

681
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,420
For the past 30,000 years,

682
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,630
the Moon Tribe has been torn apart

683
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,640
with no lead.

684
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,070
That's why Shuiyuntian could conquer the cities.

685
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,210
Now that My lord has come back,

686
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,710
the Moon Tribe has returned to unity

687
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,300
and people have been of one mind,

688
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,440
this is the time for us

689
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,700
to take revenge

690
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,880
and crush the immortal world.

691
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,790
Take revenge. Crush the immortal world.

692
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:39,400
Take revenge. Crush the immortal world.

693
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,070
But the previous plan to unseal the 100,000 soldiers

694
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,080
has failed.

695
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:47,970
Now facing the 200,000

696
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,730
raging army of the Fairies,

697
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,040
we are outnumbered.

698
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,490
I'm afraid we're in great danger.

699
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,450
In my opinion,

700
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,020
we should give up Silver Lake and retreat to Jiuyou.

701
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,760
What do you think, Brother?

702
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,370
Your Highness, what are you talking about?

703
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,540
You want to cede the land?

704
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,890
In the past 30,000 years,

705
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,820
haven't we lost enough territory?

706
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,690
Now that My lord has returned,

707
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,560
although we don't have enough troops,

708
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,690
every one of our warriors is brave enough to be worth ten.

709
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:29,520
And besides,

710
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,460
we still have My lord.

711
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,280
That's right.

712
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,660
My lord's hellfire

713
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,640
can fight against ten thousand armies.

714
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,440
We may not lose

715
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,780
in this battle.

716
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,170
But what if we lose?

717
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:42,250
The people of the Moon Tribe are not cowards.

718
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:43,740
If we lose,

719
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,140
we are willing to follow My lord

720
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:47,690
and die on the battlefield.

721
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,920
Kill the enemy! Wipe out our shame!

722
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:54,410
Kill the enemy! Wipe out our shame!

723
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,810
Kill the enemy! Wipe out our shame!

724
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:01,090
Kill the enemy! Wipe out our shame!

725
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,450
Kill the enemy! Wipe out our shame!

726
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:11,380
