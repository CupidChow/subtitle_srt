4
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,380
I have never loved you.

5
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,450
I don't believe it.

6
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:30,810
I don't believe it!

7
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,380
If you really lied to me,

8
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,140
why are you telling me this now?

9
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,700
You could have continued to lie to me

10
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,579
and let me know nothing.

11
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,780
I coaxed you

12
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,980
and swore to you

13
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,180
because you were still useful.

14
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,700
But now

15
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,220
I have a better choice.

16
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,470
So no matter the primordial spirit of Chidi Woman

17
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,580
or you,

18
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,020
they are useless.

19
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,970
Keep an eye on her.

20
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,780
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

21
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,260
Yes.

22
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,540
So you deliberately let Changheng

23
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,660
take her away.

24
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,579
Why did you do that?

25
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,020
Am I stupid?

26
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,480
Changheng will surely take her to Xishan to find her identity.

27
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,540
Besides,

28
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,660
I am the culprit who slaughtered the Xilan Clan.

29
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,380
No matter how benevolent she is,

30
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,340
the Xilan Clan consisted

31
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,580
of her parents and family.

32
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,630
With this hatred of slaughtering her people,

33
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,220
her love for me can be shaken, and

34
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,760
the Bone Orchid can be broken.

35
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,660
Then, she won't love me anymore.

36
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,459
This is the only way to save her life.

37
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,180
My Lord,

38
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,040
the Fairy Realm's army is about to reach Xuanxu.

39
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,740
Then, let them die here.

40
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,060
You made my brother suffer,

41
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,860
and yet you're crying here.

42
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,960
Where is your courage?

43
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,790
Where is your attitude?

44
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,260
If you hadn't helped him recover his emotional root and

45
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,060
caused him to lose the Hellfire,

46
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,060
he wouldn't have ended up like this.

47
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,620
Do you know what the evil spirit is?

48
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,500
Do you know how dangerous and scary it is?

49
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,960
Once he gets attacked,

50
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,560
his primordial spirit will gradually be corroded.

51
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,170
Only a walking corpse will be left behind.

52
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,880
Where is the Chengying sword?

53
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,659
What do you want to do?

54
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,560
Take me to Xuanxu Realm.

[Ancient Battlefield. Xuanxu Realm.]

56
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,900
If I kill myself with Chengying sword,

57
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,620
100,000 Moon Tribe's soldiers can go home?

58
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,620
Yes.

59
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,020
As long as I die,

60
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,220
he would be safe?

61
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,220
Yes.

62
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,660
Do you see it?

63
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,420
This is 200,000 elite soldiers of Shuiyuntian.

64
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,890
Even with the Moon Tribe's women and children on the battlefield,

65
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,220
you only have 80,000.

66
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,380
It's no different than breaking a rock with an egg.

This is the survival battle for your Moon Tribe.

Dongfang Qingcang,

69
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,420
are you still unwilling to face it?

70
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,660
I'm the only one who can change

71
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,590
all of this.

72

73

74

for you to ask this?

76
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,650
Yes.

77
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,860
It's too late.

78
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,340
I have no other choice.

79
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,260
I can tell you.

80
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,980
I'm the Evil God Tai Sui.

81
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,900
The oldest and strongest god in the three realms.

82

I can release the 100,000 elite soldiers for you

83

and make them invincible.

84

100,000 soldiers.

90
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,240
It doesn't matter.

91

Thirty thousand years.

103
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,860
I've been looking for you for 30,000 years.

104
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,960
I've searched every corner of the three realms.

105
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,270
I've waited too long

106
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,940
for this moment.

107
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,310
Orchid!

108
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,740
No. I can't die like this.

109
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,420
I can only be killed by Chengying sword.

110

This way, he can survive.

111

Everyone can survive.

on putting us in such situation?

Do I have a choice?

How can I choose?

I should go too.

248
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,580
Where are you going, Jieli?

249
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,140
Why are you working for the Lord of Haishi City?

250
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,470
They forced you, right?

251
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,740
No one forced me.

252
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,110
Impossible.

253
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,110
You and Fairy Orchid are best friends.

254
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,630
If no one forced you,

255
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,300
you wouldn't have done anything bad to her.

256
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,900
Because all those were fake.

257
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,780
Fake?

258
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,750
I don't understand.

259
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,940
What else do you not understand?

260
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,370
I've been loyal to Haishi City since the beginning.

261
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,340
I sneaked into Silent Moon Palace

262
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,500
to gain your trust.

263
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,620
This is all for the lord.

264
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,140
Impossible.

265
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,260
You must be lying to me again, right?

266
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,140
I'm not lying.

267
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:51,850
Jieli,

268
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,940
every time you lie to me,

269
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,140
you look serious.

270
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,700
I won't believe it this time.

271
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,500
Come.

272
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,760
Go back with me.

273
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,460
No matter what misunderstanding there is.

274
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:00,740
Let go of me!

275
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,700
Let go of me!

276
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,900
Stupid Black Dragon.

277
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,940
How long are you going to be this stupid?

278
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,740
People like me

279
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,740
would never treat anyone sincerely.

280
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,220
Didn't I tell you?

281
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,220
I have no heart.

282
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,900
I can lie to anyone.

283
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,020
I can say anything.

284
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,420
What sisters who share weal and woe?

285
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,340
I lied to you.

286
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,410
All these were fake.

287
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,010
You still don't understand?

288
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,340
What about me?

289
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,020
Did you lie to me...

290
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,390
About marrying me?

291
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:41,940
Of course.

292
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,190
I got close to you

293
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,630
and promised to marry you.

294
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,260
All these were to use you to get close to the Moon Supreme.

295
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,320
Now that my mission is accomplished,

296
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,000
I don't have to lie to you anymore.

297
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,780
Do you hate me?

298
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,460
Fine.

299
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,830
Then kill me.

300
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,260
You can't do it.

301
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,260
Stupid Black Dragon,

302
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,390
forget about me.

303
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,540
Bye.

304
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:36,740
Hao.

305
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,160
Master, you're awake.

306
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,300
Why don't you sleep more?

307
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,350
How long did I sleep?

308
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,500
About an hour.

309
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,350
Are you still tired?

310
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,700
An hour?

311
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,200
Why do I feel like I've been sleeping for a long time?

312
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,840
Maybe you haven't recovered yet.

313
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,300
You get tired easily.

314
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,700
Why don't I

315
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,880
take you back to

316
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,500
your room to have a good rest?

317
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,380
No.

318
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,260
I'm already dead.

319
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,550
How could...

320
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,900
Master, did you forget again?

321
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,830
You didn't die in

322
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:31,830
that Great War.

323
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,100
You were just seriously injured.

324
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,940
But later,

325
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,180
the Goddess of Xishan cured you.

326
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,540
Since then,

327
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,260
your primordial spirit was damaged.

328
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,900
And you have a hard time remembering things.

329
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,820
I've told you

330
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,300
about this

331
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,280
for seven to eight times already.

332
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,180
You're awake.

333
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,210
Or-Or-

334
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,100
Orchid.

335
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,040
You...

336
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,160
Aren't you...

337
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,860
What?

338
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,980
Wooden Head,

339
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:04,450
what's wrong?

340
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:06,860
Wooden Head.

341
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,390
Nothing.

342
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,500
I think I had a nightmare.

343
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,910
What nightmare?

344
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,910
Forget about it.

345
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,390
Wooden Head,

346
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,100
you're hurting me.

347
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,380
Wooden Head.

348
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,980
Let me hug you.

349
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:16,590
♫ Cut a gust of wind and shake it off in the water moon ♫

350
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:23,580
♫ Who hides himself in memory and refuses to leave ♫

351
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:30,800
♫ Pick up a dream while the moon is hazy ♫

352
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:37,860
♫ Before he wakes up, there is an end ♫

353
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,880
♫ She's seen the mountains that cover everything ♫

354
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,520
♫ Snow tinted with red ♫

355
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,570
♫ She crossed the day and the night, brushing against the fallen star ♫

356
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:52,270
♫ Seeking the unseen leaves ♫

357
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,950
♫ She survived the long winter to meet you ♫

358
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,730
♫ Loneliness is entangled into a red thread ♫

359
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:02,980
♫ She was so drunk that the past came to her mind ♫

360
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:08,570
♫ Whose face is it? ♫

361
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:38,030
♫ Pick up a light wind and leave it in moon's reflection in water ♫

362
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:45,040
♫ Who hides himself in memory and refuses to leave ♫

363
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:52,040
♫ Pick up a dream while the moon is hazy ♫

364
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:59,510
♫ Before he wakes up, there is an end ♫

365
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,730
Almost done. Almost done.

366
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:03,080
♫ She's seen the mountains that cover everything ♫

367
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,710
♫ Snow tinted with red ♫

368
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:09,460
♫ She crossed the day and the night, brushing against the fallen star ♫

369
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,270
Wooden Head,

370
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,020
we've been married for 500 years.

371
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,450
♫ Seeking the unseen leaves ♫

372
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,070
And you still can't draw them well?

373
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,180
So stupid.

374
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:17,170
♫ She held up the mirror and the moon, which vanished in a flash ♫

375
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,270
Are they not pretty?

376
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:20,110
♫ A trip to the world is like a flash in the pan ♫

377
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:24,180
♫ She hid half a piece of jade in her hand when boating on the Memory Loss River ♫

378
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:31,250
♫ Drink a bowl of the old days ♫

379
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:37,830
♫ Pick up a red flower and shake it off in the moon's reflection in water ♫

380
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:45,280
♫ I turned around and you're gone ♫

381
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:56,020
