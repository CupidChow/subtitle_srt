[Episode 17]

4
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,860
In fact, I don't know much about

5
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,390
my lord killing his father.

6
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,300
All I know is it has something to do with

7
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,100
the love-eradication forbidden theurgy

8
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,700
my lord has suffered from.

9
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,979
This theurgy is recorded in an ancient secret book

10
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:58,340
and is extremely difficult to perform.

11
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,870
So far, only my lord has succeeded in doing it.

12
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,740
An ancient secret book?

13
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,380
Where is it now?

14
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,040
Do you know?

15
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,900
Can you take me to see it?

16
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,960
I want to know what's written inside.

17
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,540
It's in the first Moon Supreme's chambers.

18
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,340
But

19
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,350
it has been burned to ashes.

20
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,860
Orchid. Orchid.

21
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,410
Fairy.

22
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,700
You really shouldn't go in.

23
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,930
My lord has said

24
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,860
the chambers of the first Moon Supreme are out of bounds.

25
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,320
No one is allowed to enter.

26
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,579
Otherwise

27
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:55,900
they would be branded, get their tongues pulled out

28
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,160
and tortured to death!

29
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,140
Orchid, do you hear me?

30
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,500
You must not go in.

31
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,900
Besides, Black Dragon has said

32
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,140
the secret book has been burned into ashes by the first Moon Supreme.

33
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,060
It's no use even if you find it.

34
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,860
Let's go back.

35
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,100
Jieli.

36
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,900
I must go.

37
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,180
What you don't know is

38
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,380
my lord has always been protective of you.

39
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,980
But this is a different case.

40
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,829
In the 38,000 years of serving my lord,

41
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,740
I've never seen

42
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,940
someone who angered my lord

43
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,940
for something regarding the first Moon Supreme

44
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,860
still survive.

45
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,360
The first Moon Supreme

46
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,060
is my lord's biggest concern.

47
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,070
That's one more reason for me to go then.

48
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,340
Orchid.

49
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,860
Since it's been a concern

50
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,590
for tens of thousands of years,

51
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,079
it must have been bothering him all the time.

52
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,060
I must find out the reason

53
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,140
and the right medicine

54
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,579
to relieve his concern,

55
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,360
so that he can sleep at night.

56
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,980
Orchid, come back now.

57
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,980
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

58
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,780
Aren't you always the timidest?

59
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,940
You guys go back.

60
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,140
Don't worry about me.

61
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,700
This is none of your business.

62
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,620
If Moon Supreme Lord is to hold someone accountable,

63
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,220
just say you haven't seen me.

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,460

68

I'll go with you.

69
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,070
This chamber is so big.

70
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,079
You won't be able to find it yourself.

71
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,760
I also want to share my lord's worries.

72
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,890
In that case, I'll die with no regrets.

73
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,340
Why are you both going crazy?

74
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,380
The Lord has always disliked me.

75
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,020
If they die,

76
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,250
I sure won't survive either.

77
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,940
Wait for me.

78
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,000
Wait for me.

79
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:12,680
Good.

80
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,220
My lord will surely love it.

81
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,230
How many hours have you spent

82
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,950
learning this song?

83
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,310
Father,

84
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,980

87

or are you just an instrument player that entertains people?

88
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,180
How could you waste your time like this?

89
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,860
I carved this ice zither for you with my own hands

90
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,550
as a congratulatory gift.

91
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,870
I don't need such a frivolous gift.

92

Who

93
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,080
taught him wood carving, zither playing

94
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,330
and played around with him?

95
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,290
Execute them all.

96

No!

Yes, it was.

00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,250
♫ When it collapses and shatters, open your eyes ♫

178
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:42,060
♫ There is nowhere to put the soul but only to land ♫

179
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,220
♫ If our souls get to know each other in the world ♫

180
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,770
Meet the new Moon Supreme.

181
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,960
♫ Watching the vows come and go ♫

182
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,050
♫ I can't bear the world without you ♫

183
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,930
Kill me.

184
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,500
♫ The last of love ♫

185
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,970
♫ The tenderness of fingers tangled ♫

186
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,640
♫ Turned into a sharp sword and stabbed at me ♫

187
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,890
♫ Farewell Love ♫

188
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,340
♫ Blurs time and distance ♫

189
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,610
♫ Even time is suspended ♫

190
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,030
♫ All because of you ♫

191
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:27,700
♫ Make sure you are the only one in my heart ♫

192
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,350
♫ It's too late to say goodbye ♫

193
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,590
♫ I can't speak the regret ♫

194
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,500
Meet the new Moon Supreme.

195
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,720
Meet the new Moon Supreme.

196
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,390
♫ Too late ♫

197
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:53,310
♫ Too late ♫

198
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,980
I never thought

199
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,510
it'd be so painful

200
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:08,230
♫ Farewell Love ♫

201
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,200
to remove love.

202
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,280
Orchid.

203
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,620
I understand now.

204
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,960
My lord has been in so much pain and irritable lately.

205
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,550
It must be because his Love Tree has come back to life again.

206
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,480
That reminds him of his childhood.

207
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,960
He will never forgive his father.

208
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:30,990
I don't understand

209
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,630
why a father would

210
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,650
treat his son like this.

211
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,710
Didn't he

212
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,700
love his child

213
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,460
at all?

214
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,060
He didn't seem to.

215
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,250
No wonder my lord hates him so much.

216
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,210
I don't believe it.

217
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,480
There must be more to it.

218
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,990
Orchid.

219
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,120
Orchid.

220
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,600
Wait!

221
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,570
Orchid, come on.

222
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,410
Are you done?

223
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,090
Why are you still not leaving?

224
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,620
Do you want to get us killed?

225
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,560
Orchid Fairy.

226
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,440
Forget it.

227
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,590
It's been more than 30,000 years.

228
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,220
I'm sure we can't find anything valuable.

229
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,160
And my lord and his father have such a deep grudge.

230
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,020
This is not something we can undo.

231
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,710
I found it.

232
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:04,430
[To Father, from Qingcang]

233
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,830
Look here.

234
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,730
A gift from Qingcang to Father.

235
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,590
This is a gift from Dongfang Qingcang to his father.

236
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:09,730
And here.

237
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,090
This zither was once split in half

238
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,020
and was carefully repaired again.

239
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,410
A zither that was no longer useful

240
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,210
was still placed in the closest cabinet to the bed.

241
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,330
Isn't this a sign of

242
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,330
how the father cherished this gift?

243
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,460
And this wooden ball.

244
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,410
It's a child's toy.

245
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,480
I've heard from the older people in the palace.

246
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,290
Dongfang Qingcang liked to play with wooden balls when he was a child.

247
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,820
But Xunfeng didn't like it.

248
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,080
The wooden ball was put together with the zither.

249
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,350
These children toys are still well kept.

250
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,830
Doesn't this also show that

251
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,800
the father loved his son very much?

252
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,150
It's a scroll

253
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,790
for the Moon Supreme's close attendant

254
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,890
to record his words and actions.

255
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,290
But it should have been in the treasury.

256
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,590
But the old Moon Supreme

257
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,990
hid it in the secret crevice of the chamber.

258
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,010
I think there must be a secret here.

259
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:17,890
Shangque.

260
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,810
In the middle of April,

261
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,970
the Lord tried out Hellfire Sword with Qingcang and Xunfeng.

262
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,830
Xunfeng was no match for Hellfire,

263
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,090
failing to wield the sword in an instant.

264
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,910
Qingcang wielded the sword with ease.

265
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,670
He's the best one among the Moon Tribes

266
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,190
in addition to Yannv.

267
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:43,970
And then?

268
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,780
The reason why the first Moon Supreme

269
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,130
took away “The Book of the Living”

270
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,390
was because he didn't want others to know

271
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,150
that Dongfang Qingcang

272
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,240
was the only person who could use the Hellfire Sword.

273
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,430
Dongfang Qingcang once told me

274
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,630
that anyone who wants to learn Hellfire

275
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,920
must first be gifted

276
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,410
and second, be removed from love.

277
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,330
In all three realms,

278
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,270
only Yannv and he were qualified.

279
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,850
Back then,

280
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,910
Yannv was betrayed by Chonghua from Shuiyuntian.

281
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,300
She then learned Hellfire after cutting off her love.

282
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,810
While Dongfang Qingcang was…

283
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,080
Even when he found out

284
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,210
that I was the only genius

285
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,360
who could master Hellfire,

286
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,620
he never smiled at me once.

287
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,810
He even looked at me and said,

288
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,790
"Why you?"

289
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,090
What's wrong with you?

290
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,840
I'm just feeling sad all of the sudden.

291
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,460
The moment the first Moon Supreme found out

292
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,380
that Dongfang Qingcang

293
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,480
could wield the Hellfire Sword,

294
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,690
he must have been very sad.

295
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,900
It was his most beloved son.

296
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,580
but he had to learn Hellfire,

297
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,430
remove love

298
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,780
and suffer every pain

299
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,510
to revitalize the Cangyan Sea.

300
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,900
That's why he looked at Dongfang Qingcang and said,

301
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,550
"Why you?"

302
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,910
Only he knew

303
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,590
what he was thinking.

304
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,990
You can only take a guess.

305
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,050
Only he knew.

306
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,530
Jieli.

307
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,840
You're so smart.

308
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,040
Orchid.

309
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,960
You said you're going to ask him in person.

310
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:56,940
You're not going to the bottom of the Memory Loss River, are you?

311
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,820
That's right.

312
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,870
When fairies and those of the Moon Tribe die,

313
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,810
their spirit will rest in the realm of

314
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:01,980
the Realm of Return to Ruin at the bottom of Memory Loss River.

315
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,910
I just have to go there

316
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,500
and find the spirit of the first Moon Supreme.

317
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,360
Then I can confront him in person.

318
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,500
But

319
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,400
the Ranxi flower that can awaken the spirit

320
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,920
has been extinct for tens of thousands of years.

321
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,470
You can do nothing

322
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,150
without it.

323
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,520
If it hadn't been extinct

324
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,910
and everyone uses it to go to the bottom of the Memory Loss River

325
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,710
to talk to their deceased loved ones,

326
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:29,030
the Memory Loss River would be livelier than the Haishi City.

327
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,330
Besides,

328
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,970
not to mention a living Ranxi Flower,

329
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,360
even if a withered one

330
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,000
is a valuable collection.

331
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,980
It's worth thousands of spirit stones.

332
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,190
A withered one.

333
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,460
Jieli.

334
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,690
Do you know where to find withered Ranxi Flowers?

335
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:44,650
What are you doing?

336
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,540
Just tell me if you know.

337
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,520
There's one in Silent Moon Palace.

338
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,250
When Xunfeng was the Moon Supreme,

339
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,510
he went around looking for a Ranxi flower

340
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,570
because he missed his father.

341
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,790
Someone presented him

342
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,340
a dead Ranxi flower.

343
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,530
It was placed in the Pavilion of Spiritual Treasures.

344
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,540
Let's go to the Pavilion of Spiritual Treasures and look for it.

345
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,070
Let's go.

346
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,350
Don't bother.

347
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,210
I've already stolen it.

348
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,730
Can you give it to me?

349
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,540
It's just a dead flower.

350
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,420
What's the point of giving it to you?

351
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,720
It has its uses.

352
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,980
Give it to me.

353
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,080
No.

354
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,480
It's worth a lot of money.

355
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,080
No.

356
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,840
I told you.

357
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,850
This is a Ranxi flower,

358
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,850
a rare treasure of the Three Realms.

359
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,330
Do you think it's the same as those common grass

360
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,390
in the Arbiter Hall?

361
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,570
It's not that easy to bring it back to life.

362
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,830
Why don't you give it back to me?

363
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,490
I can sell it for a lot of money.

364
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,590
Ever since I met you,

365
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,320
my fortune has never been good.

366
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,580
Even the Love Tree can be revived,

367
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,430
why can't I save it?

368
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,320
I'll try again.

369
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,440
Why are you still trying?

370
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,330
How long has it been?

371
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,290
Your wound is open.

372
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,180
Didn't you notice?

373
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,100
I want to try one last time.

374
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,360
Stop it, Orchid.

375
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,170
How many times have you tried?

376
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,740
Alright, listen to me.

377
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,540
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

378
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,260
Are you insane?

379
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,480
Jieli. Jieli.

380
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,110
Look!

381
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,210
It's alive.

382
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,140
The Ranxi flower

383
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:36,880
is alive.

384
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,580
It's really alive.

385
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,760
How is this possible?

386
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,880
I know.

387
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,800
It's the blood.

388
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,570
I see.

389
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,000
Ranxi flower lives on blood.

390
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,390
The undercurrents of the river are dangerous

391
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,690
and sharp as a blade.

392
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,400
If anything happens,

393
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,930
you won't be able to return.

394
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,410
Do you really want to go?

395
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,490
Jieli.

396
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,420
Cloud Shadow Mirror.

397
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,220
Orchid.

398
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,640
Have you thought about it?

399
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,650
Even if you're lucky enough to reach the Realm of Return to Ruin

400
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,870
and find the first Moon Supreme,

401
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,930
he's been dead for tens of thousands of years.

402
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,890
He may have already forgotten

403
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,620
all these old stories.

404
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,790
Or maybe

405
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,060
he was just a cruel and heartless father.

406
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,660
You won't find the answers you're looking for.

407
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,140
Jieli.

408
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,820
I've thought about

409
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,880
everything you've said.

410
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,270
But I'm still going.

411
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:31,050
Dongfang Qingcang is already guilty of killing his father.

412
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,110
Now he insists on executing Xunfeng.

413
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,290
The world will think that

414
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,930
he's killing his siblings,

415
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,740
and is going to repeat the patricide.

416
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,500
I can't let him

417
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,220
be misunderstood like this.

418
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,230
As long as there is a glimmer of hope,

419
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,410
I won't give up.

420
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,890
I know you're worried about me.

421
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,440
But I can't think of

422
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,960
any other way.

423
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,780
Who said I'm worried about you?

424
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,000
I'm afraid if you die in the Memory Loss River,

425
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,010
no one will pay my debt.

426
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,440
You can rest assured.

427
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,910
When I come back,

428
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,790
I'll pay off

429
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,310
all the debt I owe you.

430
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,770
You must be careful.

431
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,150
Don't get swept away by the turbulence.

432
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,730
I know.

433
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,410
This stuff must be very expensive.

434
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,430
I can't afford to pay it back if I lose it.

435
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,890
But Jieli, think about it.

436
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,910
If there is no Cloud Shadow Mirror,

437
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,380
even if I meet the first Moon Supreme,

438
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,980
I wouldn't be able to remember his words.

439
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,330
So I will hold on to it.

440
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,840
Are you an idiot?

441
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,690
I meant you.

442
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,770
Don't get swept away by the turbulence.

443
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,200
Don't worry.

444
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,630
My lord.

445
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,930
It's time for the execution.

446
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,660
Let's go to the execution site.

447
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,060
It's been four hours.

448
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,530
Why isn't she back yet?

449
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,710
Orchid.

450
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,170
My lord.

451
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:07,930
Where is she?

452
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:09,440
She's...

453
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:37,920
Are these all spirits?

454
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,480
This is the Realm of Return to Ruin.

455
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,970
Are you

456
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,150
the first Moon Supreme?

457
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,520
Who told you to come here?

458
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,110
Go back.

459
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,630
I'm not done asking yet.

460
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,440
What do you want to ask?

461
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,790
I want to ask your father

462
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,970
why he did that to you back then.

463
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,430
It's not your place to ask.

464
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,950
This is my dead father.

465
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,230
How imperious he was back then.

466
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,630
Now there is only a poor spirit left.

467
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,920
No need to ask.

468
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,970
I don't want to know

469
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,120
anything about him.

470
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,590
Let's go.

471
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,580
You said he didn't love you.

472
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,760
Why did he still keep your zither?

473
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,020
My zither was destroyed by his own hands.

474
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,880
You broke into the forbidden place.

475
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,680
That's right.

476
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,160
If I hadn't gone there,

477
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,210
no one would ever have known

478
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,540
where he hid the zither.

479
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,180
Wooden Head,

480
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,130
I'm already here.

481
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,210
Let me go and ask.

482
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,650
Whether you want to kill me, hurt me

483
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,450
or pull out my tongue,

484
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,960
do it after we get back.

485
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,760
Okay?

486
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,440
I said

487
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,590
no need to ask.

488
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:54,670
Let's go.

489
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,820
First Moon Supreme Lord.

490
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,130
How long have I been here?

491
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,690
30,000 years.

492
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,830
30,000 years.

493
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,010
30,000 years.

494
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,390
Who are you?

495
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,620
I... I'm...

496
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,740
Your son sent me here.

497
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,930
Qingcang?

498
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,190
Has he swept away the fairy realm

499
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,050
and restored the Moon Tribe?

500
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,340
This is

501
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,610
all he cares about.

502
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,030
First Moon Supreme Lord,

503
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,270
do you recognize this zither?

504
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,230
Of course, I do.

505
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,630
Then did you

506
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,890
restore this zither?

507
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,130
Qingcang

508
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,420
gave it to me as a birthday gift.

509
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,400
But I

510
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,560
trampled on it.

511
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,700
I felt so sad.

512
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,620
Hypocrite.

513
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,230
If you couldn't bear it,

514
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,430
why did you destroy with your own hands?
