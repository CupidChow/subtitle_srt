[Haotian Tower, Shuiyuntian]

5
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,140
You are the sinful immortal who is locked inside.

6
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,340
You want to trick me into releasing you.

7
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,620
I advise you not to compare me

8
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,780
with these nobodies.

9
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,790
My patience is limited.

10
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,660
Hurry and break this Haotian Matrix.

11
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,300
Otherwise,

12
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,660
I will kill you now.

13
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,300
You are just a sinful immortal.

14
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,820
You're not a big deal.

15
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,940
You keep talking about yourself.

16
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,870
You're just more powerful than me.

17
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,660
Anyone in Shuiyuntian

18
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,260
is more powerful than me.

19
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,890
Besides,

20
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,540
we've switched bodies.

21
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,460
If you kill me now,

22
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,140
you kill yourself.

23
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,579
We can just die together.

24
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,120
Come on.

25
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,980
You reminded me.

26
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,579
My hair!

27
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,220
Don't forget.

28
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,579
You're also in my hands now.

29
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,950
I won't let you off the hook.

30
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,980
I'll make you bald today!

31
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,250
Stop!

32
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,860
How dare you be so presumptuous.

33
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,940
Do you believe that I'll

34
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,540
break your arms off now?

35
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,070
Then I'll cut your neck off!

36
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,020
You dare talk nonsense.

37
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,780
You don't seem to want your tongue anymore.

38
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,820
If you dare touch my tongue,

39
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,350
I will...

40
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,780
I will use my power to destroy your immortal root.

41
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,820
You dare?

42
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,980
Why not?

43
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,659
My immortal root is damaged anyway.

44
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,820
I'll just destroy yours.

45
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,740
I'm not afraid.

all gone.

49

Don't cry.

It's all gone.

51
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,700
I can't braid my hair anymore.

52
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,580
I can't wear a hairpin anymore.

53
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,900
I even have to stay

54
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,620
in this sinful immortal body of yours.

55
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,460
I told you not to cry.

56
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,820
I can't pass the immortal examination too.

57
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,740
I can never go back to the Arbiter Hall.

58

I'm only 1,500 years old.

59
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,500
I'm still so young.

60
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,940
Why is my life so miserable?

61

Clean your face.

You're the first person in history

to threaten me.

70
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,660
You're also the first person in history to

71
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,340
make me cry like a man.

72
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,340
I don't want to stay in

73

74
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,260
It's just some Haotian Matrix.

75
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,380
Today, I'll break it

76
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,260
for you.

let's figure out a way

79
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,270
as soon as possible.

80
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,340
People from the Heavenly Realm always claim to be honorable.

81
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,590
But when things happen,

82
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,940
you only care about yourself.

I'm just an orchid plant.

85

If you want a plant to think about these things,

86
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,330
then why do we need the Heavenly Soldiers,

87
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,340
Heavenly Emperors, and Fairy Lords?

88

Besides,

my master said that

90
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,220
stealing one's job is like killing one's mother.

Enough. Don't disturb me.

95

I don't know how to use your body.

96

How could there be such a stupid person in this world?

97
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,780
Do you have any idea?

98

Everything has its cause.

102
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,810
We must have done something

103
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,610
that caused us to switch bodies.

104
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,220
Now,

105
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,860
if we repeat what we were doing before we switched,

106
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,460
maybe we can switch back.

back from the Northernmost Ocean.

not good at other things.

116

I failed to save her.

But my brother and the others

You know that.

Me too.

142
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,820
I'd rather be with this lonely lake and empty mountain.

143

I'd rather

144

have a drink with you.

145
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,060
Green flame wine from the Northernmost Ocean?

146
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,200
It lives up to its reputation.

147
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,860
Good wine.

148
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,700
Xishan is really a good place.

I think that goddess, Xi Yun,

What are you holding?

152
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,070
Something from your lover?

153
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,180
It's nothing.

154
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,200
It's just a handkerchief.

something on it.

158
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,500
You can fool others but not me.

159
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,530
Why do you

160
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,820
keep staring at a handkerchief?

161
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,780
There are no poetries or patterns on it.

162

What are you looking at?

163
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,900
I didn't expect

164
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,290
you to hide the pattern.

165
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,620
Actually,

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,580
you and the goddess only have a marriage engagement.

167
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,180
You've never met each other.

she has been gone for 30,000 years.

What if she doesn't come back?

171

It's my marriage engagement with her.

172

Even if she's been away for 30,000 years,
