[Episode 21]

4
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,880
The music is what I've been waiting for.

5
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,400
What music?

6
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,000
Why can't I hear it?

7
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,530
The music...

8
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,760
I've never heard

9
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,810
the music before,

10
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,170
but it seems that I've heard it

11
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,320
a million times.

12
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,360
Well...

13
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,320
Do you know

14
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,450
the player?

15
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,730
No.

16
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,150
I don't know who the player is.

17
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,090
It's bustling outside.

18
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,680
Although I'm not going,

19
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,210
you don't need to stay here.

20
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,410
Go and have fun.

21
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,690
Thank you, my lady.

22
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,880
I'll be right back.

23
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,290
Jieli.

24
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,480
What's wrong?

25
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,210
Where is Orchid?

26
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,490
She's missing.

27
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,329
Look for her!

28
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,920
Yes.

29
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,760
Forget it.

30
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,570
It's too troublesome.

31
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,690
I'll move away all the people on the street.

32
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,130
No.

33
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,670
My lord.

34
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,970
My lord.

35
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,840
We've agreed that

36
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,440
we don't use magic in Lu City.

37
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,360
My lord, calm down.

38
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,130
It may disturb the fate of Chidi woman.

39
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,130
You can't do that.

40
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,450
My lord,

41
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,280
although Orchid's magical power is weak,

42
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,850
it's more than enough

43
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,890
for her to deal with the mortals in Yunmeng Lake.

44
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,810
I'll go and look for her now.

45
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,960
If she is in any danger,

46
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,620
I will throw you both into the Memory Loss River.

47
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,130
Yes.

48
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,210
Let's go.

49
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,890
She was heartbroken and about to end her life.

50
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,810
She met her Mr. Right who understood her so well.

51
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,160
If my guess is right,

52
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,730
the place where the former God of War will experience the hardships tonight

53
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,040
is Life Ending Pavilion.

54
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,280
She will meet Lord Changheng and

55
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,530
fall in love with him at first sight.

56
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,640
I have to keep watch.

57
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,700
I can't let Wooden Head disturb them.

58
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,400
Xie Wanqing.

59
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,830
That's Life Ending Pavilion.

60
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,210
Itâ€™s time.

61
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,680
My lord.

62
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,690
Dongfang Qingcang appeared in Lu City.

63
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,290
I'm afraid

64
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,690
he will disturb the former God of War's hardship experience.

65
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,260
What Dongfang Qingcang aims to do

66
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,020
is to take my master's primordial spirit

67
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,920
and unlock 100,000 soldiers of the Moon Tribe.

68
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,250
So before the hardship is completed,

69
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,710
or before the wedding night on the Flora Day,

70
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,650
he won't take any action.

71
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,250
Over 30,000 years,

72
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,200
I've been guarding her

73
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,080
to avoid any problem during her hardships.

74
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,970
I finally found the Goddess of Xishan.

75
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,140
This is the last life of my master.

76
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,800
So,

77
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,080
you must be careful

78
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,120
and make sure everything goes well.

79
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,970
After this life,

80
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,130
my master can go back with me.

81
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,120
Yes, my lord.

82
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,770
I have no regret.

83
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,290
Hearing the flute on the night of the Lantern Festival.

84
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,210
She met her Mr. Right who understood her so well.

85
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,560
She plans to end her life on the night of the Lantern Festival.

86
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,650
Her Mr. Right will stop her.

87
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,690
But why hasn't

88
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,520
the Mr. Right shown up yet?

89
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,490
Stop!

90
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,370
Stop!

91
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,240
Stop!

92
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,760
Stop!

93
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,560
Get out of the way!

94
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,530
Over there!

95
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,040
Stop!

96
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,520
Don't run!

97
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,480
Stop! Stop!

98
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,159
-Don't run. -Here. Here

99
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:41,880
Move!

100
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:44,930
Don't run!

101
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,680
Stop!

[Life Ending Pavilion]

103
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,030
Where are you going?

104
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:16,960
Wait. Wait.

105
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,650
We are on familiar terms with each other.

106
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,080
Why do you have to do this?

107
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,000
Give me the jade.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,680
Hand it over!

109
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,850
No, no.

110
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,370
I was born with this jade.

111
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,570
I can't give it to you.

112
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,000
How about this?

113
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,280
When my father calms down,

114
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,170
I'll

115
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,640
pay you double.

116
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,430
OK?

117
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,370
I don't care who you are.

118
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,500
How dare you play tricks in our casino?

119
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,210
No. I can't give you.

120
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,140
You have to

121
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,270
suffer a lot.

122
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,700
I can't give it to you.

123
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,580
Mr. Xiao,

124
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,670
-you are so rich. -I have to give it to my destined lover!

125
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,820
You don't have to suffer this for a piece of jade.

126
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,820
Give it to me.

127
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,060
How dare you bite me?

128
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,770
Beat him!

129
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,320
Beat him!

130
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,620
Stop!

131
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,550
It's perfectly justified

132
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,730
to pay the debt.

133
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,990
Where did this wild girl come from?

134
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,500
You'd better mind your own business.

135
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,250
Leave!

136
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,720
Let him go.

137
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,230
Otherwise,

138
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,230
don't blame me for being rude to you.

139
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,430
She's a heroine.

140
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,310
What?

141
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,310
Do you want to show off your bravery?

142
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,380
Attack!

143
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,010
Go!

144
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,309
Stop!

145
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,980
Within the three realms,

146
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,660
you, as a woman,

147
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,590
are not able to kill me.

148
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,640
Is it you?

149
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,090
We...

150
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,120
Have we met before?

151
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,220
Never.

152
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,440
The music...

153
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,220
Was the music just now

154
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,160
from you?

155
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,170
What music?

156
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,580
It's you.

157
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,610
It must be you.

158
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,840
Why did I feel hate,

159
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,950
respect,

160
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,760
and concern

161
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,250
at the same time

162
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,790
when I saw you?

163
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,390
It's like I've been entangled with you for ages.

164
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,320
I think I was waiting for you.

165
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,380
You're drunk.

166
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,570
I'm drunk.

167
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,930
Look at this muddy world.

168
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,730
Everyone is drunk.

169
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,500
I was just dreaming.

170
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,190
At this moment,

171
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,850
I should wake up from my dream.

172
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,500
You can't die.

173
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,250
We met in our previous life.

174
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,250
Who are you?

175
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,450
How could this happen?

176
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,090
Where is the Mr. Right?

177
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,490
He should have appeared.

178
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,150
Are you okay?

179
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,860
Have we

180
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,380
met before?

181
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,940
No. No. No.

182
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,860
No. No.

183
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,620
Young master,

184
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,170
you must have mistaken me for someone else.

185
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,220
Since you are fine,

186
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,420
I shall take my leave.

187
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,920
No, I can't be wrong.

188
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,590
I...

189
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,070
Last month,

190
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,010
we met at the Mansion of Duke Zhongyi.

191
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,800
At that time,

192
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,490
the wife of Duke Zhongyi was training with female generals.

193
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,170
You knocked off my hair bun.

194
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,050
What?

195
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,190
What female generals?

196
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,450
I've never heard of it.

197
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,760
How forgetful I am!

198
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,070
It's rare to see such a beautiful technique.

199
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,090
You must be the legitimate heir of the magician of Liuyun Theatre.

200
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:49,760
Half a month ago,

201
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,320
I watched your performance.

202
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,160
Young master,

203
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,210
you must be mistaken.

204
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,470
We've never seen each other in this life.

205
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,760
I remember now.

206
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,380
There is a beautiful fairy in my dream.

207
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,040
She looks very similar to you.

208
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,040
You and I

209
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
must have a relationship in heaven.

210
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,910
Heroine, wait.

211
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,340
I haven't asked your name yet.

212
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,260
Where do you live?

213
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,480
Whatâ€™s your name?

214
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:26,890
Heroine.

215
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,360
Heroine.

216
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,580
It's almost midnight.

217
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,210
Why is the lord still wandering here?

218
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,340
Why isn't he going to meet Xie Wanqing?

219
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,620
After the night of the Lantern Festival,

220
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,170
the fate will be changed.

221
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,850
I was worried about your safety

222
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,950
and looking for you everywhere.

223
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,410
But you're here to meet Changheng secretly.

224
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,780
Changheng?

225
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,460
Isn't Lord Changheng at Shuiyuntian?

226
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,560
You got the wrong person.

227
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,960
You are still lying to me.

228
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,920
Do you really think I am a three-year-old child

229
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,780
who will be fooled by your tricks?

230
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,110
That day at the Life Ending Pavilion,

231
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,070
I found

232
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,930
Changheng was also experiencing hardships there.

233
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,160
Everything you said and did

234
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,090
is just covering up for Changheng.

235
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,770
Even so,

236
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,180
I would rather believe it when you said

237
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,320
the Bone Orchid I gave you is priceless.

238
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,450
But you...

239
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,550
Yes.

240
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,850
I lied to you.

241
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,710
What about you?

242
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,670
Why did you come to Lu City?

243
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,270
You said you came to hang around with me.

244
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,950
In fact, you are here to take the spirit of the former God of War,

245
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,570
right?

246
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,720
How did you know?

247
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,660
Jieli told you?

248
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,880
She didn't say anything.

249
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,080
I guessed it according to the fate poem.

250
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,100
How smart you are, the head disciple of the Arbiter!

251
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,570
Since you are so good at guessing,

252
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,870
did you know long ago about

253
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,870
Changheng's hardship experience?

254
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,060
I...

255
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,300
Good. Very good.

256
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,660
No wonder you came to Lu City without permission,

257
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,130
and claimed that you wanted to hang around with me.

258
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,520
So you had a plan.

259
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,360
I didn't.

260
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,830
I knew it not long ago.

261
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,600
This is a rare opportunity.

262
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,160
I'm going to kill Changheng now

263
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,310
and get rid of a big trouble for Cangyan Sea.

264
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:17,940
No.

265
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,860
You can't kill him.

266
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,460
Lord Changheng is Mr. Right!

267
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,190
What did you say?

268
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,660
Xiao Run, the second son of the Xiao family,

269
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,500
was betrothed to Xie Wanqing before birth,

270
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,970
and then offered a lot of money to propose.

271
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,650
They both

272
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,910
showed up at Life Ending Pavilion tonight.

273
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,310
There must be no mistake.

274
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,310
If you kill him on impulse,

275
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,480
Xie Wanqing's fate

276
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,790
will change too.

277
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,880
It's because of you.

278
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,440
What do you mean?

279
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,540
If, as you said,

280
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,760
Changheng is the Mr. Right in the poem,

281
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,240
then the reason why he didn't show up on time

282
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,420
is because he wasted time

283
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,380
pushing and pulling

284
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,560
with you

285
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,820
and thus changed the fate.

286
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,710
If I hadn't stopped Xie Wanqing,

287
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,730
she would have died.

288
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,660
What?

289
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,880
You stopped Xie Wanqing?

290
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,270
Why are you so nosy?

291
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,910
Itâ€™s not her fate.

292
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,830
If I didn't stop her

293
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,920
and let her die,

294
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,650
there would be no turning back.

295
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,580
Oh, no, no, no.

296
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,770
They've missed the destined time.

297
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,570
They should have fallen in love tonight,

298
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,550
but they didn't meet each other.

299
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,110
If things don't happen according to the fate poem,

300
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,110
the two of them would fail in the hardship experience,

301
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,700
and their primordial spirits will perish.

302
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,370
[Everlasting Virtue]

303
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,490
Run,

304
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,890
after going home today,

305
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,860
you look as if you lose your soul.

306
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,750
You've been staring at the blank paper

307
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,440
for the whole night.

308
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,079
You don't understand.

309
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,310
If I don't draw until I am fully prepared,

310
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,160
I would offend that heroine.

311
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,440
Run,

312
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,050
It's 1:30 a.m.

313
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,240
After school tomorrow,

314
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,250
you need to go to Life Ending Pavilion

315
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,010
to visit Lady Wanqing.

316
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,859
Rest early.

317
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,840
I won't go to Life Ending Pavilion tomorrow.

318
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,220
It's not Lady Wanqing.

319
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,520
I was wrong.

320
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,390
That heroine

321
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,400
is actually the fairy in my dream.

322
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,470
Another girl?

323
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,120
What do you mean?

324
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,020
It's different this time.

325
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,030
I can feel

326
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,260
that heroine is the fairy in my dream.

327
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,570
I was born with this jade.

328
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,580
I was born for her.

329
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,400
Run, take your time.

330
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,510
Who are you?

331
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,070
You are Fairy Danyin.

332
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,680
Are you a thief?

333
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,110
Help!

334
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,530
Help!

335
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,120
Help!

336
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,710
Qu Shui!

337
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,060
Thief! Thief!

338
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,070
Qu Shui!

339
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,920
Who dares to break into Xiao's mansion at night?

340
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,180
I came to Lu City.

341
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,650
You also came to Lu City.

342
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,330
You and I are destined to meet.

343
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,840
You bandit, I'll beat you!

344
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,290
Stop!

345
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,220
Let him go!

346
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,660
Young master,

347
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,750
you must be mistaken.

348
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,890
There is a beautiful fairy in my dream.

349
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,550
She looks very similar to you.

350
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,460
You and I

351
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,460
must have a relationship in heaven.

352
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,080
Why isn't he back yet?

353
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,490
How did it go?

354
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,330
Did it go well?

355
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,900
It's easy to erase

356
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,960
a mortal's memory.

357
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,020
No.

358
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,780
The problem has not been fully solved yet.

359
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,430
Even if Xiao Run's memory of meeting me was erased,

360
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,570
he still hasn't met Xie Wanqing.

361
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,800
You...

362
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,200
Why are you looking at me?

363
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,670
Orchid, you are in charge of fixing the Destiny Book.

364
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,810
No one knows hardship experience better than you.

365
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,070
Hurry up and find a way!

366
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,520
Let me get it straight.

367
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,620
On the night of the Lantern Festival,

368
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,880
the God of War Changheng,

369
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
or Xiao Run,

370
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,610
was destined to meet

371
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,990
Chidi Woman Xie Wanqing

372
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,710
at Life Ending Pavilion,

373
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,530
and save Xie Wanqing who would fall off the building,

374
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,930
and they would fall in love with each other.

375
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,780
But because Wooden Head and I were careless,

376
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,540
they missed each other.

377
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,450
Because of you two,

378
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,130
their fates

379
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,480
deviated from the...

380
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,160
Fate poem.

381
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,910
Yes. Yes. Yes.

382
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,670
Fate poem.

383
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,570
If they didn't meet, they wouldn't be in love.

384
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,000
If they were not in love, they wouldn't get married.

385
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,350
If so,

386
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,660
Xie Wanqing won't be able to be killed by Xiao Run

387
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,380
on the wedding night.

388
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,350
I have a question.

389
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,490
Since Changheng wanted to marry her,

390
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,080
why would he kill her?

391
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,680
I'm also curious about this.

392
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,490
Lord Changheng is a person who values love and loyalty.

393
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,510
Why would he kill Xie Wanqing?

394
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,140
Yes.

395
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,800
There is someone who values love and loyalty in the fairy realm?

396
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,690
This is the first time I've ever known it.

397
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,490
My lord,

398
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,960
Changheng is a mortal now.

399
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,680
A mortal is able to value love

400
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,660
and loyalty.

401
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,090
Don't stray from the point.

402
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,350
These are not important.

403
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,980
Anyway,

404
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,380
if nothing in the fate poem happens now,

405
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,850
then the hardship experience of Changheng and Chidi Woman

406
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,990
will be a failure.

407
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,720
Their primordial spirits

408
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,480
will vanish.

409
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,360
Am I right?

410
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,850
Accidents before the hardship are not terrible.

411
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,240
What's important is the hardship experience.

412
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,890
If they are destined to love each other,

413
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,690
it doesn't matter how they meet.

414
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,670
I see.

415
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,900
You understand too?

416
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,660
No.

417
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,920
Then why did you say that?

418
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,120
I was trying to enliven the atmosphere.

419
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,880
So what do you know now?

420
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,610
Think about it.

421
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,380
As long as they get married on the Flora Day,

422
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,690
the fate poem will still come true,

423
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,000
and the hardship experience will succeed.

424
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,470
So our main task now

425
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,910
is to make them fall in love before that.

426
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,230
But they already missed the best opportunity.

427
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,700
How can we make them fall in love?

428
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,870
You don't understand.

429
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,340
Xiao Run and Xie Wanqing

430
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,020
are a match made in heaven.

431
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,240
This little setback

432
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,050
can't tear them apart.

433
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,220
Look.

434
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,250
Xiao Run doesn't value fame and fortune at all.

435
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,680
He refuses to follow his family's arrangement.

436
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,620
Xie Wanqing doesn't value wealth and splendor.

437
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,600
She refuses to care about the worldly taste.

438
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,030
They both refuse to do anything against their will.

439
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,130
Aren't they a perfect match?

440
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,260
So now,

441
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,860
as long as they meet,

442
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,490
fate will naturally lead them

443
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,150
to fall in love at first sight.

444
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,690
There's no time to lose.

445
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,820
I'll go find Xiao Run

446
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,330
and ask him to meet Xie Wanqing.

447
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,000
Donâ€™t go.

448
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,350
I went to erase Xiao Runâ€™s memory

449
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,950
to avoid more troubles.

450
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,090
If you go there rashly,

451
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,550
it would be a waste of time.

452
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,170
Exactly.

453
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,770
The relations between mortal men and women should be developed naturally.

454
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,250
Orchid, it's not appropriate for you to go find Xiao Run.

455
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:33,920
Exactly.

456
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,560
Since you want to be a mortal,

457
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,620
you must follow the rules of mortals.

458
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:40,970
How about this?

459
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,540
Lord and Shangque get close to Xiao Run.

460
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,840
As for Xie Wanqing,

461
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,690
Orchid and I will take charge of her.

462
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,950
After getting along with them,

463
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,220
we'll find a way to let them meet.

464
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:51,940
What do you think?

465
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,730
Any problem?

466
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,410
No.

467
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,160
We can't do this.

468
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,790
Why?

469
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,710
You're afraid that I'll take Changheng's life, aren't you?

470
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,770
You underestimate me.

471

He's a mortal now.

00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,420
He has no power.

473
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,850
If I kill him,

474
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,030
I'm not different from those hypocrites

475
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,370
in the fairy realm.

476
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,390
Are you sure you wonâ€™t hurt him?

477
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,820
The hardship is more important now.

478
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,750
I don't have time to waste energy in the mortal world.

479

You, wait.

I have something to tell you. Sit down.

What do you want to say?

You are awake, my lady.

You were drunk on the rooftop last night.

it would be my fault.

496
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,810
Last night, I saw someone

on the rooftop.

498
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,050

really a dream?

[Invitation]

519
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,600
Those royal descendants

520
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,950
and noble ladies of noble families

521
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,760
always recite poems and play grass games on the banquet.

522
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,570
It happens every year.

523
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,540
I'm tired.

524
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,520
Decline for me.

525
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,240
Yes.

526
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:32,410
Wait.

527
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,970
Get the best gardener in Lu City for me.

528
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:50,600
Yes.

529
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,620
Run! Run!

530
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,050
Run.

531
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,540
Why are we sleeping in the yard?

532
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,150
By the way,

533
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,190
a thief seemed to break in last night.

534
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,610
I was so scared that I...

535
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,150
And then?

536
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,160
I passed out.

537
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,650
Run, are you alright?

538
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,000
I'm fine.

539
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,430
But I feel that

540
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,660
I forgot something important.

541
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,030
Run.

542
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,240
Don't scare me.

543
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,300
Did you hurt your brain

544
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,230
when you fought against the thief?

545
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,090
Or

546
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,990
did you come across ghosts?

547
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,880
In broad daylight,

548
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,640
it's impossible to see ghosts.

549
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,050
What time is it now?

550
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,940
It should be

551
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,410
7 a.m. now.

552
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,070
Hurry up! Hurry up!

553
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,910
Pack up!

554
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:28,540
If my old man knew

555
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,680
I missed the school time,

556
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,640
I would be skinned by him.

557
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,270
Move!

558
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,150
Run,

559
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,540
Run. Hurry up!

560
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,380
It's too late.

561
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,010
What are you doing?

562
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,200
Where is this painting from?

563
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,210
You painted it yourself yesterday.

564
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,300
You forgot?

565
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,940
We are really late!

566
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,270
This must be drawn in my dream.

567
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,740
The woman in the painting

568
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,340
must be the fairy in my dream.

569
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,000
Qu Shui!

570
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,320
I know everything.

571
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,950
Know what?

572
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,420
I know what she looks like.

573
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,610
I finally know.

574
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:16,000
Qu Shui, I finally know.

575
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:21,170
Dark Golden Glory is the best among the Top 10 Peonies.

576
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,970
It's the most delicate.

577
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,110
Since the day I planted it,

578
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,160
I've been taking care of it every day.

579
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,720
I've invited countless gardeners,

580
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,570
but no one can make it bloom.

581
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,210
Lady Orchid, you are an excellent gardener.

582
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,850
Now it has buds.

583
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,870
Don't worry.

584
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,730
I'll make sure it blooms before the Spring Banquet.

585
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,620
I heard that Lady Orchid

586
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,430
is renowned as the head of flower fairies in Jinling.

587
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,160
It shows that the rumor is true.

588
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,150
I'm... I'm flattered.

589
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,980
I've heard that Jinling is full of talented people.

590
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,790
Lady Orchid, don't be modest.

591
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,700
Actually, I'm just an ordinary person.

592
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,550
I accepted your invitation

593
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,570
for personal reason.

594
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,960
If I can accompany you to the Spring Banquet,

595
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,520
maybe I can meet a fated person.

596
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,550
A young gentleman will be attracted by beautiful ladies.

597
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,100
This is a good thing.

598
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,910
If you can meet someone you like,

599
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,550
it will be good.

600
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,440
Do you have someone

601
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,860
in your heart?

602
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,460
Maybe my destined one

603
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,100
is the moon in the sky.

604
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,920
The moon in the sky

605
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,270
is bright and clear,

606
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,660
and it always hangs in the sky.

607
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,900
It's untouchable.

608
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,730
Xie Wanqing's dream lover

609
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,370
is really Lord Changheng.

610
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,720
It is the year of Guichou in terms of the Chinese lunar calendar.

611
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,810
On one of those late spring days,

612
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,080
we gather at the Orchid Pavilion, which is located in Shanyin County, Kuaiji Prefecture,

613
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,380
for dispelling bad luck and praying for good fortune.

614
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,980
The attendees of the gathering are all virtuous intellectuals.

615
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,140
Run, the teacher is coming.

616
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,050
This is...

617
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:29,850
It's you.

618
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,180
You are

619
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,190
the rich merchant who bought the Night Stream Building

620
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,750
with a box of gold.

621
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,950
It's him.

622
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,830
It's him.

623
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,800
Silence!

624
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,050
This is Mr. Dongfang.

625
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,110
He will be your classmate from now on.

626
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,040
I haven't finished yet.

627
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,050
What else can you say?

628
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,180
Let the class begin.

629
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,200
Look at his vibe.

630
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,220
So impressive.

631
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:06,810
Yes.

632
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,280
Okay.

633
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,840
Let's continue to review.

634
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,660
Mr. Dongfang,

635
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,790
you really have an

636
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,520
impressive presence.

637
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,450
Nice to meet you.

638
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,810
My name is widely known because of my money.

639
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,110
These mortals

640
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,240
are so boring.

641
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,440
Mr. Dongfang

642
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,120
is really extraordinary.

643
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,420
Stop whispering!

644
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,640
You two,

645
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,230
get out!

646
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,390
Mr. Dongfang.

647
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,450
Iâ€™m talking to you.

648
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,570
How dare you talk to me like that?

649
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,450
Calm down, sir.

[Rectification, Cultivation, Contemplation, Diligence]

651

Brother Dongfang.

652
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,350
There is a football match

653
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,699
in the west of the city.

654
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:23,360
Why don't we go and have a look?

655
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,310
School is not over yet.

656
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,199
Someone must be guarding the front gate.

657
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,880
I have a good plan.

658
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,489
You two stay here.

659
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,830
Go!

660
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:34,840
Go!

661
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,639
Go!

662
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,230
Brother Dongfang, hurry up!

663
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,030
No one is here.

664
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:54,719

665
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,360
Brother Dongfang, hurry up!

666
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,790
Brother Dongfang!

667
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,450
I'm coming.

668
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,470
Hurry up.

669
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,720
Come on.

670
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,390
Be careful.

671
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,490
Be careful.

672
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,340
I can't believe I just crawled into a dog hole with Changheng hand in hand.

673
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,270
What did you say?

674
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:34,480
Nothing.

675
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,810
Who is sneaking around?

676
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,450
Let's go.

677
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,170
Mr. Xiao.

678
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,430
It's you again.

Master.

680

It's...

681
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,980
It's almost lunchtime.

682
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,700
Have you eaten?

683
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,630
Mr. Xiao,

684
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,110
you've been idling about

685
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,960
and fooling around all day long.

686
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,390
You're stubborn.

687
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,580
You don't focus on your studies at all.

688
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,890
Today, you even crawled into the dog hole.

689
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,550
You've humiliated yourself.

690
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,170
If it weren't for your father's sake,
