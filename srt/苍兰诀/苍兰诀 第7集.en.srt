4
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,580
Help!

5
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,980
Daqiang,

6
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,220
why are you here?

7
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,820
I was just passing by.

8
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,180
Just passing by?

9
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,660
I told you to wait at home.

10
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,060
Who told you to run around?

11
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,250
Do you know it's dangerous here?

12
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,700
What if you get caught?

13
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,780
This beast hurt you, right?

14
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,380
What beast?

15
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,820
You mean Ying Zhao?

16
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,280
You're the one who subdued it?

17
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,980
Say something.

18
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,020
What are you doing, Daqiang?

19
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,780
Don't hurt it.

20
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,820
Ying Zhao, you're hurt.

21
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,860
Let me heal you.

22
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,500
This beast hurt you.

23
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,140
Why won't you let me kill it?

24
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,740
It's already like this.

25
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,140
How can I bear to see that?

26
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,620
You can't?

27
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,390
Isn't it human nature?

28
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,220
Human nature?

29
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,780
Because of this nature,

30
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,140
it made you weak and put you in danger.

31
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,660
I will remove

32
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,340
this nature of yours completely,

33
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,740
so you won't get yourself in trouble again.

34
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,659
You dare?

35
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,100
Yes, I'm being emotional.

36
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,180
But without emotions,

37
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,300
we will become

38
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,060
a tree without leaves,

39
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,620
a flower that never blooms,

40
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,020
a bird without wings.

41
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,570
Anyway,

42
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,630
we'll be disabled.

43
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,140
What do you know?

44
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,660
Being heartless can help us analyze the pros and cons.

45
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,900
Without love, we won't feel pity.

46
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,900
If you didn't pity them,

47
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,460
you wouldn't have cut yourself

48
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,700
to distract Ying Zhao.

49
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,230
And you wouldn't have put yourself in danger.

50
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,220
Daqiang,

51
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,460
you're wrong.

52
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,180
If what you said is true.

53
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,820
We only cared about our own safety.

54
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,420
We're scattered.

55
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,900
We would've been eaten

56
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,340
by Ying Zhao.

57
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,970
Because we took pity on each other and

58
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,690
didn't want to see any of us die,

59
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,420
we faced our fears

60
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,620
and worked together

61
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,060
to win time for survival.

62
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,580
So emotion is not a burden.

63
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,770
It's the reason we survived this time.

64
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,740
Are you spacing out?

65
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,060
Daqiang.

66
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,740
I know

67
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,670
you've been locked up for too long,

68
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,980
so you're more aggressive.

69
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,900
No matter how dark your past was,

70
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,660
you must believe that

71
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,260
there are still more good people in this world.

72
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,620
Orchid!

73
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,340
It's Lord Changheng!

74
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,340
You need to go now!

75
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,450
Orchid!

76
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,760
Why are you still here?

77
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,020
Don't worry.

78
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,330
Lord Changheng is very powerful.

79
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:39,820
With him around,

80
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,900
I won't be in danger.

81
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,340
Hurry up.

82
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:41,980
Orchid!

83
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,050
Go!

84
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,020
If you don't leave now and

85
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,370
-he sees you, he'll think I... -Orchid!

86
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,340
What?

87
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,700
Think you're colluding with a sinful immortal and engaging in adultery with a man?

88
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,340
You!

89
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,300
Orchid!

90
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,770
I'm here!

91
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,460
Orchid!

92
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:03,740
Greetings...

93
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,470
Are you okay?

94
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,580
I'm fine.

95
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,940
That's good.

96
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,500
Lord Changheng,

97
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,380
how are Fairy Danyin and the others?

98
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,380
They're all fine.

99
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,140
Are you okay?

100
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,220
Are you okay?

101
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,940
How did you

102
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,620
escape just now?

103
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,300
My Lord,

104
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,860
I don't know why Ying Zhao suddenly went crazy just now.

105
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,380
It kept chasing me.

106
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,700
I was very scared,

107
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,420
so I kept running.

108
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,740
When I reached here,

109
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,770
it suddenly

110
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,940
turned back to normal.

111
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,260
This is a serious matter.

112
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,380
You'd better not hide it.

113
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,100
I've said everything I need to say.

114
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,820
If it's the truth,

115
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,500
why are you being so dodgy?

116
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,260
I...

117
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,140
My Lord,

118
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,500
I don't think she wants to hide anything.

119
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,630
She is just in shock.

120
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,100
Really?

121
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,620
She only has a few thousand years of cultivation.

122
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,580
She used herself as a bait to distract Ying Zhao.

123
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,440
It's normal for her to be in shock.

124
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,100
My Lord,

125
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,660
you look so fierce.

126
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,700
You look just like that crazy Ying Zhao.

127
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,700
She's just a weak fairy,

128
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,820
not your prisoner.

129
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,620
Besides,

130
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,919
she just saved your daughter's life.

131
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,059
I was really anxious.

132
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,460
Please forgive me.

133
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,320
Thank you for saving my daughter.

134
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,500
I once read about it

135
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,300
in the ancient forbidden books.

136
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,540
It can capture people's souls, control their minds,

137
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,470
and stimulate their anger to kill.

138
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,180
It must be

139
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,150
caused by the evil spirit.

140
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,300
I'm afraid only the Moon Tribe and sinful immortals

141
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,620
rear such evil creature.

142
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,860
Why is it in Shuiyuntian?

143
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,300
Evil spirit?

144
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,580
The sinful immortals who escaped from Haotian Tower a few days ago.

145
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,380
Could we've missed someone out?

146
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,590
Your name is Orchid?

147
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,610
Greetings, Lord Rong Hao.

148
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,100
You must be Arbiter's disciple.

149
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,690
But my master has been traveling for a long time.

150
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,690
I think almost for a thousand years.

151
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,940
Do you miss her?

152
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,300
I miss her every day.

153
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,910
My master has been away for a long time too.

154
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,060
I miss her too.

155
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,540
When will your master

156
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,980
return?

157
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,510
I don't know.

158
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,900
But...

159
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,110
I think she'll be back soon.

160
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,100
Refining evil spirit requires a lot of primordial spirits of the dead.

161
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,820
Also, the Soul Transformation Cauldron needed to refine evil spirit

162
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,860
was lost during the ancient times.

163
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,780
Evil spirit has vanished for hundreds of thousands of years in the three realms.

164
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,180
Why did it suddenly appear in Shuiyuntian?

165
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,210
Why did it suddenly

166
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,580
possess Ying Zhao?

167
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,940
Don't worry.

168
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,580
I've ordered men to seal the Spirit Lock Gate.

169
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,580
No matter who brought the evil spirit,

170
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,310
they can't escape from Yujing.

171
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,060
If you seal the Spirit Lock Gate,

172
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,990
what should I do?

173
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,780
I asked someone out

174
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,630
for a drink at Yunmeng Lake.

175
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,460
You have to prioritize matters.

176
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,820
As for drinking and entertainment,

177
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,350
you should plan them for later, Lord Rong Hao.

178
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,940
Did master reply to my letter?

179
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,260
Fairy Orchid,

180
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,180
you are the first candidate

181
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,890
to subdue the monster today.

182
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,140
Your performance is excellent.

183
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,180
You emerged as first in the exam.

184
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,240
Congratulations.

185
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,460
The first place?

186
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,140
I emerged as first in the exam.

187
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,740
I can enter Fountain Palace!

188
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,780
The sinful immortals who escaped from Haotian Tower a few days ago

189
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,180
have been captured by me.

190
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,580
Could we've missed someone out?

191
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,660
What should I do?

192
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,260
I hid the existence of Daqiang

193
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,790
and lied to Lord Changheng.

194
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,260
Was today's incident

195
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,100
Daqiang's doing?

196
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,240
[Liufang Pavilion, Haishi City]

197
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,860
You can't even kill a little fairy.

198
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,120
You even left the evil spirit at the scene, and it was found.

199
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,860
Do you think I

200
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,720
should have killed you back then?

201
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,420
Please forgive me.

202
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,580
I deserve to die.

203
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,180
But...

204
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,100
the mysterious man

205
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,560
who disrupted Haishi City

206
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,190
suddenly appeared.

207
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,820
I can't win against him.

208
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,340
So this time,

209
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,860
do you know who he is?

210
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,580
Hellfire?

211
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,060
I asked you to keep an eye on her.

212
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,540
How dare you put her in danger?

213
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,950
How should you be punished?

214
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,580
It was my negligence.

215
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,510
I almost delayed your plan.

216
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Please punish me.

217
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,380
Fortunately, she is safe.

218
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,450
Remember.

219
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,820
From now on, if I'm not around,

220
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,220
you are not allowed to leave her side.

221
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,860
If she gets hurt,

222
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,180
I will strip off your dragon scales

223
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,180
and remove your dragon tendons.

224
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,620
Yes.

225
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,500
Rise.

226
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,070
When I saved Orchid from Haishi City that day,

227
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,180
I sensed the evil spirit.

228
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,600
Today, Ying Zhao also went crazy due to the evil spirit.

229
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,130
Evil spirit is ancient residual.

230
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,860
It requires intense practice.

231
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,130
This can't be a coincidence.

232
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,380
My Lord,

233
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,900
you mean

234
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,500
Ying Zhao went crazy today

235
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,710
because of Haishi City?

236
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,300
They tried everything to get to Orchid.

237
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,700
Maybe it's because Orchid knows

238
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,030
the secret of Chidi Woman's Destiny Book.

239
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,420
They wanted to kill her during the immortal examination.

240
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,550
How much do you know about Haishi City?

241
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,310
My Lord, please forgive me.

242
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,740
I know little about Haishi City.

243
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,260
I only know that Haishi City was formed

244
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,060
after the Great War between the two tribes.

245
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,020
And the Lord of Haishi City

246
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,220
is highly powerful and unpredictable.

247
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,380
He never shows his real face.

248
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,900
30,000 years ago?

249
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,060
In that case,

250
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,860
Haishi City was formed when

251
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,190
Chidi Woman was experiencing hardships.

252
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,100
Chidi Woman's Destiny Book is also hidden in Haishi City.

253
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,180
Could the

254
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,540
Lord of Haishi City

255
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,540
be the keeper of the primordial spirit of Chidi Woman?

256
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,100
Dongfang Qiang, come out.

257
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,340
I want to talk to you.

258
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,550
Daqiang, let me ask you.

259
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,540
Why were you

260
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,860
in Shuyu Forest today?

261
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,380
I said I was just passing by.

262
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,340
Although my power is weak,

263
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,340
I'm not stupid.

264
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,020
Tell me honestly.

265
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,580
Was that evil spirit your doing?

266
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,540
Ridiculous.

267
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,220
If I really wanted to hurt someone,

268
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,300
I don't need these dirty tricks.

269
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,850
Stop quibbling.

270
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,420
Lord Changheng said

271
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,980
the evil spirit is ferocious.

272
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,460
No one will use it except for

273
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,520
the Moon Tribe and sinful immortals.

274
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,260
Is everything Changheng say

275
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,660
true?

276
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,580
Today, in Shuyu Forest,

277
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,820
other than the fairies who attended the exam,

278
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,980
there's only Lord Changheng,

279
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,860
Lord Liyuan,

280
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,580
Lord Rong Hao,

281
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,900
and Aunt Sansheng.

282
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,450
If you didn't do it,

283
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,460
did they do it?

284
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,860
I told you it wasn't me.

285
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,500
And you'd better be glad that it wasn't me.

286
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,940
If I wanted to kill,

287
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,420
no one in Shuyu Forest

288
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,950
would've gotten out alive.

289
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,510
Including your Changheng.

290
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,980
It's my fault.

291
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,339
It's all my fault.

292
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,890
I've been soft-hearted towards you.

293
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,020
I didn't report you to Lord Changheng.

294
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,540
Today, Danyin and the others almost died under the hands of Ying Zhao.

295
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,740
If anything were to happen to them today,

296
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,220
I am to blame.

297
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,300
I don't care what your purpose is.

298
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:24,859
Come with me

299
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,369
to meet Lord Changheng and turn yourself in.

300
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:27,010
Let's go!

301
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,380
My Lord,

302
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,180
are you really

303
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,220
turning yourself in?

304
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,400
I don't want to turn myself in.

305
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,540
But my body...

306
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,780
You have to even if you don't want to.

307
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,840
End of discussion.

308
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,940
My Lord,

309
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,300
I know even all the people together at Shuiyuntian

310
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,020
are no match for you.

311
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,020
But now,

312
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,420
we haven't achieved our plan.

313
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,980
We should not alert them.

314
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,100
Then you should figure out a way!

315
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,340
There's no other way!

316
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,980
Turning yourself in is the only way.

317
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,660
My Lord,

318
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,290
only you can explain it to her

319
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,420
and ask her to withdraw her order.

320
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,820
Ridiculous.

321
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,540
I never explain.

322
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,020
What else can you explain?

323
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,100
All the clues are pointing to you.

324
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,520
My Lord, if you don't compromise, you'll ruin the plan.

325
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,680
Little flower spirit.

326
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,900
What?

327
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,580
Don't you want to know

328
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,300
why I went to Shuyu Forest?

329
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,460
I will

330
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,660
explain it to you.

331
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,900
Go ahead.

332
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,780
I wanted to help you pass the exam.

333
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,140
Help me pass the exam?

334
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,140
Which fairy would like to enter Shuyu Forest first?

335
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,490
Help!

336
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,780
Daqiang, why are you here?

337
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,980
I was just passing by.

338
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,860
So you were helping me.

339
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,260
I told you that

340
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,410
I would only protect you.

341
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,420
I won't hurt you.

342
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,300
Ying Zhao almost killed you today.

343
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,620
If you die,

344
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,940
I'll die too.

345
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,180
So how could it be me?

346
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,420
Is my life

347
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,620
that important to you?

348
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,380
It's as important as my own life.

349
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,220
Daqiang,

350
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,820
I'm sorry.

351
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,420
I think I misunderstood you.

352
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:42,580
Then...

353
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,500
don't turn yourself in.

354
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,900
If they think

355
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,580
you caused this,

356
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,580
they will definitely take you back to Haotian Tower.

357
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,620
Then you can never come back.

358
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,940
What now?

359
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,300
Didn't I explain it clearly?

360
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,700
Why are you still upset?

361
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,930
I thought I really improved my power.

362
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,940
But in the end,

363
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,100
I was happy for nothing.

364
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,060
I'll go to Aunt Sansheng tomorrow

365
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,660
to cancel my result of winning the first place.

366
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,620
Why?

367
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,820
Thank you, Daqiang.

368
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,770
Although my power is weak,

369
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,580
I still have my values.

370
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,060
Cheating is cheating.

371
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,100
But if I tell everyone that you helped me,

372
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,690
will you be taken back to Haotian Tower again?

373
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,750
Don't you always wish for me to go back to Haotian Tower?

374
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,260
I do.

375
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,890
But after going through so many things together,

376
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,060
I don't seem to wish as much.

377
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,860
Forget it.

378
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,180
You won't understand.

379
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,370
Anyway,

380
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,500
don't be so nice to me anymore.

381
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,020
Why?

382
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,180
It's like you've

383
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,860
been taking medicine.

384
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,500
Because you're used to it,

385
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,580
you never think it's bitter.

386
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,700
But one day,

387
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,580
someone gave you a candy

388
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,580
while you're taking your medicine.

389
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,140
Because you've tasted the sweetness of the candy,

390
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,400
the same medicine that

391
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,020
you've taken before

392
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,080
will now taste too bitter to swallow.

393
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,500
In the past,

394
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,940
my master was not around.

395
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,340
I've been guarding the Arbiter Hall alone.

396
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,860
I never felt lonely.

397
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,460
Then, you suddenly came.

398
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,340
You accompanied me

399
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,420
and walked with me in the sun.

400
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,880
You cooked porridge for me

401
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,380
and helped me with the exam.

402
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,340
I'm afraid I'll get used to it.

403
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,540
After you leave,

404
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,340
I'll be alone again.

405
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,460
I'm like the person who have tasted sweetness.

406
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,270
I don't want to taste bitterness anymore.

407
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,780
This little flower spirit.

408
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,500
What nonsense was

409
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,420
she saying?

410
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,460
Why can't I understand?

411
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,660
Strange.

412
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,100
I can see you every day,

413
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,260
but I can't seem to remember

414
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,320
your face clearly.

415
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,700
Hao.

416
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,120
You're being childish again.

417
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,540
I've lit the candles for you.

418
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,860
This way,

419
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,060
you won't be afraid of

420
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,660
having nightmares anymore.

421
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,820
Master is the God of War of the three realms.

422
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,220
No one can defeat you.

423
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,380
I am nobody.

424
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,940
How can this hand that

425
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,520
wields the Shuofeng sword

426
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,500
light candles for me.

427
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,460
I'm useless.

428
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,620
Unlike the former God of War, Wanyi, I'm not gentle.

429
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,820
Please spare my life.

430
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,540
How dare you kneel

431
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,340
with her face on?

432
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,240
She won't make that look on your face.

433
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,780
Stop crying.

434
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,210
People suffer from seven emotions.

435
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,770
Joy.

436
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,860
Worry.

437
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,020
Sadness.

438
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,020
Pity.

439
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:40,860
Love.

440
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,700
Hate.

441
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,380
Jealousy.

442
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,060
These will be the stumbling blocks

443
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,540
when you make decisions.

444
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,580
Cut off the emotional root.

445
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,820
Don't love.

446
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,540
Without weakness,

447
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,500
you won't be soft-hearted.

448
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,560
Then, you'll become the strongest in the three realms.

449
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,820
Because we took pity on each other and

450
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,420
didn't want to see any of us die,

451
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,140
we faced our fears

452
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,380
and worked together

453
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,780
to win time for survival.

454
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,580
So

455
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,050
emotion is not a burden.

456
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,500
It's the reason we survived this time.

457
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,260
Didn't you want to pass the exam?

458
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,020
Why do you want to cancel the result now?

459
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,480
Wouldn't it all be in vain?

460
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,460
I'm weak.

461
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,140
But I never cheat.

462
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,020
I won't accept

463
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,420
a result that isn't mine.

464
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,620
Firefly.

465
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,220
You scared the firefly away.

466
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,900
Magical Firefly Stone

467
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,020
is now just an ordinary stone.

468
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,340
Here you are.

469
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,890
Have you been eating my flowers?

470
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,740
Why do you keep eating the same one?

471
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,380
Why don't you change to another plant?

472
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,900
Try this.

473
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,700
It tastes better and sweeter.

474
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,540
I found the firefly.

475
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,070
I can return them together to Lord Changheng.

476
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,090
Everything will return to its original place.

477
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,620
I can also rest assured.

478
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,620
It's really him.

479
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,500
Didn't Dongfang Qingcang die 30,000 years ago?

480
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,140
Shuiyuntian said that

481
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,460
to stabilize the three realms.

482
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,220
Dongfang Qingcang's body can't be destroyed.

483
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,540
His primordial spirit can't be reincarnated.

484
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,180
He is the real immortal.

485
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,820
Back then,

486
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,410
Lord Yunzhong

487
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:58,980
gathered the power of the gods

488
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,110
to scatter only his primordial spirit

489
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,670
and seal him in this Haotian Tower.

490
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,660
Could it be that day

491
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,620
when we reinforced the Haotian Matrix?

492
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,560
A little fairy was sucked into the tower.

493
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,180
Could that little fairy break the seal

494
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,030
and gather the primordial spirit of Dongfang Qingcang?

495
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,650
In the three realms,

496
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,870
besides the Goddess of Xishan,

497
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,220
who else can restore souls?

498
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,660
Yesterday, in Shuyu Forest,

499
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,340
how did that fairy

500
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,100
subdue Ying Zhao?

501
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,260
Tell me in detail.

502
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,300
Don't miss out anything.

503
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:46,860
Yes.

504
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,100
Aunt Sansheng,

505
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,740
someone helped me

506
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,000
with my immortal examination this time.

507
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,140
No, no.

508
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,980
I can't say it's Daqiang.

509
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,310
It's a coincidence.

510
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,780
I'll say my result this time

511
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,040
is just a coincidence.

512
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,060
Stop!

513
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,780
What?

514
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,170
Are you a big deal now after winning the first place?

515
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,100
No.

516
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,140
Fairy Danyin,

517
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,740
I'm going to see Aunt Sansheng

518
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,220
to cancel my exam result.

519
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,260
What?

520
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,860
Don't be angry.

521
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,500
I know I don't deserve it.

522
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,700
You don't deserve it?

523
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,380
The person who saved me

524
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,970
is undeserving of the first place?

525
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,820
If you say one more word about canceling the result,

526
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,220
I'll turn you back into your original form.

527
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,380
Orchid,

528
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,340
thank you.

529
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,220
Yeah.

530
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,580
If it weren't for you yesterday,

531
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,910
we would have been dead.

532
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,340
You were just lucky.

533
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,180
Forget it.

534
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,930
You're quite capable.

535
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,700
Much better than some illiterate young lady.

536
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,300
You!

537
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,420
What?

538
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,490
From now on, I'm a member of the Fountain Palace.

539
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,580
Fairy Danyin,

540
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,740
no matter how noble you are,

541
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,260
if you touch me,

542
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,420
what will Lord Changheng

543
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,620
think of you?

544
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,660
She's too much.

545
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,420
Thank you, Fairy Danyin.

546
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,180
For what?

547
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,820
I've always been clear about my grudges and gratitude.

548
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,340
Since you saved my life,

549
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,260
I won't bother you anymore.

550
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,300
But remember,

551
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,290
I still hate you.

552
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,610
Why?

553
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,130
No reason.

554
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,860
Lord Changheng.

555
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,300
You won the first place brilliantly.

556
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,180
Why are you here

557
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,580
instead of celebrating?

558
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,260
Actually,

559
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,100
I want to ask Aunt Sansheng

560
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,860
to cancel my exam result.

561
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,700
Why?

562
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,940
My power is weak.

563
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,060
I got this honor

564
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,980
merely because I was lucky.

565
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,180
Orchid.

566
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,800
After the Ying Zhao incident,

567
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,260
your bravery, wisdom,

568
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,660
and kindness were

569
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,370
seen by everyone.

570
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,140
So

571
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:37,140
you deserve the honor of winning the first place.

572
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,580
Besides,

573
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,580
I'm the judge.

574
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,380
Your result is determined by me.

575
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,700
Thank you, Lord Changheng.

576
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,300
I will continue to work hard.

577
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,100
Wait.

578
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,300
Lord Changheng.

579
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,260
I found your Firefly Stone.

580
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,390
I'll return it to you

581
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,290
This...

582
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:15,760
Hold onto it again.

583
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,139
No. No.

584
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,500
I'm clumsy.

585
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,060
What if I break your...

586
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,580
What's going on?

587
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:32,260
Did you feed it?

588
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,860
I used plants to lure it into the Firefly Stone.

589
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,659
I see.

590
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,219
You are the first person to feed it.

591
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:44,150
It acknowledges you as its master.

592
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,739
Master?

593
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,060
What stupid method did I use?

594
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,980
Lord Changheng.

595
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,820
How about this?

596
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,739
You can feed it some precious plants.

597
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:56,460
Maybe

598
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,540
it will look down on my weeds.

599
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,100
Since the firefly sees you as its master,

600
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,140
then this Firefly Stone is yours.

601
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,340
No, I can't.

602
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,620
How can I take your stone?

603
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,080
Fireflies are spiritual.

604
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,820
I dare not force it to stay with me.

605
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,300
As a disciple of Arbiter,

606
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,050
you should know

607
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,060
we can't force our fate.

608
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,820
So

609
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,090
you're following the will of Heaven,

610
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,620
not stealing others' love.

611
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,060
Aren't you Fairy Orchid who emerged as

612
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,060
first in the immortal examination?

613
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,260
Greetings, Lord Rong Hao.

614
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,770
I don't like people

615
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,220
being too polite.

616
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,460
We'll have many chances to meet

617
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,260
once you enter Fountain Palace.

618
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,660
By the way,

619
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,780
I have a problem now.

620
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,580
Would you

621
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,700
be willing

622
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,620
to help me?

623
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,180
My power is weak.

624
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,500
If you can't figure it out,

625
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,290
how can I be of help to you?

626
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,020
You can definitely help me.

627
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,020
This is

628
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,380
Ice Jade.

629
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,060
Ice Jade has strong vitality.

630
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,180
With enough spiritual energy,

631
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,860
it'll grow with the wind.

632
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,220
Why would it wither?

633
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,980
I heard that plant spirits

634
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,380
have healing abilities.

635
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,420
Please have a look.

636
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,280
Can it be saved?

637
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,330
The root is damaged.

638
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,640
Its spiritual energy is drained.

639
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,330
I'm afraid...

640
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,900
I'll try.

641
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,370
It's alive.

642
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,630
I knew I found the right person.

643
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,500
You flatter me, My Lord.

644
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,340
I have to go back to Arbiter Hall to work.

645
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,500
I'll get going then.

646
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,020
My Lord, what is this?

647
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,620
In this world,

648
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,490
only one person

649
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,220
can purify evil spirit.

650
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,700
Purified evil spirit.

651
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,020
Brought it back to life.

652
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,060
You are indeed...

653
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,700
the Goddess of Xishan.

654
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,420
Master.

655
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,260
Since you died in battle,

656
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,350
there's nothing left for me to think about

657
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,820
in the three realms.

658
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,940
I suffer every day.

659
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,300
Only left with endless pain.

660
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,380
But what I suffered

661
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,660
is nothing compared to yours.

662
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,470
For these 30,000 years,

663
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,500
do you

664
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,020
blame me for my incompetence?

665
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,250
Master, don't be afraid.

666
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,660
Even if I have to turn the world upside down,

667
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,190
even if it means killing everything in the three realms,

668
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,700
I will find a way

669
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,170
to save you.

670
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,620
Master.

671
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,380
Do you know?

672
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,290
We'll meet soon.

673
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:52,000
