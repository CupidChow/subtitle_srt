Is the Four Waters Pearl repaired?

Yes.

39
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,740
The resurrection of Dongfang Qingcang

40
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,340
is the fault of my oversight.

41
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,810
Please forgive me, my brother.

42
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,220
Dongfang Qingcang has resurrected for more than ten days,

43
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,140
but he hasn't returned to the Cangyan Sea

44

and stayed in Yujing.

After his identity was exposed,

46
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,179
he plundered an unknown fairy.

47
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,789
There must be something behind it.

48
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,300

and destroy the Cangyan Sea.

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,250
As the God of War in Shuiyuntian,

how dare you put yourself at risk?

Where do you place your duty to defend Shuiyuntian?

Brother, please forgive me.

56
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,110
It's because I was eager to kill the enemy.

57
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,040
I spoke too much.

58
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,810
Are you eager to kill enemy

59
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,540
or to save people?

60
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,980
Without my order,

Devour.

71
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,940
Since you know the Moon Supreme so well,

72
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,220
do you know what he likes to eat?

73
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,050
What Dongfang Qingcang likes to eat most

74
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,040
is a chubby little fairy with thin skin and tender meat

75
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,260
like you.

76
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,940
Boiled,

Little flower spirit, go!

People of your Moon Tribe

81
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,510
are so unreasonable.

82
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,990
If I didn't accidentally break into the Haotian Tower,

83
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,350
your Moon Supreme

84
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,190
would not know he would be confined for 30,000 years.

85

No, 300,000 years.

86
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,390
Not only do you not thank me,

87
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,230
but you even want to eat me.

88
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,710
You...

89
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,390
Do you have any humanity?

90
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,700
My lord accidentally fell into the tricks of your fairy realm.

91
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,160
That's why he was trapped.

92
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,110
How can a lowly fairy

93
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,270
be the savior of my lord?

94
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,710
Besides,

95
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,840
when did my lord say he wants to eat you?

96
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,110
Isn't the Devouring Immortal House

97
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,910
to eat us fairies?

98
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,790
The Immortal Devouring House

99
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,390
is just an ordinary bedroom.

100
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,310
Some places in Silent Moon Palace are called Immortal Slaying Pavilion.

101
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,310
Some are called Divine Slayer Ward.

102
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,510
They were all established when the first Moon Supreme was alive.

103
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,910
It refers to the auspicious wish of

104
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,070
destroying the Shuiyuntian one day.

105
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:24,790
Really?

106
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,030
You didn't lie to me, did you?

107
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,030
I never lie.

108
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,260
My lord.

109
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,130
You may leave.

110
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,310
Yes.

111
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,230
My lord.

112
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,270
Orchid has settled down in her bedroom.

113

Is the doctors ready?

114
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,260
My lord, don't worry.

115
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,660
Everything is arranged.

116
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,600
After I studied it carefully,

117
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,430
I found that the Xilan Holy Seal really has a way to break it.

118
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,500
If I want to break the curse,

119
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,100
we can only kill one of them

120
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,320
with the ancient sword of Chengying.

121
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,970
Congratulations, my lord.

122
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,460
I don't know this book

123
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,670
was written tens of thousands of years ago.

124
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,900
The Chengying sword

125
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,660
was destroyed in the ancient war.

126
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,060
Even the fragments were scattered everywhere.

127
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,460
My lord, you may not know.

128
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,640
Although the Chengying sword has been destroyed,

129
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,640
the fragments are still traceable.

130
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,740
It is said that there is a piece under the Silver Lake.

131
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,260
I'll go find it now.

132
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,140
So this is what the fairies in the Shuiyuntian look like.

133
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,000
Why does she look different from the one in the book?

134
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,900
Her appearance

135
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,610
is just average.

136
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,460
Yes.

137
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,980
Stop.

138
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,450
Stop touching me.

139
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,100
Who are you?

140
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,500
Why did my lord bring you

141
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,470
from Shuiyuntian?

142
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,210
How would I know?

143
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,380
Does he

144
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,550
like her?

145
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,940
Look at her.

146
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,700
Her face is ordinary.

147
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,060
Her power is not good at first glance.

148
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,180
How could my lord like her?

149
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,980
Exactly.

150
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,340
It's okay to be mocked in Shuiyuntian.

151
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,440
Why am I still being criticized

152
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,170
in the Cangyan Sea?

153
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,210
If the lord didn't like her,

154
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,910
why did he specifically order us to heal her

155
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,210
when he was busy taking over

156
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,550
the affairs of the Moon Tribe?

157
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,580
Look.

158
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,460
These

159
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,140
are the best elixirs in Silent Moon Palace

160
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,230
and are never used for outsiders.

161
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,750
I asked you to heal her.

162
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,960
What are you doing?

163
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,870
Greetings to my lord.

164
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,860
Leave us.

165
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,050
Yes.

166
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,400
Little flower spirit,

167
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,430
What?

168
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,100
Weren't you arrogant to me before?

169
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,430
Now you are afraid of me.

170
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,950
My lord, I was wrong.

171
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:31,860
No.

172
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,650
I hope

173
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,330
you treat me like you used to.

174
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
No, no, no.

175
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,030
It was my fault.

176
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,290
I won't do it again.

177
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:55,850
However.

178
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,670
Even if you are the Moon Supreme,

179
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,680
I have to say it.

180
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,230
Even if you took me away,

181
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,160
you can't take away my heart.

182
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,890
I won't like you.

183
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:06,730
Why?

184
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,150
No reason.

185
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,810
Because I already have someone else in my heart.

186
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,550
Changheng again?

187
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,550
Besides mentioning him,

188
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,150
would you say anything else?

189
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,290
Not really.

190
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,100
Anyway,

191
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,410
it's useless

192
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,840
even if you fall in love with me.

193
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,430
You can't force me.

194
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,230
Ridiculous.

195
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,250
How would I fall in love with you?

196
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,240
If you don't,

197
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,670
Moon Supreme lord,

198
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,770
why don't you just let me go?

199
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,030
Let you go?

200
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,290
Where can you go?

201
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,140
Don't forget

202
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,830
you are a fugitive from Shuiyuntian

203
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,010
and a spy of the Moon Tribe.

204
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,410
There's no place for you to stay.

205
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,170
You lied to me.

206
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,220
I never lied to you.

207
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,520
You are so stupid.

208
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,120
You...

209
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:58,970
Don't forget

210
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,660
I took you away

211
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,720
in front of everyone.

212
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,190
I'm afraid

213
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,120
you'll never be able to wash it off.

214
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,140
From now on,

215
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,150
you will be with me.

216
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,880
Understand?

217
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,730
Fix the Destiny Book

218
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,580
or you won't get out of this room.

219
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,830
This Destiny Book again?

220
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,930
You are a Moon Supreme.

221
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,640
Why do you have to

222
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,280
hold a mortal's Destiny Book every day?

223
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,330
What do you want?

224
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,420
Stop asking.

225
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,300
Just fix it.

226
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,670
I won't fix the Destiny Book.

227
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,390
I won't help the evil.

228
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,260
My lord.

229
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,400
His Highness Xunfeng requests to see you.

230
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,950
He said he wanted to return the sacred artifact of the Moon Tribe,

231
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,950
the You jade ring.

232
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,520
He is outside the hall now.

233
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,400
Let him in.

234
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,640
[Cangyan Sea, the main hall of the Silent Moon Palace]

235
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,630
Greetings to my lord.

236
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,530
Wait.

237
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,780
Let him submit it himself.

238
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,250
Yes.

239
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,810
What's up? Are you afraid that I will kill you?

240
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,150
You are my brother.

241
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,700
A man who did not hesitate to kill his father

242
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,090
for the position of the Moon Supreme.

243
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,060
How can you

244
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,300
show your mercy

245
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,730
to your brother?

246
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,790
When I'm not here,

247
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,450
the Cangyan Sea has no leader.

248
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,290
You are acting on behalf of the Moon Supreme for now.

249
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,670
It's not seizing power.

250
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,870
I want to ask you on behalf of the people of the Cangyan Sea.

251
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,670
30,000 years ago.

252
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,020
Since you were not killed by the fairy realm,

253
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,950
why don't you go back to the Cangyan Sea to take charge of the situation?

254
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,300
As the Moon Supreme,

255
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,510
why do you sit idly

256
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,910
by knowing that there is civil unrest here?

257
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,310
Do you want to ask something about me?

258
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,280
I dare not.

259
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,790
I want you to solve my confusion

260
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,940
and give an explanation to the people of Cangyan Sea.

261
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,020
Why should I

262
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,250
tell you what I do?

263
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,480
I hope what you did

264
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,020
will be worthy of the sacred artifact of the Moon Tribe.

265
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,840
I'll leave.

266
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,450
My lord.

267
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,900
His Highness Xunfeng is so rude.

268
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,840
Is he disloyal?

269
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,080
Nothing.

270
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,030
He just wanted to kill me.

271
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,450
My lord.

272
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,490
I killed his beloved father.

273
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,370
It's not hard to predict that he wants to kill me.

274
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,270
But just him?

275
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,700
Besides, he didn't make any big mistakes.

276
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,460
It's still useful to keep him alive.

277
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,680
We can kill him

278
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,230
after he makes a mistake.

279
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes.

280
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,380
My lord.

281
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,560
The sacred artifact has returned to you now.

282
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,750
Wear it,

283
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,140
although it can't isolate

284
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,490
the conjoined damage from the Heart Curse with the Orchid,

285
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,750
it can get rid of the interference of the mind.

286
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,350
By the way,

287
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,840
is that little flower spirit still refusing to fix the Destiny Book?

288
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,300
Yes.

289
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,280
These days,

290
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,750
she kept saying she wanted to go back to Shuiyuntian.

291
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,520
Now she refuses to apply the medicine.

292
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,480
Nonsense!

293
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,810
How can she recover without the medicine?

294
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,590
If she doesn't recover,

295
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,290
how can she fix the Destiny Book?

296
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,850
Yes.

297
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,280
But I think

298
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,880
the wounds are not a big deal.

299
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,980
I'm afraid she's in a bad mood

300
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,310
and consumes her power.

301
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,600
I'm afraid that fixing the Destiny Book is...

302
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
What should we do?

303
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,890
My lord, calm down.

304
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,910
The little flower spirit is as timid as a mouse.

305
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,640
It's her first time traveling.

306
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,560
So she will be nervous.

307
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,990
First time

308
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,470
traveling.

309
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,720
Find the best jade carpenter in Silent Moon Palace.

310
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,820
Yes.

311
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,610
I didn't expect that

312
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,900
even though I tried my best,

313
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,110
I still failed in the end.

314
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,200
My lord.

315
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,760
The Destiny Book of the god of war...

316
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,490
I've searched the Arbiter Hall.

317
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,560
My master's book is not there.

318
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,250
Dongfang Qingcang stayed with the fairy

319
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,390
in the Arbiter Hall these days.

320
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,250
Did he read the Destiny Book?

321
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,960
That's what I'm worried about.

322
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,490
During the Battle with the two races,

323
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,800
my master was hurt by his Hellfire.

324
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,050
The scars of Hellfire

325
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,790
will never disappear

326
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,470
no matter how reincarnated they are.

327
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,030
If Dongfang Qingcang saw the scars of Hellfire on the red spirit's body

328
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,050
through the book,

329
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,410
we can be sure that she is my master.

330
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,130
If Dongfang Qingcang knows

331
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,020
the primordial spirit of the God of War is still here,

332
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,000
he will try his best to retrieve her primordial spirit

333
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,210
into the Shuofeng sword,

334
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,810
and summon 100,000 soldiers.

335
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,650
Then

336
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,910
the first God of War will turn into ashes.

337
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,230
Your 30,000 years of hard work,

338
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:37,770
wouldn't that be...

339
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,130
I did everything I could

340
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,480
to keep a bit of my master's primordial spirit.

341
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,450
I will never allow anyone

342
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,510
to disrupt my master's revival plan.

343
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,310
Inform the spies of Silent Moon Palace

344
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,820
to confirm if Dongfang Qingcang

345
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,010
knows the presence of the Destiny Book.

346
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,020
After confirmation,

347
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,160
we will try to snatch the goddess.

348
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:07,840
Yes.

349
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,870
[Cangyan Sea  Silent Moon Palace]

350
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,250
Flower sisters.

351
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,720
I beg you.

352
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,400
I know you are the Cangyan Sea's flower.

353
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,700
You don't know me well.

354
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,840
But for the sake of us all being flowers,

355
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,480
please help me this time.

356
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,570
Give me some pollen

357
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,830
to make those two brothers unconscious.

358
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,350
I swear

359
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,780
after I return to the Arbiter Hall,

360
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,460
I will make a tablet for you

361
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,890
and serve you well.

362
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,190
I beg you.

363
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:29,950
Brother.

364
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,480
You can't do anything.

365
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,880
Even if you can get out of this door,

366
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,980
there are countless guards outside.

367
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,380
You can't get out of the Silent Moon Palace.

368
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,280
Follow me.

369
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,950
My lord wants to take you to a place.

370
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,000
Hurry up.

371
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:21,230
Go.

372
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,480
I heard you want to run away.

373
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,920
No, no.

374
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,140
It's okay.

375
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,610
When you move in,

376
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,540
you won't want to run away anymore.

377
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,590
Moon Supreme lord.

378
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,400
I won't run around again.

379
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,200
Don't lock me up in the prison.

380
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,290
I'm afraid of the dark.

381
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,180
If you lock me up in the prison,

382
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,820
I'll go crazy.

383
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,130
Follow me.

384
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,890
Why is it so dark here?

385
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,190
I can't see anything.

386
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,760
Here is not a prison

387
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,320
but a dungeon?

388
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,240
Take a guess.

389
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,850
Moon Supreme lord,

390
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,280
please forgive me.

391
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,590
Don't lower yourself to my level.

392
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,140
I promise

393
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,940
I won't run away again.

394
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,570
Please.

395
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,760
Please send me back to the Devouring Immortal House.

396
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,970
Are you scared?

397
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,700
It's too late.

398
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,700
You'll have to live here from now on.

399
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,760
Follow me.

400
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,850
Where is this?

401
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,900
Why is it so dark?

402
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,230
Where are you taking me?

403
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,720
♫ Fall in love with your clear eyes ♫

404
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,850
♫ It's the most unforgettable scenery along the way ♫

405
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,060
♫ No one can ever replace what we've been through ♫

♫ Stories in the past play in my head ♫

411

♫ I will remember it to the end of my life ♫

Daqiang.

No, big devil.

427
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,010
Big wood.

428
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,430
Is this the Arbiter Hall?

429
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,050
♫ Blaze a way through brambles and thorns to search for you ♫

430

♫ Make light of traveling from afar for days with you ♫

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,750

♫ I will never betray you even if I betray the world ♫

433
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,220
I'm coming.

434
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,170
Great.

435
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,270
There's no place like home.

436
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,950
I'm finally home.

437
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,130
From now on, you can see

438
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,980
such sunrises and sunsets every day.

439
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,240
You don't have to go to the roof of Yunzhong Water Pavilion.

440
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,440
Do you like it?

441
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,090
I specially built it for you.

442
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,790
All the houses, buildings,

443
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,090
every brick tile

444
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,530
are exactly the same as the Arbiter Hall in Shuiyuntian.

445
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,670
I thought you might miss home

446
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,850
because it's your first time traveling.

447
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,580
You can live here in the future.

448
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,720
Here is not Shuiyuntian.

449
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,310
Here is the Cangyan Sea.

450
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,440
Impossible.

451
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,540
This place looks exactly like Shuiyuntian.

452
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,220
How can it not be Shuiyuntian?

453
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,300
Creeper, Holly, Peach.

454
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,350
Come out!

455
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,690
You...

456
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,340
don't like it?

457
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,280
I like it.

458
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,910
Thank you, Moon Supreme lord.

459
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,710
Are you unhappy?

460
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,740
Tell me the truth.

461
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:17,930
Although...

462
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,920
Although it is very similar to the Arbiter Hall...

463
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,600
Yes.

464
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,700
Isn't it good?

465
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,140
The Arbiter Hall is so remote.

466
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,310
I can't see such beautiful sunrises

467
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,790
and these flowers and plants.

468
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,560
They are not my pets.

469
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,250
When I talk to them,

470
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,900
they won't answer me.

471
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,070
What are you trying to say?

472
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,960
I want to go back to my real home.

473
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,310
I told you

474
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,610
this is your home.

475
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,360
From now on,

476
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,290
you are not allowed to go anywhere.

477
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,330
I beg you, Moon Supreme lord.

478
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,460
I helped you hide your traces

479
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,760
in Shuiyuntian.

480
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,810
And I let you hide in the Arbiter Hall for so long.

481
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,970
I treated you well, didn't I?

482
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,450
But if you knew

483
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,790
I'm Dongfang Qingcang,

484
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,680
do you still help me?

485
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,420
No matter what,

486
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,900
we've been together for so long.

487
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,390
I will remember this friendship forever.

488
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,870
Even if I return to Shuiyuntian,

489
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,210
I will never tell anyone

490
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,270
about your traces.

491
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,080
Even if Lord Changheng asks me...

492
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,930
You always talk about Changheng.

493
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:08,900
What else do you have in your brain

494
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,030
besides Changheng?

495
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,100
I will not say it anymore.

496
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,900
Please

497
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,250
let me go back.

498
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,719
You still want to leave!

499
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,650
No matter what you want,

500
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:22,250
I can find it for you in the three realms.

501
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:22,880
Except you,

502
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,320
I didn't indulge anyone else.

503
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,980
Why do you still want to leave?

504
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,409
Why?

505
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,650
Little flower spirit,

506
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,730
let me tell you the truth.

507
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,640
There is no love

508
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,950
between you and me.

509
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,760
When we were in the Arbiter Hall,

510
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,450
I tolerated you

511
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,340
because of the Heart Curse.

512
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,450
Heart Curse?

513
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,590
This damn Curse mark

514
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,770
made me share your joy and sorrow.

515
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,790
That's why I have to

516
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,590
protect you

517
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,720
and take care of you.

518
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,990
But now,

519
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,320
I have the You jade ring.

520
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,960
It can isolate your mind.

521
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,690
Now you are captured by me.

522
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,290
I can finally

523
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,060
get rid of the weakness.

524
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,840
So

525
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,150
all your goodness to me

526
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,340
is fake?

527
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,310
You took me sunbathing.

528
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,080
You took over the morning dew to me.

529
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,620
And you made me flower soup.

530
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,130
It's all fake.

531
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:18,720
Yes.

532
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,240
Not only it's all fake,

533
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,830
I really think

534
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,390
it's disgusting

535
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,360
from my heart.

536
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,470
Keep an eye on her.

537
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,310
Without my order,

538
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,030
she can't leave here.

539
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:04,490
Yes.

540
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,140
Also,

541
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,450
find the fragments of the Chengying sword

542
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,130
under the Silver Lake.

543
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,390
I want to reestablish the Chengying sword.

544
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:16,970
Yes.

545
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,330
Dongfang Qingcang.

546
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,180
How long are you going to lock me up?

547
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,280
What kind of weather is this every day?

548
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,090
It's always thundering, windy, and raining here.

549
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,020
It's so cold that I can't sleep.

550
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,150
There's no sun

551
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,040
and no one to talk to.

552
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,140
Moon Supreme lord.

553
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,440
Dongfang Qingcang.

554
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,830
You're ungrateful.

555
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,090
You bully me like this.

556
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,660
Aren't you afraid of being laughed at by others?

557
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,790
Dongfang Qingcang.

558
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:44,540
Come out!

559
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,140
How is the little flower spirit?

560
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,400
Have she surrendered?

561
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,240
Not yet.

562
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,750
She shouts in the garden every day

563
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,150
and scolds you.

564
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:30,320
But nothing happened recently.

565
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,370
But it is said that

566
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,220
she started a hunger strike again.

567
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,620
She didn't eat anything.

568
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,680
She didn't eat anything.

569
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,220
Good.

570
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,570
She's gluttonous.

571
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,700
It seems that she will surrender soon.

572
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,030
My lord.

573
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,970
the fairy you brought back, she...

574
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,040
What's wrong with her?

575
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,680
She went on a hunger strike

576
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,170
and stood in the windy.

577
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,280
She is going to die.

578
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,130
Why don't you find doctors?

579
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,270
The doctors have gone.

580
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,360
But she refused them to treat her.

581
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,210
She said she won't live long.

582
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,180
And she has something important

583
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,690
to say to you.

584
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,290
Why did you go on a hunger strike?

585
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,380
Why did you freeze yourself?

586
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,810
Who asked you to drive away the doctors?

587
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,810
Do you want to die?

588
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,470
Moon Supreme lord.

589
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,180
I seem to be sick.

590
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,500
Listen.

591
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,180
I don't care about your life.

592
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,620
But your life belongs to me.

593
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,340
So before you fix the Destiny Book,

594
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,190
you have to take care of yourself.

595
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,950
Got it?

596
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,420
Yes.

597
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,140
Do you have anything important to tell me?

598
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,850
Go ahead.

599
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,300
Moon Supreme lord.

600
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,990
Can you go outside to talk with me?

601
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,300
Let's talk here.

602
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,610
No.

603
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,540
I can't say it here.

604
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,670
Stop!

605
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,360
Do you still want to freeze here?

606
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,290
Just say it here.

607
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,500
I have no time to waste with you.

608
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,090
Say it.

609
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,780
Louder!

610
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,790
I can't hear you.

611
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,480
What are you trying to say?

612
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:36,200
