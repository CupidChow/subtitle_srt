4
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,940
Qingcang.

5
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,850
You've always used me as a tool

6
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,259
to revive the Moon Tribe!

7
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,060
You made me suffer the lost of my emotions and my ability to love!

8
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,100
You made me bear the name of killing my own father!

9
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,580
You made me a monster that everyone avoids!

10
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,740
Have you ever felt heartbroken for me?

11
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,580
Or have you ever found it a little unbearable to see me suffer?

12
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,180
Qingcang,

13
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,579
you were young, strong,

14
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,180
and talented.

15
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,579
I believed

16
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,500
you can master the Hellfire.

17
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,130
You

18
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,900
are the hope

19
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,560
of the survival of the Moon Tribe.

20
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,980
This again.

21
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,370
I'm sick of it.

22
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,460
Let me ask you now.

23
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,590
If you could turn back time,

24
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:51,510
would you make a different choice?

25
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,500
Say something!

26
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,700
If I could turn back time,

27
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,180
I would have made the same decision.

28
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,380
I knew it.

29
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,060
No matter what,

30
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,220
it's my duty to revive the Moon Tribe.

31
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,100
But you are...

32
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,780
a father who is worse than a beast.

33
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,100
That's why you have a son

34
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,500
who is worse than a beast.

35
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,180
Son.

36
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,940
At that time,

37
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,140
I had no choice.

38
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,980
I really had no choice.

39
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,180
You don't have to look so hypocritical!

40
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,140
Aren't you always fierce, strict,

41
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,020
and firm?

42
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,020
Why are you saying this now?

43
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,650
My Lord,

44
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,100
Chidi Woman led the immortal army and attacked us.

45
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,500
We lost the south of

46
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,459
Silver Lake.

47
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,060
My Lord,

48
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,740
the north has fallen.

49
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,980
Eight thousand soldiers of ours

50
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,260
were wiped out.

51
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,840
Father,

52
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,620
you promised me

53
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,550
that you'll play football with me.

54
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,820
After all,

55
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,800
you still treated me as a sharp blade without emotions.

56
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,380
You used me as a tool to resist the Fairy Realm.

57
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,659
I couldn't bear to see you suffer.

58
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,460
How dare you say that!

59
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,340
You're even being cruel now!

60
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,270
You couldn't bear to see me suffer?

61
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,940
You should have killed me.

62
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,860
Back then,

63
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,940
you should have killed me!

64
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,000
But what did you do?

65
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,100
You made me suffer a lot.

66
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,340
I'd rather die.

67
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,000
I couldn't bear to see you suffer.

68
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,500
That's why I chose for you to kill me.

69
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,580
Have you considered my feelings?

70
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,980
I don't have time to listen

71
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,020
to a dying soul now.

72
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,540
Wait.

73
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,740
The First Moon Supreme,

74
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,180
what do you mean by letting him kill you?

75
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,460
I read the secret book.

76
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,780
It didn't state

77
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,140
that only by killing your loved one

78
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,800
can you completely destroy the seven emotions.

79
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,140
That's because

80
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,780
emotions are hard to destroy.

81
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,700
Every time he comes back to life,

82
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,860
it takes a thousand years to remove them completely again.

83
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,750
Besides the secret technique,

84
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,260
if you can kill your loved one,

85
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,540
your emotions can be completely destroyed

86
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,340
in that moment.

87
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,900
So,

88
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,140
you chose to let him

89
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,140
kill you.

90
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,100
It's worth sacrificing my life.

91
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,659
Qingcang,

92
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,300
your emotional root has recovered.

93
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,820
That's why you're in so much pain.

94
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,820
Let me ask you.

95
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,490
Are you going to be

96
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,740
the invincible Moon Supreme

97
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,660
and bring the Moon Tribe back to glory?

98
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,540
Or

99
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,860
you want all of your previous sufferings

100
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,580
to be in vain?

101
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,820
If you continue to indulge in your emotions and love,

102
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,700
you will be in pain.

103
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,100
You can't escape from it.

104
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:27,900
Qingcang,

105
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,820
pull out your Hellfire sword

106
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,740
and shatter my soul!

107
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,620
Then you can get rid of your emotional root.

108
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,940
Hurry up!

109
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,460
I can't do it.

110
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,740
You can do it.

111
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,390
Qingcang, have you forgotten?

112
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,140
You did it once before.

113
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,100
You can do it again.

114
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,300
My boy.

115
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,140
If you don't get rid of your emotional root,

116
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,780
you will be trapped in pain forever.

117
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,840
Do you understand?

118
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,940
Are you willing to bear

119
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,220
the pain of killing your own father?

120
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,260
Come!

121
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,970
Recently,

122
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,720
I kept thinking during the day and

123
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,850
dreaming at night.

124
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,540
They were the happy moments of us

125
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,260
practicing sword fighting and playing football.

126
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,140
So this time, I have to make my own decision.

127
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,640
I'd rather bear the pain of killing my own father

128
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,150
and bear the pain caused by emotions and love.

129
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,110
I don't want to forget these feelings.

130
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,180
Come.

131
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,180
Qingcang.

132
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,060
Wooden Head,

133
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,140
what are you thinking?

134
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,980
Kick it.

135
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,100
Wooden Head,

136
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,060
if you miss this chance,

137
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,590
you won't have another one.

138
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,980
Kick it.

139
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,140
Father.

140
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,360
How many lightning strikes are left?

141
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,060
My Lord,

142
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,970
30 flashes of lightning were struck just now for the

143
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,460
punishment of 81 lightning strikes.

144
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,920
There are 51 strikes left.

145
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,460
I'll take

146
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,140
the rest for him.

147
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,380
My Lord,

148
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:14,840
this...

149
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,780
My Lord, your body is precious.

150
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,640
How can you take the punishment on behalf of anyone?

151
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,540
Dongfang Qingcang,

152
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,700
what tricks are you playing?

153
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,620
Execute it.

154
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,890
♫ Waiting for the moment when the sky collapses and the ground cracks ♫

155
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,490
♫ When it collapses and shatters, open eyes ♫

156
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,380
Do you want me to say it again?

157
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:18,110
♫ There is nowhere to put the soul but only to land ♫

158
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,020
Execute it.

159
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,250
♫ If our souls get to know each other in the world ♫

160
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,270
♫ Watching the vows come and go ♫

161
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:31,280
♫ I can't bear the world without you ♫

162
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,610
♫ The last of love ♫

163
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,050
♫ The tenderness of fingers tangled ♫

164
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,600
♫ Turned into a sharp sword and stabbed at me ♫

165
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,220
♫ Farewell Love ♫

166
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,570
♫ Blurs time and distance ♫

167
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,780
♫ Even time is suspended ♫

168
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,180
♫ All because of you ♫

169
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:04,020
♫ Make sure you are the only one in my heart ♫

170
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,620
♫ It's too late to say goodbye ♫

171
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,650
♫ I can't speak the regret ♫

172
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,300
♫ Too late ♫

173
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,570
The punishment of 81 lightning strikes is completed.

174
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:23,980
Dongfang Qingcang!

175
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,500
My Lord!

176
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,500
Wooden Head, are you alright?

177
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,040
♫ If our souls get to know each other in the world ♫

178
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,980
Dongfang Qingcang.

♫ Watching the vows come and go ♫

180
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,100
Don't think I'll thank you

00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,260
♫ I can't bear the world without you ♫

182
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,560
for your pretentious act.

183
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,840
Even in death, I will get my

♫ The last of love ♫

185
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,500
revenge for father.

Your Highness Xunfeng.

187
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,570
♫ The tenderness of fingers tangled ♫

188
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,020
As his brother,

189
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:52,380
♫ Turned into a sharp sword and stabbed at me ♫

190
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,580
do you really know his pain?

191
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,260
Do you know the truth between them?

192
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,740
♫ Farewell Love ♫

193
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,870
You only cared about yourself.

♫ Blurs time and distance ♫

195
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,540
You know nothing.

♫ Even time is suspended ♫

♫ Make sure you are the only one in my heart ♫

00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:23,790
♫ Too late ♫

00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,300
It has been so long.

204
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,430
Why is he not up yet?

205
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,840
♫ Too late ♫

206
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,110
Lightning strikes are strong.

207
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,460
Even the Lord can't take it.

208
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,810
Although his life is not in danger,

209
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,620
it will take some time

210
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,800
to recuperate.

211
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:51,820
♫ Farewell Love ♫

212
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,140
You're awake.

213
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,690
Where are you going?

214
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,070
I'm not going anywhere.

215
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,760
Your medicine is almost ready.

216
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,490
I need to keep an eye on the fire.

217
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,910
The medicine is...

218
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,650
Moon Supreme Lord?

219
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,750
Moon Supreme Lord?

220
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:35,980
Are you

221
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,850
willing to bear the pain of killing your own father?

222
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,280
Recently,

223
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,030
I kept thinking during the day and

224
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,130
dreaming at night.

225
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,690
They were the happy moments of us

226
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,500
practicing sword fighting and playing football.

227
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,430
So this time, I have to make my own decision.

228
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,300
I'd rather bear the pain of killing my own father

229
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,740
and bear the pain caused by emotions and love.

230
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't want to forget these feelings.

231
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,280
In the past, when it was my father's death anniversary,

232
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,970
I didn't feel anything.

233
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,870
Now

234
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,410
when I think that today is his death anniversary...

235
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,750
When I think that...

236
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,930
I'll never see him again...

237
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,110
If I destroy the Love Tree,

238
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,300
will the suffering end?

239
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,250
Will the suffering end?

240
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,670
I don't blame him.

241
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,180
I don't blame him anymore.

242
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,940
Time to take your medicine.

243
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,440
Why do I have to take the medicine again?

244
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
It's bitter.

245
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,490
How can I take it?

246
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,450
How can you recover without taking medicine?

247
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,230
Because you didn't want to take the medicine,

248
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,710
you haven't recovered for days.

249
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,220
The wounds are getting more and more painful.

250
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,110
I have to hold you for you to walk.

251
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,080
Take it.

252
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,810
Take it in one go. You won't taste the bitterness.

253
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,040
If you take it,

254
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,810
I can make your favorite fresh flower cakes for you.

255
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,030
Assorted flavors

256
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,090
with honey.

257
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,960
What do you mean by letting him kill you?

258
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,310
I read the secret book.

259
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,570
It didn't state

260
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,620
that only by killing your loved one

261
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,280
can you completely destroy the seven emotions.

262
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,610
If you can kill your loved one,

263
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,810
your emotions can be completely destroyed

264
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,580
in that moment.

265
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,900
Once you're done,

266
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,580
get up and walk more.

267
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,630
The doctor said

268
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,470
you have to be able to walk freely

269
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,280
for your wounds to be

270
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,750
considered better.

271
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,620
No.

272
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,340
It still hurts.

273
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,110
I need your help.

274
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,560
My Lord, His Highness Xunfeng wants to see you.

275
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,660
What is he doing here?

276
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,930
Forget it. Let him in.

277
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,470
Brother.

278
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,490
How is your injury?

279
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,830
It's just the punishment of lightning strikes.

280
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,290
I'm fine after some sleep.

281
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,590
What about you?

282
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,600
What brings you here?

283
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,780
It's to

284
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,970
tell you the truth about Haishi City.

285
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,290
30,000 years ago,

286
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,730
the news of you being killed by the Fairy Realm

287
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,990
spread to Cangyan Sea.

288
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,050
Southern and Northern Youxian County had a mutiny one after the other.

289
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,980
They intended to take over the Ninth Youxian County.

290
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,880
When I was extremely anxious,

291
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,160
a mysterious man came to me.

292
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,290
The Lord of Haishi City?

293
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,230
I don't know who he is and

294
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
where he is from.

295
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,780
But he told me,

296
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,110
as long as I can help him build Haishi City,

297
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,550
he can help me control the Kings of Southern and Northern Youxian County.

298
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,640
He never takes off his mask

299
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,970
and shows his real face.

300
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,480
So at first, I didn't trust him.

301
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,080
But...

302
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,890
But both kings were pressing.

303
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,040
So you accepted any help that came your way.

304
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,250
You even put the fate of the Ninth Youxian County

305
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,770
in the hands of an unknown person.

306
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,770
Go on.

307
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,130
Did you see his face after that?

308
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,820
No.

309
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,100
Not asking for his identity was

310
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,820
one of his conditions for helping me.

311
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,500
30,000 years ago,

312
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,020
at this timing.

313
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,790
Is the Lord of Haishi City

314
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,810
also involved in the Great War?

315
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,850
Since you told me previously that

316
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,660
the Lord of Haishi City secretly used the primordial spirit of the dead of the Moon Tribe

317
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,870
to make evil spirits,

318
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,180
I recalled

319
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,730
what happened in the past 30,000 years carefully and

320
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,460
noticed something unnatural.

321
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,680
Every time when I was close to losing the war,

322
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,920
he always helped me to turn the tide.

323
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,730
Every time I had the upper hand,

324
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,730
the Southern and Northern Youxian County

325
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,370
always got away safely.

326
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,230
The Lord of Haishi City's planning

327
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,960
is like...

328
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,820
Always letting you fight against each other

329
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,650
without getting a definite result.

330
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,390
The three kings of Cangyan Sea engaged in

331
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,140
civil unrest that lasted for tens of thousands of years.

332
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,660
This caused the power of the Moon Tribe to perish for no reason.

333
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,610
I'm so stupid.

334
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,220
I feel guilty towards my people.

335
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,490
I deserve to die.

336
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,110
You shouldn't have pardoned me the day before yesterday.

337
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,920
I didn't pardon you.

338
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,680
From now on,

339
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,910
you have to win on the battlefield

340
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,940
to correct your mistake.

341
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,450
Yes.

342
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,280
You may leave.

343
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,570
What?

344
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,190
Are there any details missing?

345
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,620
No.

346
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,220
In that case,

347
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,220
you may leave now.

348
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,070
Yes.

349
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,060
Wooden Head,

350
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,310
are you still holding a grudge against His Highness Xunfeng

351
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,320
for wanting

352
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,090
to kill you?

353
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,850
There are tens of thousands of people in the three realms

354
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,820
who want to kill me.

355
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,220
He's not even on the list.

356
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,930
It's such a trivial matter.

357
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,400
Since he has admitted his mistake,

358
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,870
I don't blame him.

359
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,150
Why do you ask?

360
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,870
Just now,

361
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,460
didn't you see

362
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,390
his desire to speak?

363
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,530
He wanted to tell you something,

364
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,170
but he's afraid to bring up what happened in the past

365
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,350
and upset you.

366
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,070
Did he really misunderstand?

367
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,000
You finally made up after so long.

368
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,480
I think

369
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,370
next time you see him,

370
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,460
don't always

371
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,470
act like the almighty Moon Supreme

372
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,820
and scold him.

373
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,570
If it were me,

374
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,510
I would be scared too.

375
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,560
You need to do something intimate.

376
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,200
This way, he will know

377
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,010
that you've forgiven him.

378
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,650
Something intimate?

379
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,690
You don't want to?

380
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,340
I don't know how.

381
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,100
People only taught me how to become stronger,

382
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,690
how to kill,

383
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,320
and how to conquer the world.

384
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,090
But no one has ever taught me

385
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,820
how to get close to others.

386
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,610
This is very simple.

387
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,570
Let me teach you.

388
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,180
Next time you see him,

389
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,520
don't pull a long face.

390
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,570
You need to smile.

391
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,210
Come on, smile for me.

392
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:57,940
Can you smile more naturally?

393
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,910
Look.

394
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,930
This is a good angle.

395
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,710
Is this enough?

396
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:43,930
No.

397
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,000
You are brothers.

398
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,550
Next time you see him,

399
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,190
you need to be more friendly.

400
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,950
How?

401
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,990
Let me think.

402
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,470
I got it.

403
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,690
Next time you see him,

404
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,660
you can hug him.

405
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,960
How?

406
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,430
Like this....

407
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,920
Hug him like this

408
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,900
or pat his shoulder.

409
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,490
Next time you see him,

410
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,000
you'll do it, right?

411
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:25,680
No.

412
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:26,980
Why?

413
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,580
It's cheesy.

414
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,880
How is this cheesy?

415
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,730
How is this cheesy?

416
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,300
What are you thinking?

417
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,030
Why are you smiling so happily?

418
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,760
Jieli,

419
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,270
have you ever noticed that

420
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,530
sometimes

421
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,530
the Moon Supreme Lord is quite cute?

422
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,630
Cute?

423
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,679
Are you alright?

424
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,280
How can the Moon Supreme be linked to cuteness?

425
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,770
You didn't see it.

426
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,080
When he was learning how to smile at people,

427
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,340
he was silly and cute.

428
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,020
He'll do whatever you tell him to do.

429
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,080
He is very serious.

430
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,139
Orchid, Orchid.

431
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,600
You're really something.

432
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,530
I thought I was a good liar.

433
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:31,870
You don't show it normally.

434
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,010
But I didn't expect you

435
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,060
to be so good

436
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,670
at acting.

437
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,389
First, you risked your life

438
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:41,949
to find the first Moon Supreme's primordial spirit at the bottom of Memory Loss River.

439
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,600
Then, you even boiled medicine and made pastries for him every day.

440
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,770
Whenever you talk about him,

441
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,250
you smile and glow.

442
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,360
If I hadn't known you were acting,

443
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,159
I would have been like the Moon Supreme

444
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,380
and think you've

445
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,110
betrayed Shuiyuntian for him.

446
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,710
Are you

447
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,810
not acting?

448
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,700
You mean it?

449
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,630
No way.

450
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,940
Of course I was acting.

451
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,210
Good acting, right?

452
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:54,060
My Lord, Lord Xunfeng wants to see you.

453
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,790
Is what you said

454
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:05,800
true?

455
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,760
The seal that holds 100,000 soldiers

456
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,150
at Xuanxu Realm for 30,000 years

457
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,950
can be broken?

458
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,870
Yes.

459
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,350
The next reincarnation of Chidi Woman who'll be experiencing hardships

460
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,780
is called Xie Wanqing.

461
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,370
When she is born,

462
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,510
I want you to go to Yunmeng Lake immediately

463
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,320
and take her to Xuanxu Realm.

464
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,420
Place her primordial spirit into Shuofeng sword.

465
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,180
It can break the seal,

466
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,440
and you can bring back 100,000 soldiers.

467
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,790
I'll set out immediately.

468
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,050
Wait!

469
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,090
What else can I do for you?

470
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,260
You're still injured.

471
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,100
You must be careful.

472
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,010
Yes.

473
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,610
So he didn't hug him.

474
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,760
He was shy.

475
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,100
For him,

476
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,160
it's a massive improvement.

477
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,800
Shangque,

478
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,740
your Lord has feelings now.

479
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,690
He knows forgiveness, kindness, and mercy.

480
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,860
That's great.

481
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,430
What's wrong with you two?

482
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,440
Are you unhappy?

483
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,700
Not really.

484
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,550
The Lord and His Highness Xunfeng made up.

485
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,560
They are working together.

486
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,690
Of course I'm happy.

487
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:41,620
But,

488
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,630
if the Lord really changed

489
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,680
as you said,

490
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,250
is he still the Moon Supreme?

491
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,720
Why not?

492
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,310
Since ancient times,

493
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,410
the Fairies and the Moon Tribe have been enemies.

494
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,600
Yannv, our first ancestor, once passed an ancestral teaching.

495
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,940
Only a tough general who

496
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,490
never gives up on hatred

497
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:59,760
is the key of the survival of the Moon Tribe.

498
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,480
Why must there be hatred?

499
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,510
Whether it's the Moon Tribe or the Fairies,

500
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,850
there are good people.

501
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,710
Let's not talk about Shuiyuntian.

502
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,640
Anyway,

503
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,400
the Lord will destroy the Fairy Realm

504
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,540
to avenge the Moon Tribe.

505
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,220
I believe he won't give up.

506
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,020
That's because you didn't see how

507
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,080
he was with the first Moon Supreme.

508
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,770
He's different now.

509
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,590
He's no longer the Dongfang Qingcang we know.

510
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,360
Jieli,

511
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,620
what's with that look?

512
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:39,910
My Lord.

513
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,300
My Lord.

514
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,510
Are my fresh flower cakes ready?

515
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,140
Have you taken your medicine?

516
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,910
The medicine is too bitter.

517
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,340
But I've finished it.

518
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,390
Not a drop left.

519
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,630
The fresh flower cakes are almost ready.

520
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,600
I'll get them.

521
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,060
Wait.

522
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,400
What is this?

523
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,460
According to the Moon Tribe's rules,

524
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,930
if you want to thank someone,

525
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,330
you have to use your blood

526
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,840
and apply it to that person's face.

527
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,840
Thank you very much.

528
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,910
No, this is your blood.

529
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,910
I guessed you may not like blood,

530
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,220
so I changed it to cinnabar.

531
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,830
Can I not apply it?

532
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,380
No.

533
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,870
This is the first time I've ever thanked a person.

534
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,110
Don't refuse me.

535
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:40,560
