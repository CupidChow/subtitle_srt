[Episode 23]

4
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,340
Oh my god.

5
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,620
I'm exhausted.

6
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,699
Do you know?

7
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,550
Xiao Run is really something.

8
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,530
He posted 500 portraits of you in the city.

9
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,460
Five hundred...

10
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,110
Portraits.

11
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,220
I, Shangque,

12
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,690
and the servant, Qu Shui

13
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,700
teared them for four hours.

14
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,060
My legs are thinner.

15
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,390
It's all because of your bad idea.

16
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,500
You not only let Xiao Run and Xie Wanqing don't meet,

17
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,100
but also helped Xiao Run

18
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,780
and his fairy in the painting.

19
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,790
If Xie Wanying fails to experience the hardships,

20
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,470
ruining my plan,

21
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,410
I will send you to Silver Lake

22
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,750
to dig rocks and mine.

23
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,630
Don't blame Jieli for that.

24
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,400
It's because of you, Moon Supreme Lord who is too charming.

25
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,540
You dated with Lady Wanqing under the moonlight

26
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,270
and made her fall in love with you at first sight

27
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,000
with uncompromising honesty.

28
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,220
I don't deserve

29
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,220
what the fairy in the painting said.

30
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,930
Why is her lover in the dream so modest?

31
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,110
Good things come after a long time.

32
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,370
Don't be too anxious.

33
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,040
Persuade the lord.

34
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,140
Now you want to order me around?

35
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,910
You ordered Qu Shui around

36
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,240
and smiled at him today.

37
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,140
Isn't it exciting?

38
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,329
Why are you acting weirdly?

39
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:40,329
I just don't understand

40
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,430
why you are so interested

41
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,480
in Qu Shui?

42
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,070
Because he's interesting because of his stupidity.

43
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,870
just like his master,

44
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,920
who is a fool.

45
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,800
But you always say

46
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,400
I'm the most stupid person in the three realms.

47
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,200
In terms of stupidity,

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,800
can he be more stupid than me?

49
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,810
Stupid Black Dragon,

50
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,400
If you want to be the best in the three realms like the lord,

51
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,040
can you learn something good?

52
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,180
That's not what I mean.

53
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,310
Then what do you mean?

54
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,040
-Stop arguing. -Stop arguing.

55
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,640
Forget it.

56
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,940
Let's be serious.

57
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,650
Jieli.

58
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,000
It's been a long day.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,880
They haven't

60
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,269
met each other.

61
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,480
What should we do?

62
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,950
I...

63
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,130
Are you still counting on her?

64
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,200
Forget it.

65
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,080
In my opinion,

66
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,760
I'd better go to Xiao Run

67
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,850
and talk to him face to face

68
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,910
to make him give up.

69
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,590
Talk to him face to face?

70
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,670
His heart and eyes are full of you.

71
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,270
If you meet him now,

72
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,900
I'm afraid

73
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,630
you will get married tomorrow.

74
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,100
This isn't OK! That isn't OK!

75
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,940
Then tell me

76
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,940
what should we do?

77
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,110
I got it.

78
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,460
Orchid,

79
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,640
do you want to go to meet Xiao Run?

80
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,350
It's OK.

81
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,920
But you can't meet him like this.

82
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,170
All right.

83
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,770
Perfect.

84
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,920
If Xiao Run sees the fairy in his heart

85
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,600
looks like this,

86
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,860
I'm sure he'll give up.

87
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,470
Here, take a look.

88
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,380
Is it too...

89
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,320
No.

90
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,520
It's not ugly enough.

91
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,690
I'll do it myself.

92
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,250
Moon Supreme Lord.

93
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,260
No need.

94
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,350
No.

95
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,150
Since it's to make Xiao Run give up,

96
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,620
the uglier, the better.

97
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,400
Changheng

98
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,920
has become a mortal now.

99
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,180
He even likes

100
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,900
you, an ordinary girl.

101
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,490
My lord is really good at making up.

102
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,260
If Xiao Run had a look at Orchid now,

103
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,659
he would have nightmares after going home.

104
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,760
Do you remember what I said?

105
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,270
I should be as rude as I could,

106
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,210
and as vulgar as I could.

107
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,050
After meeting Xiao Run today,

108
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:46,810
I should make sure

109
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,909
his love for me will be gone.

110
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,370
What's your hurry?

111
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,640
You used to be lazy

112
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,280
and didn't want to get up early.

113
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,540
You are quite active to meet Xiao Run now.

114
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,770
I just hope

115
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,290
he can experience the hardships as soon as possible.

116
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,510
Moon Supreme Lord.

117
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,520
I've sacrificed so much.

118
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,830
Don't you believe

119
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,090
I have no personal feelings for Xiao Run?

120
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,290
There's no rush.

121
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,810
You'd better go there after noon.

122
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,780
Let Xiao Run wait for a long time.

123
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,910
He must have a worse impression of you.

124
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,360
Fine.

125
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,450
I'll listen to you.

126
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,260
[The mansion of Dongfang]

127
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:43,970
Remember,

128
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,409
stay away from him when you talk.

129
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,670
Don't look at him.

130
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,060
Don't smile at him.

131
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,720
Don't go to the place where there are few people.

132
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,330
Moon Supreme Lord,

133
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,800
why are you so weird today?

134
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,740
Why are you so talkative and overcautious?

135
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,550
Are you so worried about me?

136
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,650
You talked too much.

137
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:08,880
I'm leaving.

138
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,420
Wait.

139
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,540
What is this?

140
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:21,520
Food.

141
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,890
I'm leaving.

142
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,370
Xiao Run.

143
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,440
F... Fairy in the painting.

144
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,590
It's really you.

145
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,850
You really came.

146
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,360
Fairy in the painting.

147
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,660
So mysterious.

148
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,840
What a stupid name!

149
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,720
I don't like it.

150
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,430
Also,

151
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,630
why are you staring at me?

152
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,110
Maybe she's

153
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,440
testing me.

154
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,130
Lady, you misunderstood me.

155
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,230
I was thinking

156
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,330
I've never seen a woman

157
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,330
with such an extraordinary makeup.

158
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,990
It has an ancient meaning.

159
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,830
And the crown

160
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,180
is refreshing and elegant.

161
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,320
I think only you

162
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,410
who is unworldly

163
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,970
and elegant

164
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,970
can match with it.

165
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,490
I'm so late.

166
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,490
Aren't you angry?

167
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,430
Why would I be angry?

168
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,990
You dressed up so carefully.

169
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,720
I think you attach great importance to meeting me.

170
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,690
Naturally, I should wait for you longer.

171
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,780
Not to mention half a day,

172
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,880
even if it's three or five days,

173
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,590
I will wait.

174
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,980
Does Xiao Run have eye disease?

175
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,680
Beauty is in the lover's eyes.

176
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,140
No.

177
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,320
I have to go.

178
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,380
My lord,

179
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,060
they just met.

180
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,920
Why don't we wait a little longer?

181
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,390
I thought

182
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,080
it was just a coincidence in the dream on the night of the Lantern Festival.

183
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,940
I didn't expect

184
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,030
to see you today.

185
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,730
How dare you say that?

186
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,830
I...

187
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,670
I'm here to question you.

188
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,400
Why do you have my painting?

189
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,920
You even posted my painting all over Lucheng City.

190
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,510
It's so ugly.

191
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,120
It didn't even show a bit of my beauty.

192
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,280
You are right.

193
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,670
You are so extraordinary.

194
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,770
But I'm not good at painting.

195
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,770
I couldn't draw a bit of your beauty.

196
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,720
But don't worry.

197
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,480
I will practice more in the future.

198
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,400
When I go back today,

199
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll paint it again

200
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,840
according to your makeup today.

201
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,810
No need.

202
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,110
No need.

203
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,670
Lord Changheng has become a mortal.

204
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,970
Although his personality has changed a lot,

205
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,990
he is still so gentle.

206
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,950
I'm being unreasonable,

207
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,890
but he's not angry at all.

208
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,470
So

209
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,410
I have to continue to annoy him.

210
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,820
I've been tired all day.

211
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,210
I'm exhausted.

212
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,050
I can't walk anymore.

213
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,310
Let me massage my feet.

214
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,320
So comfortable.

215
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,140
He must hate me this time.

216
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,120
I used to think that I was unrestrained.

217
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,640
I didn't expect you to be a real scholar.

218
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,160
Wonderful!

219
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,300
Interesting!

220
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:01,890
No.

221
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,110
I have to go.

222
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,280
My lord,

223
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,500
Xiao Run must not be killed.

224
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,850
Please think twice, my lord.

225
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,860
Who said I want to kill him?

226
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,160
She is fearful.

227
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,960
She can't even act.

228
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,470
We can't count on her.

229
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,000
Making Xiao Run give up

230
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,230
depends on me.

231
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,250
My lord.

232
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,760
Lady is indeed extraordinary.

233
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,520
You're like a fairy outside the world.

234
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,000
To be honest,

235
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,310
I may offend you,

236
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,640
but I have to spit it out.

237
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,270
I always feel that

238
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,160
you and I are destined to be together.

239
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,050
You are here, honey.

240
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,940
I've been looking for you for a long time.

241
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,000
Brother Dongfang.

242
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,890
Wooden Head.

243
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,290
Why are you following me?

244
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,000
What are you doing?

245
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,000
The floor is cold.

246
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,880
Be careful.

247
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,660
Don't move.

248
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,560
Don't move!

249
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,330
Brother Dongfang, you...

250
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,860
How could you do this to her?

251
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,960
My wife has been married to me for three years.

252
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,380
Who married you?

253
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,450
Honey,

254
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,180
why are you still angry with me?

255
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,350
I...

256
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,990
You're pregnant

257
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,460
and toilsome.

258
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,760
I shouldn't have made you angry.

259
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,940
I know I was wrong.

260
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,880
You're pregnant.

261
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,770
You shouldn't eat too much ice bowls.

262
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,110
I was too anxious

263
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,640
so I said those harsh words.

264
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,060
When our child is born,

265
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,870
I'll take you to the whole Lucheng City to eat delicious food.

266
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,040
Whatever you want to eat,

267
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,840
it's up to you.

268
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,940
You've gone too far.

269
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,540
Getting married is ridiculous enough.

270
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,470
But you lied that I'm pregnant.

271
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,730
Jieli can't even make up

272
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,830
such a terrible lie.

273
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,630
How can you make Xiao Run give up,

274
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,820
if I didn't do like this?

275
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,000
This is too much.

276
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,260
Look at him.

277
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,660
You already feel sorry for him?

278
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,710
I didn't.

279
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,070
Let's go, honey.

280
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:03,910
Let's go home.

281
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,000
By the way,

282
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,750
Xiao Run.

283
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,060
We are brothers.

284
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,410
I didn't want to mention the past.

285
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,840
I thought if you couldn't find her,

286
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,700
you would give up after a few days.

287
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,780
I didn't expect

288
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,710
my wife was angry with me today

289
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,970
so she agreed your invitation

290
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,970
and caused this misunderstanding.

291
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,330
I...

292
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,630
I won't blame the ignorant.

293
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,310
Give my wife's painting back.

294
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,070
Honey, let's go.

295
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,490
We've gone so far.

296
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,960
Why don't you let me go?

297
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,350
What my wife said is inappropriate.

298
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,650
If Xiao Run comes,

299
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,080
our tricks will be exposed.

300
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,590
Who is your wife?

301
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,320
Why are you addicted to acting?

302
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,430
Why are you still mad at me, honey?

303
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,040
Let go of me!

304
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,329
What is that?

305
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,079
Haven't you seen it?

306
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,099
Follow me.

307
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:13,730
Wait.

308
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,470
Am I going like this?

309
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,130
Can you help bring me back to the beautiful appearance I used to be?

310
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,100
Have you thought about it?

311
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,550
No?

312
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,780
My wish is to destroy  Shuiyuntian,

313
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,560
kill those hypocritical immortals

314
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,820
and comfort my father.

315
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,440
Then unify the three realms

316
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,030
so that the people of Cangyan Sea

317
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,060
will suffer less diseases, less disasters,

318
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,920
and never suffer the separation.

319
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,500
But I will do these

320
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,270
by myself.

321
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,140
Why do I need to light the Kongming Lantern and pray to heaven?

322
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,470
That should be the case.

323
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,470
Why would I expect something else from him?

324
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,330
What about you?

325
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,290
Why haven't you written it yet?

326
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,260
I haven't decided yet.

327
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,580
I'm the Supreme Lord of the three realms.

328
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,280
If you want a Kongming Lantern to fulfill your wish,

329
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,610
you might as well beg me.

330
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,710
If I am happy,

331
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,310
I might agree.

332
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,370
Really?

333
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,890
I always keep my word.

334
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,510
My wish is actually very simple.

335
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,780
It's just that

336
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:54,420
♫ It was a memorable experience to meet you ♫

337
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,000
there is no war in the Memory Loss River.

338
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,750
Wars disappear and become sunlight and moonlight.

339
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:02,950
♫ I saw myself in your eyes ♫

340
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,780
You want to persuade me to stop the war again.

341
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,710
♫ I thought it a dream but I could never wake up ♫

342
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,000
For tens of thousands of years,

343
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,400
the Moon Tribe has suffered a lot of suffering from the separation and rebellion.

344
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:13,830
♫ Gradually I fell in love with you ♫

345
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,820
With the war,

346
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,550
how many tragedies will happen

347
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,280
no matters it's in the Moon Tribe or in Immortals?

348

♫ I stuck together with you in life and death ♫

♫ I rivaled against the world to guard you ♫

350
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,640
You don't want Shuiyuntian to be attacked by war.

♫ If we would finally part ♫

352

Then what about the pain of our ancestors being betrayed,

353
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,870
♫ I'd rather clear my memory ♫

354
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,400
and the humiliation of the people of Cangyan Sea?

355

♫ With a new identity ♫

356

♫ And meet you again in the next life ♫

357
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,090
The 100,000 soldiers of the Cangyan Sea

358
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,280
have been sealed in the Xuanxu Realm for 30,000 years.

359
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:41,980
♫ To rewrite the ending that is to be continued ♫

360

They are other people's sons,

361
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,060
husbands and fathers.

362
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,790
They also want to go home.

363
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,560
I grew up in Shuiyuntian.

364
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,160
However, he is the Moon Supreme of Cangyan Sea.

365
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,240
People in the Moon Tribe and Fairies can't...

366
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,220
I'm sorry.

367
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,180
We're happy today.

368
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,640

396
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,080
I've made up my mind.

397
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,740
You don't have to persuade me.

398
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,310
Lady wanqing.

399
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,400
Lady Orchid is here.

400
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,680
What's going on?

401
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,530
Lady Orchid.

402
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,960
As you said,

403
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,800
the Dark Golden Glory blossomed

404
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,820
just when I made up my mind.

405
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,090
This is a good omen.

406
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,000
These are my assets I saved

407
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,130
in Life Ending Pavilion for ten years.

408
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,340
Look at the legendary luminous pearl. Is it beautiful?

409
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,530
Yes, it is.

410
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,470
I've used the assets I saved

411
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,520
to redeem myself.

412
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,160
From now on, I will be free.

413
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,720
I can go find the lover in my dream.

414
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,110
What?

415
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,160
Are you here to...

416
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,960
Yes.

417
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,160
But...

418
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,580
But you don't know

419
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,470
whether he likes you or not.

420
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,690
That's right.

421
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,500
If you don't leave a way out,

422
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,520
even if he agrees,

423
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,120
in the future, you are not beautiful anymore.

424
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,350
You won't have any money to support you.

425
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,060
Wanqing.

426
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,980
That's right.

427
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,220
I can't forget him at first sight. That's enough.

428
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,650
Life only has decades.

429
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,640
Since I'm certain that the fated person

430
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,850
is not a dream.

431
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,900
No matter what,

432
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,300
I don't want to leave any regrets.

433
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,530
From now on,

434
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,830
I won't have any valuable flowers

435
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,690
to let you take care of them for me.

436
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,360
Don't say that.

437
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,170
We are friends.

438
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,230
It's worth

439
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,740
to make a friend like you.

440
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,950
Didn't he give up?

441
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,070
Brother Dongfang.

442
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,420
After I came back yesterday,

443
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,880
I thought I almost made a huge mistake.

444
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,280
So I couldn't sleep at night.

445
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,340
I'm here to ask for your forgiveness.

446
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,610
The matter has been solved.

447
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,740
Don't mention it again.

448
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,450
I can't.

449
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,690
The face and figure of the fairy in the painting

450
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,950
are lingering in my heart for a long time.

451
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,220
I'm afraid

452
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,110
I'll never meet a person

453
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,620
whom I like so much.

454
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,550
But don't get me wrong.

455
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,690
I may be a playboy,

456
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,510
but I will never take away the love of my brothers.

457
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,520
I promise, from now on,

458
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,120
I will never appear in front of your wife again.

459
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,320
I've decided

460
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,920
leave this sad place

461
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
to garrison the border in the North.

462
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,160
What?

463
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,630
After this trip,

464
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,290
for three years or five years,

465
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,040
I'm afraid I can't

466
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,280
play Cuju, play chess, take up the wine cup and chat merrily with Brother Dongfang.

467
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,940
For three years or five years?

468
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,330
If Xiao Run leaves Lucheng City,

469
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,940
how can he and Xie Wanqing

470
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,780
get married at the Flora Day?

471
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,560
Xiao Run, it's getting late.

472
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,770
We have to hurry.

473
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,240
Brother Dongfang.

474
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,070
Take care.

475
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,460
Wait.

476
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,480
These two are mortals now,

477
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,280
but they're troublesome.

478
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,270
Even if you see us off thousands of miles, there will be a parting.

479
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,330
Now it is the farewell.

480
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,280
Xiao... Xiao Run.

481
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,340
Are you really leaving?

482
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,700
I vaguely think

483
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,360
I should give this stone to my destined one.

484
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,040
But fate is a joke.

485
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,250
Brother Dongfang and Lady Orchid

486
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,380
are a perfect match.

487
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,590
But I'm very grateful

488
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,850
you see me off today.

489
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,790
I heard that the northern prairie is vast.

490
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,300
When I see the beautiful scenery,

491
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,360
I may feel relaxed.

492
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,870
Do something.

493
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,670
It's all your fault.

494
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,080
Well...

495
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,980
Then...

496
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,960
There's nothing to see

497
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,770
in the frontier, where is cold and hard.

498
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:21,440
Xiao Run.

499
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,530
It's just a misunderstanding.

500
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,050
I don't blame you anymore.

501
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,060
Don't be impulsive.

502
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,150
Yes.

503
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,510
I know you don't want me to leave,

504
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,150
but I've made up my mind.

505
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,350
Xiao Run.

506
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,950
Why don't you think about it?

507
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,340
Xiao Run, if we delay any longer,

508
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,340
we won't be able to get to the courier station by night.

509
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,630
I see.

510
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:09,240
Xiao Run has only known you for a short time.

511
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,790
But for 18 years,

512
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,180
only these days have been the happiest time.

513
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,020
If you can see

514
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,460
the snow in Lucheng City

515
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,190
or there's wind from the North.

516
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,740
I must be that I am missing you all.

517
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,340
Goodbye.

518
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,050
Jieli.

519
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,500
Hurry.

520
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,830
What should we do?

521
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,510
I'm thinking.

522
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,730
I'm thinking.

523
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,960
I'm thinking.

524
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:38,760
Hurry.

525
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,900
I'm thinking.

526
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,720
He's leaving, Jieli?

527
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,830
Have you figured it out, Jieli?

528
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,620
Xiao Run.

529
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,170
Congratulations.

530
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,340
You passed the test.

531
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,910
Test?

532
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,310
Let me introduce her to you again.

533
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,080
Lady Orchid

534
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,320
is the biological sister of Mr. Dongfang.

535
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,700
As her elder brother,

536
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,350
Mr. Dongfang treats Lady Orchid as a treasure.

537
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,400
Xiao Run.

538
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,120
You claimed that you love Lady Orchid,

539
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,010
but you acted so absurdly.

540
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,570
You even posted paintings all over Lucheng City.

541
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:34,960
For such a strange thing,

542
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,640
of course my lord can't

543
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,060
let his sister marry you.

544
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,780
So,

545
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,000
we thought of a way

546
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,260
to let them pretend to be a couple.

547
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,320
We wanted to know how you deal with it.

548
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,540
But today,

549
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,050
Xiao Run came up with

550
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,440
such a perfect plan.

551
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,510
It can not only live up to

552
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,810
your love to Lady Orchid,

553
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,490
but also live up to

554
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,150
brotherhood to Mr. Dongfang.

555
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,680
It's so obvious that

556
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,870
your personality and character

557
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,800
are impeccable.

558
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,320
Mr. Dongfang, right?

559
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,200
Yes.

560
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,600
Are you really siblings?

561
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,000
Yes.

562
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,550
What is the test?

563
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,760
Foolish.

564
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,690
It means

565
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,870
you are allowed to marry Lady Orchid.

566
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,220
Brother-in-law, please accept my bow.

567
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,140
You...

568
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,180
Aren't you going to garrison the North?

569
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,500
I'm not going anywhere.

570
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,080
Don't get cocky too soon.

571
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,620
You keep saying you like Orchid...

572
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,030
You like my sister?

573
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,410
Do you know what love is?

574
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,610
How do you prove that?

575
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,330
I think Lady Orchid is very close.

576
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,130
I think I've seen her somewhere.

577
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,360
It doesn't count.

578
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,670
Aren't parents and siblings

579
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,680
close?

580
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,870
That's right.

581
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,180
The moment I saw Qu Shui, I felt so close, too.

582
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,360
I feel like I've seen her somewhere.

583
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,600
I will treat Lady Orchid very well.

584
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,120
Treasure her and protect her.

585
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,250
Don't let anyone bully her.

586
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,690
I'll do these. I'm enough.

587
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,160
Yes.

588
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,060
Brother Dongfang and Lady Orchid are close.

589
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,490
Of course I'm no match for it.

590
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,010
Do you only know how to play tricks?

591
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,020
To be honest,

592
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,120
Xiao Run has been carefree

593
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,970
for these years.

594
00:30:58,970 --> 00:30:59,770
I always think I am

595
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,160
the happiest person in the world.

596
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,300
Being flogged and educated,

597
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,150
I felt it is like nothing.

598
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:05,900
Until I...

599
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,130
Until I dreamed about Lady Orchid in my dream,

600
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,280
but I couldn't find her.

601
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,410
I kept turning around.

602
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,680
I couldn't stop thinking about her.

603
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,960
That day when Brother Dongfang tested me,

604
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,480
when I thought that I'm not fated with Lady Orchid,

605
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,160
I felt empty inside.

606
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,060
Lady Orchid's makeup is refreshing and elegant today.

607
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,400
The day we met,

608
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,330
it must be a test.

609
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,170
But what Xiao Run said that day

610
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,350
was sincere.

611
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,120
I'll give you whatever you want in the future.

612
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,620
Enough.

613
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,610
My lord.

614
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,900
Now, it's inappropriate to talk about this.

615
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,810
I'll go back and report to my father

616
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,670
and prepare the betrothal gifts.

617
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,760
Get lost!

618
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:02,850
Yes.

619
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,360
Let's go.

620
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,860
Look what you've done.

621
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,290
Do something about it.

622
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:10,920
-What should we do? -My lord.

623
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,220
I didn't know it.

624
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,140
I have the same feeling.

625
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,500
Is this love?

626
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,150
My lord,

627
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,790
all 3,000 guards are here.

628
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,920
No one escaped.

629
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,260
Don't look so sad.

630
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,380
My lord, here.

631
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,430
Have some grapes.

632
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,360
Eat it yourself.

633
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,970
When you go to the Silver Lake, you won't be able to eat it.

634
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,500
What are you talking about?

635
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,740
Why should I do it?

636
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,720
The current situation is great.

637
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,400
Great?

638
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,460
Even I can see it.

639
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,320
It's all ruined.

640
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,040
Jieli.

641
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,970
What should we do now?

642
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,150
Xiao Run is busy with holding a betrothal gift to marry me.

643
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,670
Lady Wanqing determined to redeem herself

644
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,270
and marry Moon Supreme Lord.

645
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,040
What should we do?

646
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,050
Now, everything is

647
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,690
still going according to the fate poem.

648
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,790
Xie Wanqing met her lover on the night of the Lantern Festival

649
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,639
and redeemed herself to get married.

650
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,880
Next, it is the wedding ceremony on the Flora Day.

651
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,900
She would died under the sword of the bridegroom, Xiao Run.

652
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,449
But she wanted to marry me,

653
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:33,389
not Xiao Run.

654
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,469
Yes.

655
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:36,320
The groom is not Xiao Run.

656
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,630
I know. I know.

657
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,219
Calm down.

658
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:41,360
Everyone's thoughts

659
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,949
are too narrow.

660
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,100
I mean,

661
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:47,659
what if there are two weddings on the Flora Day?

662
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,469
You mean...

663
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,400
Seven words.

664
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,720
Steal the beam to replace the pillar.

665
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,680
Orchid,

666
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,360
you agreed to marry Xiao Run.

667
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,720
And the lord will marry Lady Xie.

668
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,290
We will prepare the wedding together.

669
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,600
When the wedding night on the Flora Day,

670
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,570
the two sides will exchange.

671
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,660
Jieli.

672
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,550
I've known you for over a thousand years.

673
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,980
I know you're immoral.

674
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,040
I didn't know you were so immoral.

675
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,850
You're flattering me!

676
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,030
Will this work?

677
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,770
The bride and groom are all fake.

678
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,330
Why not?

679
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,340
We just need to follow the fate poem.

680
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,390
On the wedding night,

681
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,320
Xiao Run will kill Xie Wanqing.

682
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,750
Then the hardship experience will be a success.

683
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,140
The rest are details.

684
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,670
I disagree.

685
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,630
Marriage is not a child's play.

686
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,490
I object.

687
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,420
I object, too.

688
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,910
Do you have any standpoint?

689
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,940
My lord,

690
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,380
but there is no other way now.

691
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,130
I agree.

692
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,220
Although the process is different,

693
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,650
as long as the ending

694
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,120
matches the fate poem,

695
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,460
hardship experience will be completed.

696
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,560
It works.

697
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,040
Didn't you just say it was immoral?

698
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,550
I...

699
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,200
The most important thing now

700
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,090
is to make the hardship experience of Changheng

701
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,980
and Chidi woman successful

702
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,670
and keep their primordial spirits alive.

703
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,260
As long as we can achieve this goal,

704
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,280
we can do anything special.

705
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,830
The Flora Day is coming.

706
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,600
Moon Supreme Lord, you...

707
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,820
No, today.

708
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,790
Take the betrothal gifts

709
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,390
to propose for Lady Wanqing.

710
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,970
Don't forget that everything is fake.

711
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,200
Fake?

712
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,440
I don't care if it's real or not.

713
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,370
I will only marry the girl I love.

714
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,500
For other people,

715
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,140
let alone propose,

716
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,870
I won't even take another look.

717
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:25,150
