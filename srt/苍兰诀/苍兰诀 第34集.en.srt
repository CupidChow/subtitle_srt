[Episode 34]

4
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,100
Now that God Chidi has resurrected.

5
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,160
So I can sit and talk to you.

6
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,180
I feel like I was dreaming.

7
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,130
I also want to join you, the God of War,

8
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,050
and gain some precious experience.

9
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,480
Although

10
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,540
my father always said I'm delicate

11
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,640
and can't stand the hardships in the army,

12
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,530
I'm not afraid of hardships.

13
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,160
Enough!

14
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,280
Chidi God of War.

15
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,270
I'm not feeling well today.

16
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,400
Leave here, please.

17
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,050
You have just resurrected.

18
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,860
You should have rested more.

19
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,170
I was thoughtless.

20
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,010
-Get out! -Thanks for your time.

21
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,660
I loved you so much.

22
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,670
Why did you betray me?

23
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,490
Why did you deceive me?

24
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,130
How dare you neglect me?

25
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,400
Why did you cheat on me?

26
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,370
Why? Why?

27
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,850
God Chidi,

28
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,400
we heard some noise,

29
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,370
so we came to patrol.

30
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,640
God Chidi,

31
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,990
we heard some noise,

32
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,950
so we came to patrol.

33
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,980
God Chidi.

34
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,200
Evil God Tai Sui.

35
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,430
Chidi woman.

36
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,409
How's the feeling of killing your own people?

37
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,190
I've been looking forward to it

38
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,590
since 30,000 years ago.

39
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,970
It's you!

40
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,540
It' you who bewitched Hao.

41
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,730
I just gave him hope.

42
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,510
As for you, Chidi woman.

43
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,620
You and all the fairies risk your lives to protect

44
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,510
the three realms and stop me from returning back.

45
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,190
And then what?

46
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,740
I didn't return.

47
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,330
But it turned out in the end that

48
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,550
it was you

49
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,110
who killed so many people.

50
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,030
Over 100,000 years,

51
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,380
you've always been playing this trick.

52
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,490
These demagogic remarks

53
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,670
are useless to me.

54
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,670
Have you forgotten it?

55
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,310
You're wrong.

56
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,870
Chidi woman.

57
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,920
I'm just here to see you.

58
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,190
It's over. I'm already the winner.

59
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,170
I'm not trying to convince you.

60
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,110
I don't need to persuade you either.

61
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,380
Goddess Xi Yun has resurrected.

62
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,400
And I will also remind Shuiyuntian

63
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,500
no matter what tricks you play,

64
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,880
you will not make it forever!

65
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,930
Chidi woman.

66
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,820
Don't test people's hearts.

67
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,460
People are silly.

68
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,340
They always miss the forest for the trees.

69
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,890
They can't see the truth clearly.

70
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,740
Just wait and see.

71
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,760
No one will believe you.

72
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,200
Your immortal body will be mine sooner or later.

73
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,460
Guards!

74
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,760
I want to see His Majesty.

75
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,360
When Tai Sui appears,

76
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,950
the three realms will be in huge trouble.

77
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,100
Guards!

78
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,830
Guards!

79
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,030
Her primordial spirit is damaged and her soul is in chaos.

80
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,500
She just said some crazy words.

81
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,190
But the God of War was absorbed by the evil spirit.

82
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,950
This is strange.

83
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,840
If it really has something to do with the Evil God Tai Sui,

84
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,100
it won't be a trivial matter.

85
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,159
We need to gather the power of all immortals

86
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,500
and get prepared in advance.

87
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,590
After Tai Sui's immortal body was destroyed

88
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,780
by the first Goddess,

89
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,350
his primordial spirit has been sealed by various Goddess

90
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,909
for hundreds of thousands of years.

91
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,640
The power of the ancient Evil God has long gone.

92
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,980
Not to mention that the Goddess Xi Yun

93
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,909
has resurrected.

94
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,180
She will suppress its soul.

95
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,160
The struggling ancient Evil God

96
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,770
will not be a threat to Shuiyuntian.

97
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,410
Then in your opinion,

98
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,250
what's the real threat to Shuiyuntian?

99
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,010
The most important thing in your eyes

100
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,310
is the war

101
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,910
between the fairies and the Moon Tribe, right?

102
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,260
Yes.

103
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,160
People in the Moon Tribe are brutal

104
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,090
and hate the Fairies to the gut.

105
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,030
The truce between us is just temporary.

106
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,210
With the 100,000 hostile soldiers' unsealing,

107
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,850
the power of Cangyan Sea has been improved a lot.

108
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,230
If another war starts in a hundred years,

109
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,070
they will be more arrogant and strong.

110
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,720
But as far as I noticed, the Cangyan Sea is resting now.

111
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,970
They have no intention to fight.

112
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,400
I think starting a war between two clans

113
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,840
is just your selfish motive.

114
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,560
All beings are selfish.

115
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,590
Isn't Chidi woman selfish?

116
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,450
She suddenly mentioned Tai Sui

117
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,650
just to alleviate her beloved disciple.

118
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,180
How could you look down on the former God of War?

119
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:05,730
Enough.

120
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,720
I know you don't want to share the burden of Shuiyuntian.

121
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,560
I can't force you.

122
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,420
Get ready for your wedding with the Goddess.

123
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,190
You don't need to

124
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,530
worry about other things.

125
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:36,809
Your Majesty,

126
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,030
although the God Chidi has remarkable battle achievement,

127
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,549
if we let her primordial spirit be continually consumed by the evil spirit,

128
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,980
the consequences will be unimaginable.

129
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,320
At this point,

130
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,050
I'm afraid we can only execute the God of Chidi

131
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,850
to prevent further problems.

132
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,910
But the God of War is righteous.

133
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,920
She sacrificed herself

134
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,020
to save the long peace for Shuiyuntian.

135
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,030
How can we bear

136
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,210
to execute her?

137
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,890
Please think it over, Your Majesty.

138
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,870
Please think it over, Your Majesty.

139
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,220
God Chidi.

140
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,270
is afraid that she may kill her people again.

141
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,530
His Majesty executed her

142
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,720
just to free her.

143
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,240
Forget it.

144
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,680
This is the result the sinner Rong Hao caused

145
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,400
by going against the heaven rules.

146
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,550
Even if I can't bear to execute her,

147
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,940
I can't resist the fate.

148
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,480
Pass my order.

149
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,260
At tomorrow noon,

150
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,010
execute Chidi woman at the fairy guillotine.

151
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,290
My lord.

152
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,590
Lord Yunzhong ordered

153
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,100
to send the former God of War to the fairy guillotine

154
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,150
tomorrow noon,

155
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,620
and execute her.

156
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,000
Father!

157
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,650
Father!

158
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,160
What's wrong?

159
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,090
Nothing.

160
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,580
I just came to see you.

161
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,680
Did I wake you up?

162
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,950
It's late in the night.

163
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,340
Why didn't you have a rest?

164
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,440
You dressed so neatly.

165
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,910
Where are you going?

166
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,690
Something urgent came up at Yunzhong Water Pavilion.

167
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,910
I need to deal with it.

168
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,710
Just sleep.

169
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,930
Wait, Father.

170
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,320
Father, I have something to ask you.

171
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,310
We can talk another day.

172
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,230
You said

173
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,460
you couldn't always keep me company.

174
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,930
You also said

175
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,830
if one day you passes away,

176
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,590
I need to take care of Jieli,

177
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,680
What does

178
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,780
it mean?

179
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,670
Nothing.

180
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,940
I was just reminding you.

181
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,280
But it sounds weird.

182
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,720
These days,

183
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,780
I couldn't sleep tight,

184
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,040
because I felt uneasy.

185
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,100
Are you

186
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,500
hiding something from me?

187
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,030
Don't think too much.

188
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,380
Danyin.

189
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,150
You're my good girl.

190
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,850
Be good. Go to sleep.

191
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,370
What are you doing?

192
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,590
Can't you let me sleep?

193
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,680
You'll have plenty of time to sleep

194
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,810
after being beaten to death by me.

195
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,650
Let me ask you.

196
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,250
Where did my father go tonight?

197
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,050
Do you know?

198
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,900
Why did you ask me? It's your dad.

199
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,660
Since you came,

200
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,830
my father has been weird.

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,010
It must be related to you.

202
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:52,860
Forget it.

203
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,920
He is my father,

204
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,050
not yours.

205
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,280
You don't need to worry about him.

206
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,420
Greetings, Lord Li Yuan.

207
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,650
I was ordered by His Majesty

208
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,330
to interrogate the criminal Rong Hao.

209
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,010
You may leave now.

210
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:22,720
This...

211
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,230
We'd better stay here

212
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,320
and follow orders.

213
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,310
The interrogation is confidential.

214
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,520
Leave.

215
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,830
Yes.

216
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,620
My lord.

217
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,380
Rong Hao.

218
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,450
I have betrayed my duty for you once.

219
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,420
If I let you go again,

220
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,060
there will be no turning back.

221
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,910
I only have one request.

222
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,590
Give her to me.

223
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,690
When I make sure my daughter is completely detoxicated,

224
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,120
I will kill her,

225
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,470
so that she won't hurt my daughter again.

226
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,620
Dieyi is my trusted subordinate.

227
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,180
During these 30,000 years, without her,

228
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,560
my plan would be difficult to accomplish.

229
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,700
I hope you can let her die peacefully

230
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,090
when you kill her.

231
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,130
Rong Hao.

232
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,310
It's been tens of thousands of years.

233
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,700
I didn't know

234
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,630
you were such a monster.

235
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,020
You're the people who are ungrateful

236
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,530
and selfish.

237
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,110
You sent my master

238
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,700
to the fairy guillotine.

239
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,900
Speaking of being ungrateful and selfish,

240
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,320
I'm not as good as

241
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,750
you senior immortals of Shuiyuntian.

242
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,460
Danyin.

243
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,100
Father!

244
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,900
You can't let him go.

245
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,350
Danyin, why are you here?

246
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,320
If I didn't come,

247
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,210
you would make a huge mistake for that pest.

248
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,890
Danyin.

249
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,700
Danyin.

250
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,660
Listen to me.

251
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:22,840
Father.

252
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:23,930
Danyin.

253
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,850
Go back now.

254
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,460
Father, I can't go back.

255
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,770
I'll explain to you later,

256
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,400
okay?

257
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,030
Danyin.

258
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,290
Come with me now!

259
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:32,880
-Danyin. -Father!

260
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,070
Father!

261
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,550
Father!

262
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:46,360
Father!

263
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,180
Rong Hao,

264
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,040
I didn't expect you to be so powerful.

265
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,510
I was wrong.

266
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,800
Don't go!

267
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,480
Are you going to stop me?

268
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,010
Danyin.

269
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,420
I'm afraid no one can beat him

270
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,680
except Dognfang Qingcang.

271
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,900
Stay out of it.

272
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,680
Step aside.

273
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,150
If you leave,

274
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,710
my father will be convicted of betrayal.

275
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
He will be sent to the karma jail

276
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,400
and fairy guillotine.

277
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,330
I'll spare no effort to stop you

278
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,640
from leaving today.

279
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,760
Danyin.

280
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,670
Father, are you okay?

281
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,470
My lord,

282
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,450
the former God of War was locked in the previous Immortal Mansion.

283
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,580
Kill him!

284
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,380
Yes.

285
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:58,930
Father!

286
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,070
Wait for me.

287
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,700
Danyin, stop chasing!

288
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,130
Stop chasing!

289
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,870
Stop!

290
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:25,390
Father!

291
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,410
Put down the sword.

292
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,210
Danyin, leave now!

293
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,680
Get out.

294
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,790
Put down the sword.

295
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,440
Let my father go.

296
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,330
No way.

297
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,010
I was ordered to kill him.

298
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,950
Greetings, Pavilion Master.

299
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,130
Jieli.

300
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,350
Jieli.

301
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,030
Jieli, why are you here too?

302
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,460
Go back now.

303
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,010
Go back now.

304
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,100
Father,

305
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,190
this pest

306
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,330
is in cahoots with them.

307
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,840
Why didn't you get it?

308
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,890
Why do you still care about her so much?

309
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,990
She's just poisoned.

310
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,170
Jieli,

311
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,470
come here.

312
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,079
Pick up your sister's sword.

313
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,760
She's poisoned?

314
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,119
She can only cured by them.

315
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,099
So she will help them to harm us for sure.

316
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,280
Tell me

317
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,720
who should be killed?

318
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:28,890
Kill me.

319
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,540
Kill me.

320
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,740
Pest!

321
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,680
Kill me if you have to kill one.

322
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,110
Father!

323
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,760
You kill me,

324
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,370
you will die too.

325
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,310
Bah!

326
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,710
I've had enough!

327
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,180
Stop trying to control me.

328
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,480
Master.

329
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,420
I'm late.

330
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,580
[Zhilan Pavilion]

331
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,130
Danyin.

332
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,490
Take Jieli to your room

333
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,420
and pretend that you hadn't come out tonight.

334
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,480
No matter who asks,

335
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,780
just pretend that you didn't know anything.

336
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,000
Got it?

337
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,800
Go in now.

338
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,070
Father, what about you?

339
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,930
I'll turn myself in to Lord Yunzhong.

340
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,480
I'll go with you.

341
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:38,920
Danyin.

342
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,560
I can't protect you anymore.

343
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,370
Jieli.

344
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,010
My daughters.

345
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,490
I've been repenting for thousands of years

346
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,920
to make up for what happened back then.

347
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,280
But even when your mother died,

348
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,920
I couldn't see her for the last time.

349
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:07,650
Danyin.

350
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,920
You've been spoiled since young.

351
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,390
But overnight,

352
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,450
you're going to become the daughter of a sinful immortal and traitor,

353
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,090
and will be despised by everyone.

354
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,560
Jieli.

355
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,420
I haven't been with you since you were little.

356
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,140
You have suffered a lot.

357
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,860
You haven't got the antidote yet.

358
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,480
I'm sorry.

359
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,980
I can't even protect my own daughters.

360
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,870
I'm incapable.

361
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,310
Danyin.

362
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,780
Jieli.

363
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,350
When I'm gone,

364
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,670
you two should be united

365
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,310
and support each other.

366
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,860
Got it?

367
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,240
Do you understand?

368
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,880
Yes. Yes.

369
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,430
Father.

370
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,530
Father.

371
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:03,970
Go in.

372
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,190
No. No.

373
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,460
Father, I want to be with you.

374
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,260
No matter what consequence it will be,

375
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,110
I want to be with you.

376
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,570
Go in. Someone is coming.

377
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,490
Go inside.

378
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,670
No, I'm not leaving.

379
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,140
Go in.

380
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,060
I'm not leaving.

381
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:31,940
Hurry.

382
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,080
I'm not leaving.

383
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
I'll take her inside.

384
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:16,760
Father!

385
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,690
Stop chasing.

386
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,750
Didn't he tell you

387
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,840
that he would turn himself in.

388
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,070
You knocked me out?

389
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,590
Your father wanted you to leave.

390
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,240
He treated me so well these days.

391
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,170
I was just doing him a favor.

392
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,310
You just left him like that?

393
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,750
How can you say it's none of your business?

394
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,260
He is also your father.

395
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,220
It's all your fault!

396
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,960
You pest!

397
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,030
Pest!

398
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,330
Everything was fine

399
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,470
without you.

400
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,560
You showed up

401
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,070
and completely ruined

402
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,330
my life.

403
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,850
I'm talking to you.

404
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:55,820
Let me ask you.

405
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,740
Why did you pretend to save me

406
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,830
at the karma jail?

407
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,470
Didn't I tell you?

408
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,700
All I want is to survive.

409
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,090
Nothing else.

410
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,270
Meeting you

411
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,870
is to survive.

412
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,470
But if you kill that butterfly demon,

413
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,270
you won't be able to live, right?

414
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,530
Yes.

415
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,840
Because now

416
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,650
I don't want to survive anymore.

417
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,750
Why?

418
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,890
You like Changheng, right?

419
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,750
Will you lie to him and betray him?

420
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,470
Of course not.

421
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:26,690
Never!

422
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,370
But I will.

423
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,010
In order to live,

424
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,320
I will betray my best friends,

425
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,550
and lie to the person I love most.

426
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,290
I didn't kill Dieyi to save you.

427
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,300
I hate her so much.

428
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,320
In the control of her,

429
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,080
I did lots of things that I was not willing to do.

430
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,900
I've hurt people I didn't want to hurt the most.

431
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,790
I should have killed her

432
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,630
no matter what it would take.

433
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,610
You've killed her,

434
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,920
and got rid of her control.

435
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,980
The people you care about

436
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,080
will forgive you.

437
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,070
No.

438
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,870
Even if they will,

439
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,600
I don't want them to forgive me.

440
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,820
There's no need to forgive me.

441
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,540
I'm such a jerk.

442
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,560
Didn't you just say that

443
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,440
I'm a troublemaker

444
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,500
and pest?

445
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,140
Without me,

446
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,700
everyone could have lived a good life.

447
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,270
But your father

448
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,700
is such a fool.

449
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,680
When I pretended to be a good girl,

450
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,200
he was so nice

451
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,510
and obedient to me.

452
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,340
But this kind of love

453
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,390
is meaningless to me.

454
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,730
I don't want to tell lies anymore.

455
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,830
What's wrong with you?

456
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,530
There is a good medicine of Wuxian Clan

457
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,750
called Memory Recollecting Pill.

458
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,050
It can help people regain their memories.

459
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,150
The Memory Recollecting Pill

460
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,580
can help the old

461
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,260
to regain their memories.

462
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,650
It won't work

463
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,780
for Fairy Orchid.

464
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,830
Well,

465
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,050
if I take her to the places

466
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,360
where we have been before,

467
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,970
and tell her everything that had happened,

468
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,070
can I stimulate her to remember something?

469
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,290
But haven't you used these ways

470
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,430
a few days ago?

471
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,570
They didn't work at all.

472
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,680
Well,

473
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,240
there is a black jade bed at the Pavilion of Spiritual Treasures,

474
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,960
which can help create dreams.

475
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,220
People can dream the most beautiful moments in their lives

476
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,240
while sleeping on it.

477
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,670
If I move the bed here for her...

478
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,720
She needs to remember the things first.

479
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,280
Or, the order will be wrong.

480
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,530
Why do you always pour cold water on

481
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,370
my plans?

482
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,350
Sorry, my lord.

483
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,900
I was wrong.

484
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,100
I have something to tell you.

485
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,420
I know

486
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,240
you had an affection with Orchid.

487
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,040
And you two almost got married.

488
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,750
You...

489
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,720
remember it now？

490
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,380
Changheng has told me everything

491
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,430
that happened before.

492
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,370
I'm here to tell you that

493
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,260
I'm not Orchid.

494
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,710
Orchid will never come back.

495
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,880
You are Orchid.

496
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,480
She will come back.

497
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,990
I'm not.

498
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,010
Back then,

499
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,400
Arbiter formed a plant of fake orchid grass

500
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,420
in order to hide me

501
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,570
from being noticed as the Xilan holy grass.

502
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,290
And Orchid

503
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,300
is only a weak memory

504
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,820
attached to this illusion.

505
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,880
Now, the illusion has been removed.

506
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,280
So Orchid disappeared with the memory,

507
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,620
and will never come back.

508
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,300
The one in front of you

509
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,360
is Goddess Xi Yun.

510
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,690
You're wrong.

511
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,460
She's still here.

512
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,930
She's gone.

513
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,320
I have evidence.

514
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,290
What evidence?

515
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,480
Orchid likes flowers and grass.

516
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,070
You also like plants.

517
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,220
She lives in the Arbiter Hall.

518
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,690
You also live in the Arbiter Hall.

519
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,900
Orchid...

520
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,060
She likes to wear clothes in light colors.

521
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,790
You also like these colors.

522
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,700
You must be her.

523
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,670
She must still be here.

524
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,850
In three days,

525
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,040
I will get married with Changheng.

526
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,630
Don't play dead. Get up.

527
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,520
Sister,

528
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,960
it will be useless even if we get there.

529
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,730
Why is it useless?

530
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,030
The Goddess of Xishan

531
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,840
has the strongest healing magic.

532
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,180
She can resurrect dead things.

533
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,360
You will be detoxified.

534
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:55,750
Come on.

535
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:57,810
Get up.

536
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,010
Leave me alone.

537
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,000
Go by yourself.

538
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,990
Leave me alone.

539
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,290
I'll carry you.

540
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,350
Come on.

541
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,680
What are you waiting for?

542
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,650
Come up.

543
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:49,210
[Arbiter Hall]

544
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,310
[Arbiter Hall]

545
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,720
Fairy Danyin,

546
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,920
I want to see the Goddess.

547
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,370
Now!

548
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,120
Come with me.

549
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,380
[Arbiter Hall]

550
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,970
The Goddess wants you to go upstairs.

551
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,210
Let's go.

552
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,360
I've forgotten the past.

553
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,840
I don't even remember

554
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,180
the connection and deception

555
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,780
between us.

556
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,520
You can stay.

557
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,580
From now on,

558
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,630
I will detoxify you and extend your life.

559
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,410
Thank you, Goddess.

560
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:41,480
Jieli.

561
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,840
Thank you, Goddess.

562
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:48,950
By the way,

563
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,090
Goddess

564
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,520
and Lord Changheng,

565
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,180
I have to tell you something

566
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,440
very critical.

567
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,550
Rong Hao escaped from the karma jail.

568
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,850
When did that happen?

569
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:02,940
Last night.

570
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,750
Besides,

571
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,800
I also heard that

572
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,450
the former God of War went crazy for some reason.

573
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,840
She even said

574
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,910
she saw the Evil God Tai Sui.

575
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,440
Fairy Danyin,

576
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,960
please tell me

577
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,300
what you heard and saw in details.

578
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,320
Yes.

579
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,150
Before we met,

580
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,040
I thought she was Orchid.

581
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,520
But when I saw her,

582
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,290
I couldn't help keeping my voice down,

583
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,630
and dare not make trouble.

584
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,900
When she looked at me,

585
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,590
my heart beat faster.

586
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,480
Yes.

587
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,870
They look the same,

588
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,940
but there is no sign of Orchid on her.

589
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,420
She is really

590
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,660
the Goddess of Xishan who protects the three realms.

591
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,190
It's a perfect match

592
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,000
when she is standing beside Lord Changheng.

593
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,780
It sounds jealous.

594
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,330
Are you still not over him,

595
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,220
your Lord Changheng?

596
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,040
Not really.

597
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,650
When I told everyone Orchid was the Goddess of Xishan

598
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,510
at Yunzhong Water Pavilion,

599
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,040
I already let it go.

600
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,280
Both of you are the Goddess's guests.

601
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,550
Let me arrange a place for you.

602
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:31,430
Sure.

603
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,310
No need.

604
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,580
I'm familiar with the Arbiter Hall.

605
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,630
I know where to live.

606
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,930
Have you had the meal?

607
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,780
I'll prepare some food for you.

608
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,170
We're not hungry.

609
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,070
Miss Jieli.

610
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,720
How are you doing recently?

611
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,860
I'm fine.

612
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,170
Thank you for your concern.

613
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,450
Why are you so cold to him?

614
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,110
You two were a couple, right?

615
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,719
It's all in the past.

616
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,100
Why bother?

617
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:16,750
The person I like

618
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,139
doesn't like me.

619
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:21,920
But the person you like

620
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,810
loves you.

621
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,610
He shouldn't have loved me.

622
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,429
In my opinion,

623
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,820
he is the purest,

624
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,750
brightest

625
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,389
and gentlest person in the world.

626
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,570
But

627
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:37,920
I don't deserve him.

628
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,510
Good for you.

629
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,239
You are my younger sister.

630
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,620
You deserve to be happy.

631
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,719
Not to mention a little black dragon,

632
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,530
you deserve the King of Heaven.

633
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,960
You don't understand.

634
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,520
You can have

635
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,989
the trust

636
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:53,710
and eternal love from others,

637
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,520
but I can't.

638
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,970
Even if I gained it by chance,

639
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,610
I would lose it eventually.

640
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,560
Then I'd rather not expect anything in the beginning.

641
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,050
Coward.

642
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,110
Let's go.

643
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,950
This is a love candle.

644
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,060
It is said that its fragrance

645
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,310
can make people...

646
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,370
What?

647
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,120
Remember the past love

648
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,430
and reunite.

649
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,690
You want to use it on Jieli?

650
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,200
Ridiculous!

651
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,320
You are the chief guard of me,

652
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,380
how dare you use this trick to compete her favor?

653
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,780
Are you crazy?

654
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,640
I may be crazy for her.

655
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,080
But as long as she can come back...

656
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
she won't be back.

657
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,490
She's no longer the one

658
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,290
you knew before.

659
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,380
No.

660
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,490
She is the Jieli I knew back then.

661
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:20,190
She was a spy for Haishi City at the very beginning.

662
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,380
Everything you saw was a disguise.

663
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,620
Throw away the candle.

664
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,390
No, my lord.

665
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,040
Let me try.

666
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,390
Can you do the reality check, please?

667
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,830
But you also can't recognize the reality.

668
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,190
Don't you think

669
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,960
the Goddess is Orchid?

670
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,060
Sorry.

671
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,810
Have a drink with me.

672
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,500
The God Chidi's warning is true.

673
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,050
Tai Sui has escaped.

674
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,310
It seems that

675
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,120
on the day I died in the Xuanxu Realm,

676
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,590
and my primordial spirit was destroyed,

677
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,650
the power of me was at its limit.

678
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,750
Tai Sui took the chance to break the seal.

679
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,970
But he has no immortal body.

680
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:04,970
He has only a strand of soul.

681
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:05,690
He can't do evil.

682
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,650
We still have time.

683
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,460
No.

684
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,930
Without the actual body,

685
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,690
he can appear at every corner

686
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,700
of this world,

687
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,170
including people's mind.

688
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,940
He can bewitch those who have delusions,

689
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,490
and make them be used by him

690
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,750
and do evil for him.

691
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,600
For the peace of the three realms,

692
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:21,610
this time,

693
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,620
we must destroy him completely.

694
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,430
Didn't you say you love Orchid?

695
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,130
Then why did you agree to marry the Goddess?

696
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,490
Whether she remembers the past or not,

697
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,850
she is still my betrothed.

698
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,070
This is fate.

699
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,850
Didn't you see it in the Tianji Mirror?

700
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,790
Lord Changheng.

701
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,920
Don't see me off.

702
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,480
Just stay here

703
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,530
to detoxify and recuperate.

704
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,790
Don't go anywhere.

705
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,110
I'll go back to Shuiyuntian

706
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,050
to inquire the information about my father.

707
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,660
If you have any news,

708
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,020
keep me updated please.

709
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,610
Lord Changheng,

710
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,390
are we

711
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,070
friends now?

712
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,970
Fairy Danyin, you are my close friend.

713
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:53,940
Well,

714
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,080
may I ask that

715
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,770
do you really want to

716
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,080
marry the Goddess?

717
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,700
Is this really what you want?

718
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,570
In the past,

719
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,460
I've been deceiving myself.

720
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,730
I knew that you love someone else,

721
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,540
but I still hoped that

722
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,390
a miracle would happen one day.

723
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,490
You could

724
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,420
turn around

725
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,560
and see me,

726
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,160
like me,

727
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:28,960
and even fall in love with me.

728
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,690
That's why I didn't tell you

729
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,110
what I saw in the Tianji Mirror.

730
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,840
I hid it from everyone

731
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,150
and myself.

732
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,830
But later I realized

733
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,350
those were my delusions.

734
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,330
It's the greed.

735
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,930
It's the possession.

736
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:48,960
If something doesn't belong to me,

737
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,770
it won't be mine after all.

738
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,910
Changheng.

739
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,810
I don't want you to be controlled by delusions.

740
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,620
The Goddess...

741
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,080
Danyin,

742
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:00,380
stop please.

743
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,420
This is my destiny.

744
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,280
No matter

745
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,910
how bitter the fruit of fate is,

746
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,180
I will swallow it

747
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,070
for her.

748
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,710
It's scorching.

749
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,440
Let's take a rest here.

750
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:29,990
Okay.

751
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,490
Have a short rest.

752
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,250
Have a short rest.

753
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:47,590
