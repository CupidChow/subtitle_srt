Not necessarily.

51
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:38,860

Changheng's hardship

54
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,390
is not to kill Xie Wanqing.

55

In this life,

56
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,659
he should die to save the people he cares about.

57

You've succeeded in your hardship experience?

95
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,820
Since the God of War, Changheng, has returned from his hardship experience,

96
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,380
it's imperative to destroy Dingfang Qingcang.

97
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,780
I'll see who dares to touch her.

98
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,380
Fairy Orchid is a fellow immortal.

99
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,140
She is not a traitor to Shuiyuntian.

100
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,850
Anyone who harms her

101
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,650
will be my enemy.

102
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,020
Since the God of War is here to protect her,

103
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,880
I guess there's really a hidden misunderstanding.

104
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,580
Forget it.

105
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,430
After killing Dongfang Qingcang,

106
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,980
Orchid can return to Shuiyuntian,

107
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,420
safe and sound.

108
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,500
Orchid, come home with me.

109
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,860
Come home?

110
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,730
Although I haven't left Shuiyuntian for long,

111
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,220
the life in Arbiter Hall

112
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,980
seems like thousands of years,

113
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,980
and tens of thousands of years away.

114
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,580
I really want to go home even in my dreams.

115
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,310
I miss the flowers and plants in the Arbiter Hall,

116
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,380
the nagging of Aunt Sansheng,

117
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,750
the loud voice of Fairy Danyin.

118
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,020
If I hadn't met him, how wonderful it would be.

119
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,380
I could be living at peace in Yujing,

120
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,500
gradually turning into

121
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,460
an old fairy.

122
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,220
Come back with me.

123
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,820
Nothing will change.

124
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,780
As long as you go back to Shuiyuntian,

125
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,220
whether you go back to the Arbiter Hall

126
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,330
or come to Fountain Palace,

127
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,370
you can do whatever you want.

128
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,010
I promise

129
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,400
no one will treat you badly

130
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,960
in the whole Shuiyuntian.

131
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,420
I'm sorry.

132
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,260
Lord Changheng.

133
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,420
Orchid.

134
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,540
Obstinate.

135
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,420
Kill them!

136
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,140
Changheng.

137
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,370
I've been patient with you

138
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,820
since you're my brother.

139
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,300
But you've been in league with

140
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,810
Dongfang Qincang and the traitor of Shuiyuntian,

141
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,380
arousing a rebellion.

142
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,140
This is an unforgivable sin!

143
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,940
Changheng.

144
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,050
Do you want to rebel?

145
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,750
I used to respect you as my brother.

146
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,980
For tens of thousands of years, I've obeyed the rules of heaven,

147
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,500
following your lead.

148
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,380
But after experiencing the hardships in the mortal world,

149
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,740
I've understood a lot.

150
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,380
Until today, I realize

151
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,500
in your eyes,

152
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,000
Mother God's fervent love for her son is cowardice.

153
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,580
Changheng's longing for the person he loves is a mistake.

154
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,020
All the true feelings in the world

155
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,410
are just foolish and unbearable in your eyes.

156
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,610
If this absurdity is the rule of heaven,

157
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,660
so what if I rebel against it?

158
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,060
The sinful immortal Changheng

159
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,500
aroused a rebellion,

160
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,880
committing the same crime as the Moon Tribe.

161
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,300
If anyone sees him,

162
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,500
kill him without mercy.

163
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,480
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

164
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,070
It's been 30,000 years.

165
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,820
This moment has finally come.

166
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,280
It's funny that they only have the fate poem,

167
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,060
but they've never grasped the true meaning of the poem.

168
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,260
I've followed my master through thousands of lifetimes.

169
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,500
I've already seen

170
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,940
that she has to die in every life for her beloved one.

171
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,980
So Mr. Xiao

172
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,780
cannot just be a name.

173
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,060
The real person who needs to be killed

174
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,300
to help my master experience the hardship

175
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,900
is Dongfang Qingcang,

176
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,760
who she really loves in this life.

177
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,860
Master.

178
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,530
Finally, you don't have to suffer through the experience hardship anymore.

179
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,820
Don't worry, Master.

180
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,260
I've placed your spirit

181
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,300
in a place

182
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,150
to help you complete the last step before resurrection.

183
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,540
It must be a place

184
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,700
that no one could have guessed.

185
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,340
Didn't you always say that you are the supreme

186
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,030
and the strongest of the three realms?

187
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,540
So you'll be fine, right?

188
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,910
Dongfang Qingcang.

189
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,780
Please wake up, please.

190
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,250
As long as you can wake up,

191

no matter how much you hurt me or lie to me,

192
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,820
I wouldn't be angry.

193
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,300
I beg you.

194
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,620
Don't leave me alone.

195
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,660

my blood can bring the dead back to life.

are suffering like this.

273

274

there are spirits of the Moon Tribe people and immortals.

277

Could it be that the death of the 3,000 immortal soldiers

278
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,100
was also related to the Lord of Haishi City?

286
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,670

How could you be so badly injured?

288
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,620
It is my fault.

289
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,150
I failed to protect my Lord.

290
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,420
It's just a momentary loss of power.

291

There is no need to panic.

292

The Cangyan Sea is now settled.

293
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,860
The Kings of Southern and Northern Youxian County have always had the potential to rebel.

294
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,500
If they know about this,

295
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,360
I'm afraid they'll cause unrest.

296
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,670
Even if I can't use my Hellfire,

297
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,140
it's not difficult to

298
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,820
kill them.

299
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,880
It's better to make it safe after all.

300
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,260
Brother.

301

302
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,220
Shangque and I will keep this a secret.

303

305
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,860
Don't mention it.

306
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,660
You and I are brothers.

307
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,220

We are brothers.

309
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,540
I'll leave.

310
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,340
I'll go see His Highness off.

311
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,150
Have some medicine.

312
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,740
What are you laughing at?

313
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,420
I was thinking

314
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,820
my wish

315
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,150
seems to have come true.

316
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,340
What wish?

317
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,180
Forget it.

318
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,380
Don't ask.

319
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,580
Drink the medicine, it's getting cold.

320
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,820
Since you finish it,

321
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,620
I'll leave now.

322
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,260
Get some rest.

323
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,460
You too.

324
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,860
What?

325
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,040
She's the reason why my brother was seriously injured?

326
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,420
He even killed the reincarnated body of Chidi woman

327
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,500
to save her?

328
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,360
Your Highness.

329
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,860
Don't alert the Lord.

330
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,180
The fairy has been haunting my brother all day.

331
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,780
She's a real nuisance.

332
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,760
I'll go and kill her now

333
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,620
to eliminate future problems.

334
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,680
Your Highness, no.

335
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,000
Your Highness.

336
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,380
It's just a fairy.

337
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,110
Why can't I kill her?

338
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,780
Brother.

339
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,130
I'm connected to Orchid by the Heart Curse.

340
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,300
We simultaneously die and get injured.

341
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,780
If you kill her,

342
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,140
you kill me.

343
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,460
This is my greatest weakness now.

344
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,340
I trust you.

345
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,380
I will never reveal a word.

346
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,510
You are the leader of the three realms,

347
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,540
but now your life is at stake in the hands of

348
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,140
a fairy of low power.

349
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,340
How malicious

350
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,460
is this woman!

351
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,870
The curse on me was an accident.

352
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,460
It has nothing to do with Orchid.

353
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,900
On the contrary,

354
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,730
if it weren't for her,

355
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,530
I'm afraid I'd still be locked up in Haotian Tower.

356
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,930
But in Lu City,

357
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,960
not only did she cause you serious injuries,

358
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,330
but she also ruined the plan

359
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,260
to unseal 100,000 of our soldiers.

360
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,950
What is she if not a scourge?

361
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,500
You are blaming me?

362
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,740
I don't dare.

363
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,660
I blame myself too.

364
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,950
The revenge of Shuiyuntian for oppressing our clan,

365
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,720
the suffering of Father who was forced to kill himself.

366
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,020
I always remember it in my heart.

367
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,530
The 100,000 soldiers in Xuanxu Realm

368
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,540
are more of a pain in my heart.

369
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,820
I want to break the seal all the time

370
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,140
to welcome them back.

371
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,380
But now it seems that

372
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,180
I'm really ashamed of the people of the Moon Tribe.

373
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,020
My Lord.

374
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,680
Brother...

375
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,260
You're not yet recovered from your injuries.

376
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,380
Don't overdo it.

377
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,820
My Lord, no one understands

378
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,420
your desperate need better than I do.

379
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,660
But now that this is the case,

380
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,860
you should consider the Chidi woman's spirit

381
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,060
to have been destroyed 30,000 years ago

382
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,070
and never have left a single fragment behind.

383
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,470
Let's think of another way.

384
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,500
Why are you standing here?

385
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,940
Jieli.

386
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,740
It's an sachet that can calm the spirit

387
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,420
I just made.

388
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,220
I...

389
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,420
You go and deliver it.

390
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:56,940
I...

391
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,340
I need to be alone.

392
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,740
Orchid.

393
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,540
Orchid.

394
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,110
Jieli said you want to be alone.

395
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,750
I can accompany you.

396
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,860
Wooden Head.

397
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,460
You shouldn't have saved me.

398
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,460
I don't need you

399
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,590
to tell me what to do.

400
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,590
I hope the First God of War can successfully ascend through the hardship experience.

401
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,780
I can't bear to see the soldiers

402
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,700
forever sealed in the Xuanxu realm,

403
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,450
who can't see their living loved ones.

404
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,650
But these two things have failed because of me.

405
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,220
And…

406
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,420
I also caused you to get hurt.

407
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,270
It was my decision to kill Xie Wanqing.

408
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,900
You don't need to feel guilty about it.

409
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,700
And I will never regret

410
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,480
saving you at that time

411
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,190
to unseal the Moon Tribe soldiers.

412
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,080
There must be another way.

413
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,150
But in all three realms,

414
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,980
I can't find another

415
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,380
timid

416
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,940
crybaby Orchid,

417
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,200
who likes to meddle in things,

418
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,980
causes a lot of trouble,

419
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,970
but cares for me and takes care of me,

420
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,500
makes me willing to rebirth the Love Trees for her,

421
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,700
cry with her

422
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,220
and laugh with her.

423
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,020
In my eyes,

424
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,660
you are never the insignificant grass.

425
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,300
You are not grass at all.

426
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,180
Orchid.

427
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,340
Haven't you always wanted to know who you are…

428
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:53,940
Orchid.

429
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,340
Lord Changheng.

430
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,790
What are you doing here?

431
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,990
To take Orchid away, of course.

432
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,460
Just try.

433
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,580
If you want a problem,

434
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,460
I'll give you a problem.

435
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,180
Stop!

436
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,790
Can you put down your swords first?

437
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,880
Before I take Orchid away,

438
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,670
I have something important to say.

439
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,139
I think I've seen such fragmented spirits before

440
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:26,540
at Transformation Grounds in Haishi City.

441
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,500
I've already destroyed the Soul Transformation Cauldron.

442
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,820
Why can't they return to the Memory Lost River?

443
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,460
These dead people were tortured during their lives.

444
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,580
Their spirits are thus mutilated and lost

445
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,570
and can't go back to the Realm of Return to Ruin.

446
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,139
They can only spend their days wandering in the Memory Lost River,

447
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,659
failing to rest in peace.

448
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,420
I will not tolerate such humiliation for the people of the Moon Tribe.

449
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,620
The souls of our immortal warriors

450
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,550
should have had peace after death.

451
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,860
I have a way

452
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,880
to appease and purify these spirits.

453
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,820
This is the “Spirit of Knowledge Book”?

454
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,140
My master once told me

455
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,700
this is the song composed by

456
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,420
the first Goddess of Xishan in ancient time.

457
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,660
It has the power to heal

458
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,410
and purify the spirit.

459
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,220
Lord Dong and Yannv

460
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,500
once played together

461
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,140
to worship heaven and earth.

462
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,780
But for millions of years,

463
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,140
although this tune has spread to the three realms,

464
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,020
no one can master it.

465
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,540
I know.

466
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,620
You are the supreme of the Moon Tribe.

467
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,860
You're the God of War of the fairy realm.

468
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,620
You two are the most powerful people

469
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,780
in fairy and Moon Tribe worlds.

470
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,500
If you two can join forces,

471
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,180
you must be able to master it.

472
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,980
That's exactly what I want to do.

473
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,720
Moon Supreme Lord, what do you think?

474
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,850
He agrees. Of course he agrees.

475
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,420
This is not only about

476
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,940
Lord Changheng.

477
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,540
Moon Supreme Lord is so kind.

478
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,460
I'm sure he won't abandon the Moon Tribe people.

479
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,180
Am I right?

480
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,420
Since Orchid begged for mercy

481
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,710
and there's a reason for it,

482
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,540
I'll grant it.

483
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,510
The music score.

484
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,980
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

485
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,420
You two have been practicing for so long.

486
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,540
You must be tired.

487
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,380
Take a drink of water and rest.

488
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,860
State of mind can be recognized from the sound of instrument.

489
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,580
Your sound of the zither

490
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,300
was weak and feeble,

491
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:14,180
just like those hypocrites in Shuiyuntian

492
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,690
who have been pampered for too long to be of little use,

493
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,620
unable to take a single blow.

494
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,740
Moon Supreme Lord is wrong about this.

495
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,380
The “Spirit of Knowledge Book” is a healing ritual song.

496
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,180
Your music was disorderly, barbaric, and vulgar.

497
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,060
But music practice is like training a soldier.

498
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,490
You can't be too hasty.

499
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,820
If you rush into it,

500
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,550
you will definitely stagnate.

501
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,220
These two are not practicing the zither.

502
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,550
They are obviously insinuating the army.

503
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,020
Don't be so serious.

504
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,420
You've been friends before, haven't you?

505
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,540
You even made brothers in Lu City.

506
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,380
How can what happened in mortal world be taken seriously?

00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,580
How can what happened in mortal world be taken seriously?

508
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,500
You two are on the same page about this though.

509
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,340
The reason why your tunes don't match

510
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,140
may be because

511
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,900
you don't really understand each other.

512
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,060
The fairies and the Moon Tribe are already at odds with each other.

513
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,580
It's just a temporary cooperation.

514
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,740
How possibly can we understand each other?

515
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,980
It's not like that.

516
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,740
In fact, the Moon Tribe is not as cruel and murderous

517
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,460
as it's rumored to be in the fairy realm.

518
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,380
On the contrary,

519
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,780
because of the constant warfare,

520
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,460
they also long for peace and quietness.

521
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,500
And at first,

522
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,140
it was because the Moon Tribe ancestor Yannv

523
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,500
was betrayed by Chonghua,

524
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:29,900
she took…

525
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,760
That's enough.

526
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,460
The Moon Tribe doesn't need anyone to defend themselves.

527
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,860
I didn't mean that.

528
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,700
Moon Supreme Lord.

529
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,020
You once said

530
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,420
after your seven feelings are restored

531
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,780
and you can be considerate to others,

532
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,900
you wouldn't want your people

533
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,940
to suffer from the separation with their loved ones like you did.

534
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,700
If fairies and the Moon Tribe can put aside their prejudices

535
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,300
and turn them into peace,

536
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,160
wouldn't your wish be fulfilled?

537
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:58,280
How can the Moon Supreme Lord change because of what you just said?

538
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,950
After all, you are not the same people.

539
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,140
Lord Changheng really has other purposes.

540
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,340
I guess you don't really want to cooperate with me either.

541
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,580
No way.

542
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,330
They don't see eye to eye.

543
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,990
I'm afraid they can't end this if they continue.

544
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,380
Moon Supreme Lord.

545
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,980
Take it easy, take it easy.

546
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,860
You haven't yet recovered from your injuries.

547
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,340
You mustn't strain your mind.

548
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,220
Why don't you rest for today

549
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,380
and practice tomorrow?

550
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,640
That's not necessary.

551
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:32,750
It's still unknown who will die between fairies and the Moon Tribe.

552
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,380
But you and I

553
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,780
can decide victory and defeat first today.

554
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,490
That's good.

555
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,200
I have the same intention.

556
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,140
That's enough.

557
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,380
As the Moon Supreme

558
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,340
and the immortal God of War,

559
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,070
why don't you have any decency?

560
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,620
Greetings, My Lord.

561
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:18,420
What are you doing?

562
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,530
My Lord.

563
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,990
We are making a sacrifice.

564
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,220
Sacrifice?

565
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,580
For the past 30,000 years,

566
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,140
war has been raging.

567
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,380
Every year at this time,

568
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,540
we pay tribute to our dead husbands, brothers, sons,

569
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,580
and set up lanterns to pray for blessings

570
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,180
at the Memory Lost River.

571
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,390
Why do these clay dolls

572
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,620
have no faces?

573
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,740
It's because they've been gone too long

574
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,980
for us to remember how they look like.

575
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:56,180
And we don't know where their spirit is,

576
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,480
whether they've returned to the bottom of the Memory Lost River for rest.

577
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:07,500
My Lord.

578
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,490
Do you still remember

579
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,460
what I told you last time?

580
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,460
Yes, I do.

581
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,260
I will do it.

582
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,190
I will bring back the 100,000 soldiers

583
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,320
from the Xuanxu realm.

584
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:31,050
