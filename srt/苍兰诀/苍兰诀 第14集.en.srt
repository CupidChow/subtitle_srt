You're here.

Stop!

8
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,780
Pass token?

9
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,020
The Moon Supreme Lord has ordered

10
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,380
no one

11
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,660
can enter the Ninth Youxian County without a pass token.

12
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,820
Yes. I have it.

13
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,500
Wait.

14
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,820
Sir,

15
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,820
the token, right?

16
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,460
Can I leave now?

17
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,390
Go.

18
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:55,940
Yes.

19
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,960
It's not easy for you.

20
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,830
You were doing fine by yourself,

21
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,080
but was dug up to be moved here to accompany me.

22
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,190
We are in the same boat.

23
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,180
Don't worry.

24
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,780
As long as I'm here,

25
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,440
I will be responsible for you.

26
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,370
You almost killed me.

27
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,829
Why are you still watering the flowers here?

28
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,840
Jieli, you...

29
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,060
Why are you here?

30
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,530
Don't you have to run the shop?

31
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,790
How dare you mention my shop?

32
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,590
I asked you to deliver some clothes.

33
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,690
How dare you mess around with others in Haishi City,

34
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,540
ruining my shop and treasures.

35
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,390
If I didn't run fast,

36
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,690
I would have died.

37
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,829
No, I didn't do that.

38
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,640
They wanted to arrest me for no reason,

39
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,570
even hit and tried to kill me.

40
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,260
Luckily Dongfang Qingcang saved me.

41
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,060
The Moon Supreme Lord saved you?

42
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,070
It seems the rumor is true.

43
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,090
What rumor?

44
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,110
It has spread throughout

45
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,170

46
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,899

49
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,620

50
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,140
What love story?

51
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,690
Don't listen to them.

52
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,409
By the way,

53
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:33,420
I also heard that

54
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,230
you saved the Moon Supreme Lord from the first God of War.

55
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,120
Really?

56
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,620
I...

57
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,320
It's a long story.

58
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,510
I don't know how to explain it.

59
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,400
It's just a misunderstanding.

60
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,120
Enough.

61
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,840
Whatever.

62
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,140
Well,

63
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,290
all my savings for thousands of years

64
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,800
are gone.

65
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,480
You are favored

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,010
and enjoy your life in the Silent Moon Palace.

67
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,680
Listen carefully.

68
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,990
You must take me in

69
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,670
and be responsible for me.

70
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,380
No.

71
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,470
You can't stay here.

72
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,070
It's really dangerous here.

73
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,000
How can it be more dangerous than that of  outside the palace?

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,770
There are so many people from Haishi city chasing me outside the palace.

75
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,960
It's not easy for me to sneak into the palace to seek shelter for you.

76
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,680
I don't want go out to make me die.

77
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,440
Besides,

78
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,510
-I also want to... -Hush.

79
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,500
He's here.

80
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,510
Hide yourself.

81

83
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:37,600
I...

84
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,650
The Moon Supreme Lord, what brings you here

85
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,870
to see me?

86
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,470
I want to see you.

87
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,330
Me?

88
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,760
I want to see

89
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,030
if you are fixing the Destiny Book.

90
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes.

91
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,590
I want to see if you are slacking off.

92
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,140
I...

93
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,920
I can't fix it. I can't fix it.

94
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,070
You're the Head Disciple of Arbiter, right?

95
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,290
Why can't you fix it?

96
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,890
I didn't know

97
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,070
I didn't know you were the Moon Supreme Lord in the Moon Tribe.

98
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,170
That's why I told you I can fix the Destiny Book.

99
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,030
Then you asked me to fix the Destiny Book every day.

100
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,000
To be honest,

101
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,060
I thought you had nothing to say.

102
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,410
Now I know

103
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,190
how ridiculous and how much of an overthinker

104
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,360
I am.

105
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,310
The Moon Supreme Lord has been asking me to fix the Destiny Book.

106
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,280
Is there any special reason for it?

107
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,659
Is it related to dealing with Shuiyuntian?

108
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,150
I knew it.

109
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,710
I helped you in front of Lord Changheng,

110
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,650
I have proved that I am a traitor.

111
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,750
But I won't do anything bad

112
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,890
to Shuiyuntian.

113
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,450
I asked you to fix the Destiny Book,

114
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,590
but you refused again and again.

115
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,970
I know

116
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,570
You have been kind to me.

117
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,170
You saved me three times.

118

Lord Yunzhong.

121
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,730
But I also saved you once.

122
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,150
You're the Super Moon Supreme Lord.

123
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,910
Your life is so valuable.

124
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,840
Saving you once is worth the three times you saved me.

125
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,960
We're even now.

126
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,190
We don't owe each other anymore.

127
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,080
It's not easy

128
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,340
to be even with me.

129
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,480
Let me ask you.

130
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,490
Are you going to fix it or not?

131
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,159
I'm just an apprentice who's not good at it.

132
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,270
The Destiny Book has been destroyed.

133
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,409
I can't fix it.

134
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:53,070
I don't have the abilities to.

135
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,850
Good.

136
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,510
Jieli!

137
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,770
The Moon Supreme Lord.

138
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,120
Is she your friend?

139
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,170
If I don't see the Destiny Book in three days,

140
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,500
I will kill her.

141
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,060
Shangque.

142
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,690
Yes.

143
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,740
Take her away

144
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,070
and guard her strictly.

145
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,080
Yes.

146
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,270
Let's go.

147
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,190
The Moon Supreme Lord.

148
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,330
The Moon Supreme Lord, please spare my life.

149
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,960
Orchid, save me.

150
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,500
Black Dragon.

151
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,900
Where are we going?

152
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,550
Wind Prison.

153
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,220
Wind Prison!

154
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,610
Black Dragon! Black Dragon!

155
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,990
I really didn't commit any crime.

156
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,880
I'm just a vendor who makes a living in the Haishi City.

157
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,650
I do business with my conscience.

158
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,820
My goods are well stocked and its price is fair.

159
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,830
Business is good.

160
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,130
If people of the Moon Tribe shop in my store,

161
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,520
I'll give them a 20% discount.

162
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,820
Black Dragon.

163
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,870
-So if you are a vendor... -Black Dragon, listen to me.

164
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,049
Why didn't you do business properly?

165
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:42,350
Why did you sneak into Silent Moon Palace?

166
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,400
It was Orchid.

167
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,530
I asked her to deliver some clothes on behalf of me.

168
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,960
But she made a mess.

169
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,930
The people of the Haishi City couldn't catch her,

170
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,480
so they hated me,

171
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,200
and chased to kill me all the way to Cangyan Sea.

172
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,130
Black Dragon.

173
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,300
I'm just a weak woman.

174
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,650
I came here to seek refuge with her.

175
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,320
Black Dragon.

176
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,740
Let's go.

177
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,540
Black Dragon.

178
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,550
Trust me.

179
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,950
I'm not lying. Black Dragon.

180
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,870
Listen to me!

181
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,730
-Shut up! -I...

182
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,040
Let me tell you the truth.

183
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,720
It won't work if you let her fix the Destiny Book

184
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,850
with my life.

185
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,360
Why?

186
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,720
I am not close to Orchid.

187
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,070
and we don't know each other actually.

188
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,290
She just comes to my shop to buy things.

189
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,060
She's so poor she always leaves it on credit.

190
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,070
She still owes me hundreds of spirit stones.

191
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:21,660
If...

192
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,010
If I die,

193
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,350
she doesn't have to pay the debt.

194
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,070
Isn't that a great thing?

195
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,200
Who can it threaten?

196
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,680
What you said

197
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,850
makes sense.

198
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,150
Right!

199
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,470
What do you think we should do?

200
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,400
Let me think.

201
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,090
Based on my understanding of Orchid,

202
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,980
it's not difficult to threaten her.

203
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,960
We just have to capture a few immortals,

204
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,010
and kill one every day in front of her,

205
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,670
until she is willing to fix it.

206
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,740
This seems to be a way.

207
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,680
Go and tell the Lord

208
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,560
and let me go.

209
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,690
No.

210
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,210
Why not?

211
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,810
The Orchid fairy is sentimental.

212
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,450
If she sees her clan is killed in person,

213
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,960
she will be sad.

214
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,340
The Lord will be sad too.

215
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,530
People in the Cangyan Sea say

216
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,310
the Lord trusts the Black Dragon around him the most.

217
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,570
Now I see it,

218
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,630
I don't think you know the Lord at all.

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,390
The Lord is powerful in the three realms.

220
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,530
Why would he be sad for a little fairy?

221
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,860
Who would believe that?

222
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,750
I don't believe it anyway.

223
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,950
What do you know?

224
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,080
Since 38,000 years ago,

225
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,610
I have been around the Lord.

226
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,370
After his demutation, I never left him.

227
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,170
He helped Orchid get the eternal fire,

228
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,140
make flower soup,

229
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,570
help her take the exam,

230
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,950
and pursue her lover.

231
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,640
To ease her missing for Shuiyuntian,

232
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,940
he even built

233
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,370
the same Arbiter Hall.

234
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,700
I saw it with my own eyes.

235
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,670
What I just said

236
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,260
is the Lord's personal matter.

237
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,320
Don't tell anyone.

238
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,790
Otherwise...

239
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,780
Black Dragon.

240
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,920
I'm very timid.

241
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,650
Since the childhood, when I was scared,

242
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,240
not only do my legs move uncontrollably,

243
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,840
but also my tongue will move uncontrollably.

244
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,190
I'll say things out of control.

245
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,450
Don't talk nonsense.

246
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,340
Don't lock me up in the Wind Prison.

247
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,650
And naturally, I won't talk about it.

248
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,870
This is the order of the Lord.

249
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,090
It's useless to say anything.

250
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,440
The Lord just asked you to keep an eye on me.

251
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,770
He didn't say we must go to the Wind Prison.

252
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,710
How about this?

253
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,600
You send me back

254
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,150
to where the woman the Lord loves,

255
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,240
the future Moon Queen of Canyan Sea,

256
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,120
Orchid lives.

257
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,800
Living there,

258
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,200
I can't run away, either.

259
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,470
What woman?

260
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,400
The future Moon Queen.

261
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,040
My Lord wants to unify the three realms.

262
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,000
As for Orchid,

263
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,270
the Lord regard her as a loyal friend.

264
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,330
When have they ever had a love affair?

265
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,600
The beauty in Silent Moon Palace

266
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,440
is like clouds

267
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,120
for the Lord.

268
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,050
That's it!

269
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,640
Think about what you said.

270
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,690
Doesn't that mean

271
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,790
the Lord is in the vast flowers now,

272
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,270
but he only looks at that orchid.

273
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,040
You've been with the Lord every day.

274
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,420
Didn't you notice it?

275
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,230
Black Dragon.

276
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,820
I think you're handsome too.

277
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,920
Why don't you have such wisdom?

278
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,350
The relationship

279
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,160
between the Lord and Orchid

280
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,210
is very special.

281
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,360
Let me explain it this way.

282
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,910
To girls,

283
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,040
making porridge and getting fire

284
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,600
are trivial matters.

285
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,820
The Lord built the Arbiter Hall

286
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,260
because she misses her home.

287
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,230
Well...

288
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,910
The Moon Supreme Lord is great.

289
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,910
So rich.

290
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,320
Let alone a luxury palace,

291
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,750
as long as someone can build a candy shop for me,

292
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,430
I will marry him.

293
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,690
You keep talking about getting married.

294
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,510
You're a girl.

295
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,510
Don't you feel ashamed?

296
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,920
Is that the point?

297
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,880
Black Dragon,

298
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,650
you're good at training soldiers and fighting.

299
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,860
But you don't even know

300
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,290
love between men and women.

301
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,930
How can you be considerate

302
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,260
and serve the Lord well?

303
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:49,850
Right?

304
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,740
Think about what I said.

305
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,000
Doesn't it make sense?

306
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,440
It's reasonable.

307
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,460
In that case,

308
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,060
the Lord and the fairy Orchid

309
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,480
are a perfect match.

310
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,080
She looks like a Moon Queen.

311
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,300
Of course.

312
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,500
But according to our ancestors' rules,

313
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,550
fairies and the Moon Tribe are not allowed to marry.

314
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,150
The Lord and the Orchid fairy

315
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,950
can't be together.

316
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,390
Think about it.

317
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,610
Is our Lord a man who follows rules?

318
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,260
No.

319
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,610
For what the Lord wants to do,

320
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,160
no one can stop him.

321
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,510
That's it.

322
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,730
Orchid is the future Moon Queen.

323
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,550
Then I'll be the future Moon Queen's sister.

324
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,400
Shouldn't you be nicer to me?

325
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,960
But didn't you just say

326
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,640
you're not close to

327
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,650
the Orchid fairy ?

328
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,800
If we're not close, how can I let her pay on credit?

329
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,270
Hundreds of spirit stones!

330
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,990
We've basically been through life and death together.

331
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,790
We are closer than sisters.

332
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,440
That makes sense.

333
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,240
Lock her up.

334
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,340
Yes.

335
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,780
Why are you

336
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,040
-so stubborn? -Go.

337
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,090
Jieli!

338
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:02,720
Jieli!

339
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,700
Jieli!

340
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,790
I'm here to see you.

341
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,470
Orchid!

342
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:08,640
Orchid!

343
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,860
Help me!

344
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,410
Don't let him lock me up.

345
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,660
Shangque is so stubborn.

346
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,710
He won't follow others' advice

347
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,440
expect the Moon Supreme Lord's.

348
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,990
Then do something.

349
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,590
Okay, I'll try.

350
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,470
Well, Shangque.

351
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,930
Yes.

352
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,390
Can you do me a favor?

353
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,400
Don't lock Jieli up..

354
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Leave her to me.

355
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,660
Yes.

356
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,840
You live well, Orchid.

357
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,580
I've finally coaxed this god with black face.

358
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,720
On the way,

359
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,910
I've been talking too much. I'm thirsty.

360
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,640
Here you are.

361
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,210
Tell me,

362
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,470
what special relationship do you have

363
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,940
with the Lord?

364
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,830
Like you said,

365
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,920
if others offend the Lord,

366
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,900
they would have died a graveless death.

367
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,760
What about you?

368
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,430
You didn't lose a strand of hair.

369
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,160
You and him...

370
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,680
You two...

371
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,100
Impossible.

372
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,880
We are not what you think.

373
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:37,850
Actually,

374
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,250
I don't know what kind of relationship we are now.

375
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,030
I have three questions

376
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,970
that can quickly determine your current relationship.

377
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,170
Do you dare to answer?

378
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,130
Go ahead.

379
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,850
Have you held hands?

380
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,410
Yes.

381
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,070
Have you been in the same room?

382
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,170
Tell me.

383
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,630
You're thousands of years old. Don't be shy.

384
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,210
We have been in the same room,

385
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:08,800
but...

386
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,520
Stop.

387
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,110
I don't want to hear the details.

388
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,400
Next question.

389
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,440
Have you kissed?

390
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,500
We've kissed many times.

391
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,720
But...

392
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,370
Wow, Orchid,

393
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,500
you made the Lord fall in love with you

394
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,560
without a word.

395
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,190
You are really capable.

396
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,610
No, that's not it.

397
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,550
I'll be frank with you.

398
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,540
Dongfang Qingcang was really good to me.

399
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,300
But he also said

400
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,480
he never liked me.

401
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,580
It's just because

402
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,680
of something called the Heart Curse.

403
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,110
That's why he protected me.

404
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,250
He had to take care of me.

405
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,430
Actually, he didn't do it willingly.

406
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,640
That's all?

407
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,460
That's it?

408
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,600
Don't you understand?

409
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,619
His kindness to me is fake.

410
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,480
I'm his weakness that he can't wait to get rid of.

411
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,069
He was nice to me

412
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,530
because he wanted me to fix the Destiny Book.

413
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,920
You're still too young.

414
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,380
You don't understand men.

415
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,630
For men,

416
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,850
dignity is more important than life.

417
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,660
He just doesn't want to admit

418
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,140
that he likes an useless fairy like you

419
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,910
so he made up this curse thing.

420
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,550
That's just an excuse.

421
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,300
Are you having a quarrel?

422
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,820
He forced you to fix it

423
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,580
to make you give in.

424
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,650
No.

425
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,670
He is the Moon Supreme Lord!

426
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,720
Does that matter?

427
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,540
Stubborn.

428
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,170
Since the Moon Supreme Lord likes you,

429
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,730
why don't you make good use of him?

430
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,450
Make him happy.

431
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,130
In the whole Silent Moon Palace...

432
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,360
No, in the whole Cangyan Sea,

433
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,950
you are the hostess.

434
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,570
Jieli is right.

435
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,880
I have to cheer Wooden Head up

436
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,390
to escape.

437
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,190
Fine, I'll listen to you.

438
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,040
Teach me

439
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,550
how to coax him.

440
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,740
Come here.

441
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,430
My Lord.

442
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,840
What is it?

443
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,520
My Lord,

444
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,360
fairy asked you to go to the Arbiter Hall.

445
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,360
She fixed the Destiny Book so quickly?

446
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,310
I don't know if it's about the Destiny Book.

447
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,700
She only said

448
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,210
she would give you a surprise.

449
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,170
Surprise?

450
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,390
It's good enough if she doesn't give me a scare.

451
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,220
Hurry up.

452
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,190
Will it work?

453
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,160
Of course.

454
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,170
Ouch!

455
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,730
Don't be nervous.

456
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,730
Smile naturally.

457
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,710
What did I teach you?

458
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,940
Talk about memories.

459
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,370
Yes!

460
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,080
Since you said

461
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,340
the Lord has restored

462
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,900
the same Arbiter Hall.

463
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,400
That means

464
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,750
every moment he spent with you

465
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,550
is in his heart.

466
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,850
It's so touching.

467
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:08,740
Come on.

468
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,790
Be ready!

469
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,750
At this moment,

470
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,650
you have to hold his hands gently

471
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,780
and take him through all the trees and grass here

472
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,430
to recall times you spent with him.

473
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
What do you think?

474
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,580
So mushy.

475
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,260
This is called being romantic.

476
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,560
Understand?

477
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,200
You're not romantic at all.

478
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,130
I don't know why the Lord likes you.

479
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,460
He's here. I have to go.

480
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,050
Wait, Jieli.

481
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,190
Let me emphasize it again.

482
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,990
No matter what I say or do later,

483
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,040
I do it in order to escape.

484
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,840
Don't get me wrong.

485
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,970
I know. It's just a temporary measure.

486
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,630
Have you fixed the Destiny Book?

487
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,200
I'm asking you.

488
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,660
Not yet.

489
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,740
You keep delaying.

490
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,920
Are you disrespecting me?

491
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,610
The Moon Supreme Lord is a great hero who is invincible in the world.

492
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,460
You're the best in the world.

493
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,560
How dare I disrespect you?

494
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,760
The best in the world?

495
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,560
How about comparing me with your Changheng?

496
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:58,590
The Moon Supreme Lord is the strongest in the three realms.

497
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,230
No one can compare with you.

498
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,860
You're sensible.

499
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,580
What?

500
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,310
You think you will die

501
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,410
and now you want to flatter me?

502
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,310
I remember

503
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,650
that day,

504
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:20,140
you said that

505
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,610
I begged for mercy

506
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,670
with a bloody nose and a swollen face.

507
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:29,880
Wait.

508
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,150
I also made some flower cakes.

509
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,750
Would you like to try it, the Moon Supreme Lord?

510
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,360
Is it good?

511
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,680
But the taste

512
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,090
is different from before.

513
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,790
I added the honey of Forgetting Sadness Grass in it.

514
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,340
You feel sad recently.

515
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,270
You can be happier after eating it.

516
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,100
Who told you I was sad?

517
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,750
These days,

518
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,610
whenever I think of how Shuiyuntian called me a spy,

519
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,760
and they no longer welcome me home,

520
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,140
I was heartbroken.

521
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,600
You've been in the Haotian Tower for 30,000 years.

522
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,240
After coming home,

523
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,510
your family doesn't welcome you.

524
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,520
How can you not be sad?

525
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,750
You mean Xunfeng?

526
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,630
Do you think I don't know you're playing tricks?

527
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,190
Fix the Destiny Book now!

528
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,030
Don't go.

529
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,000
Wooden Head,

530
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,600
I have something to tell you.

531
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,130
Why do you call me Wooden Head?

532
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,200
The Moon Supreme Lord sounds distant.

533
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,830
It's scary.

534
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,810
I don't dare to tell you my feelings.

535
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,270
It feels much closer to call you Wooden Head.

536
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,340
But if you don't like it,

537
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,000
I won't call you that anymore.

538
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,450
You can call me whatever you want.

539
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,020
What do you want to ask me?

540
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,950
I counted the flowers in the Arbiter Hall.

541
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,180
There are really 8,452 flowers.

542
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,570
What are you trying to say?

543
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:50,160
You even remember such a trivial thing?

544
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,930
You even remember what happened between us.

545
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,280
Your kindness to me is true.

546
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,390
I am the Moon Supreme.

547
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,860
I am destined to overturn the three realms

548
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,730
and revive the Cangyan Sea.

549
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,830
I told you

550
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,390
there is no love between us.

551
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,490
I don't believe it.

552
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,930
Do you know what this is?

553
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,590
This is Hellfire,

554
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,070
the most powerful magic in the three realms.

555
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,300
You're the only one who mastered it in the three realms

556
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,150
expect Yannv, the first ancestor of the Moon Tribe.

557
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,700
But do you know?

558
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,360
If you want to learn Hellfire,

559
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,190
what price should be paid?

560
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,010
Detached from love.

561
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,070
Detached from the seven emotions.

562
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,800
As long as there is a little bit of love in my heart,

563
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,230
I can't control the Hellfire completely.

564
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,800
Detached from love?

565
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,600
That's right.

566
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,910
Be it for the immortals or people,

567
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,560
they are all affected by the seven emotions.

568
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,890
But by using the ancient forbidden skills to remove my love,

569
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,270
my mood won't be disturbed.

570
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,240
From now on,

571
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,720
even if I kill my family,

572
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,860
I won't hesitate.

573
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,770
I won't fall in love with anyone.

574
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,270
Father.

575
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,620
Kill me, please.

576
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,350
The feelings are all over people's meridians.

577
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,430
[The Old Moon Supreme]

578
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,360
When it was removed, it would resurrect.

579
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,800
If we don't get rid of the new one,

580
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,280
our efforts will be in vain.

581
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,190
Only by removing the root of love

582
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,890
can you become the most powerful person in the three realms.

583
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,030
Father.

584
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,210
Now you understand.

585
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,240
It turns out

586
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,800
that's your Heart Sea and Love Tree.

587
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,910
You know I detached from love,

588
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,090
you are not sad,

589
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,400
but happy.

590
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,320
Why?

591
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,490
So you said you hated me.

592
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,080
It isn't true.

593
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,010
You've only been removed from your feelings.

594
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,320
You have no choice.

595
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,450
It's not your fault.

596
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,060
Jieli is right.

597
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,520
I should think more about what you did for me.

598
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,640
You've done so much for me.

599
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,080
This time, it's my turn.

600
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,530
It's just a Love Tree.

601
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,800
You're lucky.

602
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,560
Although I'm just an useless fairy,

603
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,710
there's no plant I can't cure.

604
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:05,990
Ridiculous!

605
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,500
I've lost all roots of my Love Tree,,

606
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,770
just like people of the immortals and the Moon Tribe lose their the primordial spirit totally.

607
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,770
There is no chance of resurrection.

608
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,270
Not to mention you, a lowly flower spirit,

609
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,330
even if you find the ancient gods,

610
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,590
it may not be possible.

611
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,940
How do you know

612
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,130
if you don't try?

613
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:28,020
Everyone said I couldn't pass the immortal examination.

614
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,240
But not only did I pass,

615
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,040
but also I won the championship.

616
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,620
I have wasted half a day with you.

617
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,820
I don't have time to talk nonsense with you.

618
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,410
Daqiang,

619
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,040
I will never give up on you.

620
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,290
The elixir to amplify for emotional fluctuations.

621
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,090
Do you have it?

622
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:58,890
Yes.

623
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,140
But why do you need that medicine?

624
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,800
What are you going to do?

625
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,060
Jieli!

626
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,570
Jieli!

627
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,870
Jieli!

628
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,420
Why are you leaving?

629
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,310
I'm going to find something

630
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,040
that can make me die fast and painlessly.

631
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,470
I thought you had made the Lord fall in love with you.

632
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,000
But I didn't expect that he has already removed the root of love.

633
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,090
Oh no.

634
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,980
Don't panic.

635
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,870
Let's help him cure the Love Tree.

636
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,960
Once his root of love is recovered,

637
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,980
our lives will be saved.

638
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,690
Besides,

639
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,000
he and I are connected by the Heart Curse.

640
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,930
We are connected.

641
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,990
If he can understand the seven emotions through me,

642
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,620
once his Love Tree is stimulated, he might...

643
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,180
Sister,

644
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:40,850
do you think

645
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,700
his Love Tree is the grass in your yard?

646
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,330
Detaching from love

647
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:46,390
is a forbidden ancient skill according to the legends.

648
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,430
Jieli, please.

649
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:53,160
Give me the medicine first, Jieli.

650
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,210
Let go!

651
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,090
What have I done wrong?

652
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,760
Hey, it's a deal.

653
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,230
You buy it on credit.

654
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,960
30 spirit stones.

655
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,560
3...

656
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,630
OK, let me buy it on credit first.

657
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,310
Hey.

658
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,900
You still owe me 743 spirit stones.

659
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,630
I haven't even calculated the interest with you.

660
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,340
As my Lord's brother,

661
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,320
Xunfeng should help you revive our clan

662
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,700
and strengthen the Cangyan Sea.

663
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,970
But now he colluded with Lord of Haishi City

664
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,070
to usurp power.

665
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,200
It's unforgivable.

666
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,010
The champion?

667
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,780
I am the champion of the immortal examination.

668
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,670
I can enter Fountain Palace now.

669
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,630
Fortunately, my Lord has both wisdom and courage

670
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,680
and prepared before.

671
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,810
In an instant,

672
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,660
his trickery failed.

673
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,640
We are deeply impressed

674
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,040
by your actions like thunderbolt, my Lord.

675
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,880
What's wrong with what I said?

676
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,450
What is she doing?

677
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,400
My Lord, what is this?

678
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,150
Although Xunfeng was forced

679
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,800
to control the Cangyan Sea.

680
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,330
He has been the Moon Supreme for 30,000 years.

681
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,929
How can the Lord not mind it?

682
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,350
He just has no chance to punish him.

683
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,250
Now Xunfeng is seeking death,

684
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,560
the Lord can get rid of him justifiably

685
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,040
and feel relieved.

686
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,400
If you're not an immortal, you're the person of the Moon Tribe.

687
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,570
How could I be a person of the Moon Tribe?

688
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:05,970
My Lord.

689
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,200
I rebelled against Xunfeng

690
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,960
because I couldn't bear to see

691
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,900
our foundation be overturned by an incompetent person.

692
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,070
In my heart,

693
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,730
you are the only Moon Supreme.

694
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,340
I am definitely loyal to you, my Lord.

695
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,730
I suggest

696
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,840
Xunfeng,

697
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,220
the treacherous criminal

698
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,480
be executed

699
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,330
as a warning to others.

700
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,670
Why is the Lord crying suddenly?

701
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:49,950
Well...

702
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,590
After all, they're a family.

703
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,690
To kill his brother

704
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,080
the Lord couldn't bear it.

705
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,760
I overstepped the line.

706
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,160
I shouldn't have asked about Xunfeng.

707
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,770
It's up to you,

708
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,870
my Lord.

709
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,900
Get lost!

710
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,700
Go get my You jade ring.

711
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,420
I've ordered someone to get it.

712
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,620
It'll be right there.

713
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,150
What are you looking at?

714
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,950
Stop looking!

715
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,430
Or I'll peel off your dragon skin.

716
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,670
My Lord.

717
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,090
Bring me Orchid.

718
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,640
Yes.

719
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,110
Go!

720
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,810
The Moon Supreme Lord.

721
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,060
L... Lord.

722
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,450
It really has nothing to do with me.

723
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,980
I just sold medicine to her.

724
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,230
The... The Moon Supreme Lord.

725
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,530
Put her down.

726
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,290
She will be strangled to death.

727
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,050
Jieli.

728
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,700
Did you ever think that she would die

729
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,630
when you played jokes on me?

730
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,560
The Moon Supreme Lord.

731
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,650
I was wrong.

732
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,700
It's all my fault.

733
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,880
I won't do it again!

734
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,820
I won't do it anymore.

735
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,540
Put her down.

736
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,700
Jieli.

737
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,660
Are you okay?

738
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,300
If you do it again, I'll kill you.

739
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,430
Where are we going?

740
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,280
You still want to go to Cangyan Sea, right?

741
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,940
I don't want to drag you and Danyin into this

742
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,540
to be punished by my brother.

743
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,420
Ronghao,

744
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,970
you don't need to know anything.

745
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,020
I'll pretend that

746
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,630
you didn't come to the Fountain Palace today.

747
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,890
But I know everything.

748
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,870
I know you love her deeply.

749
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,720
I know you haven't recovered,

750
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,150
and you're suppressing your brother's seal.

751
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,280
It's a spent bullet.

752
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,750
I also know

753
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,290
if you go to Cangyan Sea alone,

754
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,990
it will be no different from suicide.

755
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:47,830
So what?

756
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,100
All these years,

757
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,870
brother only cared about the reputation of the heavenly family

758
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,680
and never let me fall in love with others.

759
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,610
I thought being indifferent to her

760
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,910
was my protection to her.

761
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,680
But because of this ridiculous thought,

762
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,940
I watched her suffer

763
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,240
while I stood by.

764
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,090
Now, she is framed as a traitor

765
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,050
and is caught in Cangyan Sea.

766
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,380
How can I don't save her?

767
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,040
Changheng.

768
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,820
Ever since my master died,

769
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,720
you are the only person I care about

770
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,850
in this world.

771
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:18,830
You want to stop me?

772
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,030
You're so badly injured.

773
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,910
It's not difficult to stop you.

774
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,280
But I won't stop you.

775
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,630
If I have a chance to save my master,

776
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,430
What do you think I will do?

777
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,610
You will fight to the death.

778
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,150
Even if you betray others,

779
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,640
or go against the law of heaven,

780
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,560
it's worth it.

781
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,330
That's it.

782
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:34,260
