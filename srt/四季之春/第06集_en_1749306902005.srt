1
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,470
ALL CHARACTERS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,970
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,350
The guitar I mangled before.

4
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,900
I got you another just like it.

5
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,320
I know it'll be hard,
but could you forgive me, slowly?

6
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,280
I rearranged your room
the way I thought would work best.

7
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,660
I hope you'll like it.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,920
I also received confirmation
from The Crown's agency.

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,670
The rest is up to you.

10
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,010
I'll do it.

11
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,260
I will.

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,220
No, I'll give it my all.

13
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,840
So that no one remembers
who I'm replacing.

14
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,810
I'll outshine Sa Gye.

15
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,350
I'll prove myself.

16
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,810
Good.

17
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,980
We're good now.

18
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,230
Everything is finally back
on the right track.

19
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,240
JO & JO ENTERTAINMENT: CEO JO
SANG-HEON ARTIST: SEO TAE-YANG

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,460
I truly welcome you as the new member
and leader of The Crown.

21
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,670
- Thank you.
- All in due time,

22
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,550
you'll greet the members
once the album is released.

23
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,470
It'll be kept under wraps from the media
for the time being.

24
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,760
That's fine by me.

25
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,520
Is the new song out today?

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,570
That's right.
It'll be dropped today exactly at noon.

27
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,610
That's in ten minutes.

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,200
It's good.

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,290
- The song's incredible.
- The Crown nailed it again.

30
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,960
It's amazing!

31
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,870
THE CROWN'S STILL GOING
FOR A REASON

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,170
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

33
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,840
What the hell?

34
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,640
Bom, what's wrong?

35
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
- This…
- What?

36
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,140
This? What?

37
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,810
What is this song?

38
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,060
Oh, this song?

39
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,230
It's The Crown's new song
that dropped at noon today.

40
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,690
Isn't it great? I just love it.

41
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,030
<i>You're still writing songs, right?</i>

42
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,450
<i>If you're selling,</i>
<i>I'm willing to offer top dollar.</i>

43
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,170
What's with her?

44
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,420
<i>…to let you go</i>

45
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,930
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

46
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,220
<i>Say "I'll see you later"</i>

47
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,970
<i>Tell me it's never really bye, bye, bye</i>

48
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,400
Can I ask how you came up with this song?

49
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,780
I felt down, so I went to the ocean.

50
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,360
I walked past a woman there,

51
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,950
and I saw myself in her.

52
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,740
Her eyes looked so sad,

53
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,960
but she kept her head held high,

54
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,460
making her seem even lonelier.

55
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,500
That's when the melody and the lyrics
of this song came to me.

56
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,380
Do you mind if I ask why you were sad?

57
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,130
Were you going through a breakup
with someone you loved?

58
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,430
Truth be told,

59
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,270
I had a crush on someone for a long time.

60
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,140
Someone as charming as you didn't have
your feelings reciprocated?

61
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,560
That's hard to believe.

62
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,980
It's that kind of bias
that makes me feel even lonelier.

63
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,150
But I'm over it now.

64
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,530
I feel like I've moved on
to a new chapter in my life.

65
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,910
I'm ready to experience

66
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,870
new love.

67
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,000
Why did The Crown release
your song as their own?

68
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,840
- Did you sell it to Ji-na?
- Of course, I didn't.

69
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,590
That song is about me and my mom.

70
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,050
Why would I sell it to anyone? Move.

71
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,180
I'll go with you.

72
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,350
Why? How is this your business?

73
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,980
I'm the only one
who knows the song is yours.

74
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,230
You can't do it alone. You don't know
what you're getting yourself into.

75
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,770
No one in there will believe you.

76
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,770
I don't trust you either.

77
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,440
So stay out of my business.

78
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,900
If you keep getting in my way,

79
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,160
I'll assume you sold off
my song to Jo Ji-na.

80
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,030
Like you said,

81
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,240
only the two of us knew this song.

82
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,000
You can't go in there.

83
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,920
Tell her it's Kim Bom.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,590
This is urgent, and I must talk to her!

85
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,420
It's hard to say
when the interview will end.

86
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,130
You should make an appointment first.

87
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,340
Aren't you Kim Bom?

88
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,890
What brings you here?
Are you here to see me?

89
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,520
- Do you really not know why I'm here?
- Why else would I be asking?

90
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,810
Did something happen to Gye?

91
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,070
Fine.

92
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,950
If you're really clueless,
I'll say it right here.

93
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,330
Are you sure you don't mind
having reporters here?

94
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,910
I wouldn't mind,

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,500
but it's rude to keep a guest
standing in the hallway.

96
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,670
Shall we head inside?

97
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,100
Let's hear it, then.

98
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,900
Why did you barge in here
without an appointment?

99
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,810
When did you steal my song?

100
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,980
Why did you do this?

101
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,570
The lyrics and music
of The Crown's new single match mine.

102
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,110
What do you mean?
What are you saying I stole?

103
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,780
Don't act dumb.

104
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,030
You altered the chords
and the arrangement,

105
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,620
but even that…

106
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,950
It was too obvious.

107
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,870
Are you talking about

108
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,920
the song you sold to me?

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,880
No, not that!

110
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,300
Why do you keep playing dumb?

111
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,760
You obviously saw my songbook. When…

112
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,720
No way. On our retreat?

113
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,480
I'm off to the van.

114
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,160
- Are you having fun?
- Yes.

115
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,870
Why aren't you joining us out there?

116
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,750
It was then. I'm sure of it.

117
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,590
You looked through my songbook
that was in my backpack.

118
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,590
That's when the keychain fell off.

119
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,170
Ms. Kim,

120
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,010
don't you think you're being
a little delusional?

121
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,600
I don't even want to know
what song you're referring to,

122
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,260
but how are you so sure that you're

123
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,520
the only one
who can write a song like that?

124
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,270
There's no song that only you can write.

125
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,810
You're not exactly extraordinary.

126
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,440
How can you prove you wrote this song?

127
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,690
Show me if you can.

128
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,940
Why should I?

129
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,030
Because I know you stole it.

130
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,070
I can prove that it's my song.

131
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,370
Right here. It's all here in my songbook.

132
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,500
All the revisions I've made
over the years are all here.

133
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,130
Also…

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,800
This necklace is the proof of all that.

135
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
I'll request the song to be taken down.

136
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,230
And you'll have to give it your all

137
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,480
proving

138
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,520
you didn't steal my song.

139
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
See for yourself.

140
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,900
I also have a songbook.

141
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,530
Like you, I also spent years
revising my work.

142
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,450
The entire process is in there.

143
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,460
You're lying.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,040
This can't be.

145
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,840
Bring me evidence that's irrefutable,

146
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,340
not just circumstantial.

147
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,260
Because an unbacked claim
is simply a delusion.

148
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,640
I answered your question,
so please leave now.

149
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,930
I've got better things to do
than handling losers' tantrums.

150
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,600
Can you see my visitor out?

151
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,480
Call security if you need to.

152
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,020
I'll sue you.

153
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,610
No lie can go unexposed,
and the law will hold you accountable.

154
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,990
I won't stop you
from getting into a dogfight.

155
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,450
However,

156
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,950
keep in mind that I already hold
the copyright to the song.

157
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,620
You're…

158
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
pure evil.

159
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,800
Let go of me. Let go!

160
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,560
Let go. Let go of me.

161
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,190
- This is unfair.
- Bom!

162
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,690
I didn't do anything wrong.

163
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,900
She's the one who stole my song.

164
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,920
I couldn't help but call the police.

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,880
The last thing we need is a scandal
on the day the song drops.

166
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,800
An explanation seems to be in order.

167
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,300
Was the song written by Kim Bom?

168
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,720
I wanted to dig us out
of the hole we were in.

169
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,060
I couldn't let my mistake
delay the release of the new song.

170
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,440
You call this digging us out of a hole?

171
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,230
Why'd you steal
from Kim Bom of all people?

172
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,110
Neither Kim Bom nor Sa Gye
will let this slide!

173
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,530
Why did you let us get involved
with those two again?

174
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,370
You should've discussed this with me.

175
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,830
Then things wouldn't have gotten this far!

176
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,500
I wanted your acknowledgement.

177
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,210
And I wanted that song for myself.

178
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,880
Things happened so fast,

179
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,960
and I was too afraid to confess.

180
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,220
Father, please help me this one time.

181
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,220
I'll do anything.

182
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,180
I can't go down like this.

183
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,400
If people find out I stole the song--

184
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
Shut up!

185
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,360
Listen to me.

186
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,240
From this moment on,
forget that you ever stole the song.

187
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,370
Don't ever mention it, even in your dream.

188
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,620
Do you hear me?

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,670
Ji-na, that song is yours. Okay?

190
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,920
You wrote it.

191
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,880
So defend it with your life.

192
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,930
If this gets out, you, me,

193
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,850
and Jo & Jo will all go down.

194
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,520
Bom, hey.

195
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,350
Are you all right?

196
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,980
Why are you here?

197
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,530
I was obviously worried.
Do you think I came here for fun?

198
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,740
Mind your own business and leave.

199
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,570
Do you and Sa Gye know each other?

200
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,160
Yes, I'm here as her guardian.

201
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,620
Guardian, my ass.

202
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,950
I don't know him at all.

203
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,700
I don't care about any of that.

204
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,330
Trespassing on private property
and vandalism.

205
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,130
It might not end with just a fine.

206
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,250
I'll make sure to give her an earful.

207
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,970
She hasn't been in her right mind
after a serious breakup.

208
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,390
- The jerk must work at Jo & Jo.
- Hey.

209
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,640
What is this crap?

210
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,060
I don't have the energy to deal with you,
so don't piss me off and leave.

211
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,850
- Go!
- But…

212
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,810
Will you just stay put?

213
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,360
It's actually time for her meds.

214
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,030
She's not usually this violent.
I'll make sure

215
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,870
she apologizes to those at Jo & Jo,
so could you give her a pass?

216
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,620
Are you insane? Why should I apologize?

217
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,960
I'll sue them
and request the song to be taken down.

218
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,460
Be quiet.

219
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,340
I'll make the guy who broke your heart
kneel before you.

220
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,460
Sounds good?

221
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,590
Did Jo & Jo put you up to this?

222
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,600
Did they threaten you to silence me?

223
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,720
- Don't get worked up.
- How can I not?

224
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,680
They stole my song.

225
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,350
Because you won't win
unless you stay cool-headed.

226
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,230
If you go after them without a plan,

227
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,360
they might…

228
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,570
bury you.

229
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,490
How could they bury me

230
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,570
when I'm not famous
and have nothing to lose?

231
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,450
It'll be their reputation
that takes the hit.

232
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,040
I'll continue to fight.
I won't let them have it.

233
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,460
- That's the song I wrote for my mom.
- That's why

234
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,330
you need to calm down.

235
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,840
Would you rather lose it in vain,
just like your mom?

236
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,300
What do you mean?

237
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,640
Well, I…

238
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,560
I mean, that's how important the song is.

239
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,770
Save the advice.

240
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,820
We mean nothing to each other now.

241
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,030
We could at least…

242
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,860
be friends.

243
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,330
I never considered you a friend.

244
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,630
I'm not saying you shouldn't fight.

245
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,460
I'm saying you should be smart.
I can't tell you about it just yet…

246
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,880
but there's a missing piece.

247
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,850
Just give me the benefit
of the doubt and trust me.

248
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,760
What is it that I don't know?

249
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,440
That your enemy

250
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,690
is more afraid of you
than you can imagine.

251
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,110
They're panicking,
desperate to hide something even worse.

252
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,370
I'll help you.

253
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,000
As long as you keep up the fight,

254
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,210
I'll be there by your side.

255
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,500
First, let's think about what we can do.

256
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,760
The members are still unaware
that you're joining the band.

257
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,930
For now, you'll use this locker.

258
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,310
You can use SAGYE's practice studio.

259
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,650
Just make sure no one sees you.

260
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,480
Sure. I got it.

261
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,030
SAGYE

262
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,740
THE CROWN FOREVER!
SAGYE, INO, KADI

263
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,900
<i>Why do I feel like I'm being chased?</i>

264
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,150
<i>Why?</i>

265
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,490
<i>You told me</i>

266
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,490
you liked Bom first.

267
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,410
But liking her first
doesn't mean she's yours.

268
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,160
<i>Love isn't first come, first served.</i>

269
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,740
You're wrong.

270
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,160
Time never betrays you.

271
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,400
<i>I don't want to know why you did this.</i>

272
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,530
<i>What matters</i>

273
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,820
<i>is that I lost someone I cared about.</i>

274
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,660
<i>You're just like CEO Jo.</i>

275
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,080
<i>Shameless and evil.</i>

<i>I can't post any negative post</i>
<i>about Jo & Jo.</i>

285
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,620
<i>So this is how far they'll go?</i>

286
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,840
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

287
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,680
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

288
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,010
<i>Say "I'll see you later"</i>

289
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,060
See? The melody is identical.

290
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,390
It was plagiarized.

291
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,770
Well, I can't say for sure.
Is there proof?

292
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,400
This is my songbook.

293
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,690
You can see that the pages are worn out.

294
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,740
You can even see the date I noted.

295
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,820
Isn't this enough to file a lawsuit?
It is, right?

296
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,330
I guess you could file a lawsuit.

297
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,580
That's not what I want to hear!
You should say I can win this case.

298
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,710
I haven't won any cases yet, you see.

299
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,840
Anyway, the process
of proving song plagiarism

300
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,460
is time-consuming and tiring.

301
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,090
It's not worth the effort.

302
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,050
On top of that, the other party
has already copyrighted the song.

303
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,970
They fast-tracked it,
expecting this to happen.

304
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,430
Experts will recognize
that the song was plagiarized.

305
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,140
Please help me, sir.

306
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,390
First, please calm down.

307
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,020
Why don't we talk about
an irrefutable piece of evidence?

308
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,150
What can you present?

309
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,240
Why do I need to prove anything
when it's clearly mine?

310
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,240
One is soft and lyrical
while the other is hard rock.

311
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,620
How can it be plagiarism
when they have different styles?

312
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,660
They took my song
and arranged it with an intense rock beat.

313
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,170
The melody is identical.
How can you not see that?

314
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,790
You see…

315
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,710
I know music.

316
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,090
I was a musician myself.

317
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,760
What do you take me for?

318
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,010
Look. Lee Hong…

319
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,180
You know, the band that starts with an F.

320
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,930
Darn it.

321
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,430
Anyway, it'll be hard to win this case.

322
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,230
Jo & Jo will hire the best lawyer possible
and come at you.

323
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,900
How do you expect to win?

324
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,070
To be honest, I don't think

325
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,740
I could win.

326
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,580
Look how tiny my office is.

327
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,290
Take it and leave.

328
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,750
<i>The person you called is unavailable.</i>

329
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,800
Reporter Han, why couldn't I reach you?
I've been calling nonstop.

330
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,430
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

331
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,770
You don’t know why I’m here.

332
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:42,150
Look, Jo & Jo has already spread the word.

333
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,980
That you'll come
at The Crown's new album, out of spite.

334
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,780
Leave it be. This won't change anything.
You'll only embarrass yourself.

335
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,990
You have it all wrong.

336
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,410
Don't believe what Mr. Jo says.
It's all lies.

337
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,240
Please. Please help me out.

338
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,710
- What's happening is unfair.
- Get a grip on yourself.

339
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,250
No reporter will help you.

340
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,210
All entertainment news outlets
are connected to Jo & Jo.

341
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,590
Jo & Jo owns half of their shares.

342
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,840
You won't get this advice anywhere else.

343
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,260
Take care of yourself.

344
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,560
Mr. Han, I'll wait for your call!

345
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,650
I trust you. You're the only remaining
reliable reporter!

346
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,110
Please call me!

347
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,710
Have you moved out of Kim Bom's house?

348
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,130
I have nothing to say to you.

349
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,260
Unless you're here to admit to the theft,
just keep moving.

350
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,520
Why are you doing this to me?

351
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,850
What do you mean I stole?

352
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,440
How can you accuse me
after only hearing Kim Bom's side?

353
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,730
It's a song I could've easily written.

354
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,730
So why do you think I couldn't have?

355
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,070
You couldn't have written it.

356
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,530
You can fool others, but not me.

357
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,820
Shouldn't you at least

358
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,660
give me the benefit of the doubt?

359
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,540
When you got into trouble
and got kicked out,

360
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,250
I begged my father on my knees.

361
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,090
So why won't you do anything for me?

362
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,250
You can kneel again…

363
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,090
in front of Bom.

364
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,930
It's not too late to ask for forgiveness.

365
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,800
Is that all you can say to me?

366
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,430
Do I…

367
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,720
Do I mean nothing to you?

368
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,810
I worked every day for six years
just to help you become a star.

369
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,060
I followed you everywhere,
from Europe to the US,

370
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,730
pouring my life into designing
your wardrobe and performances

371
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,820
at the expense of my own.

372
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,240
And this is how you repay me?

373
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,030
For Kim Bom, whom you only recently met,

374
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,620
you'll throw away our relationship?

375
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,250
You and Mr. Jo may have opened doors,

376
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,130
but I climbed to the top by myself.

377
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,000
I took every step alone.

378
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,340
What?

379
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,050
So why can't you do the same?

380
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,300
Does success have to come
at the cost of others?

381
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,350
Is that how you made it so far?

382
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,470
It's pathetic.

383
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,620
<i>Tae-yang, are you aware</i>
<i>that you're addicted to caffeine?</i>

384
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,080
<i>Do you want to die while studying</i>
<i>all night? Please stop drinking those.</i>

385
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,170
<i>You need quality sleep.</i>

386
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,720
Jeez, it looks tasty.

387
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,110
What's wrong with me today?

388
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,530
Breakfast is ready!

389
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:20,450
In five seconds, I'm clearing the table.

390
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,450
Goodness.

391
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,370
Seaweed soup. Just what I wanted.

392
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,710
Again, there isn't any meat.

393
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,170
Meat? In this weather, mussels are better.

394
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,750
I like my eggs over easy,
but you always fully cook the yolk.

395
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,760
Please keep that in mind.

396
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,680
Being picky, are we?

397
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,010
I cooked them thoroughly
since they had expired.

398
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,060
I was being considerate, okay?

399
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,510
Anyway, where is everyone else?

400
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,310
Beats me. What's taking Bom so long?

401
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,110
Ms. Kim, can I also have a perilla leaf?

402
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,980
Bom left ages ago.

403
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,740
Even though she makes very little,
she's incredibly busy.

404
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,650
It's not like her jobs pay well.

405
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,200
It's nicely seasoned, right?

406
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,240
- Totally.
- I know.

407
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,080
Did Bom get some sleep?

408
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,540
I'm not a watchdog. How would I know that?

409
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,370
The soup will get cold. Hurry downstairs!

410
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,710
Bae Gyu-ri!

411
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,300
Look at you dragging your feet.

412
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,840
Mom, were you in a heavy metal band?

413
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,180
A fangirl of Jeon In-kwon
and not Shin Seung-hun, right?

414
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,260
Would it kill you to speak more softly?

415
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,390
SAGYE!

416
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,140
What the heck? Why are you screaming?

417
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,560
When did you get back?

418
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,480
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

419
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,320
I thought you had dropped out of school
and left for good.

420
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,950
Goodness.

421
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,030
Don't you ever leave me again.

422
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,870
I was worried sick.

423
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,290
I couldn't sleep
and completely bombed my exams.

424
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,550
That isn't my fault.

425
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,010
- Let's eat.
- Sure.

426
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,970
How embarrassing.

427
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,020
Here for your stuff?

428
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,730
What do you mean?

429
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,810
What is this brat doing here?
When did you get here?

430
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,070
A while ago.

431
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,900
You brat. How dare you come back
like nothing ever happened?

432
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,160
This isn't a coin karaoke
that you can come and go as you please.

433
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,530
Get over here, you brat.

434
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,370
You…

435
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,960
You dodged that?

436
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,620
Like that'd stop me.

437
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,090
Why you… Get back here, you brat.

438
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,470
What's going on?

439
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,480
Why are you staying here?
Where's Tae-yang?

440
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,190
Unbelievable.

441
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,560
I'm gone for a few days,
and I come back to a new roommate?

442
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,070
You're one to talk!

443
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,320
You prick.

444
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,570
You quit the band
without so much as an explanation.

445
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,950
You have some nerve coming back.

446
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,030
The band broke up because of you.

447
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,200
Do you have any idea
the heartache you've caused?

448
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,540
You irresponsible jerk.

449
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,620
Just get lost!

450
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,710
Jin-gu, I know you're upset,
but at least give me a heads-up.

451
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,300
That was cowardly.

452
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,760
I see that punch wasn't enough.

453
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:37,440
Jin-gu, a punch from a trained drummer
could be deadly.

454
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,690
Are you kidding me?
I should beat the crap out of you.

455
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,030
Hello, Reporter Han.

456
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,240
Really?

457
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,700
Thank you so much.
I'll seriously owe you one.

458
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,120
I'll be on my way now.

459
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,790
Did you just smile?

460
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,380
Get back here!

461
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,630
SAGYE, run.

462
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,140
Stop, my ass!

463
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,050
I'm teaching him a lesson today.

464
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,430
Who are you to say that?
Don't you know who he is?

465
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,270
Take it out on me instead!

466
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,530
Hey.

467
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,490
You… Let go of me.

468
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,950
Let go while I'm asking nicely.

469
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,880
It's your fault!

470
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,800
Why won't you let SAGYE alone?

471
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,140
<i>So why can't you do the same?</i>

472
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,980
<i>Does success have to come</i>
<i>at the cost of others?</i>

473
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,060
<i>Is that how you made it so far?</i>

474
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,320
Why did you ask to see me?

475
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,570
Don't even think
about trying to pay me off.

476
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,580
No way I'm backing down
after that visit to the police station.

477
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,870
Of course. I didn't think you would.

478
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,250
I guess I can throw courtesy
out the window.

479
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,050
I came across an interesting video
in my dad's office this morning.

480
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:32,470
My dad must be deeply upset by all this.

481
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,640
It's understandable,

482
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,810
given that a mere 20-year-old
is making baseless accusations.

483
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,350
In two hours,

484
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,440
he will release this video to the press.

485
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,190
You probably know this,

486
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,940
but my dad is a man of his word.

487
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:50,940
Tell him to go ahead.

488
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,740
I'm not guilty of anything.

489
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:57,660
Did he catch me on video stealing,
like a certain someone?

490
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,290
Let's check it out together.

491
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,260
Only you can stop this video
from being released.

492
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,380
You're smart,
so I'll let you think it over.

493
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,720
Ms. Jo Ji-na,

494
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,510
is this who you are?

495
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,100
I can't just sit back
and let you come at me.

496
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,600
I have to do what it takes
to defend myself.

497
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,190
Don't you agree?

498
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,650
SA GYE

499
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,950
Promise me you won't
take issue with this song.

500
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,790
Just sign right here.

501
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,000
What if I won't?

502
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,000
Then, SAGYE will lose any chance
of making a comeback.

503
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,090
But if you sign this document,

504
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,630
I'll make sure this video stays buried.

505
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,760
You have my word.

506
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,600
My answer…

507
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,520
is no.

508
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,940
Don't you care about
what'll happen to Gye?

509
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,980
I thought you were close friends.

510
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,730
I'm disappointed.

511
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,150
The Sa Gye I know

512
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,660
would never resort to violence.

513
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,490
You should know that too.

514
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,830
If he went as far
as to destroy Mr. Jo's car,

515
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,700
Mr. Jo must have done

516
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,080
something terribly wrong.

517
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,210
Go ask your father

518
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,000
how he wronged Gye.

519
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,420
<i>How's that for an answer?</i>

520
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,560
We're good, Bom. I got the approval.
Reporter Han agreed to help us.

521
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,650
How?

522
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,110
Sometime this week,
he'll gather some reporters for us.

523
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,190
Isn't it great?

524
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,450
Mr. Han may seem cold,
but he's quite loyal.

525
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,950
He was more pissed off
about what they did to you.

526
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,280
You have your necklace and your songbook.

527
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,540
You also have me.

528
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,330
With the right counterattack,
you'll win your case.

529
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,500
- I'm hungry.
- What?

530
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,590
Sure. We should eat to fight properly.

531
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,840
What would you like to have?

532
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,930
They're all yours, so slow down.

533
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,180
I'm happy to treat you to all this,

534
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,060
but who runs up the bill at a cafe?

535
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,770
Now I feel better.

536
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,150
I'm good now. Bye.

537
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:40,660
Hey, where are you going?
We have to meet with Mr. Han.

538
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,070
I've let go of that song.
I won't sue them.

539
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,200
What are you talking about?
Why won't you sue?

540
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
I can write

541
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,710
other songs.

542
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,790
Jo Ji-na won't be able
to write any more good songs,

543
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,590
but I can.

544
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,760
- That's true, but--
- That's why I won't sue them.

545
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,050
I've had it with their dirty tricks.
And you…

546
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,890
Stay out of my sight.

547
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,270
How is that possible
when I'm back as your housemate?

548
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,390
Don't you get it?

549
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
I don't want to see you again.

550
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,570
I called you here because
our last memory together was the worst.

551
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,860
Remembering how you were that day

552
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,740
was enough to make me feel sick forever.

553
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,530
I thought this sweetness
would mask that bitterness.

554
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,540
Don't even come near my house.
Don't follow me out.

555
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,840
I can pack a mean punch.

556
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,170
Hey, Bom.

557
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,970
Bom!

558
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,050
Why won't you sue them?
I don't understand.

559
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,560
I don't want to. Why the fuss?

560
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,480
Are you stupid?

561
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,270
You wrote the song for your mom.

562
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,350
You kept it because it meant a lot.

563
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,440
So you should sing it.
Why let someone else do it?

564
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,030
That's right.

565
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,160
I wanted to sing that song. With you.

566
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,820
But who broke the promise?

567
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,830
It'll be sung by you and me.

568
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,750
You have to be the one to sing this.

569
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,370
<i>Who else could sing it but me?</i>

570
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,330
You abandoned me first.

571
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,210
And I don't think

572
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,380
I can sing this song anymore.

573
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,890
We're done.

574
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:46,070
<i>Keep your promise</i>
<i>to erase that video of Gye.</i>

575
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,160
<i>From Kim Bom.</i>

576
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:50,490
Ms. Jo.

577
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,500
It's been handled.

578
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,830
I think that dash cam video you gave me

579
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,170
scared her.

580
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,220
All right!

581
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,300
Here are the records
that The Crown has set.

582
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,720
The fastest single to break
into the World Chart's top ten,

583
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,640
the most-viewed
and highest-trending music video.

584
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,730
You did it all!

585
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,020
It's the most covered song as well.

586
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,150
Good job, Producer Jo.

587
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,360
Good work, everyone.

588
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,110
Raise your glasses.

589
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,920
Mr. Kang, join us.
We should celebrate together.

590
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,330
I can't hold my liquor, sir.

591
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,920
But I'll drink.

592
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,180
With our new single being a huge hit,
it's time I step up as the leader, Mr. Jo.

593
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,270
- You'll do what?
- I'll take over as the leader.

594
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,810
Are you already a bit tipsy?

595
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,690
SUNDER.

596
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,070
Do you think you're a big shot?

597
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,950
You think you can demand
the leader position from me?

598
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,740
That's not what I meant.

599
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,790
I'm sorry, sir.

600
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,920
I was going to save it for later,
but since we're on the topic,

601
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I'll do it now.

602
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
Soon,

603
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,710
The Crown will get a new member.

604
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,720
And who's that?

605
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,430
I can't reveal that just yet
due to security reasons.

606
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:35,100
Just know that there's no one
more fitting for The Crown.

607
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,890
He will be the team's new leader.

608
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,400
Who could he be keeping under wraps?

609
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,200
- Are you off to smoke?
- Yes.

610
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,660
Isn't that Mr. Kang's wife?

611
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,540
Yes, I think that's her.

612
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,460
She must be here to pick him up.

613
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,790
Check out that fancy car.
It looks expensive.

614
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,460
Did he win the lottery?

615
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,170
Actually, I asked him
the same thing and he said

616
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,840
that CEO Jo gave it to him.

617
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,140
Did Mr. Jo own an SUV?
I thought he only drove sedans.

618
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,760
It wasn't exactly his.

619
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,600
I think it belonged
to either a friend or a relative.

620
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,940
It was set to be scrapped
due to water damage,

621
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,850
but Mr. Kang gave it to his wife instead.

622
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,520
- Water damage?
- Yes.

623
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,110
- It's chilly. Let's head inside.
- Sure.

624
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,740
Water damage?

625
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,120
Why aren't you picking up?

626
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,710
<i>Gye, I just saw an SUV.</i>

627
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:48,380
<i>Apparently, CEO Jo gave it to Mr. Kang--</i>

628
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,730
Did Auntie swing by?

629
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,010
THE LATE YU JEONG-AE

630
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,090
Mom.

631
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:34,970
It's me.

632
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,550
Your daughter, Bom-bom.

633
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,930
Mom,

634
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,680
you're still young and beautiful.

635
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
I'm glad.

636
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,870
Mom, did you miss me?

637
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,460
I missed you so much, Mom.

638
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,800
I wanted to come here every single day.

639
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,390
But I couldn't bring myself to.

640
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,150
It's still too painful…

641
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,860
to see your face.

642
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,530
Also, I'm sorry.

643
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,200
I…

644
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,460
I even lost the song I wrote for you.

645
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,420
I'm so pathetic, aren't I?

646
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,080
What's this?

647
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,840
- Auntie.
- Yes?

648
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,550
Did you go see Mom yesterday?

649
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,390
Me? No. Her birthday is still months away.

650
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,520
I'm so cold.
Am I coming down with something?

651
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,270
Someone went to see Mom yesterday.
Who could it have been?

652
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,850
Probably her friend.
I hear they do reunions there.

653
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,190
She was popular, you know.

654
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,400
- And those flowers?
- Didn't you bring them?

655
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,820
Goodness. Then it must have been
that brat Jin-gu.

656
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,530
He likely feels bad for freeloading.

657
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:03,700
But slabs of pork would've been better
than those flowers.

658
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:07,120
There's nothing to like about him.
Can you hang these to dry?

659
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:27,930
Bom-bom.

660
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:30,770
Mom?

661
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,450
What are you doing?

662
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,200
Isn't it obvious?

663
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,950
I've been cleaning. The house is a mess.

664
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:50,120
Also, shouldn't you keep the piano clean?
It was a gift.

665
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,960
You can't practice like this.

666
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,870
We're doing what here?

667
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,000
Heave-ho!

668
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,590
- Heave-ho!
- Hang those later and get the equipment.

669
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,800
SAGYE, Gyu-ri's here.

670
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,510
What took you so long?
You should've set everything up already.

671
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,050
Cut the chatter and give me a hand.

672
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,140
It's heavy.

673
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,310
- Hey, that's expensive.
- It just dropped.

674
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,520
What are you all doing?

675
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,980
Obviously, practice.

676
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,730
TWO SAGYE is back. Didn't SAGYE tell you?

677
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:18,360
The studio ban’s ending soon,
so we’ll practice here for now.

678
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,570
All right. Here's the sheet music.

679
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,490
Thanks.

680
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,490
What's your deal?
Why's it all so easy for you?

681
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,710
Who are you to reassemble the band
when you broke it up?

682
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,080
You said you're done with TWO SAGYE.

683
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,090
So what is all this?
Am I a joke to you? Is this all a game?

684
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:43,260
Why do you keep changing your mind
and irritating the hell out of me?

685
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,260
Put the instruments away.

686
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,220
I will never be in a band with you.

687
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,860
All right.
Don't join us if you're not up for it.

688
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,740
But can we at least perform this cover?

689
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,900
I found a song I like
for the first time in a while.

690
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:07,530
You can at least do that much.

691
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,450
Perform it yourselves
if you're that eager.

692
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,090
EXAM REGISTRATION SLIP

693
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,060
EXAM REGISTRATION SLIP
SEO TAE-YANG

694
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:39,230
Ta-da! I bet you didn't pack lunch.

695
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,900
I packed shrimp fried rice, your favorite,
and egg soup.

696
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,400
They'll stay warm until lunchtime,
so make sure to eat everything.

697
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,160
You shouldn't have bothered.
I was going to pick up some porridge.

698
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,030
You can't have that before an exam.

699
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,830
I made sure the eggs aren't lumpy,

700
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,580
so tackle all of those questions.

701
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,670
Our Hanju University High School
should produce the top-ranking student.

702
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,540
That reminds me. The exam slip.

703
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,920
Do you have it?

704
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,300
You don't?

705
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:07,090
Of course, I have it.

706
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,180
Just a second.

707
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:19,520
Here. I prayed for you.

708
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,980
SEO TAE-YANG, DON'T FRET!
KIM BOM IS PRAYING FOR YOU HARD!

709
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,990
Victory! I wish you good luck
on your CSAT!

710
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,700
I'll get going.

711
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,370
Tae-yang, good luck on your exam.

712
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:37,040
Get the correct answer,
whether you know it or not.

713
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,040
Let's get you to Hanju Med School!

714
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,210
<i>Go, Seo Tae-yang!</i>

715
00:44:58,310 --> 00:44:59,350
KIM BOM

716
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,190
<i>Bom, are you doing well?</i>

717
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:04,650
<i>Could we perhaps meet up?</i>

718
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,820
<i>There's something I should tell you.</i>

719
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,760
TWO SAGYE BANNED
FROM USING THEIR STUDIO

720
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:12,970
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

721
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:16,600
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

722
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,990
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

723
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:37,240
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

724
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,000
<i>Girl, you shake up my world</i>

725
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,750
<i>Even without words, you know how I feel</i>

726
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,420
<i>You appear before my eyes</i>

727
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,710
<i>Without you, my nights will be lonely</i>

728
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,800
<i>I find new things to do</i>

729
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,510
<i>Meet friends at every chance</i>

730
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:55,340
<i>Talk about meaningless things</i>

731
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:57,470
<i>But why is it still this hard?</i>

732
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,930
I added a rap section
to your original song.

733
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:04,690
Let's upload this as a cover song.

734
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,520
That darn song is being played
everywhere you go.

735
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,940
Will you keep avoiding it?
It's your song, isn't it?

736
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,820
You said only losers backed out
without a fight.

737
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:17,570
This is the hottest song right now,
so our cover will get a lot of views.

738
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,700
Even Jo & Jo will promote it.

739
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,240
That won't make it mine again.

740
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:26,500
- It'll be just one of many cover songs.
- Yours will be different.

741
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:31,250
Let's prove together that the original
stands in a league of its own.

742
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:35,800
You have me. What is there to fear?

743
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,470
What if…

744
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,760
you change your mind again?

745
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:45,270
What if you give up and run again?

746
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:46,940
That…

747
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,940
will never happen.

748
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:53,650
<i>I'll never run away again.</i>

749
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,780
<i>I swear on these very eyes.</i>

750
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,410
<i>Were your eyes always this beautiful?</i>

751
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,120
<i>Both eyes shining like the stars.</i>

752
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,590
Hey. You made me rush the cover,

753
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:13,920
so I recorded it only with a guitar.

754
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,960
I bet the audio quality was lousy.

755
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,880
No.

756
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,050
It's good.

757
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:22,970
Really?

758
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,190
Nice! Does that mean you approve?

759
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:31,150
That was my audition.

760
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:33,650
You acknowledge my talent, right?

761
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,110
When did you write the rap?

762
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:39,950
Writing the rap was a breeze,
thanks to the inspiring original song.

763
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,500
Come on. Let's go practice.

764
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,790
The others are waiting.

765
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,720
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

766
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,600
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

767
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,900
Mr. Kwon Hyeok-gi is here?

768
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,700
Yes, it's an emergency, sir.

769
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,160
He is asking you to perform the surgery.

770
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,740
Right. I just received a call
from the president's office.

771
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:29,540
Performing surgery on the floor leader
of the ruling party should be my priority.

772
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,710
Prep the OR immediately.

773
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:34,040
Kim Bok-rye's surgery is scheduled
for 3 p.m. today.

774
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:35,420
She's elderly and lives alone,

775
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,880
so the social welfare division
has specifically asked you to operate.

776
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,380
Push it to tomorrow.

777
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,640
You can't, sir.

778
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,810
Considering her age, her deteriorating
liver condition is a serious concern.

779
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,060
Time is of the essence.

780
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,180
Life and death is up
to the patient's will.

781
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:53,850
If her time has come,
we won't be able to change it.

782
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:57,020
- I'll operate on Mr. Kwon.
- But--

783
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:59,860
Make sure to schedule
the post-op briefing.

784
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,490
I'll be handling that myself too.
Get on it.

785
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,080
What in the world?

786
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,210
Is this a dumpster or what?

787
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:14,210
Are you kidding me?

788
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:17,420
Would it kill them
to clean up after eating?

789
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,630
This won't do the job. My gosh.

790
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:23,720
So much for washing these for him.

791
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,800
Why are they like this
when they haven't been worn?

792
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,060
I can already see
how this place will be without me.

793
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,810
It's basically a pigpen.

794
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:34,270
Goodness.

795
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:38,020
If it weren't for this, Sa Gye,
you'd only be getting the bare minimum.

796
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:39,190
My gosh.

797
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:42,940
I don't know why this makes my heart
skip a beat every time I see it.

798
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,910
In my early days,
my heart fluttered for Shin Seung-hun.

799
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:49,530
But now, it skips a beat
for a suitcase full of cash.

800
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,790
Goodness me.

801
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:54,710
Aren't these Jin-gu's?

802
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,460
Unbelievable.

803
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:00,630
I told him to put dirty clothes
in the laundry basket!

804
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:03,090
He's a freeloader, and yet
he's the most high-maintenance.

805
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,760
Goodness.

806
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,680
It's so worn out it's got holes.

807
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,600
This is basically a rag.

808
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,100
He's nothing but a homeless bum.

809
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,810
Just my luck.

810
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,100
Unbelievable.

811
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:19,400
All that stress has turned my hair gray.

812
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:21,780
How upsetting.

813
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,450
Ms. Kim, are there any snacks?
We're rehearsing on the rooftop.

814
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:27,860
Can't you see I'm busy dyeing my hair?

815
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,450
Drink tap water.

816
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:33,910
- Why are you dyeing it at home?
- To save money.

817
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,420
I'm low on cash because of a freeloader
who doesn't pay rent.

818
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,460
Ask Gye to help you out.
I heard his mom was a hairdresser,

819
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:43,590
so a dye job will be a piece of cake.

820
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,510
I'm not like you, you know.

821
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:48,970
Of course, the freeloader knows
exactly what to take advantage of.

822
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,260
Unbelievable.

823
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,850
Wait. What's that around your neck?

824
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:55,520
A rag, of course.

825
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,060
It looks familiar.

826
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:02,360
Jin-gu, Bom's back! Hurry on up!

827
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,230
Sure, I'll be right there!

828
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,320
I know I recognize it.

829
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,780
Oh, right! I've set aside clothes
for dry cleaning, so don't touch them.

830
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,410
They can't be washed with water.

831
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:12,580
Who gets clothes with holes dry cleaned?

832
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,830
That's why you're so poor!

833
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:19,290
Bom! I've landed a role in the band.

834
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:21,170
Ta-da. Clever, right?

835
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,540
SAGYE recommended it.

836
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,840
Gyu-ri, could you be a maracas prodigy?

837
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,300
The way you play with the beat
is ingenious!

838
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:34,260
All right. Let's give it a shot.

839
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,850
Hold on. What about Tae-yang?

840
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:39,230
TWO SAGYE is missing a SAGYE.

841
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:40,350
Exactly. What's he up to?

842
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:45,230
<i>That's why I'm telling you to let him go.</i>

843
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,240
<i>Let him swim in a larger pond.</i>

844
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:49,200
We'll perform…

845
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,570
without Tae-yang.

846
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,030
It'll be just us.

847
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,290
Why? He doesn't want to?
He thinks he's better than everyone.

848
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:57,370
Focus, guys.

849
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,250
Shall we?

850
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:01,330
Let's go!

851
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,420
<i>TWO SAGYE…</i>

852
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,340
doesn't have a future.

853
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:05,630
<i>It ends here.</i>

854
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,550
I hope you get to do what you want.

855
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,800
<i>Don't waste your time with me.</i>

856
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,410
Tae-yang.

857
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,670
Is this your answer?

858
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,840
Was it so wrong of me
to tell you I like you?

859
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,090
Was it too much for you to deal with?

860
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:51,590
Was disbanding TWO SAGYE all a show
to drive me out of the band?

861
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,970
It's a misunderstanding.
It's not what you think.

862
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:56,010
You should've just been honest with me

863
00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:59,020
and told me to leave the band.

864
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,310
If you had,
it wouldn't have been this miserable.

865
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:03,730
Please hear me out.

866
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:06,520
I meant to break up the band.

867
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,570
- But--
- I don't get you at all.

868
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,110
How can you welcome Gye with a smile
after what he did?

869
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,200
Do you have no self-respect?

870
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,330
You must be so into him
to be this understanding.

871
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:20,370
I can't seem to catch a break with you,

872
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:23,000
but he gets away with everything.

873
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,210
I'm sorry…

874
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:34,090
I couldn't reciprocate your feelings.

875
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,640
That's why…

876
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,430
I couldn't hold onto you.

877
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:45,980
Don't apologize.

878
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:49,610
It's actually for the best.

879
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,490
I won't have to feel bad either.

880
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:54,400
Regardless of how I start my career…

881
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:58,660
You won't care, right?

882
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,670
If it's your choice,

883
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:07,630
it must be the right choice.

884
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,510
TWO SAGYE and I were never a good fit.

885
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:23,890
If I could,

886
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,020
I'd wipe it from my memory.

887
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:03,470
You didn't tell Gye anything, did you?

888
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,060
I didn't. You told me not to, sir.

889
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:11,360
But why can't I tell him?

890
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,440
What?

891
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:17,780
You know how suspicious he can be.
There's no point in giving him ammunition.

892
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,530
Which SUV is Gye looking for?

893
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,910
It wasn't even yours,
so who wanted it scrapped?

894
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,410
How long have you worked for me?

895
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:27,830
Six years, sir.

896
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:30,920
In those six years,
you would've learned how the world works.

897
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,590
Gye and I are like brothers.

898
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,340
We grew up in the same neighborhood,

899
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:42,800
our mothers are close,

900
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:44,560
and we don't keep secrets from each other.

901
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,180
Is that so?

902
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:51,900
I envy that friendship.

903
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:55,070
I'll keep it short, then.

904
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:58,280
Which mountain will it be?
Pick one to hike up.

905
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,070
The day is short,
so don't get stranded halfway up

906
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,490
and end up torn apart by a wild animal.

907
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,910
I'll now start the presentation
introducing The Crown's new member.

908
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:23,010
<i>Girl, you shake up my world</i>

909
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:24,680
<i>Even without words, you know how I feel</i>

910
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,100
<i>The time that we had</i>
<i>You appear before my eyes</i>

911
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,020
<i>Without you, my nights will be lonely</i>

912
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,850
<i>I find new things to do</i>

913
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,850
<i>Meet friends at every chance</i>

914
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,560
<i>Talk about meaningless things</i>

915
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,440
<i>But why is it still this hard?</i>

916
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:39,690
<i>I think about you every day</i>

917
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:43,820
<i>I hold back as much as I can</i>

918
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:50,960
<i>If we're meant to be, we'll meet again</i>

919
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:58,250
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

920
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:01,840
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

921
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:44,800
We're going to film it now.

922
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,260
The video will go up at midnight.

923
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,640
That's too sudden.
You never said we'd be filming it today.

924
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,270
Hanju University High School's finals
start tomorrow.

925
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:54,640
If we're too loud at night,
the mothers will murder us.

926
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:57,110
I'll need 11 mm falsies to be
camera-ready.

927
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:00,570
These are only 9 mm.
We absolutely can't do this.

928
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,530
I'm in. Cover videos should look
as natural as possible.

929
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:06,110
I'm in too.

930
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,450
My wardrobe today…

931
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,290
couldn't be more natural.

932
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:12,370
I honestly can't agree.

933
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,880
All my clothes were ruined,
so Ms. Kim lent me some of hers to wear.

934
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,800
They suit you nicely.
How generous of my mom.

935
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,210
Hang in there, Jin-gu.

936
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,380
Right.

937
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:25,170
Put these on.

938
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:28,800
We'll rock it
in these matching bucket hats.

939
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:32,270
What the hell?

940
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:34,180
This covers my face completely.
Why wear this?

941
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:37,230
I don't want to either.
As the face of this team, I refuse.

942
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:39,190
My hair is my best feature!

943
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:45,110
We'll reveal our faces when our video gets
over three million views.

944
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:46,110
Three million?

945
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,910
- Are you kidding me?
- That'll never happen.

946
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:51,030
Who'll listen to our song
if we show Gye's face?

947
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,660
The entire nation will be
too busy hating us.

948
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:54,750
Are you good with that?

949
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,250
Hear me out.

950
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,630
We'll blow people's minds
with our cover song,

951
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:02,960
then reveal that it's Gye.

952
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:06,470
It'd be annoying to get chewed out
before a fair assessment.

953
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:10,930
My fans will still recognize my voice,
even if my face is covered.

954
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:12,930
You need to fool them.

955
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,100
Switch up your singing style.

956
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:18,060
Forget what you learned at Jo & Jo
and sing however you want.

957
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,360
Belt out notes if you want
and even try growling.

958
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,610
Can't you do it?

959
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:26,360
Okay. Sure!

960
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:31,990
It'll be done in a single take.
You can't mess up, so focus.

961
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,790
- Got it.
- We'll nail it at first attempt!

962
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:35,160
- Yes!
- Let's do it!

963
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:37,250
<i>Roopretelcham.</i>

964
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:46,380
<i>Girl, you shake up my world</i>

965
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,090
<i>Even without words, you know how I feel</i>

966
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:50,180
<i>The time that we had</i>
<i>You appear before my eyes</i>

967
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:52,510
<i>Without you, my nights will be lonely</i>

968
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,310
<i>I find new things to do</i>

969
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:55,810
<i>Meet friends at every chance</i>

970
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:58,020
<i>Talk about meaningless things</i>

971
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,770
<i>But why is it still this hard?</i>

972
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:03,190
<i>I think about you every day</i>

973
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:07,190
<i>I hold back as much as I can</i>

974
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:13,870
<i>If we're meant to be, we'll meet again</i>

975
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:21,830
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

976
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,670
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

977
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,930
<i>I hear time will do the work</i>

978
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:37,600
<i>It'll help me forget about you</i>

979
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:52,070
<i>Only until then will I give it my all</i>

980
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,990
<i>I'll hold out, even if it's just for a day</i>

981
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,850
At exactly 10 a.m., public TV channels,

982
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:19,100
general TV stations, cable networks,
and other media outlets

983
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:20,890
will introduce you as breaking news.

984
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,890
The members will find out simultaneously.

985
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,610
The CS department is paralyzed
from the rumor about a new member.

986
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:28,570
Global fans must be stirred up too.

987
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,940
The timing couldn't be better.

988
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:33,450
The Crown's new song
just topped the charts.

989
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:36,490
We'll be the center of attention
and have the most viral videos.

990
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:38,660
It's almost 10 a.m.
Let's head to the conference room.

991
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:40,370
Right. Let's go.

992
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,460
Guys, come quick!
The Crown is announcing its new member.

993
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,090
- What?
- Who is it?

994
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:49,800
Let me see his face. Who is it?

995
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:52,050
THE CROWN NEW MEMBER REVEAL
COUNTDOWN

996
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:01,720
THE CROWN'S NEW LEADER REVEALED
ON DECEMBER 1ST, 10 A.M.

997
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,620
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

998
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:21,370
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

999
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:03,540
<i>If you don't want to get hurt,</i>
<i>leave the agency on your own terms.</i>

1000
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,790
<i>I'm always down for a fight with you.</i>

1001
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:09,460
- <i>Bom, did you know about this?</i>
- <i>It's not our place to meddle.</i>

1002
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,840
<i>Make me a more successful artist</i>
<i>than Sa Gye.</i>

1003
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:15,880
<i>TWO SAGYE is finally making its debut.</i>

1004
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,680
<i>I have something to say to you.</i>

1005
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,260
<i>This is cheating.</i>

1006
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:21,890
<i>You have no fear, do you?</i>

1007
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:24,390
<i>You let Sa Gye get the better of you.</i>

1008
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:26,270
I can't let him sink and drown.

1009
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:29,100
<i>I'm set on taking down</i>
<i>the shady Jo & Jo Entertainment.</i>

1010
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:30,230
<i>I'll get it done.</i>

1011
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:32,440
Don't. This is Tae-yang's choice.

1012
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,190
She's letting it slide for your sake.
Because she's kind to a fault!

1013
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,280
Do you know Bom that well?
More than I do?

1014
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:41,370
