EP Yaon Shui

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,200
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,200
Are you a thief?

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,200
You've been in a coma for 10 days.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
What are you hiding from me?

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
My clothes. I'm going to the concert today.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,200
The concert?

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Are you going to ruin the memory?

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,200
You must have warned the guards.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
The contract is broken.

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,200
I won't go to the doctor anymore.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
No, I can't go.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
Every time I go to the operating room,

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
my mom comes to mind.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Why do you think your mom is thinking?

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,200
The patient who was lying down at the operating room and stepping on her foot is different from your mom.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,200
The patient is the one who saved our lives.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,200
The doctor exists only for people who risk their lives.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
That's why I'm not going to the doctor.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
What?

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,200
The place where my mom was happy was the stage where she was singing music before meeting the doctor's father.

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
I won't live like my mom.

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
What are you doing?

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,200
Taeyang, what are you going to do with your father?

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
I'm out of my mind.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,200
That's why I'm going to do what I want to do.

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,200
You son of a...

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
Hey, Na.

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Did you know that the four beggars are performing today?

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,200
What are you doing with the representative?

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,200
You're going to ruin the memory of the four beggars and Kim Beom!

35
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,200
I don't have any evidence.

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,200
I'm going to cancel the performance.

37
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Are you sure?

38
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
I'm sure.

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Tell me everything I need to help.

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
Hey, hey, how should we do this?

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
It's okay now.

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Where's the checker?

43
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Let's go.

44
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Let's go.

45
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Let's go.

46
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Everyone is ready to go on stage.

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
All right?

48
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
Finally, the first stage of the two-stage.

49
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Shall we finish it one more time?

50
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,200
What do you mean finish it?

51
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
It's a stage for our team's performance.

52
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
Yes.

53
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Actually, the crowd is coming here.

54
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
What?

55
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
My fans are coming?

56
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
I didn't hear that.

57
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,200
You didn't ask me to surprise you.

58
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,200
The precious fans who are still here.

59
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,200
They came all the way to the performance.

60
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
They're already here.

61
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Already?

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
Really?

63
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
What should we do?

64
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
Look at me.

65
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
How do I look?

66
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Are you okay?

67
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
What are you talking about?

68
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
The floor is broken.

69
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
The apartment is broken.

70
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Everyone is here.

71
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
The fans are going to be here before the show starts.

72
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Really?

73
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Then shall we show them your face?

74
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
What are you talking about?

75
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Are you talking about your fans?

76
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
How long have they been here?

77
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
I can't hear anything.

78
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
What's that?

79
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
Are you here?

80
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Yes.

81
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
What's that?

82
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
I don't know.

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,200
I thought we'd meet at the other side of the building.

84
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,200
I only called the fans to see if they'd have a problem.

85
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Wait.

86
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
The fans are holding a different question.

87
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
What?

88
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
That's right.

89
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
The real thing is different.

90
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
That's a fake.

91
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
They're not our crown.

92
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,200
Our crown is famous for being a mature fan.

93
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
I don't think they're doing this.

94
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
What?

95
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
The festival is all canceled.

96
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
The school's canceled school is down.

97
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Please wait for the safety.

98
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
I'll tell you again.

99
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
The show is canceled.

100
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Please all please leave.

101
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Don't run.

102
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Don't run.

103
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Taehyung.

104
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Taehyung.

105
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Is there anyone who's hurt?

106
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
No.

107
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,200
The police and the ambulance were in a hurry.

108
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
That's right.

109
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
How did they know?

110
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,200
They're the ones who canceled the show.

111
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,200
They're not our crown.

112
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Look.

113
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,200
This is the crown and this is the fake.

114
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
They were all the first to see it.

115
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,200
They came here and pretended to be a scammer?

116
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Is it Bomi and Taehyung?

117
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
No?

118
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
They were with him until a while ago.

119
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
The doctor said he's going to be a scammer.

120
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
He won't?

121
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Don't go!

122
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
Don't go with Bomi.

123
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Don't do anything.

124
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,200
If you're going to fight with the CEO, stop it.

125
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
It's dangerous to Kim Bomi.

126
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
What are you doing?

127
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
What are you doing?

128
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Why are you here?

129
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
What are you doing?

130
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Where's Bomi?

131
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Where are you?

132
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
What are you talking about?

133
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Why are you here to find Kim Bomi?

134
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Is there anyone else but the CEO?

135
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Is there anyone who's going to be bad to Bomi?

136
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
What are you doing?

137
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Let me answer.

138
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Let me go.

139
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Stop it.

140
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Get your head off.

141
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
What are you doing?

142
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Bomi.

143
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Tell me.

144
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Why are you doing this to me?

145
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Why are you here to find Kim Bomi?

146
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
I'm here.

147
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,200
I'm glad I didn't hurt anyone.

148
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
You're the CEO.

149
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
How did you get the show?

150
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,200
The police prepared it in advance.

151
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
I'm a good person.

152
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
I can't do that.

153
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Anyway, I can't do anything about this.

154
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Why are you here to waste my money?

155
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,760
I love you.

156
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
Bong-ah!

157
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,080
Are you okay?

158
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,180
You're fine.

159
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,680
Are you sure you're okay?

160
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,920
Promise me.

161
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,520
Don't ever disappear from my sight again.

162
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,520
I was so scared,

163
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,320
but I thought you were crazy.

164
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
Sa-gye.

165
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,020
Tae-young disappeared.

166
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,620
Some old man took her away.

167
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,960
Tae-young's father came to me recently.

168
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
He told me not to see her again.

169
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,460
I didn't make a promise.

170
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,360
I quit all the time.

171
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
What should I do?

172
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,600
Tae-young...

173
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,400
It's nothing.

174
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Don't worry.

175
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,200
She's five years old.

176
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,720
She's a good girl.

177
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,620
Don't worry.

178
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,720
Nothing will happen.

179
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,620
It's right to plan something.

180
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,220
We're going to stop the show.

181
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,260
Who are you talking about?

182
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,260
Stop it.

183
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,300
Just go straight to your head.

184
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,720
President Cho.

185
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,000
President Seo.

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,460
You two might have been together.

187
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
We're close.

188
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,160
I don't understand.

189
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,800
President Seo said he didn't like the band.

190
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,060
Why would he?

191
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,040
He said he hated Sa-gye

192
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,000
because he hated the band's big band.

193
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,560
He said he didn't like it.

194
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,540
That's right.

195
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,640
The most important thing that the president does is...

196
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,700
He follows me around and hack me.

197
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,600
Wow.

198
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,440
He's so mean.

199
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,680
He's not young or anything.

200
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,140
I can't forgive him.

201
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,940
How can I prepare for this?

202
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,880
I found him!

203
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
Seo-kyung!

204
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,440
Is he your father?

205
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,380
The one who supported people during the festival?

206
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,280
I'm sure...

207
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,080
Only my father

208
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,120
will be able to do this.

209
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,220
If you had kept your promise,

210
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,880
you wouldn't have been able to avoid other people.

211
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,160
Why didn't you do that to make people uncomfortable?

212
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,820
I'm going home.

213
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,000
No.

214
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,740
You know how much you care about yourself now.

215
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,940
You're not good enough to live in a environment

216
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,840
where you can't feel your value

217
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,440
if you're not interested or complimented.

218
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,140
You're a coward who's been attacked by the law.

219
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,140
I'm sorry.

220
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,740
I'm sorry that your mother didn't raise you well.

221
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,680
Yes, I think so.

222
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,720
I know what you're saying.

223
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,560
Don't touch the band.

224
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,720
Come.

225
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,560
You must be tired of watching souls out by night.

226
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:32,680
How do you 전뭐

227
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,300
remember my son right out there?

228
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,000
Is Tae Yang in the hospital?

230
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,700
Yes, he just got a cab.

231
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,500
I shouldn't have been there.

232
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,800
I was in the hospital.

233
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,700
Did you find out?

234
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,700
Where is he?

235
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,500
He's Tae Yang's dad.

236
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,300
We can just drag him out of the hospital.

237
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,100
What's the matter?

238
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,800
Tae Yang is the head of the hospital.

239
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,100
He's so busy today.

240
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,700
Will he let us go?

241
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,400
No.

242
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,600
Please save my daughter.

243
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,100
No.

244
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,300
Are you okay?

245
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,200
We don't have any hospital beds left.

246
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,000
We can't just leave them here.

247
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,900
What the hell is going on?

248
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,200
If you pay for the surgery,

249
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,100
we'll call another hospital for you.

250
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,600
What?

251
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,800
Let's go.

252
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,600
Don't go.

253
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
What?

254
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,700
I'm sorry.

255
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,100
I can't go in.

256
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,700
What are you doing?

257
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,600
This is the VIP hospital.

258
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,700
Is that so?

259
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,500
We're the college friends of Seo Tae Yang.

260
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,200
Did you not get any calls from Seo Eon Jung?

261
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Tae Yang decided to just leave.

262
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,800
Leave?

263
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,100
What do you mean?

264
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,700
Well, Seo Eon Jung said he'd take care of

265
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,900
the patient's health for the sake of the patient.

266
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,900
He said he doesn't have any special treatment.

267
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's hard to get a doctor here.

268
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,700
What's going on?

269
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,900
Sir, we're here.

270
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,200
You're a real hypocrite.

271
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,800
You're a heroine who's treated by all means.

272
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
What's wrong?

273
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,800
Sir, you're here to pay for the surgery

274
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,700
and the medical expenses

275
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,200
for the sake of the patient.

276
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,100
What are you talking about?

277
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,200
A big applause!

278
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,300
Thank you.

279
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,300
Thank you.

280
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,800
Thank you.

281
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,000
Thank you.

282
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,200
Thank you.

283
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,500
Calm down.

284
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,500
Hey, you're not there?

285
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,000
I've never seen Tae Yang.

286
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,500
I'm here.

287
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
What did Tae Yang say?

288
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,100
He said he'd pay for the surgery.

289
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,800
Sir, he's dying of love because of the surgery.

290
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,600
He's not like that.

291
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,800
That's...

292
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,700
You can just go and get him.

293
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Okay.

294
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,300
We'll take our friends and leave now.

295
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,100
What?

296
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,100
You guys...

297
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,100
What's going on?

298
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,300
What's going on?

299
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,300
What's going on?

300
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,900
Sir, we're alive now.

301
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,000
What?

302
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,300
We're alive.

303
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,800
One, two, three.

304
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,900
I'm so scared.

305
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,800
Wow.

306
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
How was my plan?

307
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,100
I was really scared.

308
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Seriously.

309
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,600
I'm so upset with you.

310
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,200
I'll help you at least once in your life.

311
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,800
I'm going to get rid of Chuseok today.

312
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,700
My father will never give up.

313
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
I don't want to be in your team anymore.

314
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,700
Thank you.

315
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,700
I'm leaving.

316
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,200
Are you going?

317
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,400
I have to find him.

318
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,700
I'll try to get him to leave this time.

319
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,800
What are you saying?

320
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
You're going to fix the punishment

321
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,600
for pretending to be cool even if you die soon?

322
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,500
You're all bad, but that's the worst.

323
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,000
What do you think?

324
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,400
Taehyung is a bit...

325
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,000
Right?

326
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,800
He's never been alone.

327
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Look at that face.

328
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
He's the one who got the free pass from the student.

329
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,600
He probably never got caught by anyone

330
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,800
while he was in class.

331
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
He's always been so kind to his heart.

332
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
He's always been so kind to his heart.

333
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
He's always been so kind to his heart.

334
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,660
Should I call him the handsome

335
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,200
and elegant version of the student?

336
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,500
I'm different from my father.

337
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,200
What's different?

338
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,800
What if he's funny?

339
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,600
Life is not funny.

340
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,400
I hope he doesn't get caught by someone like him.

341
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,000
Taehyung, Taehyung, Taehyung, Taehyung!

342
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,700
What are you going to do?

343
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,500
Did you get caught by a band?

344
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,100
I should get caught.

345
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,600
You got caught by your life not because of the band.

346
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,300
Did the president abandon the band

347
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,900
because he didn't want his son to be a band?

348
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,700
I see. That's a big size.

349
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,400
What do you mean?

350
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,700
I'll tell you when I'm sure.

351
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,900
Whatever happens,

352
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,100
if we get caught here,

353
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,700
we'll miss something very important.

354
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,200
That's why we don't have to talk about anything else.

355
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,100
We can just do whatever we want.

356
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,700
If we get caught,

357
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,500
we'll be kicked out.

358
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Okay.

359
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,800
You picked the wrong person.

360
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Let's get caught.

361
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,300
Are we a commoner?

362
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Hey, Bum.

363
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,700
How about a girl who's been a member of the band

364
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,900
before she left?

365
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,900
How about her?

366
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,900
Here?

367
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,600
How about the band?

368
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,500
Since when did we ever say we were a band?

369
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,900
What's the secret?

370
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,100
What's the secret?

371
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,200
What's the secret?

372
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,300
We're the band!

373
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
Yes!

374
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,500
Hey!

375
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,700
I'm sorry.

376
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,200
What?

377
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Let's go!

378
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Yes!

379
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Yes!

380
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Yes!

381
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Let's go!

382
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Come on!

383
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Let's go!

384
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Let's go!

385
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Yes!

386
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Let's go!

387
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,200
I don't know, think about you

388
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,200
I keep imagining it, love story, me and you

389
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
I'll tell you the truth now

390
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,200
If you see me here, it's fever

391
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
It's a fever

392
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,200
The whole world is burning up

393
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Oh my, oh my, oh my

394
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
The festival night

395
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Our own performance was a big success

396
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,200
We'll never give up

397
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
No one can stop us

398
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,200
We'll hold on to the end

399
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,200
We'll win the person who's been through this

400
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,200
The festival night!

401
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,200
What are you talking about?

402
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Why are you so loud?

403
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,200
What are you doing in front of someone else's house?

404
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
What are you doing?

405
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Are you kidding me?

406
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
What?

407
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,200
Oh my!

408
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
What's happening to me?

409
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Oh my!

410
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
Oh my!

411
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,200
What's wrong with you?

412
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
I'm so nervous.

413
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
Oh my God!

414
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Oh my God!

415
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
What's wrong with you?

416
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,200
I knew this would happen, but I didn't even get ready.

417
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Why did this really happen?

418
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Wait, wait, wait.

419
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,200
What should I sell first to make it a rumor?

420
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
First of all, it's a secret to the fraud.

421
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
It's too much for a man to be a fraud.

422
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Wait, I'm going to do this.

423
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Stop the line.

424
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Stop the line.

425
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Now it's a rumor.

426
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,200
The world's top star fraud is living.

427
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
The house where you live is right.

428
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
I'm here.

429
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Are you in the house?

430
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Stop, stop, stop.

431
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Protect the poor as a result.

432
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Unfortunately, today,

433
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Sagi went to school early in the morning and is not at home now.

434
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Are you kidding me?

435
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
That's right.

436
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
I'm really not here.

437
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Instead, I brought all the things that Sagi

438
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
used to use to buy.

439
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,200
We're asking for a loss.

440
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
I'm a kindhearted person.

441
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,200
I don't put the magic on you and put it on you.

442
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,200
I'll give you 70,000 won for the donation.

443
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
70,000 won?

444
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
What's that?

445
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Oh, it smells.

446
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,200
The towel Sagi used until this morning.

447
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
There's still moist water left.

448
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Sagi is a bear who wants to wear a full body.

449
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Sagi is sitting in his bed all night and his breath is filled with a full body.

450
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
Why is no one running?

451
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
I'm so embarrassed.

452
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
I'm so sorry.

453
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
It's my first time.

454
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,200
I'm so sorry for the fans who came to see me.

455
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
I saved this.

456
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,200
This house where Sagi lives with a special event.

457
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,200
This house will be a family.

458
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,200
I'll show you the price from the living room to the kitchen.

459
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
The hand that I want.

460
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Isn't it crazy?

461
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
You bought it again.

462
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Ma'am, how much did we pay for this?

463
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Do you want to buy another fan?

464
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
No, that's not it.

465
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Did you buy it?

466
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
No, that's not it.

467
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,200
If you don't know about Sagi, you can use it.

468
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
What did you say?

469
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,200
The manager of X-man posted a video of Sagi's heart attack at a fan cafe.

470
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
That's not good.

471
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Fans said it was a joke.

472
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,200
My money, my time, everything is bad.

473
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
What's wrong with you?

474
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Are you selling that?

475
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Sagi, wake up.

476
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,200
I'm going to get a fan.

477
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Who?

478
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
You don't know?

479
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,200
No, I have to run.

480
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Why?

481
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
What?

482
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
What should I do?

483
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
You bastard, you're a bastard.

484
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
You even hit the doorbell.

485
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
You're not going down right now?

486
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
I'm so sorry for the heat in this house.

487
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
I'm so sorry for the heat in this house.

488
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Hey, you're going to give me all my money.

489
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Let's use that money.

490
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
What?

491
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Hey, hey.

492
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
This way.

493
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,200
Yena, this way.

494
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

495
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Yena, this way.

496
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Seot-hae, get up.

497
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Wow, this is it.

498
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Wow.

499
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Hey, hey, hey.

500
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,200
Hey, hey, hey.

501
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
What are you doing?

502
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,200
Hey, hey, hey.

503
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,200
Hey, you bastard.

504
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Hey, hey, hey.

505
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Hey, hey, hey.

506
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,200
Are you okay?

507
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,200
What happened to you?

508
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Did you dream about me?

509
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,200
I can't wait any longer, Gyuri.

510
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
Get out of here and marry me.

511
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Are you here to save me?

512
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,200
I brought a bag.

513
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,200
I left it here yesterday.

514
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,200
What?

515
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
What?

516
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,200
This is a fight between the two of us.

517
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,200
The rest of the fan club has to come.

518
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,200
It's going to be hard to endure in that house because it's been released until now.

519
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Do whatever you want.

520
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Don't give me a breath.

521
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Yes, boss.

522
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Why are you doing this to me?

523
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Why did you hate Kim Bong-kwan?

524
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Did you find it?

525
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Yes.

526
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
How are you feeling today?

527
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
I keep doing that.

528
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
Why don't you let me know?

529
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Something happened between you and your father, right?

530
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
I don't know.

531
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,200
I don't know either.

532
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,200
We're both on the other side, but I don't understand when it's been turned on like that.

533
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
When did you like each other?

534
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
Didn't you hear anything from your father?

535
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,200
I'm going to meet him and do it.

536
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,200
Mr. Chung, I'm in trouble.

537
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:52,200
What is it?

538
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,200
There's a bigger problem with the new song that will be released next week.

539
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
What problem?

540
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,200
The title song is the 98th year of the Spanish singer's release and the chorus part is the same.

541
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:08,200
What?

542
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,200
It's a mess after home and school.

543
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Where do you get all these results?

544
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,200
You have to be a bad guy again.

545
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
I'm not going to play much.

546
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Who is this?

547
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
It's been a week.

548
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
It's time to clean up anyway.

549
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,200
You can do it.

550
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
What about you?

551
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Mr. Chung, what about you?

552
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:43,200
We're going to be surprised to see if we've met each other this morning.

553
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:51,200
It was a mistake to go to work early.

554
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Why did you ask?

555
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
We had a fight.

556
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,200
I couldn't be on the investment or school festival stage forever, but I lost the club room for a month.

557
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,200
I guess the Korean band members were strong.

558
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Why are you crying?

559
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
You said you had a fight.

560
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,200
I don't have to see those dirty faces for a while.

561
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,200
It's cool inside.

562
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Who's the one who's been doing business to you?

563
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,200
I told you to get out of the company and get out of there.

564
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
Tell me.

565
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,200
I guess the bastard is also a little bit stiff.

566
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Hey, hit the sticker.

567
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
I can't really see the sun.

568
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,200
You son of a bitch.

569
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
Get out of the business.

570
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Don't come here.

571
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Oh, my God.

572
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
How long have you been in this?

573
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
I'll give you a beating.

574
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
So tell me.

575
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
I'll beat you up.

576
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,200
I'll beat you up.

577
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,200
Hey, get out of the business and get out of here.

578
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Oh, my God.

579
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Oh, my God.

580
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
What's wrong with you?

581
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
What's wrong with you?

582
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:47,200
You guys are so bad.

583
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,200
How can you be so bad?

584
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,200
I gave you a pass to decide the company to reflect on it.

585
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
You're going to fight again?

586
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,200
We got hit as much as we did.

587
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
You guys are crazy.

588
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,200
You guys are crazy.

589
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,200
And where is this face?

590
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,200
That's right.

591
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
I'm not going to get hit.

592
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
That's a blood stain.

593
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:24,200
If you're going to do this, get rid of the club.

594
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Are you laughing?

595
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Are you laughing at me?

596
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
I'm not a laughing person.

597
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,200
I'm a serious person.

598
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
It's done.

599
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Oh, did you send an apology on the social media?

600
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Of course.

601
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,200
These days, there are more people who apologize than the daily life of the people in the Inbal PD.

602
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,200
They say they're going to apologize to me in the comments.

603
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
It's a thousand times more than not doing it.

604
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,200
There are so many shameless people who don't know how to apologize to the world.

605
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Did they leave the fans who were left behind?

606
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
I'm so sad.

607
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,200
The fans are enough for you.

608
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
You're talking exactly.

609
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
I'm not your fan.

610
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Please, brother.

611
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,200
I can't go to the club room for a month without being able to wear a festival.

612
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Where should I practice?

613
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Hey, everyone.

614
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Don't worry.

615
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,200
My mom said that I'm a girl with a godly character.

616
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,200
Don't you know how great your financial power is?

617
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
I'm a business man.

618
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
Didn't you hear that?

619
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Oh, business man.

620
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,200
Even if it's a little hard right now, go to sleep.

621
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Nothing.

622
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Don't meet me if you don't want to meet me.

623
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Don't do that.

624
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,200
On the day you meet him again, you don't know what I'm going to do.

625
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Did you come in with your foot?

626
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
That's impossible.

627
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
I'm going to say hello.

628
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,200
If you can't say hello, you'll keep your heart.

629
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,200
Don't put your father in my heart anymore.

630
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,200
I took a break today.

631
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,200
Break?

632
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,200
But I didn't do it myself.

633
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,200
I think I'm done with my son.

634
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,200
I hope you'll be like me once.

635
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,200
You're a little strong and you're a little stubborn.

636
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,200
You're actually busy with the hippocartist who's alive.

637
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,200
You don't have to do anything else.

638
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
I'm sorry.

639
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,200
I'm asking you this by chance.

640
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,200
Is there another reason why I shouldn't meet you?

641
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,200
What does that mean?

642
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,200
If you're just greedy as a father, it's okay.

643
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
I'm sorry.

644
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
Come down quickly.

645
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
Yes, I'm coming.

646
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
And, Aori.

647
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
I think I'm in the wrong place.

648
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
I think I'm out of the 8th star.

649
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Don't be so easy on me.

650
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
You're still not going to see me.

651
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
Get up!

652
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Hurry up and get out of here.

653
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
You're a human being.

654
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
You have to get ready to come out every morning.

655
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,200
You're not partying.

656
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Are you the one who cooked for me?

657
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
Aren't you the one who cooks when you're in a hurry?

658
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
What?

659
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,200
What are you talking about?

660
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,200
I opened the fridge and took out the side dishes.

661
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,200
I put the spoon in and I'm not doing anything.

662
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
Yes, sir.

663
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
I don't think this is the right time to say this.

664
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,200
But isn't it too much of a mess?

665
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
Why didn't you ask me to talk to you?

666
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Are you talking about that?

667
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
How much did you save my house?

668
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
I'm not even paying for it.

669
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
I'm not paying for it.

670
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,200
How much did you spend on the antique that your friends brought?

671
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:08,200
I saved so much money to send it to Kyuri's house.

672
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Why did you send Kyuri's house to the house that your mother bought?

673
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,200
It's noisy.

674
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
It hurts.

675
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Yes, sir.

676
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Where are you going today?

677
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
I'm going.

678
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Of course, I'm going.

679
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
I know you're not going.

680
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
You can stay.

681
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,200
I'll clean the house after I finish eating.

682
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
I'll run around with my shoes on.

683
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,200
I'll have more sand than the beach.

684
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,200
I was dreaming about the river.

685
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,200
I was carrying a balloon that was less popular than me.

686
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Oh, my.

687
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,200
Where are you going?

688
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
I think I found a book outside.

689
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Honey!

690
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,200
Honey!

691
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,200
My dear son, Sage.

692
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Your mother is having her last night in Pura.

693
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,200
The night view of the church is amazing.

694
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,200
If you didn't come here and die, you'll regret it.

695
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,200
I'll put a lot of good things in your eyes.

696
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Son, don't worry.

697
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Don't be afraid.

698
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
I'll take care of her.

699
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
You're going to leave a comeback for two weeks and leave a mark?

700
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
What kind of nonsense is this?

701
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,200
You're going to put a title on it?

702
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200
What were you doing with my son?

703
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Don't you know how fatal the mark is to a singer?

704
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,200
You have to write all the activities and performances.

705
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
How are you going to get an image?

706
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
I'm sorry.

707
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
I'm sorry.

708
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,200
I'm sorry that I'm late for the announcement.

709
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
That's okay.

710
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,200
There is a schedule for the broadcast and overseas tour on the day of the release.

711
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Keep the public eye on it.

712
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,200
Do you know how much the foreign tour costs if you cancel it?

713
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,200
Find a replacement within two weeks.

714
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,200
How can you find a replacement within two weeks?

715
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,200
If you're going to do it, you're going to be in trouble!

716
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,200
It's a good thing to escape the scam.

717
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,200
You can't stop doing this.

718
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,200
How can you make a joint?

719
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,200
I'll do my best to get it done as soon as possible.

720
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,200
I don't know how to do it.

721
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Welcome.

722
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
Welcome.

723
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
This is not it.

724
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,200
I can't get the prize.

725
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
I didn't mean to.

726
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,200
I just said to laugh.

727
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
You can laugh.

728
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Are you working every day?

729
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
I haven't done anything for a while.

730
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,200
I don't know if it's a joint.

731
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,200
I'm going to get a tone out.

732
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,200
If I don't have money, I'm going to lose my temper.

733
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,200
I'm so sad.

734
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
I only have this much medicine for the piano.

735
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,200
You have to work hard if you have to pay for the contract.

736
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
You can't do it today, right?

737
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
Let's just work part-time and go out.

738
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,200
I can't stay at home because of my aunt.

739
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
I can't stay here and work.

740
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
It's going to take a long time.

741
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
You can do it.

742
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,200
Let's not do that.

743
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Let's date.

744
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,200
We haven't even dated yet.

745
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
What date?

746
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,200
When am I going to date you?

747
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
If you're not dating me.

748
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,200
Don't ever tell your family.

749
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,200
I promised.

750
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
How can you not tell them?

751
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,200
I live in a house with such a pretty girlfriend.

752
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,200
How can you talk about our relationship in this country?

753
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Tae-young is in the same mood.

754
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,200
That's it.

755
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,200
This is it.

756
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
So when are you going to date?

757
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
I'm not going to date you.

758
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,200
I'm not going to date you.

759
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,200
Why are you doing this?

760
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Stop following me.

761
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Please.

762
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,200
Welcome.

763
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Kim Bo?

764
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
You're right.

765
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
I heard you saw Yura here.

766
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,200
It was real.

767
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
It's been a while.

768
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,200
How have you been?

769
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
Did you live in this neighborhood?

770
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
I didn't come to Seoul.

771
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
We came to Korea for a while.

772
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,200
You know, right?

773
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Oh, congratulations.

774
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
You were playing like that.

775
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
You were so busy studying.

776
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
What are you talking about?

777
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
I always liked my skills.

778
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
You went back to your mom

779
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
and suddenly stopped the news.

780
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Do you know how curious we were?

781
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
Is this where you work?

782
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,200
You haven't heard the news yet?

783
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Our house is ruined.

784
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
You two are still in a relationship.

785
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
You purposely forced me to come here.

786
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
Hey, Kim Bo.

787
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,200
Put up some of the awards.

788
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,200
You have a lot of money.

789
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,200
Thank you.

790
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
What are you talking about?

791
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
We really came here because we missed you.

792
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,200
I know.

793
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,200
Thank you for worrying about us.

794
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
Please accept this.

795
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
I can't even pay for your mom's tuition.

796
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Why did you come here to check?

797
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
Isn't this a bit too much?

798
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
It's been over six years since my mom passed away.

799
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
No matter how long it's been since she left Korea,

800
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,200
she doesn't have anything to hide from others.

801
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,200
Please give her a piece of paper when she passes away.

802
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,200
I don't think we'll be able to contact each other.

803
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,200
Oh, my God. It's amazing.

804
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,200
Who is she?

805
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Isn't she a singer?

806
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
I saw her somewhere.

807
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
You don't have to know.

808
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,200
Take the envelope and leave.

809
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,200
We still have a lot of money to collect.

810
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Go away.

811
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,200
Oh, my God. You're crazy.

812
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200
Why is she so bad?

813
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,200
Is she a student?

814
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,200
Sange.

815
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,200
Yes?

816
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,200
Shall we really date?

817
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,200
Why did you ask me to come here?

818
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,200
You didn't know anything, did you?

819
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,200
I know.

820
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,200
It's a very popular bakery these days.

821
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,200
So this is a date course?

822
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,200
I think I'll have to pay for it all day.

823
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,200
You're taking pictures because you're sick.

824
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,200
Are you eating delicious food for a date course?

825
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,200
It's so delicious.

826
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
I came here last time.

827
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,200
Of course, I didn't eat it because you gave it to me.

828
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,200
Then, if it's sold right in front of us?

829
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
Hey, Bongbong.

830
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
Did you forget that you're lucky?

831
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,200
I'm very worried.

832
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,200
I'll show you the best bakery I can make today.

833
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,200
Lucky is not even called sometimes.

834
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,200
Hey, it's getting better.

835
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,200
I bought the ingredients.

836
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
I'm sure the kids in school uniform will like it.

837
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,200
What?

838
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,200
I bought the ingredients.

839
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,200
It's all about the time and the world for the kids in school uniform.

840
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,200
What are you saying?

841
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,200
Isn't it fun?

842
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,200
I'm a star.

843
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,200
I'm a person.

844
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,200
I smell bread.

845
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,200
I hold my hands.

846
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,200
Yes.

847
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,200
Good, good, good.

848
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,200
Perfect.

849
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,200
Let's go.

850
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Hey.

851
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
Hey.

852
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Don't you take your credit card?

853
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,200
Card?

854
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,200
I don't have a card.

855
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,200
Who are you?

856
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,200
You're a celebrity, right?

857
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,200
Cheer up.

858
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,200
Hey, you should give me my flowers.

859
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,200
I don't even know what you're doing on the bus.

860
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,200
You can do it yourself.

861
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,200
You're not a burden to me.

862
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,200
Are you a celebrity?

863
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,200
You're a member of the family who can't even take a bus?

864
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,200
I'm going to raise you up.

865
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,200
What?

866
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,200
Hey, I can't make a contract like that.

867
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,200
Why did you take the bus all of a sudden?

868
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,200
I wanted to love you.

869
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,200
I'm the one who's going to love you.

870
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,200
Do you want this?

871
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,200
I saw you didn't buy the bag.

872
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,200
I bought it at the end.

873
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,200
Really?

874
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,200
Thank you.

875
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,200
Can I give it to you?

876
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,200
No, it's okay.

877
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,200
I'm sure you bought it hard.

878
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,200
Why do you think bread is the best thing in the world?

879
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,200
I heard a lot of your songs in your third grade.

880
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,200
Thank you.

881
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,200
I don't listen to the more loud songs because you're not here.

882
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,200
Hey.

883
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:54,200
I guess you were the only one in the world in the world.

884
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,200
What is it?

885
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,200
You bought food when you were in the public transport.

886
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,200
You don't know how to make it?

887
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,200
You can't even drive a bus.

888
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,200
How can you keep your promise when you're on the bus or when you're in the public transport?

889
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,200
Stop it.

890
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,200
You're the type of person who's been through a lot, right?

891
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,200
I was going to stop dating because I was so busy.

892
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,200
I should go around and get a ride.

893
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,200
I'm sure I'll have time on the weekend.

894
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,200
I'm sorry.

895
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,200
Light wall.

896
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,200
I dropped this chord.

897
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,200
I don't need to even peace with this melody.

898
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,160
scene

899
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,280
Oh, shoot!

900
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,060
Wow!

901
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,200
That was good.

902
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,080
You know I always pick the song, right?

903
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:06,840
Yeah.

904
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,560
If you'reêre off to work for the show,

905
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,360
you'll practice this song first.

906
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,140
That's the Ahn Seong?

907
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,140
I'm singing with you.

908
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:18,140
You have to sing for me.

909
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,140
Who would sing if it's not me?

910
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:25,140
I don't understand such a serious thing.

911
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,140
I'm addicted to music.

912
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:29,140
If it's a five-star song, why would I listen to it in my dream?

913
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,140
Really?

914
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,140
You heard it in your dream?

915
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,140
I'm serious.

916
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:39,140
What kind of pretty kid in my dream is playing the piano in front of this white piano?

917
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,140
I remember the melody after I woke up.

918
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:46,140
And the more interesting thing is that the rabbit sticker was stuck on the piano in my dream.

919
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,140
It's exactly where it is.

920
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:49,140
That makes sense?

921
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,140
Of course it doesn't.

922
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,140
So we're destined to meet.

923
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,140
I think I'm a wild animal.

924
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:00,140
It was you in my dream.

925
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:06,140
Anyway, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have found it.

926
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:09,140
I'm really thankful.

927
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:12,140
You shouldn't have been so emotional.

928
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,140
I'm not kidding.

929
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,140
Can't you be serious?

930
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,140
Do you want to talk like that every time?

931
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,140
If it's not a joke.

932
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,140
Or...

933
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,140
I think he's crazy.

934
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,140
What if someone comes?

935
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,140
I'm really uncomfortable.

936
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:38,140
It's so hard to be alone because of the boy who was born.

937
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:41,140
I can't even tell you what this is.

938
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,140
Then we're the only ones happy in this situation.

939
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,140
Let's just wait and see.

940
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:57,140
It's good to be so cold-hearted.

941
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:04,140
The first day you came here, you were so tall and pretty.

942
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:06,140
Did I?

943
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:13,140
It's the first time I'm so happy because of you.

944
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:19,140
This is how it's going to be, right?

945
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:24,140
I hope it's not autumn even though we're separated later.

946
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:28,140
It's so cruel to be separated in such a pretty season.

947
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,140
Right?

948
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:33,140
Why do you say that?

949
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,140
What are you doing?

950
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,140
Don't you drink?

951
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,140
Cheers.

952
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:45,140
You can't just drink beer, right?

953
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:18,140
I'm happy for the first time ever since my mom passed away.

954
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,140
What are you doing after class tomorrow?

955
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:28,140
Why? You want to go on a date again?

956
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,140
You're so dumb.

957
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,140
Okay.

958
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,140
If you want to go somewhere, you can go.

959
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,140
I'll take you there before the end of the month.

960
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,140
I'm going to see my mom tomorrow.

961
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,140
Do you want to go with me?

962
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,140
Mom?

963
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,140
Yes.

964
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,140
Of course.

965
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:51,140
I thought you didn't like what I said.

966
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,140
It's actually my first time taking my friend to my mom.

967
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,140
I'm not brave enough to do that.

968
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,140
Why?

969
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:05,140
When my mom was in my condition, the doctor said she'd be in a long-term depression.

970
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:08,140
I said I would.

971
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,140
I was scared and scared.

972
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:14,140
I was afraid my mom would be mad at me.

973
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:17,140
Why didn't you wait for me?

974
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:21,140
I could wake up tomorrow.

975
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:24,140
Why did you decide so quickly?

976
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,140
Did you...

977
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,140
make a mistake?

978
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:35,140
I'm sorry.

979
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:39,140
I always do this when I think about going to see my mom.

980
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,140
Let's meet at the flower shop after class tomorrow.

981
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:46,140
You'll pick me up when I like to go to school, right?

982
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,140
Yes.

983
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,140
Good night.

984
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:57,140
Good night.

985
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,140
Good night.

986
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,140
Good night.

987
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:53,140
Mom, why did you turn off the light?

988
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:56,140
Is it night now?

989
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:06,140
Unfortunately, there's no way out of the lecture room.

990
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:17,140
Bum Bum, don't fight.

991
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:26,140
Mom, I'm sorry.

992
00:54:53,140 --> 00:55:02,140
Ta da la la la la la la la la.

993
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:05,140
Mom, get him.

994
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:08,140
I'm getting him.

995
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,140
Bum Bum!

996
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,140
Bum Bum!

997
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:25,140
BOOM BOOM!

998
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,140
BOOM BOOM!

999
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,140
What? Why do I see this?

1000
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,260
You want to do this?

1001
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,860
I've been doing this for days.

1002
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,940
Did you get a little bit of a hangover?

1003
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,140
I have something I'm curious about.

1004
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:04,740
Did you live with your mom since you were young?

1005
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:05,700
Why?

1006
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,900
What if it's old?

1007
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,100
Do you want to cut it into a half?

1008
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,100
I was just curious.

1009
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,300
Just live.

1010
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,380
There's no house in this neighborhood.

1011
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,180
My dad was a housekeeper,

1012
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,500
so he got so tired of it.

1013
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,380
He's so stubborn.

1014
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,020
He's not going to break this house.

1015
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,820
And my mom is so stubborn.

1016
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:27,020
Why did your mom go back?

1017
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,340
Whether it's your mom or not,

1018
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,540
I don't want to talk about it.

1019
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,380
It's a traffic accident.

1020
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:35,180
I don't think he was just a typhoon.

1021
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,940
But he's been living a lot.

1022
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:39,620
Heart and heart.

1023
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,380
Where else?

1024
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,100
Was it snowing?

1025
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,740
Anyway, what's the point of remembering?

1026
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:45,820
You're a sad dog.

1027
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:48,060
When your mom was alive,

1028
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:50,860
she was even more cute than the princesses in the royal palace.

1029
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:52,500
You're so annoying.

1030
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:54,220
I'm going to die of boredom.

1031
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,220
You're a coward.

1032
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,460
Seoul, which was surrounded by typhoons and lichens,

1033
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,300
is a place of cold and dark.

1034
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,140
Garosu was picked up and covered in the Indochina.

1035
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,220
The traffic system in the streets

1036
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,300
hasn't been normal yet.

1037
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,780
Seoul, you're in a hurry to go to the police

1038
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,500
at the traffic accident.

1039
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,140
I'm sorry, but can you show me

1040
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,940
your mom's photo?

1041
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,620
Here.

1042
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,300
Oh, here it is.

1043
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,900
It's too much.

1044
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,900
Don't tell Bong-hee that I took a photo.

1045
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,980
It was six years ago that Bong-hee's mom passed away, right?

1046
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,580
Yes.

1047
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:38,220
Do you remember the hospital you passed away to?

1048
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,580
Of course.

1049
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:40,900
Won-joong Hospital.

1050
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:44,500
It was near the accident.

1051
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:48,100
Won-joong Hospital?

1052
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,100
Six years ago.

1053
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,100
Won-joong Hospital.

1054
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,100
Six years ago?

1055
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,300
What?

1056
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,300
You said it wasn't too late.

1057
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:31,300
Bong-bo.

1058
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:41,300
Bong-bo.

1059
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:45,300
You have to answer me when I win.

1060
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,300
What's hiding?

1061
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,300
What happened six years ago?

1062
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:11,300
The murderer is three times more than the original.

1063
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,300
You killed him.

1064
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:16,300
You're the only one who knows

1065
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:19,300
what's going on.

1066
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,300
Do you remember?

1067
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:25,300
I was there!

1068
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,300
Mom.

1069
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,300
The number you have dialed is busy.

1070
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,300
Please call again later.

1071
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,300
Mom.

1072
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,300
What's wrong with you?

1073
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,300
Answer me, mom.

1074
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,300
Mom, please listen to me.

1075
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,300
Suck it.

1076
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:49,300
Do you know where the murderer is?

1077
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:56,300
Did you see the murderer?

1078
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:07,300
Did you see the murderer?

1079
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,300
What's wrong with you?

1080
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,300
It's not right.

1081
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,300
It's not right.

1082
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,300
What are you doing?

1083
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:49,300
Were you doing this to her?

1084
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,300
Are you stupid?

1085
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,300
Oppa.

1086
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,300
You can't contact the murderer.

1087
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,300
It's not going to work out.

1088
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,300
It's not an accident, is it?

1089
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,300
I'm scared.

1090
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:17,300
I'm afraid I'll disappear like my mom.

1091
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,300
Even if you do,

1092
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,300
I'll tell you my love again.

1093
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,300
My love.

1094
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:01,300
Turn your head.

1095
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:06,300
What if someone who's precious got unhappy because of me?

1096
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,300
It's not a witness.

1097
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:10,300
How did a witness appear in six years?

1098
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,300
What are you doing?

1099
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,300
We might get caught if we stay still.

1100
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:17,300
Shall we talk about it properly?

1101
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,300
You're not going to deal with Han Bum-hee.

1102
