ALL CHARACTERS

00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,970
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE CONDITIONS

<i>Roopretelcham.</i>

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,900
<i>Girl, you shake up my world</i>

5
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,610
<i>Even without words, you know how I feel</i>

6
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,690
<i>The time that we had</i>
<i>You appear before my eyes</i>

7
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,030
<i>Without you, my nights will be lonely</i>

8
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,740
<i>I find new things to do</i>

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,320
<i>Meet friends at every chance</i>

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,030
<i>Talk about meaningless things</i>

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,280
<i>But why is it still this hard?</i>

12
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,620
<i>Oh, my, my, my</i>
<i>I think about you every day</i>

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,710
<i>Counting three-sixty-five</i>
<i>I hold back as much as I can</i>

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,340
<i>If we're meant to be, we'll meet again</i>

15
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,350
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

16
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,180
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

17
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,440
<i>I hear time will do the work</i>

18
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,110
<i>It'll help me forget about you</i>

19
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,500
<i>Oh, no. It looks like we blew a fuse.</i>

20
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,960
<i>What now?</i>

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,420
<i>Shouldn't we stop filming?</i>

22
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,340
<i>No way. I said we'd be filming this</i>
<i>in a single take.</i>

23
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,670
<i>Didn't you see the sparks?</i>

24
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,840
<i>I can't. I'm not dying here today.</i>

25
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,220
<i>No one's going to die.</i>

26
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,300
<i>Gyu-ri.</i>

27
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,940
Hey, wait.

28
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,860
THE CROWN NEW MEMBER REVEAL
COUNTDOWN

29
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,960
SEO TAE-YANG

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,050
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

31
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:29,010
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

32
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,640
Nice to meet you. I'm Seo Tae-yang.

33
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,310
I'll do my best as The Crown's new leader.

34
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,200
Director Seo Min-cheol's son?

35
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,570
The dad is friends with CEO Jo

36
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,580
and owns a large share of the agency.

37
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,950
I get it now. Strings were pulled.

38
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,960
His dad landed him the leader role.

39
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,870
He didn't even have to train.

40
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,000
I FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM
AT FIRST SIGHT

41
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,130
HE COMMANDED THE WHOLE STAGE
ON HIS OWN

42
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,420
EVEN HIS NAME IS HOT
AND OMG THAT FACE?

43
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,050
THE CROWN'S NEW LEADER REVEALED
ON DECEMBER 1ST, 10 A.M.

44
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,300
THE CROWN'S NEW LEADER REVEALED
ON DECEMBER 1ST, 10 A.M.

45
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,020
Bom, did you know about this?

46
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,270
No.

47
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,770
I had no idea.

48
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,980
Seo Tae-yang, you bastard.
How could you do this?

49
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,150
How can he be in the same band
as those jerks

50
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,700
who kicked SAGYE off his throne?

51
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,530
And who does he think he is,
replacing SAGYE?

52
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,450
His spot should be off-limits!

53
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,500
- I'll call him.
- Don't.

54
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,210
He doesn't know the truth
and should get out while he can.

55
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,580
This is Tae-yang's choice.

56
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,040
It's not our place to meddle.

57
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,920
<i>I won't have to feel bad either.</i>

58
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,550
Regardless of how I start my career…

59
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,840
You won't care, right?

60
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,810
It's not like Jo & Jo
ever wronged Tae-yang.

61
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,190
I bet his dad pulled strings
to get him into a top agency.

62
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,230
With this in his back pocket,
he dared say he wouldn't leave TWO SAGYE.

63
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,480
That just pisses me off!

64
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,990
What about our video?
Is it getting a lot of views?

65
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,160
As if!

66
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,830
We're just about the only ones
clicking on it!

67
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,250
I'm sure things will improve.

68
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,670
The Crown just released big news,
so more people will look them up.

69
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,340
Who knows? The algorithm might do
its magic and make us go viral.

70
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,550
That's bound to happen.

71
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,100
<i>The person you called is unavailable</i>…

Sir, you should see this.

76
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,800
What is it? What's going on?

77
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,010
Someone just uploaded a cover of the song.

78
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,070
<i>It's the best cover of our song so far.</i>

79
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,990
This arrangement is fire! How can
the cover be better than the original?

80
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,360
It sounds completely different.

81
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,530
Did a real person sing this?

82
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,030
- He's a beast on those notes. It's sick!
- This is insanely good.

83
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,160
Who can pull off high notes
in chest voice like that?

84
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,080
I'm totally sold on this vocalist.
He'll forever be my role model.

85
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,920
This definitely deserves a comment.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,380
- Hit like.
- Right.

87
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,800
- This isn't a promo stunt on our part.
- It wasn't us.

88
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,050
Of course not. Why would we hide it?

89
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,550
- We're just as baffled.
- Absolutely.

90
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,760
Can you believe it?

91
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,810
The cover is more popular
than the new member reveal.

92
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,140
The view count is no joke!

93
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,770
It just became the most trending video.

94
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,100
SUNDER's comment must've given it a boost.

95
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,650
- Exactly.
- Do you think they have an agency?

96
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,770
They must be professionals,
given how good they are.

97
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,690
- Can you tell who it is?
- No clue.

98
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,450
They'll reveal their faces once it exceeds
three million views, and they're close.

99
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,870
Should we gather the members of The Crown?

100
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,740
Filming their reaction to the cover
could hook core fans.

101
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,580
Compared to variety shows,
self-made content--

102
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,910
Why are you so hyped about this?

103
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,880
The focus of this company right now
is Seo Tae-yang, a new brand.

104
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,840
His reveal was overshadowed,

105
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,760
so why are you so excited
about a viral cover?

106
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,320
VIEWS
SUBSCRIBERS

107
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,570
We should upload it.

108
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,290
Now that it has over three million views,

109
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,210
we'll upload the video
we filmed without our hats.

110
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,960
- Here we go. One, two, three.
- Three.

111
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,880
THE CROWN, SEE YOU LATER COVER

112
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,680
See? My plan worked out!

113
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,140
That's me, Kim Bom!

114
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,180
TWO SAGYE is finally making its debut.

115
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,020
Bring it in.

116
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,360
One, two, three.

117
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,900
- TWO SAGYE, forever!
- TWO SAGYE, forever!

118
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,700
- Hey, let's get to school.
- Got it.

119
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,450
Move it!

120
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,700
- What is it?
- Out of the way, Mom.

121
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,080
What is it? Why are you leaving me out?

122
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,000
You Zoomers. Unbelievable!

123
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,290
What were they watching? The Crown?

124
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,380
They're so good.

125
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,310
Sa Gye?

126
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,930
- Has Sa Gye always been this good?
- This is insane.

127
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,440
- Is it Sa Gye?
- No wonder the vocalist sounded so good.

128
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,550
- Go, Sa Gye!
- Go, Sa Gye!

129

THE FACES BEHIND

TWO SAGYE.

133
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,140
I have a request, Mr. Jo.

134
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,650
Give me your full support.

135
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,230
Make me a more successful artist

136
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,020
than Sa Gye.

137
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,820
If it means I can erase
his presence from The Crown,

138
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,700
I'll do anything.

139
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,200
You'll do anything?

140
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,620
Are you sure you can outdo Sa Gye?

141
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,830
Yes.

142
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,910
I can do it.

143
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,340
Good, then go outshine him.

144
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,300
I'll help you soar as high as you want.

145
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,630
Guys, pack up your things.
We finally booked a gig!

146
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,630
- Really?
- Really?

147
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,970
Buckle up.
You'll be performing like crazy now.

148
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,640
What event? How much are we getting paid?

149
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,680
Come on. Just tell us already!

150
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,390
Haenam Sweet Potato Festival.

151
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,230
A base payment and a bonus
if there's a big crowd.

152
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,060
It sounds like a real banger!

153
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,400
SWEET POTATO

154
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
How can we take the bus
with all this stuff?

155
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,780
Call a truck, will you?

156
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,410
Then we'll be in the red.

157
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,160
Who knew we'd get paid
with sweet potatoes?

158
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,080
We got onions as a bonus.

159
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,040
Bom, you should've negotiated better.

160
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,040
They should at least cover our transport.

161
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,130
Is that the best you can do
as the producer?

162
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,720
That's enough.
We still have more events lined up.

163
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
Where to next?

164
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
A ski resort.

165
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,600
A ski resort!

166
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,770
You know only good singers
perform at ski resorts.

167
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,480
Bom booked a good one for us.
Give it up for her!

168
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,520
How much will we get paid there?

169
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,400
Five million won.

170
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,490
- Five million?
- No way!

171
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,450
See? I told you she's competent.

172
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,490
No other amateurs would get
five million to perform.

173
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,370
Two boxes of sweet potatoes
aren't bad at all for our first gig.

174
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,540
Based on my experience with an agency,

175
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,330
I've never come across
such a perfect producer.

176
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,290
At this rate,
we'll be able to afford a truck soon.

177
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,710
The bus is here.

178
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,350
I'm not carrying mine.
SAGYE, I'm not carrying mine!

179
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,470
I'll get it.

180
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,810
Forget it.

181
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,990
What a crowd. Are they all here to see us?

182
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,030
That's how hot TWO SAGYE is at the moment.

183
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,870
You'll get used to this in no time.

184
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,990
We became famous overnight.
Jeez, I'm super nervous.

185
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,500
Where's the event staff?

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,330
In the waiting room.

187
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,040
Where's the waiting room?

188
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,790
- Over there?
- There?

189
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,090
Let's go.

190
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,840
- I think it's over there.
- What?

191
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,680
2025 PYEONGCHANG WINTER
FESTIVAL - SPECIAL GUEST

192
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,890
Special guest! Do you see that?

193
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,020
Let's head inside.

194
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,140
What the heck?

195
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,400
What is it?

196
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,520
- It's locked.
- It's locked?

197
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,030
Why is it locked?

198
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,530
But we have to perform soon.
What's going on?

199
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,780
Why can't I hear anything?

200
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,450
- Can you call them?
- Sure.

201
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,490
<i>The number you have called</i>
<i>is not in service.</i>

202
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,040
- What? Is no one answering?
- <i>Please check again.</i>

203
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,250
Actually…

204
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,210
- the number isn't in service.
- What do you mean?

205
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,750
You just spoke with them.

206
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,920
It took three hours
and three buses to get here.

207
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,260
- Are you sure we're in the right place?
- I'm sure.

208
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,430
Pyeongchang Ski Resort.

209
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,510
2025 PYEONGCHANG WINTER FESTIVAL

210
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,430
- Here they come.
- Finally.

211
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,520
- Hello.
- Hi, we're TWO SAGYE.

212
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,310
Can you open the door for us?

213
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,350
- Hello.
- Hello.

214
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,980
- Hello. Got it.
- Guys, grab your things.

215
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,570
2025 PYEONGCHANG WINTER FESTIVAL
SEO TAE-YANG

216
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,410
This way, please.

217
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,310
Can you close the door?

218
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,100
I want it to be quiet
before I get on stage.

219
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,520
Of course.

220
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,150
How is Seo Tae-yang here?

221
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,030
Guys.

222
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,690
You can't be here, so can you move?

223
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,360
We're the band TWO SAGYE.

224
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,570
Where's the event coordinator?

225
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,490
- That's me.
- Right.

226
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,740
You must be Mr. Oh Jeong-hwan.

227
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,790
- Hello.
- Hi.

228
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,460
I'm Kim Bom. We talked on the phone.

229
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,580
You booked us to perform at 5 p.m. today.

230
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,920
I was surprised
to hear your number wasn't in service.

231
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,670
There's no one by that name here.

232
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,800
- Sorry?
- There must be a misunderstanding,

233
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,640
but we booked Seo Tae-yang
for a fan sign event.

234
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,220
Seo Tae-yang, a member of The Crown.

235
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,470
No other band was booked.

236
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,140
Anyway, this is a restricted area.
How did you get back here?

237
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,270
- Will you get over here and handle this?
- Yes, sir.

238
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,690
- But…
- You'll have to leave.

239
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,980
- This is a restricted area.
- Go on.

240
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,030
- Please leave.
- You should leave.

241
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,740
- Hurry along.
- Please leave.

242
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
Please get going.

243
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,290
This is a restricted area.

244
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,750
<i>Was TWO SAGYE meant to perform here?</i>

245
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,090
<i>You didn't mention that.</i>

246
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,220
<i>You can't defeat your adversary</i>
<i>without trampling over them.</i>

247
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,640
<i>Were you expecting to make it to the top</i>
<i>without such determination?</i>

248
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,640
<i>Still…</i>

249
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,690
STILL, THIS IS…

250
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,120
Let me get this straight.

251
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,080
Somebody tricked us into booking a gig
that was never real

252
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,370
by luring us with a payment
of five million won.

253
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,880
But it Seo Tae-yang
turned out to be the actual guest.

254
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,920
What are the chances?
Could it be any fishier?

255
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,800
Jo & Jo probably pulled some strings.

256
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,590
Our cover's outshining the original,
and they probably couldn't stand that.

257
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,890
Still, they're playing way too dirty.
Who do they think they are?

258
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,890
Is this really how
a multi-billion-dollar company operates?

259
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,980
Wait. We can't be certain
that it was Jo & Jo.

260
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,400
Maybe…

261
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,190
this was Seo Tae-yang's doing.

262
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,530
He could've used a burner phone
to fake-call us.

263
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,950
Just to mess with us!

264
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,530
I'm right!

265
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,080
There's nothing money can't do.
Like father, like son.

266
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,200
That's a possibility.

267
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,620
He flat-out ignored us earlier.

268
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,710
- He thinks he's a superstar.
- What a jerk.

269
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,380
He acted upright and all,

270
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,420
but stealing our gig is
what he resorted to?

271
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,380
Come on. Let's mess up
this fan sign event.

272
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,260
I dare that bastard to call the cops.

273
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,430
- Hey.
- You're dead meat!

274
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,760
- Come on.
- Wait till I get my hands on you!

275
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,390
You prick. You're done for!

276
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,560
I can't take this.

277
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,610
Forget our chance to perform.
Since we're here…

278
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,500
Let's have some fun.

279
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,670
- Let's have some fun.
- What?

280
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,960
Let's have some fun!

281
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,130
I'm in.

282
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,090
Hey!

283
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,990
TWO SAGYE
EVENT BOOKING PAGE

284
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,660
DELETE POST?
DELETE

285
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,920
And Tae-yang's fan sign event?

286
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,130
I just got word that they just wrapped up.

287
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,680
Apparently,
they couldn't get enough of him.

288
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,770
And Sa Gye?

289
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,480
They packed up and left.

290
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,230
Have you been careful
with the burner phone?

291
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,310
Yes, sir.

292
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:06,780
Continue deleting all performance requests
received through TWO SAGYE's website.

293
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,320
General TV stations, cable networks,
and any other media outlets.

294
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,450
Make sure TWO SAGYE doesn't appear
on any of those.

295
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,200
Okay, sir.

296
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,800
<i>Seung-su, it looks like</i>
<i>TWO SAGYE's website has been hacked.</i>

297
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,010
<i>Fake requests keep coming in,</i>
<i>while real ones get deleted.</i>

298
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,180
<i>Can you check if CEO Jo is behind this?</i>

299
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,900
<i>It's not Mr. Jo.</i>

300
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,650
<i>He's been putting all his effort</i>
<i>into promoting Seo Tae-yang.</i>

301
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,530
Have you seen the northern lights before?

302
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,660
Yes, when I was in Iceland.

303
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,620
How was it?
I bet it's a class above sunsets.

304
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,960
What's it like to see something
blindingly beautiful?

305
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,000
Are the lights enchanting and charming?

306
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,300
Beats me. I don't really remember.

307
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,710
I was too sleepy.

308
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,970
We were on our Europe tour.
After three days of performing,

309
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,050
I'd be in another country, and then again
in another after three days.

310
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,680
That's why.

311
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,310
No way. That was rude of you.

312
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,850
How can you doze off
watching the northern lights?

313
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,190
Most people don't even get
the chance to see it.

314
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,270
My mom really wanted to see them too.

315
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,610
<i>I honestly don't even remember</i>
<i>the northern lights.</i>

316
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,950
<i>After regaining my vision,</i>

317
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,160
<i>I was looking at them with new eyes,</i>

318
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,040
<i>but I didn't realize back then</i>

319
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,330
<i>how special they were.</i>

320
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,080
That's why, someday,

321
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,710
I'll go and see

322
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,340
the northern lights.

323
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,670
I'll wait for the best time to see them,

324
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,220
and witness them with my own eyes.

325
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,220
I'll…

326
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
take you there.

327
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,810
What? Why would you?

328
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,020
I'll save up and go alone.

329
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,900
The northern lights
aren't visible every day.

330
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,030
The timing has to be right,
and you also have to be lucky.

331
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,660
So, let me go with you.

332
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,160
As if.

333
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,540
The Arctic or the Antarctic,

334
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,960
I'll make sure you see everything
you missed out on.

335
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,500
Start marking the places
that you'd like to visit on a map.

336
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,420
- You're all talk.
- Bom!

337
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,760
Bom, help me!

338
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,260
- I'm coming.
- Help!

339
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,550
He's too strong. Help me, please.

340
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,930
Here.

341
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,680
What? Hey, stop that!

342
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,970
<i>Bom's laughing.</i>

343
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,520
<i>All I ever want is to keep her smiling.</i>

344
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:51,020
<i>I want her to see</i>
<i>only the beauty life has to offer.</i>

345
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,400
<i>But what if she finds out</i>

TRENDING VIDEOS

348
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,460
The cover song has gotten
over 30 million views.

349
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,540
It's going viral.

350
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,000
I've been trying to fend off the media,

351
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,260
but they're more interested in TWO SAGYE
than The Crown.

352
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,010
It's only temporary.

353
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,340
Their fame will fizzle out
if they continue to stay invisible.

354
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,140
We could cut The Crown's promotion short.

355
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,760
That's not an option.

356
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:26,100
How much longer do we have to hear
they prefer the cover over the original?

357
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,940
They're even comparing the vocalists.

358
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,230
Is SUNDER unable to belt high notes
using chest voice?

359
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:35,110
There isn't a male vocalist
who can hit those notes using chest voice.

360
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,860
What about Sa Gye, then?

361
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,200
How did he get so good
after leaving the band?

362
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,080
You're the one who kicked him out.

363
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,750
Things wouldn't have gotten this far
if you hadn't plagiarized.

364
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,590
Hello, Director Seo.

365
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,930
I could hear you arguing
out in the hallway.

366
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,140
That's not good for the company, is it?

367
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,270
It's nothing serious.

368
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,900
Go on out.

369
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,110
Actually,

370
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,070
she should be here for this.

371
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,650
Right. I'll stay.

372
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,910
You know,

373
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:29,540
I didn't think you were working so hard
to ruin my son's chances.

374
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,290
I'm trying my best.

375
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,380
I've been accommodating
his requests and demands,

376
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,170
assigning him reporters
who will write only favorable pieces.

377
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:42,550
Whether you admit it or not,
your recent project was clearly a flop.

378
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,930
You failed to create any buzz,
even after signing a hotshot member.

379
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:49,270
Truth is,
you let Sa Gye get the better of you.

380
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,020
That's why I'll get more involved
in Tae-yang's career from now on.

381
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,610
I can't let him sink and drown
just because he boarded a leaky boat.

382
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,110
That will never happen.

383
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,740
How can you be so sure?

384
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
You've probably heard,

385
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,330
but I completed a tricky surgery
on the floor leader of the ruling party.

386
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:12,750
I'll be in as many interviews as possible,
so use that to create a buzz.

387
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
Understood, sir.

388
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,000
- The PR Team will take point.
- Producer Jo.

389
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,670
Have Tae-yang

390
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,180
be the first Asian ambassador for H brand.

391
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,930
What do you say? Can you do it?

392
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,010
Sorry?

393
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,390
But that brand is too high-end.

394
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,560
And what's Jo & Jo? A five-and-dime store?

395
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,560
No wonder.

396
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,690
I don't care how much it'll cost.

397
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,150
From now on, I'll make sure
to carry my son all the way to the top.

398
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,530
He'll sit on a throne
that no one dares to challenge.

399
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,990
- One, two, three.
- That's the same.

400
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
No, it's different. Take a closer look.

401
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,290
Sorry I'm late.
I came straight from my event.

402
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:56,040
- How much have you practiced?
- That'll be all for today. Pack up.

403
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,420
Sure.

404
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,590
Done already?

405
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,590
Tomorrow will be
our first performance as a band.

406
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,840
Our practice time is limited.

407
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,550
If you were worried,
you shouldn't have booked a separate gig.

408
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,470
And you did so without our consent.

409
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,850
The agency schedules these events.

410
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,970
Is that so?

411
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,560
But word is, CEO Jo takes orders from you.

412
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,600
Is that not true?

413
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,850
What a jerk.

414
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,650
The rehearsal's at 5 p.m.,
so gather around by noon.

415
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,350
We should talk.

416
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,600
You know how busy I've been
with all the performances.

417
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,690
I couldn't care less.

418
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:00,520
It seems like you care a lot, though.
It wasn't intentional, but I'll apologize.

419
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:04,360
TWO SAGYE happened to ruin
your historic day of joining The Crown.

420
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,450
Maybe you should've given us a heads-up.

421
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,200
I never thought you'd sign
with that lousy agency.

422
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,540
What are you getting at?

423
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,040
Do you really want to stoop down
to Jo Sang-heon's level?

424
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,090
It's lame to mess with our gigs,
don't you think?

425
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:23,170
But you had every right to be pissed,
so I'll let this one slide.

426
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,760
What if you don't?

427
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,550
I'm planning to take down Jo & Jo.

428
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,100
If you don't want to get hurt,
leave the agency on your own terms.

429
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,770
That's what I came here to say.

430
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,350
Why?

431
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,690
Are you that pissed off
that I replaced you?

432
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:44,320
I don't want you to get caught up
in this feud.

433
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,110
Bom doesn't want that.

434
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,400
Don't pretend you care about Bom.

435
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,660
You ditched her,
and now you're barking this nonsense?

436
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,780
I didn't wait outside in the cold
just to bark nonsense.

437
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,700
This is the most honest
I've been with you.

438
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,330
Leave Jo & Jo.

439
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,000
Jo Sang-heon's a piece of trash.

440
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,880
You're better than that.

441
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,380
You saying that

442
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,470
makes me think Jo & Jo is a great company.

443
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,720
Is it too good to give away?

444
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,560
Take me seriously, will you?
Jo & Jo plagiarized Bom's song.

445
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,100
How could you work
with scumbags like them?

446
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,230
Plagiarism?

447
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,900
Next time, come at me
with something better.

448
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,450
I know Bom.

449
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,610
She wouldn't sit back and sing a cover
of her own song if it had been stolen.

450
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,740
- She wouldn't keep it quiet from me too.
- Because you chose Jo & Jo,

451
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,250
she's letting this crappy situation
slide for your sake.

452
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,080
Because she's kind to a fault!

453
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,210
Do you know Bom that well?

454
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,630
More than I do?

455
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,210
I gave you my warning.

456
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,920
I'm set on taking down
the shady Jo & Jo Entertainment.

457
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,760
I'll get it done,
whether you're with them or not.

458
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,220
So don't regret this later.

459
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,180
I'm looking forward to it.

460
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,690
I'll be waiting.

461
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,440
I'm always down for a fight with you.

462
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,430
Everyone will probably be asleep.

463
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,060
That's hilarious!

464
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,650
- Can you believe it?
- It's so funny.

465
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,070
You're home late.
What's that in your hand?

466
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,570
It's beer.

467
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,030
I was thirsty, you see.
Maybe it's too dry in here.

468
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,240
The fridge is stocked with beer.

469
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,410
Ms. Kim doesn't make side dishes
but stocks the fridge with beer.

470
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,710
We didn't have the ale I like.

471
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,880
Anyway, don't mind me and enjoy the show.
That looks fun.

472
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,640
No way!

473
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,270
What is it?

474
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,650
What did he stash in the fridge
so secretly?

475
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,070
What's that? Isn't it beef?

476
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,860
No way. That's more premium
than prime-cut beef.

477
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,320
The marbling on that is insane.

478
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,990
That selfish brat.

479
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,070
How can he keep a stash for himself
when we live under the same roof?

480
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,910
What's with all the vegetables?
He hardly eats any.

481
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,290
- Maybe that isn't just for himself.
- Of course, it is.

482
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,710
He wouldn't have hid this
if he was going to share.

483
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:49,670
- That ungrateful brat.
- Right? What should we do?

484
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,710
Do you even have to ask? Heat up the pan.

485
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,590
Yes, ma'am. I'm on it.

486
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,480
<i>The Arctic or the Antarctic,</i>

487
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,610
<i>I'll make sure you see everything</i>
<i>you missed out on.</i>

488
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,900
<i>Start marking the places</i>
<i>that you'd like to visit on a map.</i>

489
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,870
Are you still up?

490
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,170
I was just about to turn in.

491
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,210
Early morning shift.

492
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,670
At what time?

493
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,920
I leave the house at 6 a.m.

494
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:40,300
Have breakfast before you go.
I'll grill some meat for you.

495
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,470
Meat?

496
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,100
Oh, that. It just landed in my lap.

497
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,850
<i>Anyway, have breakfast</i>
<i>before you leave tomorrow.</i>

498
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,850
I'll set the table and wait for you.

499
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,440
<i>You need to stay healthy.</i>

500
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,270
<i>You have a lot to do as a producer.</i>

501
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,440
What are you up to now?

502
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,280
I'm talking to you on the phone.

503
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,660
I have something to say to you.

504
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,200
- Go ahead.
- <i>Don't be surprised.</i>

505
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,180
What?

506
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:26,270
Were these doors always this easy to open?

507
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,980
Shouldn't doors be more secure?

508
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,650
This is an invasion of privacy.

509
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:38,400
And this… This is cheating.

510
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,900
My door is over there.

511
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,990
Come through there
if you have something to say.

512
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,240
You have no fear, do you?

513
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:48,710
Gye, are you still interested
in signing with me?

514
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,380
Can you promise me
you won't take it back again?

515
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,420
What if I can?

516
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,010
I want to sign you

517
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,550
as my first artist.

518
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,020
If you sign me,
Jo & Jo will only come after you harder.

519
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,180
Can you handle that?

520
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,650
That's why I'm doing it.
We're young, aren't we?

521
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,730
You're down, right?

522
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
It's an honor.

523
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,990
I can't pay you now,

524
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,750
but I will give the industry standard
once I've earned enough money.

525
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,420
Until then, this will be collateral.

526
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,840
Why would you give me that? Forget it.

527
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,510
- No way.
- You know what this means to me.

528
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,930
This means you can't run away.

529
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,770
If you change your mind again,

530
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,770
the fine will be 1,000 times higher.

531
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,020
I can't accept this.

532
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,030
I don't need a signing bonus
from you, so--

533
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,110
Take it,

534
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,450
or the deal's off.

535
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,430
I'm your producer for real from now on.

536
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,510
Let's do this.

537
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,270
Can I name your agency?

538
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,570
Sure. What will it be?

539
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,740
Bom-bom.

540
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,370
Spring is my favorite
out of the four seasons.

541
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,590
Cheers.

542
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,180
Do you know what the best drink is?

543
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,930
<i>Somaek</i>? Whiskey?

544
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,310
Or is it Chateau Moulin?

545
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,730
All wrong. It's free drinks.

546
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,110
It's thrilling to secretly sneak food.

547
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,820
- It's delicious.
- Isn't it? Let's dig in.

548
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,280
- It's a work of art.
- Right?

549
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,780
- I know a thing or two about meat.
- Right.

550
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,990
And this…

551
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,620
is the real deal.

552
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,870
The quality of this beef is outstanding.

553
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,870
You're broke, yet you
care so much about the meat quality.

554
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,500
Stuff your mouth before we get caught.

555
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,710
Hurry.

556
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,460
Cheers.

557
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,840
My heart just dropped.

558
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,220
Why are you standing there like a ghost?

559
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,480
Hold on. Are you crying?

560
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,610
Are you crying?

561
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:07,700
Why?

562
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,950
The meat…

563
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,040
is too darn good.

564
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,580
I didn't have a lot.
It's just that your mom insisted.

565
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,380
It's nothing to cry about. Go on and eat.

566
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,090
There's still about a kilo of meat left.

567
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,300
No!

568
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,050
I'm having it all by myself.

569
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,140
No one else can have it.

570
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,510
SAGYE bought this,

571
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,350
and I'm going to have all of it!

572
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,270
It's all mine!

573
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,900
What…

574
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:56,080
No!

575
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,330
Bom-bom.

576
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,800
I'll grill you meat some other time.

577
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,710
Today, stick to this instant coffee.

578
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,880
It's really hot,
so cool it down before drinking it.

579
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,640
But I'm off to work at a cafe.

580
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,350
It serves coffee made from roasted beans--

581
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:18,060
So? Are you saying
the coffee I made is worthless?

582
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,180
Of course not. I'll drink it.

583
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,350
The coffee someone else
makes for me is the best.

584
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,190
Especially instant coffee. Thanks.

585
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,060
This isn't coffee made by just anyone.

586
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,520
- What?
- It's CMS.

587
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,820
Coffee made by Sa Gye.
How special is that?

588
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,570
I'll get going.

589
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,670
Why aren't you bundled up?

590
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,080
Did you dress up for your shift?

591
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,880
I'm sure you'll be stubborn
and walk there.

592
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,840
You never listen, do you?

593
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,180
- We've been barely able to perform, so--
- Look.

594
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,390
I'll book us gigs.

595
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,770
Make sure you don't catch a cold.

596
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,560
That'll really put a damper on things.

597
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,070
Does an artist have to
look after his producer too?

598
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,400
Have a good one.

599
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,660
<i>Bom-bom!</i>

600
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,790
You'll catch a cold.

601
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,370
You know you shouldn't leave
your neck exposed in the cold.

602
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,870
Right, I forgot.

603
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,420
Here's a hand warmer.
It's a must for a pianist.

604
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,250
I forgot that too.

605
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,420
How do you expect to study abroad
if you're this clumsy?

606
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,930
Why don't you just stay? Please?

607
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,930
Just stay here with me.

608
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,680
My life will be boring without you around.

609
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,270
Mom, come on.

610
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:45,350
How can you not support me
when I'm dying to go to Juilliard?

611
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,610
It's the least you can do
for your daughter's future.

612
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:51,650
My daughter means more to me
than that Juilliard or whatnot.

613
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,030
Don't be on my case later on
for not getting married.

614
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,070
I'm going to live with you forever.

615
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,700
- I'll get going.
- Wait.

616
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,200
Why don't I give you a ride?

617
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,620
It's too cold today.

618
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,410
I'll go with Mi-yeon.
Gosh, I'm already sweating in my neck.

619
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,500
See you later!

620
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,380
Bom-bom, have a good day.

621
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,710
Keep the muffler.

622
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,510
You don't have to give it back.

623
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,740
Why is it so cold today?

624
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,160
I can't believe you three.

625
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,880
How could you silently gobble up
almost 2 kilos of beef

626
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,630
in the middle of the night?

627
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,630
What are you, thieves?
The "Lupin of Meat"?

628
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:56,590
Who are you calling thieves?
That's just wrong.

629
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:00,140
I saw the meat, and my hands
just instinctively grabbed it.

630
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,180
And that's what thieves do.

631
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,220
Taking what belongs to others
without a word.

632
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,060
We didn't eat any meat.

633
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,310
Didn't you bring home beer?

634
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,440
Yes, of course!

635
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,060
You bought beer home last night.

636
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,440
So what if I was thirsty and took a sip?

637
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:17,070
Does that give you the right
to give me an earful?

638
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,530
Unbelievable.

639
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,820
I'll keep my hands off
whatever you bring home.

640
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,080
Don't you feel bad for Bom?

641
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,450
She had gigs all day yesterday

642
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,040
and got an early morning shift,
so I wanted to grill her some meat.

643
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,830
But you went and ate it all.

644
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,130
And you call yourself her aunt?

645
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,880
Shouldn't a cousin be more caring?

646
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,840
Was the beef meant for Bom?

647
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,340
I had no idea.

648
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,510
But if I'm being honest,

649
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,510
Gyu-ri had most of it.

650
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:44,640
You should've seen her stuff herself.
She's pale from eating so much.

651
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,350
It's actually true.

652
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,350
Do you have indigestion?
Why have you been zoning out?

653
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,320
- So what?
- Gosh.

654
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,770
I already ate it!

655
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,030
Do you want me to throw it up?

656
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,700
I'll keep on eating
whatever's meant for Bom.

657
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,320
Goodness.

658
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,290
Is she for real?

659
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,500
Why isn't Gyu-ri working part-time?

660
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,880
Why is only Bom providing for the family?

661
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,590
What about you? How is this fair?

662
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:19,010
"Those who don't work shouldn't eat."
You don't know that?

663
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,130
Of course, I'd like to get a job.

664
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,180
But Bom keeps insisting that I don't.

665
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,850
She says staying put and not causing
trouble is the way to help her.

666
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:29,230
I'm dying to be out and about too.

667
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,350
Then do so.

668
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,560
- Where?
- Ms. Kim. Can you drive?

669
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,360
I don't own a car, but I'm licensed
to drive trucks and buses.

670
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,770
And you know how to take photos.

671
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,650
I'm incredible at it.

672
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,490
Back in high school,
I was the vice president

673
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,240
of Shin Seung-hun's Seoul fan club.

674
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,160
I used to be a WM.

675
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,660
- What's a WM?
- A website manager.

676
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,750
They follow celebrities around
and post the photos they take online.

677
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,710
Every famous celebrity has
a website manager with them

678
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,830
wherever they go.

679
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,170
- It's settled, then.
- What?

680
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,420
Ms. Kim Ja-young.

681
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,970
- You've been hired.
- As what?

682
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,930
You just got a job as TWO SAGYE's WM.

683
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,840
- Me?
- Let's go.

684
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,720
Website managers need good equipment,

685
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:10,140
so let me spend some money on you.

686
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,890
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes?

687
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,850
Ms. Kim, a camera should be black.

688
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,940
That's too gloomy.
What about this white one?

689
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,110
- I want this.
- You're clueless.

690
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,900
The key to a camera is the lens.

691
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,440
- The lens?
- You must have the right one.

692
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,820
Can I get the longest one?

693
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,200
Absolutely. How much is this?

694
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,530
That looks like a thermos.

695
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,320
A thermos? What a joke.

696
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,410
- But--
- What? Do we drink from it?

697
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,000
Guys, are you going to buy that?

698
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,580
- Get going.
- Hold on.

699
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,670
Come back when you're ready to purchase.

700
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:38,750
We're

701
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,920
- buying.
- Buying!

702
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,050
Unbelievable.

703
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,550
- Move.
- What do you take us for?

704
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,380
Here you go.

705
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,140
Thank you.

706
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,550
You're amazing!

707
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,680
Applause!

708
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,270
I'll start practicing.

709
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,930
- Start watching videos and practice.
- Got it.

710
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,060
We want the fastest.

711
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,650
Nonsense. The coolest.

712
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,230
No, the one with the best value.

713
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,980
The best value. You know what I'm saying?

714
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,240
Jin-gu, Ms. Kim, over here.

715
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,330
I found the perfect vehicle for us.

716
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,160
What do you think?

717
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,830
- This van?
- Yes.

718
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:16,830
Sweet, right?

719
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,760
Ms. Kim!

720
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,510
Ms. Kim, wait!

721
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,550
- What…
- Ms. Kim, please.

722
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,760
Stop!

723
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,020
Even though it's a used car,

724
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,180
he chose a van
with the best upgrades and features.

725
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,440
He also bought a high-end camera
worth over ten million won.

726
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,730
It was fully paid in cash.

727
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,690
In cash?

728
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,610
He still has some money left?

729
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,820
He seemed to have a lot of money
in his suitcase.

730
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,580
Didn't I say that I didn't want to see you
for the time being?

731
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,540
Did you think you could fake loyalty
with a few lousy photos?

732
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,210
Sir, please let me make it up to you.

733
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:00,920
I won't make another mistake.

734
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,250
The car seemed too nice to scrap.

735
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,710
Clearly, I wasn't thinking straight.

736
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,180
It's been going on for six years!

737
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,180
How could you have kept the car
all this time?

738
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,680
On top of that,
you told people it had water damage?

739
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,480
Just how many times
have you ignored my orders?

740
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,650
I swear it only happened that one time.

741
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:22,190
I made a terrible mistake, sir.

742
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,690
So? Did you actually
have it scrapped this time?

743
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,860
Yes, sir.

744
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,530
I took it to the junkyard myself

745
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:32,830
and watched as it was crushed
into a piece of metal.

746
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:34,330
There's even a video of it.

747
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:37,200
Please don't let me go, sir.

748
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,370
It's going to take you a long time
to make up for this.

749
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,210
Lay low until I summon you again.

750
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,850
Were you already here?

751
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,970
I got in early myself.

752
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,640
We just ended our practice session.

753
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,310
What? But we were to gather at noon.

754
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,400
Who said so?

755
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,110
Did I say that?

756
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:06,070
Guess you didn't hear
that the rehearsal is now at 2 p.m.

757
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:08,490
Anyway, we finished our practice
and are heading out.

758
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,320
Is this even the song…

759
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,070
we're performing today?

760
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,620
Who knows? Sit this one out
if you think you can't do it.

761
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,080
This is childish.

762
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,330
Like it or not, we're in the same band.
Are shows a joke to you?

763
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,380
They aren't,

764
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,880
so step down as leader and get lost.

765
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,340
We don't accept you as a bandmate.

766
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,420
What were you doing
while we spent five years

767
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:31,720
struggling to reach the top?

768
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,140
Absolutely nothing.

769
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,300
All you did was join
an already successful band.

770
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,450
HANJU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

771
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,670
I appreciate you agreeing
to this interview.

772
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,500
Thank you so much.

773
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,010
I hope you say good things
about Hanju University Hospital.

774
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:14,550
This recent surgery had nothing to do
with the hospital.

775
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,390
Your success was mostly your own.

776
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:19,010
I'll write a good article
that focuses on you.

777
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:21,930
That wasn't my intent.

778
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,940
Still, it's rewarding to see
that my patient's prognosis

779
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,610
has been positive after the surgery.

780
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,610
Your son joined The Crown
as its newest member.

781
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:30,780
Congratulations.

782
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,950
If you need promotional content,
I could include a family photo.

783
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:36,280
Goodness, Ms. Hong.

784
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:37,950
That's really not necessary.

785
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,490
Hold on. Let me see
if I have a decent photo.

786
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,960
I actually have a few right here.

787
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,420
Would these work?

788
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,210
Goodness me.

789
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:50,170
The two of you look so close.

790
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,210
You seem like a great father.

791
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,970
Gosh, I'm hardly one.

792
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:57,640
You know better than anyone that I spend
most of my time in the hospital.

793
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,560
I don't interfere in my son's life.

794
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,100
Instead, with these hands,

795
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:05,020
I hope to be a doctor
who continues to save lives.

796
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:09,020
Wouldn't that be the best gift
a father could give his son?

797
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,280
What the hell?

798
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,500
You…

799
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:34,630
Don't just stand there.
Let's get to rehearsal.

800
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:41,310
I felt uncomfortable riding
in the same van anyway,

801
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:42,680
so I appreciate it.

802
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,470
I wondered if I should
a few times to be polite.

803
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,480
What the hell?

804
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:53,280
- Over here. Seo Tae-yang, over here!
- Tae-yang!

805
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,860
- It's him.
- Yes, just like that.

806
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,650
- That brand looks great on you.
- Seo Tae-yang!

807
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,950
- I love it. Nice.
- That's great.

808
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:01,370
Can you look this way too?

809
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:03,040
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

810
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,580
- Coming through.
- Amazing outfit.

811
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,540
- Excuse us.
- We're coming through.

812
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,830
- Please let us through.
- Coming through!

813
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:11,710
Director Seo,

814
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,130
I have something to report.

815
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:16,920
- Later. I need a break.
- It's urgent.

816
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:19,590
Ms. Kim Bok-rye just passed away.

817
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,230
She died?

818
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:30,060
I believe we missed
the critical window for her surgery.

819
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:36,820
Her chances of survival were slim anyway.

820
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,030
I only agreed to the surgery
as a humanitarian effort

821
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:41,570
to help the poor woman.
There's no need to feel guilty.

822
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:44,370
The problem is that Ms. Kim
was a prominent figure in Suncheon.

823
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:47,330
People looking to arrange the funeral
are on their way to the hospital.

824
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:48,620
What are you talking about?

825
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,370
You said she lived alone
without any family.

826
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,960
She doesn't have any family,

827
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,920
but many people
have received financial aid from her.

828
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,130
She even left behind an inheritance
of over 60 billion won.

829
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,470
Sixty billion won?

830
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:03,470
In her will and testament,
she said she's leaving everything

831
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:04,970
to Hanju University Hospital.

832
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,680
Are you sure about this?

833
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,940
Reporters have already gotten wind of it
and have been calling.

834
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:13,900
What should we do if they find out
that we postponed her surgery?

835
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,190
We'll begin the rehearsal for The Crown.

836
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,330
<i>Your eyes are always somewhere else</i>
<i>Never on me</i>

837
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,250
<i>But still, I am always here for you</i>

838
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:38,300
<i>Why can't I be the one you love?</i>

839
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,810
<i>Only until then will I give it my all</i>

840
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:50,850
<i>I'll hold out, even if it's just for a day</i>

841
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,200
<i>See you later</i>

842
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,080
Thank you.

843
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:17,920
Your childish antics end here.

844
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,510
Unless you're as good as I am,
I suggest that you follow my lead.

845
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,300
No matter what song you play,

846
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:25,430
I'll be able to keep up.

847
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:34,100
<i>His voice has a power</i>
<i>that can rival Sa Gye's.</i>

848
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,560
<i>Visually striking and skilled</i>
<i>on the guitar. He's perfect.</i>

849
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:38,270
<i>He might</i>

850
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,570
<i>even overshadow Sa Gye.</i>

851
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,030
These are articles about Seo Tae-yang
that will be released tomorrow.

852
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:46,280
Before they are posted online,

853
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,870
we will review each
and every one of them carefully.

854
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:51,790
Articles that could tarnish
our artist's image

855
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:53,710
will be sent back for revision,

856
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,830
so review them thoroughly.

857
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,080
- Got it.
- Understood.

858
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,210
Go, team.

866
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,860
<i>Isn't that Mr. Kang's wife?</i>

867
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:27,110
<i>Check out that fancy car.</i>
<i>It looks expensive.</i>

868
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:30,580
<i>Was the SUV Director Seo's?</i>

869
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:35,210
CUT

870
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,540
CEO JO

871
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,550
Sa Gye bought a high-end camera
and even a van.

872
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,140
This means he'll get down to business
and take on real gigs.

873
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,390
I have no idea what he's scheming.

874
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:56,730
Haven't we blocked all their gigs?

875
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:00,770
Well, SBN's Reporter Han
has been helping him.

876
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,030
He's been arranging unpaid gigs for them.

877
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:05,110
Unpaid gigs?

878
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,860
How's that even possible?
What money could Sa Gye have left?

879
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:11,410
Didn't he leave the company penniless
after paying the cancellation fee?

880
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:15,290
I felt bad for him,
so I gave him some money.

881
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,790
No wonder he's still on his high horse.

882
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:24,460
He bought a car using the company's money
and has been funding his gigs with it!

883
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:27,300
That's how he's still been running wild.

884
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,010
Go get that money back right now.

885
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:31,930
Sorry?

886
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:34,810
We need to stop that cheeky clown
and keep him in check!

887
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:38,230
Brats like him need to struggle
to afford food and gas

888
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,850
in order to come to their senses.

889
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,400
That…

890
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:44,770
I can't do that.

891
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:47,820
- You can't?
- Sa Gye has already lost a lot.

892
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,110
He's desperately floundering
in an attempt to make a comeback.

893
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,660
I don't get why you must take it this far.

894
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,700
Does he seem like
he's floundering desperately to you?

895
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:00,290
He's coming after me like a madman.

896
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:04,040
If I don't take him down,
he'll end up crushing me.

897
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,000
Why would he be after you?

898
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,300
He's not the kind of person
who would harm anyone.

899
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:13,850
If Sa Gye releases an album
under TWO SAGYE

900
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:15,810
and regains popularity and influence,

901
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:18,600
Jo & Jo will suffer an irreversible blow.

902
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,190
To save Jo & Jo,

903
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:24,560
he must never set foot
in this industry again.

904
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,070
No way. I can't do that.

905
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,820
I won't tell Sa Gye that I saw the SUV.

906
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,950
You can trust me on that.

907
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:38,500
I'm sorry, sir.

908
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,830
I'll understand if you fire me.

909
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:45,250
If you take care of this matter,
you will be compensated for your troubles.

910
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:48,590
I could even
promote you to chief director.

911
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:49,760
I'm not interested.

912
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,590
I'm even looking to buy
an apartment unit in your name.

913
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,470
I'd rather live without an apartment

914
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,600
than live with guilt.

915
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,520
How about five percent
of Jo & Jo's shares?

916
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:02,140
I'll give you five percent.

917
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:03,730
With that,

918
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:06,690
you'll be able to buy more
than a few buildings in Gangnam.

919
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:08,020
You'll have enough money

920
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:11,400
to support your family for generations
without working.

921
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:13,150
Jo & Jo

922
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,570
is your first ever workplace.

923
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,120
Don't you want to stand with me
to protect Jo & Jo?

924
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,500
This is a dump.

925
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,960
Just kill me already.

926
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,260
So much for looking decent.
It's a clunker.

927
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,260
I've been rubbing and scrubbing,
but it's still filthy.

928
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,050
A clunker, you say?
Don't say that to our Bom-bom Car.

929
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,890
Bom-bom Car, my ass.

930
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:39,010
- What?
- By the way,

931
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,810
why have we been doing all the cleaning?

932
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:42,140
Get rubbing too.

933
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,100
Those who enjoyed the meat
have the energy.

934
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,400
Not me though.
I've only been fed an earful.

935
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,270
You bring up the beef every ten minutes,
especially when cornered.

936
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,230
Starting today, I'm going vegan.

937
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,360
All right, guys. Keep it up.

938
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:56,070
We'll be travel around in this,
performing all across the country.

939
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,820
It should be as shiny as a new van.

940
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,700
Jin-gu, use a handheld vacuum
to clean the inside.

941
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:04,210
I can still see the dust.

942
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:06,040
- Where? Here?
- Yes.

943
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,250
Clean every inch.

944
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:10,090
- Sure.
- Dust the floor mats as well.

945
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,050
Hey! Stop bossing me around.

946
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:16,970
I can't take this anymore.
Do you even have any gigs booked for us?

947
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:19,430
What if we bought all of this for nothing?

948
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:20,970
Don't worry about that.

949
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,100
I have us fully booked for a month.

950
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,440
- A month?
- Already? For a month?

951
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,520
- Yes.
- No way!

952
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,810
You will pay me, right?
You promised a monthly salary.

953
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:33,780
If you make me work for free
since I'm family, I'll call the cops.

954
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,320
Just make sure to cover living expenses
once you get paid.

955
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,950
Stop mooching off Bom.

956
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:39,740
When did I ever mooch off her?

957
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,160
The payments we get
will be split evenly, right?

958
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,790
You don't get extra because you invested.

959
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:45,660
I hear you, okay?

960
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:48,330
But if you don't work hard,
I'll fire you both.

961
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,880
Go!

962
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,840
Gosh, it's freezing.

963
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,420
When will Bom be back?
I wanted to give her a ride.

964
00:55:58,430 --> 00:55:59,550
A ride?

965
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:02,760
I should call her.

966
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:05,560
I'll do it.

967
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,190
I was just about to call her anyway.

968
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:12,690
It's me. Where are you?

969
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:15,490
- Why are you at a department store?
- What?

970
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:17,490
- Is she at a department store?
- Yes, working.

971
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,660
What are you saying? I'm at our studio.

972
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,910
<i>I'll be home soon.</i>

973
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:22,620
- No!
- What do you mean?

974
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,580
Mom wants something
from the department store.

975
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,700
Yes, pajamas.

976
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:29,290
- Pajamas?
- She needs them tonight to help her sleep.

977
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:31,330
Apparently, they're made
with quality cotton.

978
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:35,800
Since you're there, can you pick up
a blusher, mascara, and lip gloss for me?

979
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,090
You'll be late?

980
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:38,680
That's too bad.

981
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,720
What the hell was that?

982
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,180
Bom has a shift at the department store
and will be home late.

983
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:47,810
There's team dinner, too.

984
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,310
- A part-timer goes to a team dinner?
- I don't know.

985
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,650
That being said, is Bom the one
you have to give a ride to?

986
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:55,940
Can't you give me one instead?

987
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:58,030
No. I can't.

988
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,990
Give me a ride instead!

989
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,500
Let it be me!

990
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,620
Take me on a drive!

991
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,130
Hey, Gyu-ri. Calm down, will you?
When Bom gets home--

992
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:16,460
No!

993
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:17,710
Today!

994
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,130
Right this moment!

995
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,890
Only give me a ride in the van!

996
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:28,520
Would it kill you
to give me what I want for once?

997
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,020
I thought your fans always came first!

998
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,360
Why can't it be me?

999
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,440
Yes! Step on it. Honk, honk.

1000
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:44,950
Gyu-ri, we've been driving around
for about 30 minutes.

1001
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:46,160
So?

1002
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,700
Well…

1003
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:50,910
- It wasn't enough!
- Exactly!

1004
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,420
It should be at least an hour.
Let's go, Bom-bom Car!

1005
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:02,930
I told you not to call it Bom-bom Car.

1006
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:07,100
I said no such thing.

1007
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,970
Maybe you heard wrong.

1008
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,810
I clearly said Bung-bung Car.

1009
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,280
- Gyu-ri.
- Please…

1010
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:23,570
don't say anything.

1011
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:26,490
Just for a while.

1012
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,950
Let's stay like this.

1013
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:38,880
I can't see the side-view mirror.

1014
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:40,630
I'm good now.

1015
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:44,340
<i>You jerk.</i>

1016
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:46,180
<i>You prick.</i>

1017
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,180
<i>I devoted my teen years to you.</i>

1018
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,310
<i>Yet, you think</i>
<i>even this is a waste of your time.</i>

1019
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:54,060
<i>All you care about is Bom.</i>

1020
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:55,690
<i>You're crazy about Bom!</i>

1021
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:57,940
<i>How could you?</i>

1022
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,270
<i>How could you?</i>

1023
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:02,650
What are you doing?

1024
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,950
Why are you getting out?

1025
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:05,240
I'm done being your fan.

1026
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:07,280
I'm done!

1027
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:08,740
I'm now off

1028
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:11,740
to find true love for myself.

1029
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,460
Wait. Where are you going?

1030
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,420
I loved you, SAGYE.

1031
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:21,920
A whole lot.

1032
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,300
Why does she suddenly want
department store pajamas?

1033
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,430
They're pricey.

1034
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:10,760
SALE
BUY 1 GET 1 FREE

1035
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:13,770
How are they this soft?

1036
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,640
I'll take them all.

1037
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:19,850
Today's my lucky day.

1038
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,860
Next, I'll buy a blusher and…

1039
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,160
- Tae-yang!
- It's Seo Tae-yang!

1040
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,870
- Can you believe it?
- He's so handsome!

1041
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,960
He's so handsome.

1042
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,720
Seo Tae-yang!

1043
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:57,430
Seo Tae-yang!

1044
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,570
Are you all right?

1045
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:02,420
<i>Why don't you hate Tae-yang?</i>

1046
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,960
<i>Is he that special to you?</i>

1047
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:04,880
<i>Don't go.</i>

1048
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,460
<i>I thought I could manage without you,</i>
<i>but I couldn't.</i>

1049
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:10,010
<i>You're hiding something from me.</i>
<i>Tell me.</i>

1050
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:11,630
<i>I know who's responsible.</i>

1051
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,680
<i>I'm warning you.</i>
<i>Even your life will hang in the balance.</i>

1052
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,760
<i>I'll handle him from now on.</i>

1053
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:18,810
<i>In the end, you're no different</i>
<i>from your father.</i>

1054
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:20,520
<i>I'll only think of Bom from now on.</i>

1055
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,310
<i>How about we lighten the mood a bit?</i>

1056
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:24,980
Make sure that Sa Gye doesn't talk.

1057
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:26,270
<i>If you hurt Bom in any way,</i>
<i>I'll take action.</i>

1058
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:31,360
