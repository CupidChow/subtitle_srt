I'm going to make a simple, simple, and easy

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,360
Are you still here?

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,860
Oh, I'm going home.

36
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,860
I'm late because I have something to do.

37
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,860
I didn't tell you that.

38
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,860
Is this the latest group meeting in our school?

39
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,360
It's so pretty and pretty.

40
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,860
She's going to the winter school this time.

41
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,360
Can I go?

42
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,860
My daughter can't see it.

43
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,860
The class is long. I'm going to see her.

44
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,360
I want to get close to her.

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
Can you please let me go?

46
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,860
I really want to go.

47
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,860
Okay, go.

48
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,860
Do whatever you want.

49
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,860
I love you, mom. I love you.

50
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,860
I love you, my daughter.

51
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,860
Oh, my.

52
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,860
I guess it's a war.

53
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,860
It's scary. Why is the weather so bad?

54
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,860
Oh, my gosh.

55
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,860
Mom?

56
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,860
Mom?

57
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,860
What's going on?

58
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,860
Answer me, mom.

59
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,860
Mom, please listen to me.

60
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,860
Please.

61
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,860
Please wait.

62
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,860
Please wait.

63
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,860
Mom?

64
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,860
Why did you let me go?

65
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,860
I could have lived.

66
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,860
Please hold on to me for a day.

67
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,860
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,860
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,860
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,860
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,860
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,860
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,860
If you miss me now,

74
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,860
what should I do?

75
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,860
Mom.

76
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,860
Mom.

77
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,860
Mom!

78
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,860
Mom!

79
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,860
Mom, I'm sorry.

80
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,860
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,860
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,860
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,860
Mom.

84
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,860
Mom.

85
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,860
That's enough.

86
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,860
What are you doing?

87
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,860
I'm fine.

88
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,860
I told you to stop.

89
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,860
What do I do if I get sick?

90
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,860
Where's your father?

91
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,860
Did you come home?

92
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,900
I just called.

93
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,100
What? What?

94
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,300
Did something happen?

95
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,140
Why didn't you answer my call?

96
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,260
I met my friend and drank.

97
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,540
I guess I was totally drunk.

98
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,340
I told you, nothing's going to happen.

99
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,540
I'm worried about him.

100
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,900
Let's just get to the bottom of this.

101
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,460
Saki.

102
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,260
What? When did you come?

103
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,060
Hey, hey, hey.

104
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,060
Oh, what happened?

105
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,060
Look at your face.

106
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,060
What's wrong?

107
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,060
Hey.

108
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,060
Hey, can you...

109
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,060
Fill it up?

110
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,860
What's wrong?

111
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,860
Why are you asking me that?

112
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,860
I'm the only one who was drunk and filled it up.

113
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,860
Come and get some more.

114
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,860
I put kimchi in and put bean sprouts in and boiled it.

115
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,860
No, I don't have appetite.

116
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,860
Hey, can I fill it up a few more days?

117
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,860
It's okay, right?

118
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,860
Yes.

119
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,860
I'll be back.

120
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,860
Hey, Saki.

121
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,860
Where are you going?

122
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,860
Why can't you see your nose?

123
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,860
You got me a job.

124
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,860
Are you mad?

125
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,860
Why did you get me a job?

126
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,860
I didn't answer my phone.

127
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,860
I'm sorry, but I can't reach you.

128
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,860
I'm sorry, but I can't reach you.

129
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,860
Why did you get him?

130
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,860
Oh, my.

131
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,860
He's a woman.

132
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,860
For your information,

133
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,860
he's not allowed to leave without a reason.

134
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,860
I hope he's kidnapped by his fans.

135
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,860
You're so pretty.

136
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,860
I heard you had a affair.

137
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,860
You were a little strange yesterday.

138
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,860
You came to me without a reason

139
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,860
and asked me when this house was built.

140
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,860
Bomi...

141
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,860
Bomi asked me when I was going to die.

142
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,860
Why did you ask me that?

143
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,860
I'm sure he didn't want to live in a house

144
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,860
where people died.

145
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,860
I'm sure he didn't believe in his wife.

146
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,860
What are you talking about?

147
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,860
He's a man who was kidnapped.

148
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,860
Was he kidnapped?

149
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,860
Yes.

150
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,860
Anyway,

151
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,860
I'm sure his fans want to live in this house

152
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,860
even if he's not rich.

153
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,860
He's just a fun guy.

154
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,860
He must have experienced it.

155
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,860
I'm so sad that I don't have a boyfriend.

156
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,860
You didn't have a boyfriend

157
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,860
so you had two meals at the same time?

158
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,860
You must be sitting in the rice cooker.

159
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,860
Mom,

160
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,860
I don't care if I eat or not.

161
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,860
Do you hate me so much

162
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,860
that I hate eating with my daughter?

163
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,860
I hate you the most.

164
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,860
You're the only one who eats free food at this house.

165
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,860
But it's better than eating free food with you two.

166
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,860
I'm coming.

167
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,860
Can I know the name of the park?

168
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,860
Please tell me where it is.

169
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,860
It's not a regular one.

170
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,860
We don't know it either.

171
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,860
Help.

172
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,860
Help.

173
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,860
Help.

174
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,860
Help.

175
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,860
Help.

176
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,860
Mom,

177
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,860
don't cry.

178
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,860
I'm not crying.

179
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,860
I'm not crying.

180
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,860
I'm not crying.

181
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,860
I'm not crying.

182
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,860
Saki,

183
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,860
the driver is here.

184
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,860
Mom, are you sure?

185
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,860
Can you see me now?

186
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,860
I can see you now.

187
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,860
Thank you.

188
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,860
Congratulations.

189
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,860
Congratulations.

190
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,860
There's a lot of food here.

191
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,860
It's a miracle.

192
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,860
You're right.

193
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,860
Thank you.

194
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,860
How nice.

195
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,860
The world is full of people.

196
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,860
Thank you.

197
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,860
Mom.

198
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,860
Mom.

199
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,860
Mom.

200
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,860
Mom.

201
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,860
Mom.

202
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,860
It wasn't a dream.

203
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,860
I saw it myself.

204
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,860
With these eyes.

205
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,860
It doesn't make sense.

206
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,860
Even if you make it look like a dream,

207
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,860
you can't remember it.

208
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,860
But why do you see it?

209
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,860
The last time I saw it was...

210
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,860
Help.

211
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,860
Help.

212
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,860
What should I do?

213
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,860
Tell me everything?

214
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,860
You're the boss who killed your mom?

215
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,860
What are you going to prove?

216
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,860
I saw it with your mother?

217
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,860
Who told you?

218
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,860
It doesn't make sense.

219
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,860
It hurts.

220
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,860
The fraud just came to the Mahyong-dong accident site.

221
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,860
Is that true?

222
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,860
It was definitely a fraud.

223
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,860
I'm sure it's a loan.

224
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,860
If you stay still, we can get hurt.

225
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,860
I'll tell you what.

226
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,860
I'm in a meeting right now.

227
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,860
I'll be back later.

228
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,860
I'll be back later.

229
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,860
I'll be back later.

230
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,860
I'll be back later.

231
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,860
I'll be back later.

232
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,860
I'll be back later.

233
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,860
I'll be back later.

234
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,860
I'll be back later.

235
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,860
I don't think we can let the music out.

236
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,860
I said no!

237
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,860
I can't get a tour abroad.

238
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,860
Everything is over if I break the trust.

239
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,860
I don't know how cruel this is!

240
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,860
What did the members say?

241
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,860
I can't give my opinion because I don't have a leader yet.

242
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,860
If you don't have a leader, you can't think!

243
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,860
How have you been?

244
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,860
I'm Jo Jina.

245
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,860
How have you been?

246
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,860
I've been writing songs these days.

247
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,860
Do you want to sell me a good song?

248
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,860
I'll buy it at the best price.

249
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,860
I don't have one.

250
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,860
You don't have one?

251
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,860
Yes.

252
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,860
I'm sure I'll never sell my song again.

253
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,860
I'll produce it myself.

254
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,860
Really?

255
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,860
It's a shame.

256
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,860
It's hard to succeed in a good song these days.

257
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,860
It's hard to succeed in a good song these days.

258
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,860
Have you decided on an artist to call you?

259
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,860
Yes.

260
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,860
What?

261
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,860
You don't want to buy that artist, do you?

262
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,860
I'm sorry, but I have to go to school now.

263
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,860
I'll call you back later.

264
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,860
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,860
This is the first song I've written.

266
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,860
Would you like to check it out?

267
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,860
This...

268
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,860
This is yours?

269
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,860
Yes.

270
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,860
I've used it once in my experience.

271
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,860
How is it?

272
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,860
If you write a little more in the song,

273
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,860
I think you can do it with the title.

274
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,860
I'm not sure.

275
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,860
I'll have to do it once more than the previous song.

276
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,860
Ask A.N.A.

277
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,860
Ask A.N.A.

278
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,860
Yes.

279
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,860
Oh, Mr. Hyuk!

280
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,860
Mr. Hyuk, hello.

281
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,860
Isn't this the witness?

282
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,860
How did the witness appear in six years?

283
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,860
The driver slipped on the road and the car turned around.

284
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,860
But no one saw him.

285
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,860
Mr. Hyuk, listen to me.

286
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,860
We're looking for the case record.

287
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,860
The day the car accident happened because of the typhoon Lucy.

288
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,860
That's right.

289
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,860
The CCTV system was stopped.

290
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,860
No one was passing by because of the external control.

291
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,860
But someone saw it.

292
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,860
That day, the scene.

293
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,860
Who is that?

294
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,860
He's coming here.

295
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,860
He's coming.

296
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,860
Hurry up and get in.

297
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:14,860
Oh, my God.

298
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:21,860
Can I be called a witness?

299
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,860
I saw it in my dream.

300
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,860
What evidence?

301
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,860
If you can't find anything while you're out of the witness,

302
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,860
If you can't find anything while you're out of the witness,

303
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,860
If you can't find anything while you're out of the witness,

304
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,860
If you give the wound to the spring,

305
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,860
If the spring is dangerous,

306
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,860
What did the witness see?

307
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,860
The SUV was taken over the central line and was taken into the victim's car.

308
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,860
The car accident was a fake.

309
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,860
Fake?

310
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,860
Crazy.

311
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
That's right.

312
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,860
There was definitely another car.

313
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,860
What did you say before the accident?

314
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,860
The car accident was a fake.

315
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,860
The evidence is not out.

316
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,860
Why don't you believe me?

317
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,860
He's not a person who can make a car accident.

318
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,860
He's never been in a car accident.

319
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,860
Even if you drive in the ski shop, he's not a person who can make a car accident.

320
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,860
Don't lie.

321
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,860
It's not the time to investigate with a fist.

322
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,860
If there was a car accident, there would be traces.

323
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,860
The accident ended without evidence.

324
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,860
I'm sorry.

325
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,860
What kind of traces are left?

326
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,860
The accident ended without evidence.

327
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,860
If you do something wrong with the police, it's a mess.

328
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,860
Yes.

329
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,860
No, that doesn't mean that.

330
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,860
I always respect the police.

331
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,860
You're very generous.

332
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,860
But why did the witness come and report it now?

333
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,860
It seemed that there was no credibility in the beginning.

334
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,860
He said he was 14 years old.

335
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,860
He was talking about whether he saw it himself or dreamt about it.

336
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,860
He didn't even know where he went at 5 a.m.

337
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,860
Mr. Min.

338
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,860
Don't be so quick.

339
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,860
Can you call me if you want to report it?

340
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,860
It was an public call.

341
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,860
Hold on.

342
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,860
It seems like he's in a hurry.

343
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,860
He said he'd come out and report it himself, so he's afraid that he's out of his mind.

344
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,860
He said it was weird.

345
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,860
He said it was weird.

346
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,860
He said he'd find the witness.

347
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,860
He said he'd find the witness.

348
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,860
But no one showed up.

349
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,860
Why are you so upset?

350
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,860
He's a good guy.

351
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,860
He's a bad guy.

352
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,860
He's so nervous that he's going to live.

353
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,860
I'm sorry.

354
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,860
You're going home, right?

355
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,860
Yes.

356
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,860
I'm so upset that I can't go to Hawaii even if someone sends me to the freeway.

357
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,860
You should get to work.

358
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,860
I'll take you on a train.

359
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,860
I'm just taking a break.

360
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,860
If you have nothing to do, you can go to the freeway.

361
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,860
What is it?

362
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,860
A taxi.

363
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,860
Go home.

364
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,860
What are you doing?

365
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,860
Take my taxi.

366
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,860
I'm so angry.

367
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,860
Who's playing this?

368
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,860
You're a fool.

369
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,860
Why are you here again?

370
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,860
Do you want to see the victim of the accident?

371
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,860
No matter what you threaten, I won't go back.

372
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,860
I'm here to talk to you.

373
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,860
Just a second.

374
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:51,860
I had a dream to give you the promise you gave your grandfather.

375
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,860
I hoped you would become a good doctor.

376
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,860
But I realized that everything was my greed.

377
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,860
If you want to leave me, do it.

378
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,860
My father lost.

379
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,860
What should I do?

380
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,860
I can quit.

381
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,860
I've been thinking about it a lot since you left home.

382
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,860
It's the best decision for me to be a father.

383
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,860
I'm sorry for not knowing your heart.

384
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,860
Are you serious?

385
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,860
Your mother died and you're the only one for me.

386
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:42,860
If you lose, what kind of a small business will you have?

387
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,860
If you want to do music, do it.

388
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,860
Instead, do it properly.

389
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,860
Don't do anything like a band in front of school or a water line.

390
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,860
I officially joined the big company.

391
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,860
I'm sorry.

392
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,860
I'm sorry.

393
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,860
I'm sorry.

394
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,860
Don't do anything like that.

395
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,860
I officially joined the big company and got support.

396
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,860
He's the top.

397
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,860
Never try your life.

398
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,860
Then my father will oppose and support you.

399
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,860
You like to be a band?

400
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,860
You said that.

401
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,860
I was the happiest when I was in the mood.

402
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:34,860
I'm happy only for you, but I'm not greedy.

403
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,860
Jo-en, Jo-en, Tae-en.

404
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,860
My family is quite big.

405
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,860
I'm looking for three more members in the ground.

406
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,860
If you're going, I'll be right.

407
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,860
Are you going to go into the place where you fell for a scam?

408
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,860
There's nothing to oppose.

409
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,860
Even if your father didn't oppose, you would have become the first member of the dark realm.

410
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,860
When did that happen?

411
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,860
The band I'm working on now.

412
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,860
I like it.

413
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,860
I don't want to leave or go to the scam.

414
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,860
I'm going to go back to your place.

415
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,860
The scam? It was originally yours.

416
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,860
That's it. Thank you.

417
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,860
Thank you for your hard work. Let's go to the next participant.

418
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,860
Hello, I'm 35 minutes from the participant number.

419
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,860
Please start.

420
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,860
That's it. Thank you.

421
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,860
Let's put the ball on.

422
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,860
Hello, I'm 35 minutes from the participant number.

423
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,860
I'm honored to be able to support you in the crowd trainee audition.

424
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,860
The position you're confident in is a vocal and rhythm guitar.

425
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,860
You're Tae-young, right?

426
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,860
Son Ho-dong.

427
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,860
That audition.

428
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,860
It was your talent that was selected as your 100,000.

429
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,860
That was also the first place.

430
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,860
If you didn't give up, you couldn't even be a member of the crowd.

431
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,860
Instead, it was the last time you joined the group.

432
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,860
I can't say anything more.

433
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,860
Sit down.

434
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,860
Tae-young.

435
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,860
Tae-young.

436
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,860
I'm so full of energy.

437
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,860
I can't live. I'm here.

438
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,860
Are you okay?

439
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,860
It's a matter of time.

440
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,860
I'm going to be in a good mood today.

441
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,860
Don't think about anything else.

442
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,860
You're going to be in a good mood today.

443
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,860
How old are you?

444
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,860
You can't play alone. Am I a cedar?

445
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,860
I can't see you.

446
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,860
I'm a basic dog.

447
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,860
Who is your mom?

448
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,860
Please open the door.

449
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,860
What is it?

450
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,860
What do you need so much for your eyes?

451
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,860
I'm a pillow.

452
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,860
I can't give up on my eyelashes even when I go to trash bags.

453
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,860
I don't know about pillows.

454
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,860
How about this?

455
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,860
This is a little meta.

456
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,860
No, no, no.

457
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,860
I think I look good with glush.

458
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,860
So I'm going to live or not.

459
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,860
Do you want to put on all 100?

460
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
You can put on it too.

461
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,860
Are you going to cut it?

462
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,860
There's a cctv.

463
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,860
There's no one here.

464
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
What do you think?

465
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,860
What's the 20-year-old tail of a man's dream?

466
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,860
What is this color?

467
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,860
Doesn't it look like a kiss?

468
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,860
What are you doing?

469
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,860
Oh, my.

470
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,860
You've never kissed.

471
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,860
Your lips are so thick that you're going to die.

472
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,860
I'm not going to kiss.

473
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,860
What are you going to do?

474
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,860
Huh?

475
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,860
Did you kiss?

476
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,860
Who did you kiss?

477
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,860
Eli?

478
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,860
Where did you meet?

479
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,860
Did you meet at Metaverse?

480
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,860
Hey, try this on.

481
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,860
Oh, my.

482
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,860
I think it's a little more colorful.

483
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,860
I'm hungry because I'm shopping.

484
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,860
What do you want to eat?

485
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,860
I especially cut a big heart today.

486
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,860
I spent all my money.

487
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,860
You have money, don't you?

488
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,860
No.

489
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,860
You got an album.

490
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,860
Bomi, when you're done with that, buy me a back-up.

491
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,860
I haven't eaten for a hundred years.

492
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,860
I'm a thousand years old.

493
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,860
You're not even a human.

494
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,860
Then do you want to eat a pig?

495
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,860
You've been on social media these days.

496
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,860
You haven't been there, either, have you?

497
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,860
Wasn't it fun?

498
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,860
I was so tired and I smelled bread.

499
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,860
I held my hand.

500
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,860
Hey, you can shoot this much.

501
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,860
Go, go, shoot.

502
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,860
I'm afraid of seeing you with my eyes.

503
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,860
Can I go back to you?

504
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,860
I'll go.

505
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,860
I'm sorry.

506
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,860
How are you?

507
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,860
Are you okay?

508
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,860
Mr. Chung, are you doing well?

509
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,860
I think it's going to be so good.

510
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,860
I'm going to get better at it.

511
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,860
Everyone, hurry up.

512
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,860
Yes.

513
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,860
Oh, I'm here.

514
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,860
I'm recording a paper.

515
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,860
I'm recording a paper.

516
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,860
I'm recording a paper.

517
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,860
I'm recording a paper.

518
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,860
I was out of my mind to record a paper.

519
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,860
You're good at recording.

520
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,860
Yes, it's better than the old days.

521
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:26,860
I think it would be a crisis if I put a piece of paper on my shoulder and made a music video.

522
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,860
I heard the four of them went to the scene.

523
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,860
Take a deep breath.

524
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,860
What happened to the new member's last work?

525
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,860
I'll release it from the album and slowly.

526
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,860
I have to hurry up.

527
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,860
Why?

528
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,860
Do you have someone to recommend?

529
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,860
My son.

530
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,860
Tae-young?

531
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,860
Do you want to do this?

532
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,860
I have to do it.

533
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,860
I'll hold onto Tae-young somehow and write it down.

534
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,860
Even if she's the leader.

535
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:01,860
If you just come, it'll be an issue.

536
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,860
I'm a doctor who's been to the hospital for a week.

537
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,860
Why did your mind change?

538
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,860
I heard you were going to raise a third-degree doctor even if you died.

539
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,860
Yes.

540
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,860
I'll do my best to solve this.

541
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:27,860
As long as the four of them work that day, how can I see them going to the field?

542
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:33,860
By the way, why did the four of them go to the accident?

543
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,860
I have nothing to ask.

544
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,860
I'm sure there's no evidence of that.

545
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,860
How can I be sure?

546
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,860
If it was there, everything would have been lost and threatened.

547
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,860
There was nothing for six years.

548
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,860
We don't care what you change or what you listen to.

549
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,860
We just have to come back to what we didn't have.

550
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,860
So don't be scared.

551
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,860
If you're scared, you lose.

552
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,860
It's as easy as that.

553
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:11,860
If it wasn't for us, we wouldn't have been able to do anything great.

554
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:17,860
That's why we used our ears and succeeded.

555
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,860
Okay.

556
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,860
Tell me.

557
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,860
Hey, you!

558
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,860
What's wrong with you?

559
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,860
Why didn't you answer the phone while you were doing your job?

560
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,860
What were you doing all day?

561
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,860
I was just doing my job.

562
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,860
You crazy bastard.

563
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,860
Do you know how worried Bomi is?

564
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,860
All night long.

565
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,860
Why isn't she coming home?

566
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,860
Where is she?

567
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,860
I don't know.

568
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,860
I don't know.

569
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,860
Why isn't she coming home?

570
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,860
Where is she?

571
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,860
Manager's house.

572
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,860
Is that so expensive?

573
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,860
Someone might chase after you.

574
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,860
I told Bomi that I drank and got her out of there.

575
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,860
Is Bomi okay?

576
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,860
If you're worried, come and see for yourself.

577
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,860
Call her right away.

578
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,860
It's just one time to see her at the hospital.

579
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,860
What are you doing with the light on?

580
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,860
Hey.

581
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:40,860
If you were worried about me, what would you do?

582
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,860
What?

583
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,860
Did you drink?

584
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:48,860
I don't know if he'll get hurt later, but I'm sure he'll get sick.

585
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,860
Is it right to be next to him?

586
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,860
I'm sorry.

587
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,860
I've lived 10 years more than I am.

588
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,860
You don't have to live that much.

589
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,860
You should leave me alone.

590
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,860
What are you looking at?

591
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,860
You're going to kill me twice.

592
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,860
I know.

593
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,860
I think you have enough time to get rid of him.

594
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,860
I can't even eat and drink.

595
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,860
I'm sorry.

596
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,860
I'm sorry.

597
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,860
I'm sorry.

598
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,860
I'm sorry.

599
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,860
I'm sorry.

600
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,860
I can't eat and drink.

601
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,860
I'm not good at dancing.

602
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,860
Did you have a problem?

603
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,860
I'm sorry.

604
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,860
I'm sorry.

605
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,860
I'm sorry.

606
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,860
I'm sorry.

607
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,860
I'm sorry.

608
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,860
I'm sorry.

609
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,860
I'm sorry.

610
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,860
I'm sorry.

611
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,860
What?

612
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,860
When did you come in?

613
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,860
I was so tired of the anniversary.

614
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,860
Six years ago.

615
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,860
I'm a member of the founding council.

616
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,860
What's the matter?

617
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,860
Have you ever...

618
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,860
Have you ever been in a traffic accident?

619
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,860
The CEO of the traffic accident?

620
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,860
No, I've never been in a traffic accident.

621
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,860
What did Secretary Kang say?

622
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,860
He said he couldn't drive at all.

623
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,860
He said he was a driver.

624
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,860
Do you remember seeing the CEO six years ago?

625
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,860
I don't know.

626
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,860
I don't know.

627
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,860
So?

628
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,860
What was it?

629
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,860
I changed my mind.

630
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,860
Wasn't it the SUV?

631
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,860
The black or gray.

632
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,860
I can't see the color clearly.

633
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,860
I saw the light.

634
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,860
I saw the roof box.

635
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,860
How do you look at the CEO's car six years ago?

636
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,860
You didn't even come to the company.

637
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,860
You still haven't heard it.

638
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,860
Don't ask anything.

639
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,860
Please check it.

640
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,860
I have to find out what the CEO's car is.

641
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,860
I can do it.

642
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,860
I can do it.

643
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,860
Okay, I'll check it.

644
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,860
Who's the boss?

645
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,860
Who's the boss?

646
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,860
Are you mad?

647
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,860
What's wrong with the number?

648
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,860
What's wrong?

649
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,860
What's the number?

650
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,860
Just show up.

651
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,860
I'll never look at you.

652
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,860
I'm not looking at you.

653
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,860
Good morning.

654
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,860
You're up early.

655
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,860
You look happy.

656
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,860
It's cold.

657
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,860
Where are you going?

658
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,860
To see someone.

659
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,860
Oh, you said you were going on a trip.

660
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,860
I was so excited to see you on the way.

661
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,860
I still have a lot of work to do.

662
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,860
Oh, right.

663
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,860
Oh, right.

664
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,860
To Sage.

665
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,860
We haven't practiced for too long.

666
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,860
Shall we practice here while we can't use the club room?

667
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,860
Here?

668
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,860
Yes.

669
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,860
It's exciting.

670
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,860
I'll open the club room.

671
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,860
I'll practice from 5 o'clock today.

672
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,860
You have to call Sage.

673
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,860
I don't have any contact.

674
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,860
I guess I'm busy.

675
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,860
I'm going to see Sage now.

676
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,860
Do you want to go with me?

677
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,860
Where's Sage?

678
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,860
I want to go, too.

679
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,860
Bye.

680
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,860
You son of a bitch.

681
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,860
Hey, Sage, you!

682
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,860
Sage.

683
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,860
You're so mean.

684
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,860
Let's practice again at my home.

685
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,860
See you later.

686
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,860
Don't be late.

687
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,860
I'm going to the club.

688
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,860
I'm going to the club.

689
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,860
I'm going to the club.

690
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,860
I'm going to the club.

691
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,860
I'm going to the club.

692
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,860
I'm going to the club.

693
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,860
I'm going to the club.

694
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,860
I'm going to the club.

695
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,860
I'm going to the club.

696
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,860
I'm going to the club.

697
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,860
I'm going to the club.

698
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,860
I'm going to the club.

699
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,860
I'm going to the club.

700
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,860
I'm going to the club.

701
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,860
I'm going to quit the band.

702
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,860
Why?

703
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,860
I just got bored.

704
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,860
I didn't want to do it.

705
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:07,860
Did you feel pressured to make a contract?

706
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,860
Then you don't have to do it.

707
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,860
I didn't want to do it.

708
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,860
I made the band.

709
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,860
I can break it.

710
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,860
That song...

711
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,860
You said you'd sing it for me.

712
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,860
What's the reason for this?

713
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,860
I told you.

714
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,860
I'm sorry.

715
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,860
I'm sorry.

716
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,860
I'm sorry.

717
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,860
I'm sorry.

718
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,860
I'm sorry.

719
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,860
I'm sorry.

720
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,860
I'm sorry.

721
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,860
I'm sorry.

722
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,860
It's a meaningful song for you.

723
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,860
Don't wait for the rehearsal.

724
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,860
I'm not going.

725
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,860
I'm going to quit the band.

726
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,860
Bye.

727
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:17,260
It's just your photo.

728
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,260
I told you.

729
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,260
You're not going to treat Bomi like a fool.

730
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,260
Don't treat her lightly.

731
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,260
You didn't know?

732
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,260
I usually meet women easily.

733
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,260
What?

734
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,260
The deep one.

735
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,260
It's just a twig.

736
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,260
I'm not going to do it.

737
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,260
I'm not going to do it.

738
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,260
I'm not going to do it.

739
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,260
I'm not going to do it.

740
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,260
I'm not going to do it.

741
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,260
I'm not going to do it.

742
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,260
Why did you do that?

743
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,260
I should have done it better for you.

744
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,260
What are you doing?

745
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,260
You made a band to play with me?

746
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,260
You're not that good?

747
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,260
I don't think you're good at music.

748
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,260
I don't even have the right to meet Bomi.

749
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,260
Don't show up in front of her again.

750
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,260
Give me your hand then.

751
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:20,540
She came to meet Lee Mun-jer

752
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:40,880
Why did someone call this  아

753
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
Oh, my.

754
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,880
A giant turtle?

755
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,880
You're a real turtle?

756
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,880
I'm not a turtle. I'm a friend of a turtle.

757
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
But why did you come out of the turtle's house?

758
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
I slept here yesterday.

759
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
Oh, really?

760
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,880
Then did you wake up too?

761
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
No, I'm sleeping. Come later.

762
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,880
I learned that it's not polite to come to a husband's house from time to time.

763
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,880
Hey, you said you're going to practice here today.

764
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,880
I came to get some breakfast before I practice.

765
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
No?

766
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,880
I can't sleep in the club room.

767
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
Why are you talking to me?

768
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,880
Who's going to be angry at me?

769
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,880
You can't be so greedy for a member.

770
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,880
You said you went out of the house.

771
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,880
I'll give you a new job while you're not in the room.

772
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,880
It's okay, right?

773
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,880
Oh, who's going to do it?

774
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,880
My mom won't be a burden.

775
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,880
It's okay.

776
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,880
The turtle will tell you well.

777
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,880
You're not a turtle.

778
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,880
I'm going to open my eyes.

779
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,880
I'm going to open my eyes.

780
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,880
Hey, where are you going?

781
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,880
It's not safe.

782
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,880
I like the turtle better.

783
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
Can you give me a turtle when you see the next scene?

784
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,880
Oh, by the way, I'm more of a meat eater than a vegetable.

785
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,880
I have to have a fish and egg in each dish.

786
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,880
There's a knife over there.

787
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,880
What are you doing?

788
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,880
Do you know what a water-based meal this is?

789
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,880
Why water-based meal?

790
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,880
You're a fraud.

791
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Just think of me as a fraud.

792
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,880
You're not a fraud.

793
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,880
Why should I think like that?

794
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
I've never thought of a family like you.

795
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,880
Tae-yang looks lonely.

796
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,880
There are eight friends in the universe.

797
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,880
Without a roommate.

798
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,880
You said you were sleeping alone in the kitchen.

799
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,880
Yeah, why are you worried about that?

800
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,880
Of course I'm worried because I'm your friend.

801
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
Oh, Kyul-i.

802
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,880
Where did you get that knife?

803
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,880
I don't even get a single penny from you.

804
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,880
I grew up on your mom's level.

805
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,880
I'm going to pay for it right away.

806
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,880
I'll get it first.

807
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,880
Hey, get rid of my photo right away.

808
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,880
Hey, hey, hey.

809
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,880
This is not your photo.

810
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,880
It's your friend's photo.

811
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,880
I don't have a date when I come out like this.

812
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,880
I saw it all.

813
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
What?

814
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,880
You said you were going to the car in the morning.

815
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,880
I'm a fraud.

816
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,880
You were dead, right?

817
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,880
You were going to the car shop to get your body, right?

818
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,880
Body? Me?

819
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,880
Yeah, you're right.

820
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,880
I was in the school club room, I was in the bathroom, I was washing.

821
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,880
I was wearing that dirty nightclothes in the middle of the summer.

822
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,880
It's a lie.

823
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,880
What's the point of being so stubborn?

824
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,880
Oh, no.

825
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,880
Is it a way to kill me even if I'm a bean?

826
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,880
My face is completely gone.

827
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,880
Why are you looking at my face?

828
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,880
Hey.

829
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,880
More than this.

830
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,880
Get off me.

831
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,880
Get off me.

832
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,880
Please get rid of me.

833
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,880
Oh.

834
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,880
Today's band practice.

835
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,880
I'm going to cancel it.

836
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,880
I'm hungry.

837
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,880
Aren't you hungry?

838
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,880
Yes.

839
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,880
Hey.

840
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,880
I'm so sick of alcohol.

841
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,880
I've been working so hard these days.

842
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,880
I guess I'm not a good person.

843
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,880
I'm a baby.

844
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,880
Eat some snacks.

845
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,880
What snacks?

846
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,880
I'm stressed out.

847
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,880
I'm going to put it in a good alcohol.

848
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,880
Drink slowly.

849
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,880
You're drunk.

850
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,880
Bo-ma, shall I show you something fun?

851
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,880
What do you mean?

852
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,880
It's fun to see it.

853
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,880
What the hell are you doing?

854
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,880
Look.

855
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,880
One, two.

856
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,880
It's been a while.

857
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,880
Wait a minute.

858
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,880
Ta-da.

859
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,880
I knew you'd do that.

860
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,880
What?

861
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,880
You're so funny.

862
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,880
I'm not even doing it.

863
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,880
What?

864
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,880
What?

865
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,880
What's wrong?

866
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,880
What's wrong with you?

867
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,880
I'm not doing it.

868
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,880
What?

869
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,880
What?

870
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,880
What the hell?

871
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,880
What's that?

872
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,880
What's that?

873
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,880
What the hell?

874
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,880
What's that?

875
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,880
What's that?

876
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,880
What the hell are you doing?

877
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,880
I'm not doing it.

878
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,880
What the hell?

879
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,880
I'm sorry.

880
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,880
I'm sorry.

881
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,880
You're so kind.

882
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,880
I'm sorry.

883
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,880
What's wrong with us?

884
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,880
What?

885
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,880
Tell me.

886
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,880
Hold it.

887
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,880
Did you do it before?

888
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,880
Oh, my.

889
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,880
What?

890
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,880
What do you want?

891
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,880
I'm so sorry.

892
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,880
I'm sorry.

893
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,880
Mom.

894
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,880
Mom.

895
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,880
What's wrong with you?

896
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,880
Mom, let's go home.

897
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,880
Let's go home.

898
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,880
One, two, three.

899
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,880
Let's go.

900
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,880
Sir.

901
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,880
Sir, please pay the bill.

902
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,880
Here, too.

903
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,880
We'll go in.

904
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,880
Goodbye.

905
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,880
Goodbye.

906
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,880
That's right.

907
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,880
Dad.

908
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,880
I'm sorry.

909
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,880
I'm sorry.

910
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,880
I'm sorry.

911
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,880
I'm sorry.

912
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,880
I'll go slowly.

913
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,880
Are you crying?

914
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,880
Thank you.

915
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,880
Thank you for today.

916
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,880
I laughed at the house.

917
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,880
I wish you laughed.

918
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,880
You can talk.

919
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,880
You can do it again.

920
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,880
No, don't do it again.

921
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,880
If you do it one more time,

922
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,880
I'll kill you.

923
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,880
How can you laugh at me like that?

924
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,880
Dad.

925
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,880
Did you...

926
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,880
Did I make you laugh?

927
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,880
Why did I cry?

928
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,880
I even got a tongue-tied.

929
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,880
Hey, you.

930
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,880
You should practice more.

931
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,880
Why are you so upset?

932
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,880
Do you know how hard it is to react?

933
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,880
The customers are all grown up.

934
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,880
Let's go.

935
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,880
I'm done drinking.

936
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,880
Hey.

937
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,880
But it was so fast to run away.

938
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,880
I admit that.

939
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,880
Hey, Kim Bum.

940
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,880
You're not coming?

941
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,880
Hey.

942
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,880
Hey.

943
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,880
Okay, okay.

944
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,880
Sorry.

945
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,880
I'm sorry.

946
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,880
Did I ever tell you

947
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,880
that I like you?

948
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,880
What?

949
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,880
I like you.

950
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,880
From middle school to now.

951
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,880
I've never done it.

952
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,880
I've never done it.

953
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,880
I like you too.

954
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,880
You're back.

955
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,880
How much do you trust me?

956
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,880
You've always been like a brother to me.

957
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,880
Not like a brother.

958
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,880
Can't you look at me differently now?

959
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,880
I can't do it.

960
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,880
I can't do it.

961
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,880
I have someone I like.

962
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,880
Don't like it.

963
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,880
I don't like you being hurt.

964
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,880
I don't like you being hurt.

965
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,880
I don't like you being hurt.

966
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,880
I can decide who I like.

967
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,880
I don't want you to be involved in that.

968
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,880
I don't want to be involved in that.

969
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,880
Do you love me?

970
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,960
Meanwhile.

971
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:44,960
Romeo?

972
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:50,720
Don't move!

973
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,720
What are you doing?

974
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,720
Shall we talk about it properly?

975
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,720
Are you crazy?

976
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,720
You have to go to the police station to get your mind off me.

977
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,720
You're not a top star anymore.

978
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,720
Just follow me.

979
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,720
I'm giving you one more chance as a last resort.

980
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,720
But at least one time...

981
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,720
Because you called me dad.

982
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,720
That day, I was a little bit worried.

983
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,720
I was worried about you.

984
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,720
I was worried about you.

985
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,720
I was the one who called you dad.

986
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,720
Tell me why you ran away that day.

987
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,720
You could have saved me!

988
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,720
Be sure that she has no evidence.

989
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,720
No matter what she saw or heard, we won't care.

990
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,720
We just have to come back to what we didn't have.

991
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,720
Yeah, there's no evidence.

992
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,720
So don't be so selfish.

993
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,720
What kind of a big deal is a contract that doesn't seem like a lot every time?

994
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,720
If you want to threaten me, do it properly.

995
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,720
Bring me the evidence!

996
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,720
You just protected the black box.

997
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,720
Do you know that's what you're saying?

998
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,720
I see.

999
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,720
Thank you for the evidence.

1000
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,720
Let's report if you're done with today's work.

1001
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,720
Oh, you drove yourself?

1002
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,720
There was a report.

1003
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,720
I guess you're pretty confident in driving.

1004
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,720
What?

1005
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,720
What happened to Taehyung?

1006
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,720
You want to join the crowd?

1007
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,720
If you do that, I'll risk my life and raise Taehyung.

1008
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,720
I don't want to think about it.

1009
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,720
I'm just an artist.

1010
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,720
Where are you going?

1011
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,720
What? Did you bring your phone?

1012
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,720
Uh...

1013
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,720
Just...

1014
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,720
Did you remember that day?

1015
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,720
I still feel like I'm in the first day of my new medical school.

1016
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,720
I don't want to make that mistake again.

1017
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,720
I don't want to be a mental disorder.

1018
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,720
Is this it?

1019
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,720
Didn't you know?

1020
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,720
I was so busy in the office that I went to the hospital.

1021
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,720
I'm going to the US on the day of the surgery.

1022
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,720
I'm so sick.

1023
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,720
I thought you were being rude and you were so scared.

1024
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,720
I'm so sick.

1025
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,720
I'm so sick.

1026
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,720
I'm so sick.

1027
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,720
I'm so sick.

1028
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,720
I'm so sick.

1029
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,720
Saki!

1030
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,720
Mom, I'm in a hurry.

1031
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,720
Saki...

1032
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,720
I'm in a hurry.

1033
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,720
Mom, why did you turn off the light?

1034
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,720
Is it night now?

1035
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,720
There's no way out of the hospital.

1036
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,720
It's a relief that you didn't get hurt.

1037
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,720
If you did something wrong, I would have lived in the hospital.

1038
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,720
That's all.

1039
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,720
Even if you live well, you're a good boy.

1040
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,720
Let's go.

1041
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,720
You're a good boy?

1042
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,720
Me?

1043
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,720
Oh, you asked me to look for you.

1044
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,720
CEO SUV.

1045
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,720
Yeah.

1046
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,720
I didn't.

1047
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,720
CEO never rode SUVs.

1048
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,720
I checked the vehicle team.

1049
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,720
No way.

1050
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,720
It's cold. Let's go in.

1051
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,720
Then that car isn't CEO's car?

1052
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,720
No.

1053
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,720
What's wrong?

1054
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,720
What's wrong with you, CEO?

1055
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,720
What's wrong?

1056
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,720
You're sick, right?

1057
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,720
Eat before you go to the hospital.

1058
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,720
And I bought you a phone.

1059
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,720
I'm fine.

1060
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,720
I'm fine.

1061
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,720
I made a mistake and broke it.

1062
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,720
Why do you buy my phone?

1063
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,720
I'm grateful for your kind heart.

1064
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,720
But I don't think I can get my phone or my heart right now.

1065
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,720
I'm sorry.

1066
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,720
I have class early, so I'll go to school first.

1067
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,720
I'm sorry.

1068
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,720
I'm sorry.

1069
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,720
I'm sorry.

1070
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,720
I'm sorry.

1071
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,720
I'm sorry.

1072
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,720
I'm sorry.

1073
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,720
I'm sorry.

1074
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,720
I'm sorry.

1075
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,720
What's wrong?

1076
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:05,720
I didn't want to be happy, but my phone is in a good condition.

1077
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:15,720
If you heard that, I'm sorry.

1078
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:40,720
I'll give it to you so that you can have a good time in a bigger water.

1079
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,720
What should I do?

1080
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:48,720
You can't let go of your heart and avoid my dream.

1081
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:57,720
Is this all I can do for you?

1082
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,720
Tae Yang, did you hear me?

1083
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,720
I just called Bomi.

1084
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:13,720
Bomi...

1085
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,720
What are you doing?

1086
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,720
Did you break the band?

1087
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,720
The person who made it is going to break it.

1088
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,720
There's no 4th. What does 2 4th mean?

1089
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:29,720
Why did you suddenly throw us out?

1090
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,720
You're crazy.

1091
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,720
I'm not crazy.

1092
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,720
Where is he now?

1093
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,720
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

1094
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,720
We can't even perform at school anyway.

1095
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,720
What is the goal of a team that can't even do it on stage?

1096
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,720
That's it.

1097
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,720
No vocals.

1098
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,720
Is it important to you to be a fraud?

1099
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,720
We're not doing anything.

1100
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,720
Our band is just a fraud?

1101
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,720
I'm here to do it.

1102
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,720
Go on a path that's more solid.

1103
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:07,720
Don't get caught.

1104
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,720
I'm sorry.

1105
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,720
I'm sorry.

1106
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,720
I'm sorry.

1107
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,720
I'm sorry.

1108
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,720
I'm sorry.

1109
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,720
I'm sorry.

1110
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:23,720
I have an innovation like that, so I even wrote it in 3D.

1111
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,720
I thought there was value in that.

1112
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:33,720
Don't you agree to it if you want to break the band?

1113
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,720
I never agree.

1114
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,720
Esoka.

1115
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:45,080
This isn'tthe future.

1116
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,580
I guess this is all....

1117
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,420
Hey...

1118
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:54,500
Beaum.

1119
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,120
Why did you send me down here!

1120
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,440
Did you hit the head on home- quiering again?

1121
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,600
Who'd be in such a big overità?

1122
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,880
When adorable, why do they pick up the kids?

1123
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,380
What?

1124
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,760
Think of it as a letter from Hanju.

1125
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,880
There's no one to take it.

1126
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:27,880
Is this what I said yesterday?

1127
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:30,580
That's...

1128
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:31,080
No.

1129
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,680
It's because I'm tired.

1130
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,880
I guess I was confused.

1131
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,180
I was mistaken that I could do anything well.

1132
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:44,080
My idea.

1133
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,180
It was a dream that never came true.

1134
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,180
I want you to...

1135
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,080
Do what you want to do and live.

1136
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,680
Don't waste your time following me.

1137
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:11,880
I love you by myself.

1138
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,880
Should I send you more pictures?

1139
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,880
My love

1140
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,880
Would you look back?

1141
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,880
Would you look back?

1142
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,880
Or I won't send you pictures.

1143
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,880
I always tell myself

1144
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,880
Thank you for getting me here.

1145
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,880
No, it's not like that.

1146
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,880
I'm thinking about my father's son.

1147
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,880
What do you think I'm saying?

1148
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,880
I must have been too greedy.

1149
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,880
I'm sorry.

1150
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,880
I'm glad you're here.

1151
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,880
Please let me know if you need me.

1152
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:23,880
Ma'am.

1153
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,880
What is it, sir?

1154
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,880
I'm going to get new things from the office.

1155
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,880
Clean up the place.

1156
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,880
Hurry up.

1157
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,880
Yes, sir.

1158
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,880
I'm going to get new things from the office.

1159
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,880
I'm sorry.

1160
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,880
What's wrong?

1161
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,880
I'm going to go home.

1162
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,880
Okay.

1163
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:26,880
I'm going to bed.

1164
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,880
I've been waiting for you.

1165
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,880
I'm going to hold you tight.

1166
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,880
I love you.

1167
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:39,880
Let's start a new day.

1168
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,880
Oh, my.

1169
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,880
What's wrong with you?

1170
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,880
This.

1171
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,880
What?

1172
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,880
What song is this?

1173
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,880
Oh, this song.

1174
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:54,880
It's a 12 o'clock comeback song.

1175
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:55,880
Isn't it good?

1176
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,880
Isn't it so good?

1177
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,880
I'm sorry.

1178
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,880
When did you steal my song?

1179
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,880
Did I steal it?

1180
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,880
You might have stolen it from me

1181
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,880
when I went to the office without any plan.

1182
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,880
I'll use it.

1183
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,880
I can't believe you.

1184
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,880
Because I'm the only one who knows this song.

1185
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:47,880
That's yours.

1186
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,880
So keep your life.

1187
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:50,880
I'll hold you until the end.

1188
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:51,880
I can't take it.

1189
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:52,880
I'll help you.

1190
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,880
Let's prove it together.

1191
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,880
Does it matter what happens?

1192
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,880
You're not going to see it.

1193
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,880
I'm sorry.
