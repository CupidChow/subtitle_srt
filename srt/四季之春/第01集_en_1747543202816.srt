1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,200
When opening of the album cover drums hadi

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:26,320
This is the cover of song I will keep my heart

3
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,040
They became more excited to be on the stage

4
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,360
Now, the real Ну Rent

5
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,840
The future who limit the details

6
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,060
The future who limit the details

7
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,060
I'm walking on the street

8
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,060
We drive on hot hate

9
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,060
Yeah na na na

10
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,060
The sirens are ringing

11
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,060
I'm running to you

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,060
Yeah na na na

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,060
I keep getting better

14
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,060
I keep getting better

15
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,060
Oh wake it up

16
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,060
I got you

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,060
Oh wake it up

18
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,060
I'm looking for everything

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,060
I'm looking for you

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,060
Honey!

21
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,060
Move!

22
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,060
Move!

23
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,060
Mom

24
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,060
Why did you turn off the light?

25
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,060
Is it night time?

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,060
Unfortunately, there is no other way but to be in a coma

27
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,060
Mom, no

28
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,060
Where are you going to eat?

29
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,060
I'm going to sing, mom

30
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,060
I'm really okay, mom

31
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,060
I'm okay, mom

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,060
It's okay, Sage

33
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,060
I'm really okay, mom

34
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,060
My name is Sage

35
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,060
I'm the leader of The Crown

36
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,060
I'm very lucky

37
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,060
I have the brightest and brightest jewel-like eyes in the universe

38
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,060
I've never seen a more beautiful eye than mine

39
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,060
People say I'm a blessed child

40
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,060
I'm a child of God's blessing

41
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,060
As a result, I became a top star in Korea

42
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,060
No, a world-class top star

43
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,060
I'm a star

44
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,060
I'm a star

45
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,060
I'm a star

46
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,060
I'm a star

47
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,060
I'm a star

48
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,060
I'm a star

49
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,060
I'm a star

50
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,060
I'm a star

51
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,060
I'm a star

52
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,060
I'm a star

53
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,060
I'm a star

54
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,060
I'm a star

55
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,060
I'm a star

56
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,060
I'm a star

57
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,060
I'm a star

58
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,060
I'm a star

59
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,060
I just heard a great news

60
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,060
What is it?

61
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,060
Don't be surprised

62
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,060
The crown is ranked first on the world music chart

63
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,060
Shout out!

64
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,060
It's all thanks to the crowns

65
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,060
It's possible because of you

66
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,060
Thank you, you know?

67
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,060
I love you guys so much

68
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,060
LUPIN's check-up

69
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,060
Check-up!

70
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,060
I'm the top star!

71
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,060
I'm sorry, boss

72
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,060
It's all thanks to you

73
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,060
Where's Shinhwa?

74
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,060
She must have found a useful song

75
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,060
You know, if you like something, you dig into it

76
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,060
Mr. Kim Bum?

77
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,060
I'm Jo Jin-ah, the producer of Jo Hyeon-jae Entertainment

78
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,060
I like your song

79
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,060
Let's make a contract

80
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,060
See you at my office at 9 a.m. tomorrow

81
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,060
Attention!

82
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,060
Who wants to bet on this watch and bet on cocktails with me?

83
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,060
Come on!

84
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,060
Play! Play!

85
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,060
Put your hands up!

86
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,060
Hold on!

87
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,060
Let's go all the way until the end

88
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,060
Yes, yes!

89
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,060
Yes, yes!

90
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,060
Are you okay?

91
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,060
I'm fine

92
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,060
Are you okay?

93
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,060
Jo Hyeon-jae

94
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,060
This... this melody...

95
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,060
I often dream

96
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,060
A colorful and dynamic dream

97
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,060
Every time I dream, I see a child with the melody

98
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,060
I'm sorry

99
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,060
I'm sorry

100
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,060
I'm sorry

101
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,060
I'm sorry

102
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,060
I'm sorry

103
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,060
I'm sorry

104
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,060
I'm sorry

105
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,060
It's that time again

106
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,060
5 a.m. 45 minutes

107
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,060
If it's exactly this time, I'll wake up from sleep

108
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,060
I'm sorry

109
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,060
I can't believe I didn't open the door

110
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,060
I'm sorry

111
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,060
Perfect

112
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,060
Wow

113
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,060
Oh my gosh!

114
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,060
Did you come in without a notice?

115
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,060
We promised to have each other's etiquette

116
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,060
So why aren't you picking up?

117
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,060
So why aren't you picking up?

118
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,060
I'm not supposed to have a schedule today

119
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,960
I... I hit Mr. Jo with a nuclear weapon?

120
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,960
You really don't remember?

121
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,600
This is what's going on right now!

122
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,100
This crazy bastard...

123
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,900
Is really me?

124
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,600
Mr. Jo, are you okay?

125
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,240
He's in the hospital.

126
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
Hospital?

127
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,140
Why are you so worried?

128
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,980
This video is all over social media.

129
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,980
You're like a king, you punk!

130
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,880
What did I do to you?

131
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,040
I...

132
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,420
It's Sangin!

133
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,820
Wait a minute.

134
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,980
We'll be right there.

135
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,980
Thank you.

136
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,980
Wait a minute.

137
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,660
We'll be right there. Wait a minute.

138
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,020
Wait a minute.

139
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,860
Wait a minute.

140
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,100
This is...

141
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,980
What are you doing?

142
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,400
Don't go in there!

143
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,900
I'm sorry! Wait a minute.

144
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,240
Wait a minute.

145
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,580
Wait a minute.

146
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,820
Wait a minute.

147
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Wait a minute.

148
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,780
Wait a minute.

149
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,780
Wait a minute.

150
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,780
I'm late.

151
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:18,980
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,420
Kim Bum-soo?

153
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,860
You've been waiting a long time, haven't you?

154
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,620
It's okay.

155
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,900
As you know, the company's got a problem.

156
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:32,900
I was in a meeting and came out for a moment.

157
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,380
It's a contract.

158
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,780
At the moment of the contract, all these songs will be arrested.

159
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,540
I can't claim that Kim Bum-soo has any rights.

160
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,220
You can't make my song?

161
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,300
Why?

162
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,300
Instead, five times the songwriting fee received by a rookie composer.

163
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,780
It's a shocking deal.

164
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,780
But...

165
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,780
The directors called me.

166
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,780
Okay.

167
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,780
I'll leave the contract and go, so sign it and go.

168
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,780
As soon as you check, the songwriting fee will be paid in advance.

169
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:05,780
Then...

170
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:16,780
What's wrong with your shoulders?

171
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,780
Can you see?

172
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,780
No, I can't see.

173
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,780
Can you hear me?

174
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,780
No, I can't hear you.

175
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:30,780
Oh, my God.

176
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,780
How can you hit CEO Ju with your hands?

177
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,780
How can you hit CEO Ju with your hands?

178
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:41,780
The person I respect after my mom is CEO Ju.

179
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,780
You're crazy.

180
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,780
I'm going to throw up on the plate.

181
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,780
Are you going to die with that?

182
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,780
The total amount of food price for the video is 10 billion won.

183
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,780
In two hours.

184
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,780
It's a lie to say that I respect you.

185
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,780
You were totally crazy then.

186
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,780
I don't know. I don't remember.

187
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,780
I remember the coffee cocktail was crazy delicious.

188
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,780
I don't remember anything.

189
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,780
Please.

190
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,780
If you get caught, you'll get a prize.

191
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,780
You're so...

192
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:16,780
Hey, it's over.

193
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,780
Sister.

194
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:24,780
Follow me.

195
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,780
I'm going to be on a schedule without you for a while.

196
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,780
Stop the promotion and turn yourself in.

197
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,780
Sister.

198
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,780
It's my father's order.

199
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,780
Otherwise, things will get bigger.

200
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,780
The reporters are already asking about your name.

201
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,780
If it's a problem, it's a problem.

202
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,780
Our fans wanted to talk to us.

203
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,780
They want to feel friendly.

204
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,780
Don't you know how many people hate us?

205
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,780
Now, I'm going to be a big fan of you.

206
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,780
I'm even talking about the past of the other members.

207
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,780
No way.

208
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,780
My name has nothing to do with the members.

209
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,780
Why are you cursing at the innocent kids?

210
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,780
If you're worried about the members, you should turn yourself in.

211
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,780
You should go to school during the break.

212
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
School?

213
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,780
Hanju University?

214
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,780
Oh, right.

215
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,780
I'm a student at Hanju University.

216
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,780
I've never been to a school after I entered the school.

217
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,780
I totally forgot.

218
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,780
Until the press conference is over.

219
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,780
Show them how you really live in school.

220
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,780
Then I'll make you go back in a month or two.

221
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,780
Are you feeling better?

222
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,780
You're very angry, right?

223
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,780
Of course.

224
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,780
You were beaten up by a kid who raised you like a child.

225
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,780
Your father's pride and your ridiculous video have spread.

226
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,780
Okay, I'll do as you say.

227
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,780
I won't let the members get hurt.

228
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,780
If you're angry, I'll do anything.

229
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,780
Prepare a report that says you're going to the school

230
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,780
without a fraud in every schedule.

231
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,780
It's like a fraud investigation.

232
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,780
Yes, ma'am.

233
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,780
I'll be right there.

234
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,780
Exo is a normal person for a full option.

235
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,780
But please treat him with care.

236
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,780
Kim Bo.

237
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,780
Good job. Good job.

238
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,780
It hurts again.

239
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,780
It hurts again. It hurts again.

240
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,780
You can't get sick again, my nephew.

241
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,780
It's good for your health. You should make good music.

242
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,780
Oh, Chan is so mean.

243
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,780
He's so mean.

244
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,780
I'll give you a mackerel.

245
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,780
You're so pretty.

246
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,780
My mom caused the accident and you're the one who did the surgery.

247
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,780
You're so unlucky.

248
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,780
If I were you, I would've kicked you out and sprayed salt on you.

249
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,780
How can you not know what you're saying?

250
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,780
That's what you're saying.

251
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,780
Why did you hit me?

252
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,780
I ruined it.

253
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,780
I worked hard for two hours.

254
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,780
Oh, my.

255
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,780
Yes, yes.

256
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,780
Why do you need something?

257
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,780
I'm telling you.

258
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,780
If you get a loan or get into an accident again,

259
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,780
we won't see each other again.

260
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,780
We're leaving this house?

261
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,780
That's a big deal.

262
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,780
How can you say that to a poor doctor?

263
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,780
And to Pichu.

264
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,780
Pichu will live with his face.

265
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,780
We still have 5,000 left even if we pay 5,000.

266
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,780
If we don't, it'll be auctioned off.

267
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,780
We have to go out even if we don't want to.

268
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,780
Did you say I'm the only one who's eating well?

269
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,780
We're not trying to make a living.

270
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,780
You can't be so stingy.

271
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,780
You're right.

272
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,780
How can you say that so easily?

273
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,780
Are you T?

274
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,780
Yes. I'm T.

275
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,780
Don't touch me.

276
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,780
I'm not seeing you.

277
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,780
Why are you not giving me food?

278
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,780
Is it easier for me to eat?

279
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,780
I didn't do anything.

280
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,780
We should eat this when we're in trouble.

281
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,780
Do you want some seaweed or fried rice?

282
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,780
Seaweed.

283
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,780
Do you know how much I saved those songs

284
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,780
so I could sing them to people later?

285
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,780
Of course. Who would know if I didn't know?

286
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,780
Just eat it.

287
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,780
They're not Pichu's kids.

288
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,780
Right. They're not.

289
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,780
Wait. Be quiet.

290
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,780
Sanghyeon posted a post.

291
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,780
It's a fraud.

292
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,780
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

293
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,780
Everything is my fault and my fault.

294
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,780
I apologize to Mr. Jo Sanghyeon.

295
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,780
I apologize to my fans and our members.

296
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,780
I love and respect you, Mr. Jo.

297
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,780
I'm a fraud.

298
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,780
Whenever I lose my original intention,

299
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,780
I think of our first meeting.

300
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,780
You were my miracle.

301
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,780
That verse should be as powerful as a rock.

302
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,780
Mr. Jo.

303
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,780
Sit down.

304
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,780
Hold it.

305
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,780
When you fold the power cord,

306
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,780
use your pinky instead of your ring finger.

307
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,780
Then your hand shape and sound will be more natural.

308
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,780
Try it.

309
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,780
I think it's working.

310
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,780
This is it.

311
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,780
I think you practice every day.

312
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,780
Did someone tell you to do it?

313
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,780
No.

314
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,780
I can't find something that I can't handle.

315
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,780
I was the main dancer,

316
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,780
but I suddenly became a band member.

317
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,780
You have good muscle.

318
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,780
What's your name?

319
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,780
I'm Sage.

320
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,780
My last name is Sage.

321
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,780
Sage?

322
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,780
The Sage from Vivaldi?

323
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,780
Yes.

324
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,780
My mom runs a hair salon in Vivaldi.

325
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,780
I'm really sorry.

326
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,780
I'll wait until you're done with your hair.

327
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,780
I'll wait until you're done with your hair.

328
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,780
I was there!

329
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,780
It doesn't make sense.

330
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,780
There was no one there.

331
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,780
But what did you see?

332
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,780
Where did the money go?

333
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,780
I'm sorry.

334
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,780
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,780
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,780
I'm sorry.

337
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,780
I'm sorry.

338
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,780
I'm sorry.

339
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,780
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,780
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,780
I'm sorry.

342
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,780
I'm sorry.

343
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,780
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,780
I'm sorry.

345
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,780
I'm sorry.

346
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,780
I'm sorry.

347
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,780
I'm sorry.

348
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,780
I'm sorry.

349
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,780
I'm sorry.

350
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,780
I'm sorry.

351
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,780
I'm sorry.

352
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,780
I'm sorry.

353
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,780
I'm sorry.

354
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,780
I'm sorry.

355
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,780
I'm sorry.

356
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,780
I'm sorry.

357
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,780
I'm sorry.

358
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,780
I'm sorry.

359
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,780
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,780
I'm sorry.

361
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,780
I'm sorry.

362
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,780
I'm sorry.

363
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,780
I'm sorry.

364
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,780
I'm sorry.

365
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,780
I'm so sorry.

366
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,780
I'm so sorry.

367
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,780
I'm so sorry.

368
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,780
I'm so sorry.

369
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,780
I'm so sorry.

370
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,780
I'm so sorry.

371
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,780
I'm so sorry.

372
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,780
I'll look at it with my own eyes when I die.

373
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,180
I'm a real man.

374
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,080
I know how to take over a place.

375
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,680
Look at me.

376
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Give me the ball.

377
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Hey.

378
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,980
Take your umbrella too.

379
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,280
It's the first rain of the fall.

380
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,680
Rain? Are you kidding me?

381
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,180
This is my first day of school.

382
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,380
How dare you allow rain?

383
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,080
I'm a flying woman.

384
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,980
A weather fairy.

385
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,080
Now, shoot!

386
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,280
The flying woman is so pretty.

387
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,480
I should have listened to you.

388
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,580
But no one heard that I was coming to school?

389
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,080
Why isn't there anyone who's welcomed me?

390
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,280
You won't regret it in this hot weather.

391
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,180
I got all the styles.

392
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,380
My phone.

393
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,880
What's wrong with the wind?

394
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
It's nice.

395
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,980
Do you remember the first year?

396
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,680
How can I forget?

397
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,180
Where is it?

398
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,480
The legend has come true.

399
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,980
On the first rain of the fall,

400
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,580
the couple who meet at the art school bench

401
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,280
fall in love.

402
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,780
Just like us.

403
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,980
Gosh.

404
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,380
Hey.

405
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,080
Where are you?

406
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,680
The art school bench.

407
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,980
There must be a hole in the sky.

408
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,080
You don't have an umbrella, do you?

409
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,880
Wait there.

410
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,580
Just throw it.

411
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,580
It's okay.

412
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,680
What?

413
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,880
I found it.

414
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,080
As expected, it's snowing.

415
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,380
Rain!

416
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,180
Please stop!

417
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,180
Lupritel Cam!

418
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,880
At that moment,

419
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,380
something unbelievable happened.

420
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,580
What?

421
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,680
This melody...

422
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,280
I could hear the heartbeats clearly.

423
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,880
Is the melody in my dream a dream?

424
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Why does that woman hear that melody?

425
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,080
Why are there tears?

426
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,180
What's that melody?

427
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,480
What?

428
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,580
What was that music just now?

429
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
Dong-u.

430
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
Dong-u.

431
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,980
How...

432
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,280
How do you know my song?

433
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,580
Your song?

434
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,780
Is that your song?

435
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,580
Bomi.

436
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,580
Yes, Dong-u.

437
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,580
What's going on?

438
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,480
Huh?

439
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,580
Nothing.

440
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,580
Let's go.

441
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,480
Isn't it raining?

442
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
What?

443
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,280
No.

444
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,980
I'm so curious.

445
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,680
I can't wait to find out.

446
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,580
What's that?

447
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,480
How can that song be her song?

448
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,480
Does this make sense?

449
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,780
Bong-a.

450
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,780
Her name is Bong?

451
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,280
Was it Bomi?

452
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,780
Huh?

453
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,780
Dong-u.

454
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,780
When did you get here?

455
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,780
Just on my way.

456
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,780
Liar.

457
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,280
What do you mean on your way?

458
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,480
Make some creative excuses.

459
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,980
You came to see me pretending to be Bomi, right?

460
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,180
Why did I look like that?

461
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,780
It's so obvious.

462
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,780
Why are you so uncomfortable?

463
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm the one who's uncomfortable.

464
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,780
I'm sorry.

465
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,780
I'm really sorry.

466
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,780
I'm sorry, but my heart beats only for you.

467
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,280
No matter how much you're a medical student,

468
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,780
you're not my type.

469
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,280
I don't have any money, so please give up.

470
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
Wow.

471
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,980
That girl.

472
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,280
Every time...

473
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,780
When did that misunderstanding start?

474
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,080
That means she needs counseling, right?

475
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,580
Right?

476
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,980
I don't know.

477
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,480
But she's cute.

478
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,980
Let's go.

479
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,980
What is this?

480
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,980
Hi.

481
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,980
One, two, three.

482
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,980
I have to find her.

483
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,980
I'm looking for someone.

484
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,980
Are you Bomi?

485
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,980
Oppa, please sing for us.

486
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,980
Sing!

487
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:40,980
Sing! Sing!

488
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,980
Well, should I?

489
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
Yes.

490
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,980
Why isn't she showing up when she's singing?

491
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,980
Hey!

492
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,980
Do you want to be a judge?

493
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,980
What? You're so annoying.

494
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,980
Hey, you!

495
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,980
What?

496
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,980
What's wrong?

497
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,980
Quiet.

498
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,980
Do you know why she's mad?

499
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,980
No.

500
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,980
She's jealous.

501
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,980
You're just a pretty girl.

502
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,980
Anyway, that's it for today.

503
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,980
I think I should go to class.

504
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,120
I'll take you to the

505
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,980
department of entertainment.

506
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,980
I'm Crowner.

507
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,980
What?

508
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,980
Do you recognize me?

509
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,980
I'm the one who shouted the loudest

510
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,980
at your concert!

511
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,980
There's something on your face.

512
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,980
Oh, my.

513
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,980
I have a mirror.

514
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,980
I didn't see it.

515
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,980
I have a mirror.

516
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,980
I didn't see it.

517
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,980
Pretty, cute, lovely.

518
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,980
Is she alive or dead?

519
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,980
You should do this.

520
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,980
She's gone to me.

521
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,980
Attention, please.

522
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,980
Hagee is here.

523
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,980
Hi.

524
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,980
I'm Sang-ae, a freshman in the department of entertainment.

525
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,980
Nice to meet you.

526
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,980
Hi.

527
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,980
Let's focus.

528
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,980
Let's practice.

529
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,980
Okay.

530
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,980
Is she alive or dead?

531
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,980
Did she just get hit?

532
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,980
No.

533
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,980
It's because she's frozen.

534
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,980
She's in a bad mood.

535
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,980
She's so annoying.

536
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,980
She's so annoying.

537
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,980
Lastly, we'll do a Hamlin act.

538
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,980
Who wants to do a Hamlin act?

539
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,980
Do you want to?

540
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,980
Yes, I'll try.

541
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,980
Come on out.

542
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,980
The agency must have made you do it.

543
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,980
You'll see.

544
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,980
Is she alive or dead?

545
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,980
That's the problem.

546
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,980
Is it more difficult to hold back

547
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,980
the arrow and the stone

548
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,980
from the cruel fate of fate?

549
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,980
Or is it more difficult to resist

550
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,980
the evil sea and fight back

551
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,980
with weapons?

552
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,980
What about me?

553
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,980
What about me?

554
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,980
You're so angry.

555
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,980
What's wrong with you?

556
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,980
What's the point of acting?

557
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,980
You're so raw.

558
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,980
You're so fresh.

559
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,980
I'm born with a lot of things.

560
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,980
I'm a hexagonal human being.

561
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,980
I don't lack anything.

562
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,980
You said you have a super positive mind.

563
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,980
I admit it.

564
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,980
These days, it's more of a social accident

565
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,980
than a circular accident.

566
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,980
The class is over. Let's go eat.

567
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,980
I want to go to the cafeteria.

568
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,980
I'll treat you to a meal

569
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,980
to celebrate your first day of school.

570
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,980
Order whatever you want.

571
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,980
I don't think you want to eat.

572
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,980
Thank you, Mr. Sanghyeok.

573
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,980
I hope you become our model.

574
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,980
Of course.

575
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,980
Pay me today with this.

576
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,980
Sanghyeok! Sanghyeok!

577
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,980
Sanghyeok! Sanghyeok!

578
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,980
Sanghyeok.

579
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,980
Sanghyeok.

580
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,980
I'm the department head of the department of

581
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,980
history and history.

582
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,980
I'm the department head of the department of

583
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,980
history and history.

584
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,980
My classmates have a hard time

585
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,980
with their family business.

586
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,980
Family business?

587
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,980
Yes.

588
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,980
Not only the department store,

589
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,980
but there are kids who can't even

590
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,980
dream of going on a vacation.

591
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,980
I'm thinking of what to do.

592
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,980
Then I'll pay for the school expenses and the

593
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,980
m-tv.

594
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,980
I can't just sit around as a classmate.

595
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,980
I've been busy, so I didn't have time to spend money.

596
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,980
Don't worry.

597
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,980
Thank you.

598
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,980
Peace!

599
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,980
Peace!

600
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,980
What are you doing?

601
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,980
I'm doing the dubbing.

602
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,980
Why are you doing the dubbing all of a sudden?

603
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,980
I'm going to rent this room.

604
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,980
What?

605
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,980
I need to get the deposit and pay the debt.

606
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,980
I can't be kicked out.

607
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,980
I'm going to write down the aunt's number, so

608
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,980
answer the phone well.

609
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,980
Okay.

610
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,980
You're shaking.

611
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,980
Someone might think you're a piano cleaner.

612
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,980
Stop wiping.

613
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,980
Kangchong, wait a little longer.

614
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,980
I'll make a lot of money and take you there.

615
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,980
When did she find out about this?

616
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,980
What are you doing?

617
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,980
Did you stay up all night?

618
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,980
You're already at work?

619
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,980
I came in because the lights were on.

620
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,980
What kind of whiskey is this at this hour?

621
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,980
Me too.

622
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,980
It's because of the fraud.

623
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,980
It would have been nice if you had done it early

624
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,980
because it wasn't a big deal.

625
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,980
I don't know why you don't explain anything.

626
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,980
Do you remember that day?

627
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,980
Do you remember that day?

628
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,980
Not at all.

629
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,980
What did the fraud tell you?

630
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,980
Why is he so angry?

631
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,980
He's not the kind of person who makes mistakes.

632
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,980
Go and do your work.

633
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,980
I don't look like a father at all.

634
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,980
Yes.

635
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,980
Please recognize me.

636
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,980
No one will recognize me if I do this, right?

637
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,980
Do you know the name of Bomi?

638
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,980
She's this smart, pretty, and the busiest person in the world.

639
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,980
Kim Bomi?

640
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,980
She's a surgeon.

641
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,980
She's a great singer.

642
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,980
She's a great singer.

643
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,980
She's a great singer.

644
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,980
I'm the best singer in the world.

645
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,980
Oh, Kim Bomi?

646
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,980
She's a freshman in the field of practical music.

647
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,980
Kim Bomi?

648
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,980
She's a freshman in the field of practical music?

649
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,980
Where is she?

650
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,980
She's probably working part-time right now.

651
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,980
Part-time?

652
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,980
Where is that?

653
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,980
The fraud missed it.

654
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,980
I'll tell you where she works.

655
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,980
What's going on?

656
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,980
How do you know my song?

657
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,980
Your song?

658
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,980
Is that your song?

659
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,980
Come in.

660
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,980
Kim Bomi.

661
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,980
Bomi...

662
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,980
She left after work.

663
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,980
Really?

664
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,980
I can't do this.

665
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,980
I'll come back tomorrow.

666
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,980
Come back again.

667
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,980
She left.

668
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,980
Oh, my gosh.

669
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,980
Why is Seogae looking for you?

670
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,980
How do you know each other?

671
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,980
Are you two close?

672
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,980
We're not close.

673
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,980
I saw her just once.

674
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
I should go.

675
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,980
You're just going to leave like this?

676
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,980
How did you two become close?

677
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,980
Tell me.

678
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,980
I'll see you tomorrow.

679
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,980
No, Kim Bomi.

680
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,980
Bomi.

681
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,980
Can you move away?

682
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,980
It's a bit of a hassle.

683
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,980
Hey, how is that melody your song?

684
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,980
It's my song.

685
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,980
I told you it's my song.

686
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,980
So explain it to me.

687
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,980
Wait, let's talk.

688
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,980
Stop following me.

689
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,980
I'm busy.

690
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,980
Are you going on a date?

691
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,980
Why are you so busy?

692
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,980
Okay.

693
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,980
I'm going on a date.

694
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,980
Okay?

695
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,980
Hey, Kim Bomi.

696
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,980
I know that song.

697
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,980
I heard it in my dream.

698
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,980
What?

699
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,980
You again?

700
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,980
You go first.

701
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,980
What?

702
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,980
Hey, Kim Bomi.

703
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,980
Hey, my back.

704
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,980
My back.

705
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,980
Stop bothering her.

706
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,980
It's annoying.

707
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,980
This is where you stop.

708
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,980
I knew I'd miss you.

709
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,980
I can't stand you asking.

710
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,980
Kim Bomi.

711
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,980
Kim Bomi.

712
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,980
Kim Bomi, where are you?

713
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,980
Kim Bomi.

714
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
Kim Bomi.

715
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,980
Kim Bomi?

716
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,980
Here.

717
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,980
I'm here.

718
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,980
I'm here.

719
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,980
I'm here.

720
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,980
I'm here.

721
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,980
Here.

722
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,980
Thank you.

723
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,980
Stop.

724
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,980
Do you not understand the language?

725
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,980
Hey, the band.

726
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,980
Is this the date venue?

727
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,980
Is this the place?

728
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,980
Hey, get out of here.

729
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,980
We have to practice.

730
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,980
If you're going to come here, you should've told me earlier.

731
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
I'll join the band too.

732
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,980
I'm looking for you guys.

733
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,980
That's the right person.

734
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,980
Who are you?

735
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,980
It's us.

736
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,980
It's good.

737
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,980
Taeryeong is our main guitarist.

738
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,980
She's a big fan of the band.

739
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,980
Finally, the history of the four of the Hanju University and Crown's four.

740
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,980
The meeting.

741
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,980
At our band.

742
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,980
Wait a minute.

743
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,980
Who's the four of the Hanju University?

744
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,980
Who are you?

745
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,980
You're Taeryeong, right?

746
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,980
Did you call my name so rudely?

747
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,980
Hey.

748
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,980
Our band is the head of the band.

749
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,980
Should I get the application form?

750
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,980
You can use it as a mask.

751
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,980
It's just the right time.

752
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,980
What?

753
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,980
You must be not confident.

754
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,980
I'm worried that I'll get the right one.

755
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,980
I'll be nervous.

756
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,980
I can't be the same as Jjin and Jjabi.

757
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,980
You're right.

758
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,980
You've never seen my performance, have you?

759
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,980
That's why I'm afraid.

760
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,980
Or inferiority complex.

761
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,980
Why would I be inferior to someone like you?

762
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,980
No matter how I am, I have to live as my own.

763
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,980
Why am I your own?

764
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,980
I was the one who started it.

765
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,980
Good.

766
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,980
Then let's see.

767
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,980
I'm really curious.

768
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,980
Whether it's a skill or pride.

769
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,980
But if I win, it's our band again.

770
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,980
Don't doubt it.

771
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,980
Keep going.

772
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,980
Where did you meet him?

773
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,980
Where did you meet him?

774
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,980
He went to meet you.

775
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,980
He was here.

776
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,980
He was here.

777
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,980
He's awesome.

778
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,980
Go Tae-yang.

779
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,980
Go Tae-yang.

780
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,980
Go Tae-yang.

781
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,980
Go Tae-yang.

782
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,980
Go Tae-yang.

783
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,980
Go Tae-yang.

784
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,980
Go Tae-yang.

785
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,980
Go Tae-yang.

786
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,980
Go Tae-yang.

787
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,980
Go Tae-yang.

788
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,980
Sang-yi.

789
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,980
Sang-yi!

790
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,980
Gyuri is here.

791
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,980
Cheer him up.

792
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,980
What?

793
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,980
I never called him.

794
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,980
It's all my fault.

795
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,980
Tae-yang likes me.

796
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,980
I was so surprised that I said I liked Sang-yi.

797
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,980
But I'm only your brother.

798
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,980
Tae-yang.

799
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,980
This is not good.

800
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,980
Why don't you give up?

801
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,980
Are you going to drag Sang-yi in?

802
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,980
You don't know much about love.

803
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,980
This is obsession.

804
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,980
Let's be clean.

805
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,980
Wait.

806
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,980
If I win the battle,

807
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,980
I'll explain why that song is yours.

808
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,980
That's...

809
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,980
I'll win next time.

810
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,980
I promised you.

811
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,980
Lupritel Gang.

812
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,980
Why do I keep getting nervous?

813
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,980
Here, here, here.

814
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,980
I'm the fat guy of the Hanju Band,

815
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,980
Gong Jin-ho.

816
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,980
I'll make you forget the name

817
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,980
twice in the next four weeks.

818
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,980
Is that what you want?

819
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,980
I feel bad.

820
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,980
Lupritel Gang!

821
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,980
Look at me.

822
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,980
I'm giving you my eyes.

823
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,980
I have to keep my promise.

824
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,980
I have to know why your song is in my dream.

825
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,980
Don't you use other instruments?

826
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,980
I don't know about that.

827
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,980
I'll just use the guitar.

828
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,980
I'll just use the guitar.

829
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,980
I'll just use the guitar.

830
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,980
I'll just use the guitar.

831
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,980
See?

832
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,980
The guitar is pretty good.

833
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,980
Lupritel Gang!

834
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:18,980
They're having a battle?

835
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,980
They're already in a bad mood

836
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:21,980
because they're so tired.

837
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:38,980
Are you laughing?

838
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:39,980
What are you going to show me?

839
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,980
No way.

840
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,980
He's playing the guitar and the drums.

841
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,980
You're going to beat Na Yves?

842
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:55,980
You've gotten better.

843
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:09,980
I'm going to beat Na Yves.

844
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:39,980
What if I lose?

845
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,980
The technique is so good.

846
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:09,980
I'll quit.

847
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,980
I failed to control him

848
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,980
because of the bad luck.

849
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,980
I lost.

850
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,980
Seotaeang wins!

851
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,980
Seotaeang wins!

852
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:54,980
Oh.

853
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,980
Is this Han Ju-dae?

854
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,980
Yes, it's Kim Bum-hak.

855
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,980
I know him pretty well.

856
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:03,980
Who?

857
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:04,980
Him.

858
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,980
I saw the pictures of them together.

859
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:09,980
I see.

860
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,980
They knew each other?

861
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,980
Isn't World Music Chart a good place?

862
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,980
You learned nothing yesterday.

863
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:23,980
You got caught in a fake hunt.

864
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,980
Why did you do that?

865
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,980
You were just playing hard to get.

866
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:26,980
Why would I?

867
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,980
I was just trying to show off my skills.

868
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,980
It's going to be hard to get out of school.

869
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:31,980
I'm embarrassed.

870
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:36,980
Hello, Jung Hyeon-min.

871
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,980
What are you doing?

872
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,980
I'm a member of the Han Ju Band,

873
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,980
but I can't make a band.

874
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,980
If you're interested, go for it.

875
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:09,980
Don't worry.

876
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,980
I'm not here to bother you.

877
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,980
I lost, so you can't ask me questions.

878
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,980
I'll keep my promise.

879
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,980
What's so good about this place?

880
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,980
Did you eat?

881
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,980
You can't ask me questions,

882
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:23,980
so I don't have to answer.

883
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:25,980
Ask him.

884
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,980
Kang Chung, I hope you're doing well today.

885
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,980
A piano major?

886
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:10,980
What's this?

887
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,980
The more I see you...

888
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,980
Spring plays the spring.

889
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,980
Spring feels like it's all over my body.

890
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:31,980
I was curious.

891
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,980
I was curious about the spring.

892
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,980
I was curious about the spring.

893
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,980
Why do I keep thinking about spring?

894
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:42,980
Why do I keep thinking about it?

895
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,980
Why do I want to see it so I can see it?

896
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:48,980
Hey!

897
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,980
Let's be a band together!

898
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:51,980
Please!

899
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,980
I fell in love with you.

900
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,980
So you fell in love with your piano major?

901
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:01,980
If you're going to be a band with me...

902
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:02,980
Stop talking nonsense.

903
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,980
Go before you get too serious about the stalker.

904
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:05,980
Let's go.

905
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,980
Hey, wait!

906
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,980
Do you think I'll give up until you say yes?

907
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,980
I know.

908
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,980
You did it six years ago.

909
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,980
I was there!

910
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:35,980
What?

911
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,980
M-Mister?

912
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,980
I really wanted to see you.

913
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,980
I'm sorry, Miser.

914
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,980
You have two options.

915
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,980
You can go to the army

916
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:03,980
or study abroad.

917
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,980
What are you talking about?

918
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:07,980
The army?

919
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,980
Studying abroad?

920
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:10,980
What about the stalker?

921
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,980
He doesn't care about you anymore.

922
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,980
The more you say it, the better.

923
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:21,980
No!

924
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,980
I'm not saying I'm not going to the army.

925
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,980
I'll go one day.

926
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,980
Not now.

927
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,980
I'm not going to study abroad.

928
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:36,980
Is it because I asked you to drink?

929
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,980
I don't know why I did that either.

930
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:43,980
But what happened six years ago?

931
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:46,980
You...

932
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:48,980
You remember everything.

933
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,980
You remember everything...

934
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,980
No, I only remembered that.

935
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:56,980
I know everything.

936
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,980
I was there when you did it six years ago.

937
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:04,980
That doesn't make sense.

938
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,980
You were there six years ago...

939
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,980
I don't want to hear it.

940
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:10,980
Just do as I say.

941
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,980
Okay?

942
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:12,980
No!

943
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,980
You never said no to me.

944
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,980
You never said no to me!

945
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:19,980
I know!

946
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,980
It's okay to say no to me.

947
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:26,980
Okay.

948
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,980
Then we'll never see each other again.

949
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,980
Sir!

950
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:35,980
Sir!

951
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,980
Sir...

952
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,980
If you're going to hold out until the end,

953
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,980
I have no choice but to prepare for the worst.

954
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,980
How dare you think of fighting with the head of our band?

955
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,980
You're so bold.

956
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:09,980
There.

957
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,980
You're going to make a band?

958
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,980
If you're an idol, you should act like one.

959
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,980
Don't be a playboy and look pretty.

960
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,980
If you don't want to hurt your pretty face,

961
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,980
I'm not in a good mood right now.

962
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:23,980
Don't touch me.

963
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,980
You're carrying expensive guitars again.

964
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:37,980
You're the most unlucky one to be playing music with money.

965
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:47,980
I told you to stop

966
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,980
and go.

967
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,980
What's with your command?

968
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,980
Did you get that far?

969
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,980
Are we laughing?

970
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,980
What are you better than us?

971
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:03,980
Do you have anything else?

972
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,980
If you're jealous, say so.

973
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:06,980
Get out of my way.

974
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,980
If you don't want to, then say you can't.

975
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:19,980
My arm!

976
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,980
They're killing me!

977
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:22,980
My arm!

978
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,980
What's wrong with your phone?

979
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:34,980
Turn it off.

980
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,980
How could you beat someone up in your own time?

981
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,980
Dad.

982
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,980
Jo Jin-a, calm down.

983
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,980
I'm going to expel you from the company.

984
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,980
You want to protect The Crown, don't you?

985
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,980
You're the only one who can protect The Crown.

986
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,980
The injured side is refusing to agree.

987
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,980
The fans are complaining about the constant violence.

988
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,980
It won't end with just you.

989
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,980
I'm sorry for causing social tension.

990
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,980
I'll take responsibility for this

991
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,980
and I'll expel The Crown from the company.

992
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,980
I'm sorry for causing you tension.

993
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:29,980
It's an advertisement and a performance.

994
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,980
It's a lot of money to make a contract.

995
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,980
You have to sell all your house, car, building,

996
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:35,980
and stock.

997
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:37,980
Except for this.

998
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,980
All I need is our money.

999
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,980
This is all I can get right now.

1000
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,980
Hold on to this for now.

1001
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,980
What's so heavy?

1002
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:03,980
You're the man of the hour.

1003
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,980
Do you have somewhere to go?

1004
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,980
I'd like to tell you to come to my house.

1005
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,980
If you know where to go, I'll come.

1006
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:12,980
I'm sorry.

1007
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:14,980
It's okay.

1008
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,980
I'm just worried that you might not have a place to go.

1009
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:18,980
I'm sorry.

1010
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:45,980
Excuse me.

1011
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:46,980
I'm sorry.

1012
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:51,980
What?

1013
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,980
I really have nowhere to go.

1014
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,980
I have to go to the army, just like you said.

1015
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:08,980
Mom!

1016
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:10,980
Of course.

1017
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,980
I'm fine.

1018
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:15,980
I'm taking a break because of the busy schedule.

1019
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:17,980
Where's Mom?

1020
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,980
Grand Canyon?

1021
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,980
My mom has achieved her dream.

1022
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:25,980
She's so cool.

1023
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,980
It's nice to be away from the salon, right?

1024
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:31,980
I'm glad you listened to me.

1025
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:36,980
No.

1026
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:39,980
Okay, fine.

1027
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:43,980
I'll see you later.

1028
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,980
Sometimes, you feel better when you walk.

1029
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,980
When will I ever walk again?

1030
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:58,980
Oh?

1031
00:56:58,980 --> 00:56:59,980
That's my school.

1032
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,980
You have to walk then.

1033
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,980
Just like you walk without thinking.

1034
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:13,980
I'm going to go to the gym.

1035
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,980
I'm just going to sign a contract

1036
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,980
when I have the capital.

1037
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:37,980
No.

1038
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,980
She's going to pay for the money.

1039
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:42,980
I don't know if she's okay.

1040
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:44,980
She's not coming to school.

1041
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,980
Why am I doing this alone?

1042
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,980
Sigh...

1043
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,980
Have I ever lived here?

1044
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:44,980
Why am I here?

1045
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:11,980
Sigh...

1046
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,980
Okay. I've decided on this.

1047
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,980
This is a completely different story.

1048
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:39,980
This isn't a city view.

1049
00:59:39,980 --> 01:00:05,700
Is this a

1050
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:09,980
Mom?

1051
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:24,980
Kim Bum-wook?

1052
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:25,980
Kim Bum-wook?

1053
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,980
I realized the moment I saw Kim Bum-wook.

1054
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:36,980
I came here to meet Kim Bum-wook.

1055
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,980
Why is it suddenly raining?

1056
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:46,980
I have something to do.

1057
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:47,980
You go ahead.

1058
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:10,980
Looking at the sky I so want to see

1059
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,980
This is the end.

1060
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:28,980
I wish I had said it here.

1061
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,980
But something just to see

1062
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,600
wasn't there until yesterday?

1063
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:36,980
addresses breakup

1064
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:42,200
I'm going to the

1065
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:46,200
school.

1066
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:50,200
Oh, here it is.

1067
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,200
What is it? I can't even see it well.

1068
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,200
What are you talking about?

1069
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,200
I went to the early morning prayer to get this verse.

1070
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,200
You should enjoy coming, too.

1071
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,200
Do you know?

1072
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,200
You'll become a fan on the occasion of today.

1073
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,200
They're not my style at all.

1074
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,200
I'm standing, so I'm in front of there.

1075
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,420
I'm going to the school alone?

1076
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,420
Baek Yulhee!

Der Qurayeni World Music Chart,

1080
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,740
first place!

1081
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:59,740
For the first place of today, I'll would like to give you a special gift.

1082
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:02,740
Ta-da!

1083
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:07,740
If you bring this here and say that you were here

1084
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,740
I'll go on a date with you for just one day

1085
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:33,740
LUPIN's welcome

1086
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,740
Was it then?

1087
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:58,740
The fate of me and you

1088
01:03:58,740 --> 01:03:59,740
has begun

1089
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:04,740
LUPIN's welcome

1090
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,740
LUPIN's welcome

1091
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:43,740
Let's just think about paying the debt

1092
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:44,740
Let's get double the debt

1093
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,740
Double the debt?

1094
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:47,740
Pass?

1095
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:50,740
How can you be on the second floor with a guy?

1096
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:51,740
Why is he here?

1097
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:54,740
You can't be with him right now

1098
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:56,740
You just go home

1099
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:58,740
I'll take Bomi home

1100
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:01,740
Why are you still here even after all the trouble?

1101
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:03,740
It's the worst to lose without fighting

1102
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:05,740
Someone said that

1103
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:08,740
It's the worst to lose without fighting

1104
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:12,740
You have to answer all the questions I ask if I win
