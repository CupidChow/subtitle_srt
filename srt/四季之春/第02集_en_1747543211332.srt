1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,220
The End

2
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,260
Kim Bo-eun?

3
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,820
The owner of the house is you?

4
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,400
You're the one who came to see the house?

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,400
I thought you were only good at playing the piano.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,840
You're good at lying.

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,640
What? Penthouse?

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,240
What? I'm not lying?

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,040
I can see everything in Seoul, so I'm a city view.

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,380
And I have a grassy house, so I'm a grassy villa.

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,180
I use the second floor's room and the rooftop together.

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,580
I'm a floorball.

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,020
What? What did I say wrong?

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,380
What's going on? Why is it so noisy?

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,620
They said I shouldn't live here.

16
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,520
Tell them not to live here.

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,660
What? You live in this house too?

18
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,320
This is strange.

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,420
Mom.

20
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,420
Yes?

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,360
Did you wake up?

22
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,260
Why are you looking at me?

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,900
You're talking to me.

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,340
Help!

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,480
Help!

26
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,540
There's your brother.

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,980
He's in my house.

28
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,300
How can you use the second floor with a guy?

29
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,900
You don't even know him.

30
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,980
I don't know him from the start.

31
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,040
I just need to know him.

32
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,020
Let go!

33
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,180
Then let's switch rooms.

34
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,580
I'll use the second floor's room and you'll use the first floor's room.

35
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,460
You said you were a bad girl.

36
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,020
You didn't know he was such a bad guy.

37
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,020
Who's the one who cried because he didn't like him?

38
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,800
Who doesn't make mistakes?

39
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,160
I just made up my mind.

40
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,160
I'll be the last fan of my brother.

41
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,820
Ouch.

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,580
You're so mean.

43
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,660
Ouch!

44
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,620
Oh, my.

45
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,420
You don't know how life is.

46
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,000
You're a bad girl now, but you'll never be a bad girl.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,660
Just try to be fancy again.

48
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,860
Then this house is the house where the four of them lived.

49
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,100
Will there be any rumors?

50
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,400
Then the tourists will be attracted to it.

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,740
The fans will be happy.

52
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,280
The house price will be high.

53
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,440
The house price will be high?

54
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,680
What?

55
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,380
What?

56
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,720
Here we go.

57
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,780
This house is the house where the four of them lived.

58
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,660
The house price has already gone ten times higher.

59
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,100
Ten times higher.

60
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,060
Love is so hard.

61
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,040
I can't wait anymore, Gyuri.

62
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,000
Marry me!

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,440
I love you!

64
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,440
I love you.

65
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,620
Oh, come on.

66
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,920
Men are uncomfortable.

67
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,420
Oh, my.

68
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,020
When will the new tenant come again?

69
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,200
Let's just think about the rain.

70
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,120
I'll never make you uncomfortable.

71
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,800
Who's your aunt? I prepared everything.

72
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,100
The rules of life that men and women need when living together.

73
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,460
7 o'clock in the morning, 8 o'clock in the evening,

74
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,640
1st floor is the kitchen.

75
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,440
If you're late for 5 minutes, you're out of food.

76
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,840
You're out of food no matter what.

77
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,680
I have to get up at 7 o'clock?

78
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,880
That's a bit hard.

79
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,280
I wake up at 6 o'clock.

80
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,680
Why is a young person coming so early?

81
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,680
I can't eat at 6 o'clock.

82
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,620
Then...

83
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,820
Pass!

84
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,620
Never expose yourself in the house.

85
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,080
You must wear a mask when you go out.

86
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,080
No going out of the living room after midnight.

87
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,920
No going out with your partner.

88
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,460
The moment you start a fight with my daughter.

89
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,200
I don't think I'll die.

90
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,560
Don't be so sure. It's making me feel bad.

91
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,500
Anyway, I'll keep an eye on you.

92
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,700
Last, the deposit.

93
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,440
I can't just split it up.

94
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,640
Tomorrow, until 5 o'clock.

95
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,300
What?

96
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,580
Oh, my.

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,980
5,000? Right?

98
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,980
Yes!

99
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,320
Why is he carrying cash in his bag?

100
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,620
I don't know. My manager gave it to me.

101
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,980
My dad is so flexible.

102
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,860
How much is his cash?

103
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,560
He said he'd pay it even if it's cheap.

104
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,260
Did he finally find it?

105
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,520
It's more certain than the future.

106
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,460
The money...

107
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,620
Okay!

108
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,820
Pass!

109
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,260
Pass.

110
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,200
Pass!

111
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Pass.

112
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,700
Pass!

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,140
Boss, I will never give up on music.

114
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,740
I'll return as a great singer.

115
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,740
Kim Bum?

116
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,780
He's smiling just like he is now.

117
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,660
I've seen this piano before.

118
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,460
Could it be the restaurant rabbit?

119
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,420
Is this your hideout?

120
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,960
This is nice.

121
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,940
I'm going to buy a piano.

122
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,300
I'm going to buy a piano.

123
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,500
I'm going to buy a piano.

124
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,700
I'm going to buy a piano.

125
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,380
But how did you get into my house?

126
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,580
Why are you here?

127
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,780
Well, I mean...

128
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,620
You came to the place where the moon leads,

129
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,280
and now you're in front of me?

130
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
Hey!

131
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,220
I'll let you know about the melody.

132
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,220
What?

133
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,400
What if I don't want to?

134
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,560
Then where is it?

135
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Hurry up and play it!

136
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,940
How can I be curious about this?

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm going to let you know.

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm really going to let you know.

139
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay, okay!

140
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,840
I just have to tell you.

141
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,880
I got this piano as a gift from my mom when I was seven.

142
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,240
It's the first time I've ever heard it.

143
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
Okay?

144
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Okay!

145
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,120
Then how did you get into my dream?

146
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,160
Are you lying? It's a lie, right?

147
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,360
Do I look so relaxed that I'm lying?

148
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,540
I don't lie.

149
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,300
Then how do you know my song?

150
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,580
Does it make sense that you know the parts that I didn't record?

151
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,140
I thought about it,

152
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,040
and I'm sure you heard it somewhere.

153
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,820
This is the golden ear that never forgets a song you heard once.

154
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Ha...

155
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,400
So my conclusion is that we've met once.

156
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
We've met?

157
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
We? When?

158
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,040
I had a new dream.

159
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,920
A white piano.

160
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,120
A rabbit sticker.

161
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,920
And for the first time, I could see her face clearly.

162
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,820
I see!

163
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,200
You know her too, right?

164
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,000
It was spring.

165
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,140
It's not just a coincidence that I came to this house.

166
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Okay, good. Perfect.

167
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
It's uncomfortable.

168
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
It's uncomfortable. Good job.

169
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Even if it's a seed money that will be money in the future, this is not it.

170
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Hey, hey.

171
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Take out all the drinks that the company is advertising and return them.

172
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
That agency works well.

173
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,400
They take all the goods to return them.

174
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
The agency?

175
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Yes.

176
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:34,680
What agency would cut off the

177
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:50,400
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
When did you stay there?

179
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Since you played the piano a long time ago?

180
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Huh?

181
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
You had that white piano at home, right?

182
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
How did you know that?

183
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Did you hear from your aunt?

184
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Really?

185
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
That rabbit sticker.

186
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Wow, that's awesome.

187
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Wow.

188
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Hurry up and clean up and do your work.

189
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Yes, I'm going.

190
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
I'm your friend.

191
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Yes.

192
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Are you my boyfriend?

193
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Huh?

194
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Huh?

195
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Huh?

196
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Are you my boyfriend?

197
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Huh?

198
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Oh, go in, go in.

199
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Right?

200
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Go in.

201
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:31,400
I'm so interested in other people's business because I'm a stone.

202
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
I don't understand, so I'll ask you one thing.

203
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Why are you still like a bingo even after being treated unfairly?

204
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Me?

205
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
What did I get?

206
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
You didn't beat the band members.

207
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Are you a pushover?

208
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
What, Lee Koo-hyuk, Taegwabi, or something?

209
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
How do you know that?

210
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,400
I know a lot about you, too.

211
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Anyway, you keep your food bowl.

212
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,400
It's the worst to lose without fighting.

213
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Do you know?

214
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Yeah, yeah.

215
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Oh, my God.

216
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,400
What kind of superstar is that?

217
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,400
I'm so pissed off.

218
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Hey, right?

219
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
What?

220
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
What?

221
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Why is it raining?

222
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,400
I'm staying still, too.

223
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Does the spider believe me?

224
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Why?

225
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Did he see something in his dream?

226
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Why is he here?

227
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:51,400
The fact that someone believes me is as explosive as dynamite.

228
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Perfect.

229
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Now, hello, everyone.

230
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Hi.

231
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,400
You know I'm recruiting band members, right?

232
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Of course, there's a one-week band.

233
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Right?

234
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,400
But I'm going to do a different kind of music in the one-week band.

235
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,400
It's called hip-hop rock.

236
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Wow, you're back from school.

237
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
It's a hit.

238
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
I'm going to do hip-hop rock.

239
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Wow, you're back from school.

240
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
It's a hit.

241
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Aren't you going to hang up on me?

242
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,400
You're handsome.

243
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
What kind of instrument can you play?

244
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Do you really play these days?

245
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Isn't that all AI?

246
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
I'm a singer, but I can sing.

247
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
You don't need a manager.

248
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:45,400
I'm good at driving and I'm good at MC.

249
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Hey, hey, hey.

250
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Oh, what is he?

251
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Didn't you say you were going to take a break?

252
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Hey, I got hit in the eye.

253
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Wait a minute.

254
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Hey, you said you were hospitalized, and you're already born?

255
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
How's your body?

256
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
I can't die.

257
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
I'm here to say hello.

258
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
What's so scary?

259
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Who's scared?

260
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Let's go.

261
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Why are you walking with a deep-sea leg?

262
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Doesn't it hurt?

263
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Oh, let's run.

264
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,400
I don't know I won the gold medal in the Idol Athletics Championships.

265
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Now, get ready.

266
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:45,400
You crazy bastard.

267
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Why are you doing this to me?

268
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
You got hit one-sidedly.

269
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,400
What's the point of playing the media and dragging the agreement?

270
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
There's someone behind you, right?

271
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
The guy who told you to put me in.

272
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Who is that?

273
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:21,400
I don't know, you bastard.

274
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,400
I can't run anymore.

275
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Call the police.

276
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,400
I would have called you before I called you.

277
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
The fraud appeared at school.

278
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
You said you'd stop everything.

279
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:41,400
But why are you collecting the bandwagon?

280
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
The fraud came to school, sir.

281
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Didn't you say you were going to the army?

282
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:54,400
I already got a house to live in, and that house is Kim Bo-moon's house.

283
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,400
How could this happen when you live together?

284
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:08,400
I don't know if it's a coincidence, but I checked the contract with the fraud.

285
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,400
I'm not sending you out of here in a hurry.

286
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
I'm the owner of the bandwagon.

287
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
You can't be together.

288
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Get out of here right now.

289
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
I'll send you to the army.

290
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
I don't care what you do.

291
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:29,400
I don't care.

292
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
It's started.

293
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Call the perpetrator and the victim.

294
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Apologize to the victims and stop the bandwagon.

295
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Stop it.

296
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,400
The only thing that goes to the school is the bandwagon.

297
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,400
It's us.

298
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,400
What should I say?

299
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
I don't think they're wrong.

300
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,400
You know that the whole of our nutrition department is laughing because of you, right?

301
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Guys, if we stay still, we'll become a co-operative.

302
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,400
What's that nonsense?

303
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Aren't you guys too much as colleagues?

304
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Is that what you're saying?

305
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
What?

306
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Professor.

307
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Professor, I'm going to boycott all the classes with the four of you.

308
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
What are you going to do?

309
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
We're thinking the same thing.

310
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,400
I'll return the school's school supplies that the perpetrator bought.

311
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
I'll return it, too.

312
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
I'll return it.

313
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Hey.

314
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
I'll return it, too.

315
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Where are you going?

316
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,400
When are you going to eat it up?

317
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,400
An emergency meeting is taking place in the meeting room.

318
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Ta-ge, get out!

319
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Ta-ge, get out!

320
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:08,400
Ta-ge, get out!

321
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Wait a minute, Grandma.

322
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Ta-ge, get out!

323
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,400
The opinion that you're against coming to school is being trampled.

324
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,400
I'm worried about the idea that our Hanju University is comparing the violent crime.

325
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Why don't you take a break and go to the army first?

326
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
You're coming back, right?

327
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Then forget everything.

328
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
This is all for you.

329
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,400
It's for me.

330
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
But what should I do?

331
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
I don't like it.

332
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,400
I didn't study, but I'm not an empty-handed person.

333
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Who said that?

334
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,400
It's a shame to lose without fighting.

335
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,400
I'm going to the army, but I'm not going like this.

336
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
As if I'm being chased and running away.

337
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
Then I'll get up first.

338
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
I'm recruiting the band.

339
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,400
What if I stop the band?

340
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
What right does the president have?

341
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,400
I have the right to do anything for the benefit of the school.

342
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,400
There's a band in the middle that Hanju University is already building.

343
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,400
The band I'm making is for the school.

344
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,400
I'll proceed even if the president stops me.

345
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
I'll do it till the end.

346
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
More, more, more.

347
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
What about this?

348
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,400
If you can recruit more than 300 people in the club today,

349
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,400
I won't ask for anything more from our school.

350
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
No, 300 people?

351
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
It's not like we're gathering supporters.

352
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
What kind of 300 club members are you?

353
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,400
The number of students who are registered to stop the military

354
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,400
from entering the school is over 300.

355
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,400
So even students who don't lose can do that.

356
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,400
Wouldn't it be possible to get the opposite number?

357
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,400
So if I recruit 300 people,

358
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
are you going to approve the club?

359
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,400
Instead, I'll have to make a list of the names

360
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,400
that the school avoids, whether it's a failure or a failure.

361
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,400
You're not even going to sign the contract?

362
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Yes, please wait and see.

363
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
I'll make sure to do it.

364
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,400
I don't know who's playing with the sponsorship money,

365
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,400
but please tell him that I have to make this band

366
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
because of you.

367
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,400
The end time is until 6 p.m. today.

368
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
I'm going.

369
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
Who are you looking for?

370
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,400
I'm here to see Jo Jin-ah.

371
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
I have something to tell you about the company.

372
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,400
You'll know if it's Kim Bum.

373
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
What do you want?

374
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,400
He's on the outskirts right now.

375
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,400
How do you know him?

376
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,400
He bought my song.

377
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Our company bought Kim Bum's song.

378
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,400
So you're saying that the company didn't

379
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,400
use violence to protect itself?

380
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

381
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
What do you have better than us?

382
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
Is there anything else you can do?

383
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
If you're jealous, say you're jealous.

384
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,400
If you don't like it, if you can't do it...

385
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
My arm!

386
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
You're killing me!

387
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
I bet the other party started the fight first.

388
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
So I posted it on the community,

389
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
but it was deleted.

390
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
As if someone was deleting it on purpose.

391
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Did you take a video that could be evidence?

392
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,400
The evidence that the four were in the same room.

393
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
No, I didn't.

394
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,400
The victim suggested a video of evidence.

395
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Judging from that video,

396
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
it's hard to repeat that the four are perpetrators.

397
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
It's hard to repeat that.

398
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
The video that was released

399
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
showed the other party being in the middle.

400
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400
Didn't you think they were lying?

401
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Isn't protecting the artist

402
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,400
the priority in this case?

403
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,400
What are you trying to say?

404
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
I'm surprised.

405
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Why does it sound like you don't want to believe me?

406
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Isn't it true that you believe

407
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
what you can't see?

408
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Are you the CEO of the company

409
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
that you believe and respect like your father?

410
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
I'm sorry,

411
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,400
but I'm no longer the CEO of the company.

412
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
What I have to protect now

413
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
is the Crown.

414
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
So you're going to pretend you don't know?

415
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
If that's the best thing to do, I'm happy.

416
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,400
The four are alone now.

417
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
If the four were really alone,

418
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
I wouldn't have come here.

419
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
If the four heard this,

420
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
I think he would be very sad.

421
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Why?

422
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
What does it have to do with the four?

423
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Why?

424
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,400
I don't think there's a reason to tell you.

425
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,400
We'll start the training for the liberation now.

426
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
How was the training for the liberation?

427
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
It was...

428
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
It was okay.

429
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,400
How can you say that?

430
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,400
You'll remember it forever.

431
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Should I say it's a thrilling experience?

432
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
I need to wash up.

433
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Stand up.

434
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Are you going to the place

435
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
where the band came from?

436
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
I'm going to the place where the band came from.

437
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Are you going there?

438
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Are you still doing that?

439
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
You're not a former major, you're a first grader.

440
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
You don't even have time to sleep.

441
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
I heard that you even battled

442
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
in front of the whole school.

443
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
So you got a re-examination.

444
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,400
The son of the head of the hospital in Hanzu University is re-examining?

445
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
I'm sorry.

446
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,400
The band will stop soon.

447
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
I'm going to stop.

448
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Keep your word.

449
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,400
I've never raised you as a loser.

450
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
I was the best support.

451
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
I know.

452
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,400
There's a new life-size sedation surgery at 6 p.m. tonight.

453
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
So keep that in mind.

454
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
It'll help a lot if you see it yourself.

455
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,400
This is also a privilege for my son.

456
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Thank you.

457
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Come back soon.

458
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Oh, 300 people.

459
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Are you guys again?

460
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,400
It's pretty exciting to work this hard.

461
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Do you think you're qualified to make a band?

462
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,400
Besides, you said you were going to enter the special forces or donate.

463
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
I think you've cut some grass on the playground.

464
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,400
Or maybe you could have built some of Kang Hee-dong.

465
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
How many years have you been living?

466
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Do you still think that works?

467
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Did you donate $1 million to the medical school?

468
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,400
I don't think so.

469
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
I'm not going to do that.

470
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Do you think that works?

471
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
You're the one who donated $1 million to the medical school.

472
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Your agency also admitted it.

473
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
I entered the school after I donated.

474
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
That's also anonymously.

475
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
But does the agency admit it?

476
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
There's no secret in the world.

477
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
And you didn't make that up.

478
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,400
You didn't cheat to get a blackmail in class.

479
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Why? Why?

480
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Are you going to hit me?

481
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Yeah, hit me.

482
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Just kill me.

483
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
I was warned about the medical school.

484
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,400
Are you going to donate $1 million to the school?

485
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
I'm so curious.

486
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
You're making up a rumor about the band.

487
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,400
Why are you trying to chase me?

488
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,400
Can't I know?

489
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,400
I can't stand people asking questions.

490
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Apologize to us.

491
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,400
I should apologize to you first.

492
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,400
I'm not sorry for leaving the club because of you.

493
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
You can't be any louder.

494
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,400
I'm not sorry for leaving the club because of you.

495
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
I'm just trying to be nice to you.

496
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
That's not the point.

497
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
I'm sure you're right.

498
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
There's no other band in our Hanju University.

499
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
No one will apply for it.

500
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Yeah, we'll see.

501
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,400
I told you to gather up the president.

502
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
I told you to gather up the president.

503
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Stop bothering me.

504
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Can you clean up the faces?

505
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
I'm sorry.

506
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,400
My heart is burning because of you.

507
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,400
It's hot, it's hot.

508
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,400
What are you doing?

509
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Let's sing together.

510
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
I'm pretty sure that we're out of control.

511
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,400
It doesn't matter if it looks crazy.

512
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,400
I want you so bad, babe.

513
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400
In the morning when the wind blows hard.

514
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,400
I don't think you get it.

515
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
What's with the temperature difference?

516
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
You're so cute.

517
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,400
My world, I'm burning.

518
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Your cold heart melts.

519
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Bye, bye, bye.

520
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
What's this, Bong?

521
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Is this really you?

522
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,400
Thanks to Gyuri, I memorized all the lyrics of The Crown.

523
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
You're going to school with this, right?

524
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Position on keyboard.

525
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
How is it?

526
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
It's totally burnt, right?

527
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
Good. The song is good.

528
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
The outfit is good. Perfect.

529
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
I'm going to school.

530
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
I'm going to school.

531
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
I'm going to school.

532
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
I'm going to school.

533
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,400
The outfit is good. Perfect.

534
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
What?

535
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
We're pretty full.

536
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Everyone, do you know how much this is?

537
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,400
It's too expensive to even tell the price.

538
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:21,400
So you enjoyed it for free, comfortably, and for free.

539
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Right?

540
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
Yes.

541
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Right?

542
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Yes.

543
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,400
Hey, Kim Bo-ho. What are you doing? Are you crazy?

544
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Oh, my.

545
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
You were even listening to the free song?

546
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,400
Oh, I'm not trying to get a free ticket.

547
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,400
I'm just trying to get one song that's worth the price.

548
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Let's just sign the application form and go.

549
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
I memorized all the faces.

550
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Don't think about leaving.

551
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Then who's going to sign?

552
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Me!

553
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Anyone can sign.

554
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
What are you all doing?

555
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Aren't you going to sign?

556
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
You want to sign, right?

557
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Where's the sign?

558
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
What are you doing? You're even a student.

559
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Shut up and sign.

560
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,400
Hello, we're the band.

561
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Hello.

562
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
Do you like the band?

563
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,400
Hello, we're the band.

564
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
You signed this much?

565
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,400
What about you?

566
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
I signed it.

567
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
Hurry up and sign.

568
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
Go, go, go.

569
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,400
227, 228, 229.

570
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
71 people are still missing.

571
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Hey, there's still an hour left.

572
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Let's go.

573
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
The last sport.

574
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,400
From now on, you have to find it yourself.

575
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Huh?

576
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Run.

577
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
Hey, Bom.

578
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,400
You said you didn't want me to sign, so why did you change your mind all of a sudden?

579
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,400
I'm sorry, but I'm no longer the CEO of the four agencies.

580
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Four are now alone.

581
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
You.

582
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
I'm going to raise it.

583
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Huh?

584
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,400
Just because everyone is not good.

585
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Hey, wait.

586
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,400
The other is the main vocalist of The Crumb.

587
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,400
No matter how much they're kicked out of the team, they're all working.

588
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Even Sang-hee's husband is already heard and is already in line for it.

589
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
That's right.

590
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Brother, shouldn't you go ahead yourself?

591
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,400
There have been many bands in the meantime, but we were the only ones who survived.

592
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
So, let's see the two bands?

593
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
I'm going to go.

594
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
I'm going to go.

595
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,400
Okay.

596
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
Oh, my.

597
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
We have to go.

598
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,400
So, let's see the two bands?

599
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
I'm going to go.

600
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
I'm going to go.

601
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Don't you get heat?

602
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
This is a matter of our pride.

603
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Okay, I'll finish it.

604
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,400
I'll be back from class, so set it up.

605
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
Yes, sir.

606
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:42,800
Secret dance

607
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,120
Partly the Winter

608
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,400
improv

609
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,200
Facial nerve is following Basiton's face

610
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,300
triz envelope is formed of

611
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,760
Lo-ிn, Machileri, and mandibular

612
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,400
Facial nerve follows Basiton

613
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,160
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

614
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,000
Please try again later.

615
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,360
The surgery will take place at 6 p.m.

616
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,060
Don't be late and wait in advance.

617
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,660
Thank you.

618
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,360
Thank you.

619
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,020
Thank you.

620
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,400
Mom!

621
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,820
Mom!

622
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,400
Mom!

623
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,720
Mom!

624
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,760
How dare you push me into the house?

625
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,120
I only have a minute left.

626
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,160
How many people are there?

627
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,420
299. One is missing.

628
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,220
I can't just let this go.

629
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,820
It's Seoktae!

630
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,780
Seoktae!

631
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,580
Seoktae!

632
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,580
It's 6 p.m.

633
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,620
You must have failed to score.

634
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,660
It's none of your business.

635
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,620
If you're going to say that, get lost.

636
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,880
I don't want to get lost.

637
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,660
You're a loser.

638
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,480
You only know how to play the guitar.

639
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,260
There's another thing I know.

640
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,880
The guitar.

641
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,560
You're not late yet.

642
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,720
The king of the end will appear later.

643
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,580
You're coming in here?

644
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,480
Why would you?

645
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,260
Seoktae, what's wrong with you?

646
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,460
What are you talking about?

647
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,080
You said we should turn everything upside down.

648
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,520
I think I hear the dog barking from here.

649
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,360
I only play music with people.

650
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,760
I hope the band doesn't succeed.

651
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,560
What are you talking about?

652
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,880
I know that the guy we hurt is fake.

653
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,420
If we don't do something, we'll have to

654
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,860
pay off all the money we received.

655
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,080
It's worth 100 million dollars.

656
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,880
I got a foot massage.

657
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,960
It really hurts this time.

658
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,160
Let go.

659
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,620
If you're upset, sue me.

660
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,980
Before that, I'll get a diagnosis from Hanju University.

661
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,260
Why? Should I fix your leg?

662
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,520
You embarrassed punks.

663
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,080
Don't ever come near me again.

664
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,960
Okay, Hanju University's fraud.

665
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,480
If this goes on,

666
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,260
will our team be in a mess?

667
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,180
What?

668
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,820
What about our team's fraud?

669
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,560
It's fine, right?

670
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,180
Ha...

671
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,060
Do you not listen to others?

672
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,480
Move aside!

673
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,220
Move aside!

674
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,120
I mean...

675
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,360
As promised...

676
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,380
Sangil!

677
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,780
Thank you.

678
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,960
300 applications.

679
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,360
300?

680
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,060
What? 300?

681
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,260
300!

682
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,620
Hey, Bong!

683
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,100
We'll get 300 applications today.

684
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,820
You'll see what flex is!

685
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,300
Sir...

686
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,520
What do I do?

687
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,620
I've become a permissioned goalkeeper.

688
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,160
I can't go back to the half-time.

689
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,620
I can't go back!

690
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,420
Let's celebrate the dice-calling!

691
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,160
Ha...

692
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,860
Why are there only five of us?

693
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,520
Where are the other 2.9 billion?

694
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,420
I don't know.

695
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,400
Why?

696
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,500
I already paid for the 300 applications.

697
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,220
What?

698
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,920
It's the middle of next week.

699
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,820
They won't have time until the exam is over.

700
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,420
What?

701
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,760
After the exam,

702
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,020
we'll go to the intern school,

703
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,000
and then the college entrance exam.

704
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,820
No one will be able to get a certificate.

705
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,300
Right.

706
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,000
What?

707
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,920
If we get a goal,

708
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,420
we'll have to pay 5 million won.

709
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,020
What?

710
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,780
If we get a goal,

711
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,780
we'll have to pay 5 million won for the band?

712
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,780
Oh, Gyuri.

713
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,780
Me?

714
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,280
You said you don't have any instrument you can play.

715
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,180
Why?

716
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,380
Why don't I have any?

717
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,980
You'll be a stage planner.

718
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,620
How about it?

719
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,420
You'll be in charge of sound,

720
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,180
clothes,

721
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,120
sponsorship, etc.

722
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,120
You'll be in charge of multi-step.

723
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,520
Why is the story so long?

724
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,580
What should I write?

725
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,680
I know!

726
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,320
I like the 5 o'clock song better.

727
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,660
Is that so?

728
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,460
Oh, right!

729
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,180
I'm on a break.

730
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,320
I'm drinking and making trouble.

731
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,920
You can't drink during the break.

732
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,980
I'll grill the meat instead.

733
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,880
You?

734
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,980
Have you ever grilled meat before?

735
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,120
Of course.

736
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,780
Is that so hard?

737
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,780
Trust me.

738
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
It's so cool.

739
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,580
The room is here.

740
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,080
The room is here.

741
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,520
Trust me.

742
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,680
They all burned. What are we going to do?

743
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,160
Here.

744
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,560
There are some that didn't burn.

745
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,480
Hey, where...

746
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,160
Hey, Kim Boom.

747
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,460
You did a good job today.

748
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:02,780
Ta-da!

749
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,180
Nothing compared to cars.

750
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,460
Crazy!

751
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,980
That's very...

752
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,760
ALert!

753
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,620
Red coffee, maitre.

754
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,080
Goosebumps!

755
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,320
Look at my face!

756
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,280
What?

757
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,460
Hey, look!

758
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,180
Hey!

759
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:29,980
Hey, hey!

760
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,120
Where can I hide?

761
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,040
Spring has finally come...

762
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,420
With the miracle.

763
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,080
Spring. Spring. Spring.

764
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,840
Spring.

765
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:09,980
I'm sorry.

766
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,220
Hey.

767
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,980
Do you know Kim Bomi?

768
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,980
He came to see Chief Cho because he had something to say about you in the morning.

769
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,980
Kim Bomi?

770
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,980
How did you know about Jin Ah?

771
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,980
I guess he sold the song to Chief Cho.

772
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,980
Anyway, Chief Cho is on the outskirts, so I had a meeting with the CEO.

773
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,980
I heard a little bit.

774
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,980
So what did he say?

775
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,980
He said you were innocent in the assault.

776
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,980
He said he saw it himself.

777
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,980
Did he see it?

778
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,980
How?

779
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,980
I don't know.

780
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,980
But the CEO's reaction, Mr. Lee.

781
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,980
I didn't think about helping you.

782
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,980
How can you be so straightforward?

783
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,980
And then he asked Kim Bomi what you were doing.

784
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,980
But do you think Kim Bomi did it on purpose?

785
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,980
Don't ask me, just tell me.

786
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,980
That's it.

787
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,980
I don't think there's any reason to tell you.

788
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,980
And then he got angry.

789
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,980
How can you be so straightforward without a needle?

790
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,980
Hey, the CEO is coming.

791
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:11,980
Hang up.

792
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,980
I didn't think about this.

793
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:23,980
Why did the CEO...

794
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,980
He said you were innocent in the assault.

795
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:37,980
He said he saw it himself.

796
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:47,980
How did you do this?

797
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,980
Sang-ae.

798
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,980
Sang-ae, here.

799
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,980
Here.

800
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,980
Huh?

801
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,980
We're going to the library to write a report.

802
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,980
Do you want to go, too?

803
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,980
Do we have any assignments?

804
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,980
We don't have exams in the middle of our department,

805
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,980
but we only have reports.

806
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,980
But should I tell you something fun?

807
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,980
Unlike what it looks like, I'm a total nerd.

808
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,980
But I look like I'm going to study really well.

809
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,980
You don't look like me.

810
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:21,980
Thank you as much as you look like me.

811
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,980
Hey, Kim Bum.

812
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,980
Are you going, too?

813
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,980
Yeah.

814
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,980
I told you it was next week's exam.

815
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,980
I'll write a report.

816
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:38,980
I knew it.

817
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,980
Why did you follow me to the library?

818
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,980
You'll be out of line if you study.

819
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:54,980
I had a hard time today.

820
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,980
Anyway, thank you for being nice to me.

821
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:08,980
The head of the department abandoned the band, so it's going to be a lot of fun.

822
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,980
I came because of you.

823
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:20,980
If you care, you can take responsibility.

824
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,980
Instead, if you fail, you can quit or take a break.

825
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:28,980
I'll have to go right away to avoid school.

826
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:36,980
I'm going to be blocked by the promised support.

827
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,980
You donated $1 million to the medical college.

828
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,980
I even recognized your agency.

829
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,980
But the president's reaction is different.

830
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,980
I didn't think about helping you.

831
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,980
How can you be so cold?

832
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:57,980
Do it.

833
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:33,980
Dad, you can't do that.

834
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,980
What are you doing?

835
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:39,980
What kind of guitar is this?

836
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,980
You bastard.

837
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,980
You're going to do something like this?

838
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,980
You missed the good opportunity.

839
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:49,980
You're a band with a violent criminal who knows something.

840
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,980
You thought I didn't know?

841
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,980
My eyes and ears are everywhere in Hanju.

842
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:58,980
I know who you're meeting and what you're doing.

843
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,980
Throw out all your stuff right now.

844
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,980
I can't think of anything else anymore.

845
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,980
If you're going to do music, get out of my house.

846
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,980
Go out and live your life.

847
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,980
This is all because of Kim Bum.

848
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,980
Did you ask me to do music?

849
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:12,980
You don't even know your own share.

850
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,980
How dare you tease someone's son?

851
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,980
You're a noble.

852
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,980
All you can give him is sympathy.

853
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,980
You're going to meet a woman.

854
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:22,980
Meet a woman who's good enough.

855
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:28,980
You're a child who's not a child.

856
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,980
It doesn't matter if you curse me and hit me.

857
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,980
Don't talk about Bomi carelessly.

858
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,980
Don't you know who I'm doing this for?

859
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,980
It's all for you.

860
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,980
You're the only one who's doing well.

861
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,980
It's not for me. It's for you.

862
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,980
I didn't want to go to the medical school

863
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,980
because of your shame and your superstition.

864
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:47,980
I had no choice but to...

865
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,980
You punk.

866
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:52,980
Don't you have a smile?

867
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,980
Are you blind?

868
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,980
I'll do as you want.

869
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,980
What are you doing?

870
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,980
Are you really going to leave the house?

871
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,980
I'm going to live my life the way you want.

872
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,980
Are you going to go to Kim Bum?

873
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,980
Wake up.

874
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,980
What's so good about him?

875
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,980
Do people know?

876
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,980
Is your father such a backward person?

877
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,980
What?

878
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,980
Even if he's a talented doctor,

879
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,980
I think he's the most backward person in the world.

880
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,980
I think you've paid off your medical school license

881
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,980
for raising him.

882
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:39,980
Bye.

883
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,980
Hey, Seotae.

884
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,980
Are you there?

885
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,980
Seotae!

886
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,980
You can't come out now!

887
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:49,980
What?

888
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,980
We don't have any rooms left.

889
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,980
You know, the new room on the second floor.

890
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,980
The owner wanted to share the room.

891
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,980
When did I?

892
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,980
You started a new band,

893
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,980
so you should live in a house.

894
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,980
You're a bit lonely.

895
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,980
Were you lonely?

896
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,980
Then tell me!

897
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,980
No, I'm not.

898
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,980
I'm not going to live with him.

899
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,980
Let's get out of here!

900
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,980
You can live outside?

901
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:35,980
Of course.

902
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,980
It's a bit less crowded here.

903
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:39,980
That's true.

904
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,980
It was scary living with girls.

905
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:46,980
I suddenly have two tall and handsome guys.

906
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,980
I get double the rent.

907
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:50,980
Double the rent?

908
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,980
I'm the one who came to the right place, right?

909
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,980
Of course.

910
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,980
I look forward to your kind cooperation.

911
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,980
Why won't you all listen to me?

912
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,980
I don't want to! I'm the one who's the most backward!

913
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,980
Then you should have packed my stuff.

914
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:05,980
If it weren't for me,

915
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,980
I wouldn't have been able to keep my phone.

916
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,980
It's late, so I can't do anything.

917
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,980
But you can go out tomorrow.

918
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,980
I gave you all $5,000.

919
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,980
How can you compare it to free?

920
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,980
I'll pay half of the deposit.

921
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,980
No, I can give you all $5,000.

922
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,980
Then will you go out?

923
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:32,980
This is crazy.

924
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,980
How did he get into this school?

925
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,980
Don't you know that the first person to sign is the priority?

926
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,980
I was the first one to like Bomi.

927
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,980
Since middle school.

928
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,980
Then I'm the priority, right?

929
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,980
Let's play fair.

930
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:52,980
I can't let you and Bomi live in the same house.

931
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:54,980
What?

932
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,980
I don't think it's a bad idea to live like this.

933
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,980
We'll be at home anyway.

934
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,980
Let's go.

935
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,980
Hey, don't even think about crossing the line.

936
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,980
Don't even think about the smell and the snorting.

937
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,980
Don't even think about moving!

938
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,980
The president of the village is passing by.

939
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,980
The maximum speed of the moment is 40km per hour.

940
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,980
It's very windy and windy.

941
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,980
Stop going out and be safe.

942
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,980
Don't get in touch with the mountain area.

943
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:41,980
What's going on?

944
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,980
The president of the village is passing by.

945
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:24,980
The smell.

946
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,980
This is too bad.

947
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,980
When am I going to clean this up?

948
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,980
I'm sorry, but I have a lot of classes today.

949
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,980
I'll clean up after class.

950
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,980
Why are you leaving your friends alone?

951
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,980
Jingu said he was healthy.

952
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,980
He said he was healthy.

953
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,980
Wow, Jingu is old-fashioned.

954
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:57,980
Jingu's fat is running away from the club room.

955
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,980
Let's start cleaning.

956
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:22,980
One, two, three.

957
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,980
Wow, Jingu is strong.

958
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,980
Yes!

959
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:45,980
Here.

960
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:46,980
Yes!

961
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,980
Hey, are you done?

962
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,980
I'm going to clean up the room.

963
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,980
I'm going to clean up the room.

964
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,980
I'm going to clean up the room.

965
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,980
I'm going to clean up the room.

966
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,980
I'm going to clean up the room.

967
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,980
I'm going to clean up the room.

968
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,980
I'm going to clean up the room.

969
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,980
I'm going to clean up the room.

970
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,980
I'm going to clean up the room.

971
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,980
I'm going to clean up the room.

972
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,980
I'm going to clean up the room.

973
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,980
I'm going to clean up the room.

974
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,980
I'm going to clean up the room.

975
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,980
I'm going to clean up the room.

976
00:52:52,980 --> 00:53:02,980
Huh.

977
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:09,980
Please leave this on the phone.

978
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:16,980
Yeah.

979
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,980
Oh, Jina.

980
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,980
Are you the same group as Kim Bomi?

981
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,580
I heard from Manager Yoon.

982
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,680
It's amazing.

983
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,380
I heard Kim Bo-mi sold a song.

984
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,580
What kind of song is it?

985
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:30,280
It's unique, but it's just easy to sing along.

986
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,680
I felt like I had to sell it because I needed money.

987
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,980
He was angry.

988
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,980
I'll give you more, so don't be a coward from now on.

989
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:42,380
I guess you liked someone as picky as your sister.

990
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,480
It would have been perfect if you called me.

991
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,680
Too bad.

992
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,280
Is that all?

993
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,680
Do you want me to give you something as a gift for the band's birthday?

994
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,680
Tell me if you need anything.

995
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,180
Can't I be your sponsor without telling Dad?

996
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,880
No. You have more to hide from the CEO.

997
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,480
I'll call you again.

998
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,280
Are you already going to work?

999
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,280
Yes. I got more part-time jobs.

1000
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,180
I must have picked up more money.

1001
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:13,480
I can't come to school until evening.

1002
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,480
I'm going.

1003
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,280
If you're that busy,

1004
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,980
when will you practice and when will you practice?

1005
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,780
Three days a week.

1006
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,480
You must get your practice time out of your head.

1007
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,380
I couldn't go to practice even for a week.

1008
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,880
I don't have time.

1009
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,780
But I'll try to avoid any trouble

1010
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,480
even if it's at dawn.

1011
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,580
I'm going.

1012
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,380
I'm going.

1013
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,780
Hello.

1014
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,480
Hello.

1015
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,480
Where's the piano?

1016
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,880
Piano?

1017
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,480
I sold it.

1018
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,480
Someone wanted to buy it.

1019
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,480
What?

1020
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,980
What if I sell it?

1021
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,980
You promised to sell it to me later.

1022
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,480
When did you save up money?

1023
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,680
And I don't have a piano.

1024
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,080
I don't need a part-time job.

1025
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,280
It's okay. You can't sell it these days.

1026
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,700
I'm a part-timer. I'm a

1027
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,700
good son.

1028
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,700
But...

1029
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,200
But this...

1030
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,200
Ta-da!

1031
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,500
Is this really my piano?

1032
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,500
Of course.

1033
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,800
It's the seventh birthday gift for Bbom Bbom.

1034
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,300
Do you like it that much?

1035
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,700
I love it so much!

1036
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,000
I love you, too!

1037
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,600
This is mine.

1038
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,600
And you're mine, too.

1039
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,600
Bye.

1040
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,600
Bye.

1041
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,400
Thank you for everything.

1042
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,400
You're welcome.

1043
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,400
What's wrong with me?

1044
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,400
What's wrong with me?

1045
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,400
What's wrong with me?

1046
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,900
What happened?

1047
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,400
I'm buying your time.

1048
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,400
What are you talking about?

1049
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,720
I heard you're going to be a singer.

1050
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,720
I can learn.

1051
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,720
I have to make money to make a team.

1052
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,720
I have to practice for three days a week.

1053
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,220
That's all I need.

1054
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,220
Why?

1055
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,220
You're doing this?

1056
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:01,220
I want to be in a band with you for a long time.

1057
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,220
Are you going to sit down?

1058
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,220
Can't you see?

1059
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,220
Are you crazy?

1060
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,220
What?

1061
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,720
Hey, I'm going to go out.

1062
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,720
Where are you going? What's going on?

1063
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,720
Hey!

1064
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,720
Kang Mi-seo?

1065
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,720
What's going on?

1066
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,720
I wanted to see you, so I interrogated you.

1067
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,720
You don't think I'm happy about it?

1068
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,720
I was listening to the news through Jina.

1069
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,720
It's the alcohol you drank then.

1070
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,720
Coffee cocktail.

1071
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,720
I've thought about it many times.

1072
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,720
But I couldn't get an answer, so I came to ask again.

1073
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,720
Whatever crazy mistake I made,

1074
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,720
you can't do that to me.

1075
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,720
I'm sorry.

1076
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,720
I think I'm going to die.

1077
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,720
What do you mean?

1078
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,720
How long are you going to keep me from answering my questions?

1079
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,720
Are you avoiding me on purpose?

1080
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,720
Why did you do this?

1081
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,720
You're not enough to get me out of Crown.

1082
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,720
Why did you send me to school?

1083
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,720
What are you doing?

1084
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,720
Why are you looking for Kang Mi-seo?

1085
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,720
Why are you doing this to Bomi?

1086
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,720
What did I do wrong?

1087
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,720
Please tell me.

1088
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,720
You...

1089
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:51,720
You're doing this because you don't know what you did?

1090
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,720
I don't know.

1091
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,720
But I'm so curious.

1092
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,720
So I'm going to be that bastard again.

1093
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,720
You have to answer all the questions I ask.

1094
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,720
What are you hiding?

1095
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,720
What happened six years ago?

1096
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,720
I'm sorry.

1097
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,720
I'm sorry.

1098
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,720
I'm sorry.

1099
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,720
I'm sorry.

1100
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,720
I'm sorry.

1101
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,720
I'm sorry.

1102
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,720
I'm sorry.

1103
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,720
I'm sorry.

1104
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,720
I'm sorry.

1105
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,720
I'm sorry.

1106
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,720
I'm sorry.

1107
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,720
I'm sorry.

1108
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,720
I'm sorry.

1109
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,720
I'm sorry.

1110
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,040
I'm sorry.

1111
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,040
I'm sorry.

1112
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,040
I'm sorry.

1113
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,040
I'm sorry.

1114
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,040
I'm sorry.

1115
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,040
I'm sorry.

1116
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,040
I'm sorry.

1117
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,040
I'm sorry.

1118
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,040
I'm sorry.

1119
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,040
I'm sorry.

1120
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,040
I'm sorry.

1121
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,040
I'm sorry.

1122
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,040
I'm sorry.

1123
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,040
I'm sorry.

1124
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,360
I'm sorry.

1125
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,360
Why aren't you saying anything?

1126
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,360
Why aren't you as serious as that day?

1127
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,040
Are you...

1128
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,040
Are you Sang-ae?

1129
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,040
I'm so happy to see you.

1130
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,040
Why isn't he answering his phone?

1131
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,040
What?

1132
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,040
Sang-ae?

1133
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,040
What?

1134
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,040
Did he drink a lot?

1135
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,040
He was drinking on Friday. What's going on?

1136
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,040
Wake up.

1137
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,040
Can you walk?

1138
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,040
We...

1139
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,040
We...

1140
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,040
Mom?

1141
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,040
Don't be rude to Bomi.

1142
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,040
I can't help it.

1143
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,040
I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry.

1144
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,040
You're so cute.

1145
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,040
What?

1146
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,040
I'm sorry.

1147
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:18,040
Can you let me go?

1148
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,040
I'm sorry.

1149
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,040
You should be more careful.

1150
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,040
I know.

1151
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,040
I know.

1152
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,040
I'm sorry.

1153
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,040
You should be more careful.

1154
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,040
I'm sorry.

1155
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,040
I'm sorry.

1156
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,040
I'm sorry.

1157
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,040
I'm sorry.

1158
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,040
I'm sorry.

1159
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,040
I'm sorry.

1160
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,040
I'm sorry.

1161
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,040
I'm sorry.

1162
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,040
What should we do?

1163
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,040
But we can't have everything because we like it.

1164
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,040
Love doesn't have a order.

1165
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:42,040
I'm so tired of being so annoying.

1166
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,040
Guys!

1167
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,040
We're in the official lineup of the school festival.

1168
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,040
You should show them too.

1169
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,040
No matter how bad it is, it's a fraud.

1170
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:53,040
You're going to pay the school fee, quit the band, and even Kim Bong is in danger.

1171
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,040
Because of you.

1172
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:57,040
Is Bong in danger because of me?

1173
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,040
Bong!
