1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
She doesn't think physically.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,320
A father who's been through a lot.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:17,540
Exciting and heartwarming

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,080
bluntly andribly to me,

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,200
an punches she took every single third I configuration

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,380
sat down fighting to protect my siblings

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,040
She let me have power

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,480
that she sat down fighting for

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,740
even without considering my stations

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,100
It was simple that we had no future

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,700
Was something mad or spicy to her?

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,900
Will that make her not just as good as the thumbs you caught?

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,260
Something was wrong and hurt her

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:57,260
What are you doing?

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,260
If you're going to get drunk, you'll fall asleep.

16
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,260
Are you out of your mind?

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,260
What is it?

18
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,260
Don't pretend to be asleep.

19
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,260
Get up.

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:17,260
Bomi, are you okay?

21
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,260
What?

22
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,260
Why are you still?

23
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,260
He's just...

24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,260
But you're fine?

25
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,260
I'm drunk.

26
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:37,260
It doesn't matter if you're drunk.

27
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,260
You're a jerk.

28
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,260
Are you really sleeping?

29
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,260
You're showing off, aren't you?

30
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,260
You're still not getting up?

31
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,260
Hey!

32
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,260
Bomi!

33
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,260
Why are you so late?

34
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,260
I've been waiting for you.

35
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,260
I slept.

36
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,260
Bomi.

37
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:37,260
Bomi.

38
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,260
What is it?

39
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,260
7,300 won!

40
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,260
3,000 won!

41
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,260
What is this?

42
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,260
You were so mean yesterday.

43
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,260
Don't you know manners make people?

44
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,260
Manners make men.

45
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,260
I'm going to tape my mouth and sleep from today.

46
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,260
Are you kidding me?

47
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,260
I'm going to puke because of your alcohol.

48
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,260
Why are you so angry since this morning?

49
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,260
Bring him down for dinner.

50
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:26,260
He said he won't have dinner until after 7.

51
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,260
Hi, Sangyeop.

52
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,260
Good morning.

53
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,260
What is this?

54
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,260
I want to eat seaweed soup.

55
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,260
Who drank?

56
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,260
Kim Bomi, is it you?

57
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,260
It's not me.

58
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,260
She drank so much.

59
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,260
I don't know how to find her.

60
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,260
Sangyeop, did you drink yesterday?

61
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,260
Who? I'm a drunkard.

62
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,260
I drank a lot. I was drunk.

63
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,260
What did you say?

64
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,260
I think someone's talking about it.

65
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,260
Me?

66
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,260
No way.

67
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,260
I drank enough and came in and slept.

68
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:04,260
Good job.

69
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,260
Ma'am.

70
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,260
Yes?

71
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,260
I don't usually make this soup.

72
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,260
I'm going to add 2 tablespoons of alulose to organic tomatoes

73
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,260
and grind them.

74
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,260
Okay.

75
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,260
You're rich. I'll do anything for you.

76
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,260
For your information,

77
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,260
bean sprout soup is 10,000 won extra.

78
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,260
She's so mean.

79
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,260
10,000 won for meat without meat?

80
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,260
20,000 won extra for meat.

81
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,260
15,000 won extra for tofu.

82
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,260
I didn't do this.

83
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,260
It's expensive these days.

84
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,260
Kim Bomi, you made it, so take responsibility.

85
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,260
Bomi made it?

86
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,260
Oh, my.

87
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,260
You're the best for breakfast.

88
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,260
No wonder it tastes so good.

89
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,260
Kim Bomi.

90
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,260
It's chilly.

91
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,260
You remember everything, right?

92
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,260
Us?

93
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,260
Bomi.

94
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,260
Stop thinking about it, Kim Bomi.

95
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,260
Is this how you're going to be?

96
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,260
Why are you following me around?

97
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,260
Stop it.

98
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,260
Stop it.

99
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,260
You're like you've had a drink.

100
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,260
Don't be rude to Bomi.

101
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,260
She's one of the many girls you can easily meet,

102
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,260
but to me...

103
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,260
No.

104
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,260
You're the only one who can stand it.

105
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
I've never been easy on you.

106
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,260
You said it.

107
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,260
You liked Bomi first.

108
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,260
But you can't have everything you like.

109
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,260
Love doesn't have a order.

110
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,260
You two, relax.

111
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,260
You'll get in trouble if you do well.

112
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,260
I have something important to see you about.

113
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,260
Bye.

114
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,260
I hope you get along with my first band.

115
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,260
The beginning is the school band,

116
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,260
but the end is the band.

117
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,260
What about my brother?

118
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,260
I don't know. I'm not interested.

119
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,260
He left earlier.

120
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,260
Did something happen?

121
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,260
Did he say nothing?

122
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,260
Why are you all worrying about him?

123
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,260
Let's go.

124
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,260
Isn't this too much?

125
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,260
How can a person

126
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,260
not have as much eye-flash as a mole?

127
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,260
I would've been heartbroken

128
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,260
if I thought of my brother.

129
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,260
I would've lived without opening the car door

130
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,260
with my own hands.

131
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,260
I wouldn't have a manager,

132
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,260
no stylist,

133
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,260
no car.

134
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,260
I would've been in a daze.

135
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,260
I can't do this even if my house is ruined.

136
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,260
What are you doing?

137
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,260
How was it?

138
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,260
Was it okay?

139
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,260
I'm trying to act free today,

140
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,260
but I can't get the right emotion.

141
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,260
What if I don't cry later?

142
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,260
I'm a professional method actor.

143
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,260
I should try.

144
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,260
I don't think I need to explain

145
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,260
why I came to see you.

146
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,260
What's the reason?

147
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,260
Why are you wandering around me?

148
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,260
That's it.

149
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,260
In case you get caught by the anti-fans.

150
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,260
So you're following me?

151
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,260
Why do I feel like I'm more concerned about Bomi?

152
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,260
I'm worried about you.

153
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Why do I feel like I'm more concerned about Bomi?

154
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,260
Why are you taking pictures?

155
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,260
You told me to report to the Kim Boms

156
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,260
and the Street Women's League.

157
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,260
Why are you so interested in Bomi?

158
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,260
Leave the house right now.

159
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,260
Eat, hit, and quit school.

160
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,260
Don't hang out with Kim Bomi.

161
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,260
Don't do anything.

162
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,260
Even if you don't know what you're doing,

163
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,260
if you're going to fight with Mr. Cho,

164
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,260
even Kim Bomi will be in danger.

165
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,260
Because of you.

166
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,260
I'm telling you this because I care about you.

167
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,260
Is Bomi in danger because of me?

168
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,260
Why?

169
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,260
What's the reason?

170
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,260
There's something I need to make sure of.

171
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,260
If you touch a single finger of Kim Bomi,

172
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
I won't stay still.

173
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,260
What?

174
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,260
Let's look at the structure of the major and minor chords.

175
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,260
There are three common keys in the two chords.

176
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,260
Is there anyone who wants to talk about the common keys?

177
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,260
You don't look like you've seen it before.

178
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,260
What is this?

179
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,260
What do I do?

180
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,260
Hello, Professor.

181
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,260
I'm Lee Hwakbeom, a senior in the department of entertainment.

182
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,260
I came to the lecture because I really wanted to hear

183
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,260
your lecture.

184
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,260
You did?

185
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,260
Yes.

186
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,260
My best friend recommended this class.

187
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,260
This is Kim Bomi sitting here.

188
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,260
Hey!

189
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,260
When did I...

190
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,260
You said we should do good things together.

191
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,260
I'm sorry.

192
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,260
As one of the many artists who lead K-pop,

193
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,260
I'm here to participate in this class

194
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,260
because I understand and need to have a deeper understanding

195
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,260
of practical music.

196
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,260
The movement starts with the chord.

197
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,260
The movement is composed of two notes.

198
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,260
The two notes are the vibration of the two notes.

199
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,260
The vibration is the physical number of the vibration

200
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,260
toward the note.

201
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,260
For one second, the interaction of the two notes

202
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,260
is left one after another.

203
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,860
Don't listen to me if you're going to do this.

204
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,900
I'm so embarrassed.

205
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,060
I didn't sleep.

206
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,860
You must have fallen for me.

207
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,900
Forget it.

208
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,360
You didn't come all the way here, did you?

209
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,460
Where are you going?

210
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,240
Oh, I'm going.

211
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll wait for you.

212
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,340
You...

213
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,720
You really can't come?

214
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,720
You have nothing to do?

215
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,420
Look.

216
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,220
Everyone's looking for me.

217
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,560
I'm pretty busy too.

218
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,800
Yes, sir. I'll buy it.

219
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Now?

220
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,600
It's a bit difficult now.

221
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,500
Where did he go?

222
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,060
How could he just go around

223
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,420
all the time?

224
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,660
That's soggiating.

225
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,260
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,480
Junsun!

227
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,440
It's been six years.

228
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,580
Bomi's angry smile.

229
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,900
The number you have dialed is...

230
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
The number you have dialed is...

231
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,700
You're going home without a word?

232
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,560
You're so out of it.

233
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,500
What are you carrying around?

234
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,900
You're so annoying.

235
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,700
Come in.

236
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
Hey.

237
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,140
What brings you here?

238
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,580
Weren't you in the States?

239
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,180
I was in the States for a while.

240
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,780
You must be busy.

241
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,080
No, I'm fine. I'll be away for an hour.

242
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,520
Sit down.

243
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,280
I thought you were an antiviral.

244
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,620
Have you ever been awake?

245
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,960
I came because I had something to tell you.

246
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,560
Okay. Tell me.

247
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,020
What would you like to drink?

248
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,300
What is it?

249
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Tell me.

250
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,940
A car accident six years ago.

251
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,540
You remember, right?

252
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
Help me.

253
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
Help me.

254
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,720
Help me.

255
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,260
Help me.

256
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,500
I think I'm going to die.

257
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,900
This is a big deal.

258
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,680
We both drank.

259
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,140
Why are you talking about that all of a sudden?

260
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,640
A witness appeared.

261
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
A witness?

262
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,740
Guys!

263
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,740
The festival...

264
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,080
The first performance of the second and third season is finally here.

265
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,040
We're in the official lineup of the festival.

266
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,980
We're going to perform with the same band.

267
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,880
I picked the band.

268
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,080
It's the first performance.

269
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
You know, right?

270
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,960
The opening is the highlight of the show!

271
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Hey!

272
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
I'll be in charge of the planning.

273
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,920
You don't have any complaints, right?

274
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,600
No, we don't.

275
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,400
Then I'll be the sound operator.

276
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,760
I'm perfect at manipulating equipment.

277
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,400
I'll show you the sound of my sensitive hearing

278
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,460
that's like Beethoven's.

279
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,800
Beethoven's hearing is slow.

280
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,140
Hey!

281
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,300
Please point out more often!

282
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,240
I don't point out your fashion terror either.

283
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,340
What about my fashion?

284
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:29,980
Gosh.

285
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,140
How is it?

286
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,220
I'm amazing, right?

287
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,880
I'm a lucky swindler.

288
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,480
This is what a leader should do.

289
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,080
Hey!

290
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,120
What are you really bad at?

291
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,620
Well, finding what I'm bad at?

292
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,720
I can't do that.

293
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,820
Loopy, check!

294
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,260
Yes!

295
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,920
We should decide on the song first.

296
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,000
What should we do with the song?

297
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,660
What about the concept?

298
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,260
Of course, hip-hop rock.

299
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,260
From the opening, we'll show you

300
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,940
the real hip-hop rock!

301
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,400
Who says it's hip-hop rock?

302
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,500
This is a university festival, not a concert.

303
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,600
That's why we're going with hip-hop rock.

304
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
It could be a discrimination against a Korean band.

305
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,400
It's also a genre I want to challenge.

306
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,600
If you're going to do what you want,

307
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,760
why are we here?

308
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,000
It's the leader's right to decide on the song.

309
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,440
Why are you the leader?

310
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,700
Did anyone agree to this?

311
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,640
Do we really have to agree on that?

312
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,380
I made the band, Twosugat.

313
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,780
I'm sorry.

314
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,780
I'm sorry.

315
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Did you hear me?

316
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,340
I was the head of the band in Hanzu.

317
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,440
I've never been a leader.

318
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,580
I'll be the leader of this band.

319
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,580
I can't give up on my position.

320
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,220
My guitar skills are world-class.

321
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,580
You don't remember

322
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,160
how I broke your skills?

323
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,060
I just stopped because the guitar string broke.

324
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,820
I was happy with the song.

325
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,420
I never broke my skills.

326
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,800
Can't you figure out that much?

327
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,760
You're so stingy.

328
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,140
Get her.

329
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,340
Are you coming this way?

330
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,680
Hey!

331
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,160
Stop it!

332
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,980
Que! Open up!

333
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,160
How dare you!

334
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,180
Stop it!

335
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,080
What kind of performance is this?

336
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,680
Let's discuss the position.

337
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,980
Hey!

338
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,180
Hey, hey!

339
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,380
I didn't see it.

340
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,280
Hey, hey, hey.

341
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,580
Hey!

342
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,280
What are you doing?

343
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,080
Why do you have to forget about that?

344
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,280
You don't have to be in hell on your own.

345
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Are you sure?

346
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,680
Are you sure the four saw it?

347
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,080
How can you remember the scene of the accident without doing that?

348
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,080
And you're living with the daughter of the deceased.

349
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,580
The daughter of the deceased?

350
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,880
Did she have a daughter?

351
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,980
You didn't say she had a family.

352
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,280
I didn't say it because I didn't want to bother you.

353
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,080
There was nothing to die for.

354
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,880
You're so mean.

355
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,580
Why do you know so much about me?

356
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,880
What's really strange is that

357
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,680
Taeyang came into the house of the deceased.

358
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,380
What do you mean?

359
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,080
Where is he going?

360
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,180
Secretary Kang confirmed that

361
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,680
he lives in the same house as the four of them.

362
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,180
Kim Bong?

363
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,680
So the woman who died that day

364
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,380
is Kim Bong's mother?

365
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,380
Do you know Kim Bong?

366
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
Yes.

367
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,480
I've known him for a long time.

368
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,780
Since middle school.

369
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,880
You're making things weird.

370
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,880
It can't be a coincidence that the three of them live in the same house.

371
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,380
I can't explain why you're doing this.

372
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,780
But it's already closed.

373
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,180
The car slipped and died on the rain.

374
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,580
If there's a witness, we can change the story.

375
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,480
Do you want me to tell you?

376
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,580
Maybe Kim Bong already knows.

377
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,480
That's the place where his mother died.

378
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,180
If he knew, he wouldn't have stayed still.

379
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,680
I'll meet Kim Bong.

380
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,080
Why are you taking off your clothes?

381
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,880
You're not even feeling well.

382
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
You don't even think about the people who see you.

383
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,080
What are you saying?

384
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,980
Is it because you're jealous?

385
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,580
Then you should get some rest.

386
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,180
Why are you turning off the lights? Can't you see I'm studying?

387
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,080
Turn them on now.

388
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,580
The person who needs them does.

389
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,580
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

390
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,880
Me? I don't know because I can't see.

391
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,180
Darn it. Why are you stepping on it?

392
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,780
Shut up! Please leave!

393
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,380
I can't live in this house.

394
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,180
No.

395
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,480
I can't let this go down like this.

396
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,880
Shouldn't I at least attend a rock festival?

397
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
Gosh.

398
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
Notification.

399
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,980
A new band from the band club is going to be empty.

400
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,080
At 1 a.m. at 9 a.m.,

401
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,680
we'll start the school business.

402
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,280
You'll get a fine of 1,000 dollars.

403
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,280
Empty?

404
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,680
Why are you suddenly empty?

405
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,780
The atmosphere is so bad.

406
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,080
It's a big party.

407
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,980
That's why I'm going.

408
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,580
I want to bury someone.

409
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,380
Hey, here!

410
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Wow! What is this?

411
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,180
Are we riding this?

412
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,780
This is the celebrity van that we heard about.

413
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,380
It's so cool!

414
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,980
Good morning.

415
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,880
You're not late, right?

416
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,580
No.

417
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,880
Mr. Jo Jinho.

418
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,980
Kim Beom, how have you been?

419
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,680
I heard you're friends with the band.

420
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,280
Yes.

421
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,380
How have you been?

422
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,280
Thank you for lending me your car.

423
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:26,880
Thank you.

424
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,480
I haven't been to a music school in a while.

425
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,280
But I don't want to tell Mr. Jo about today.

426
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,780
Don't worry.

427
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,280
I can manage without my dad.

428
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,080
Mr. Jo, can you come with us today?

429
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,280
We need to get rid of two people here.

430
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,180
Okay.

431
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,280
We don't have enough time to clean up.

432
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,080
I don't have time.

433
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,180
Rich, let's go together.

434
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,580
I'm really into this.

435
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,580
I'll do my best to make you happy.

436
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,380
Isn't that great?

437
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,580
Yes, Rich.

438
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,680
We can pay you back.

439
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,180
Just pay me back.

440
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,580
Let's go.

441
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,880
Let's go.

442
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,080
Let's go.

443
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,880
Hey, that's not right.

444
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,380
You're going to get hurt.

445
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,380
Why aren't you getting better?

446
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,580
What?

447
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,380
What are you doing? You did that on purpose.

448
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,580
Sorry.

449
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,380
Oh, my.

450
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,380
I'm sorry. I did something wrong.

451
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,980
This is what happens.

452
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,780
When you get your favorite music,

453
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,780
you get so excited that you drive so tough.

454
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,780
You forget what you're doing.

455
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,980
It's okay, Rich. You can do it.

456
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,980
I'm fine.

457
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,480
Sangi, what's wrong with your car? Is it broken?

458
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,080
Are you crawling or standing?

459
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,180
Is it a stroller?

460
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,680
The top is all dead.

461
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,680
Why are you doing this to Sangi?

462
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,880
Hey, park it in the rest area.

463
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,980
You go to the bathroom.

464
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,580
Okay.

465
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,780
Go to the bathroom.

466
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,680
I'm going to eat fish cake.

467
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,080
What fish cake?

468
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,280
Hey, stop.

469
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,180
I told you to stop by the rest area.

470
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,580
I forgot.

471
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,680
If we go to the rest area,

472
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,280
we'll be about 100km away.

473
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,180
Just a little more.

474
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,080
Hey, wait.

475
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,880
Wait.

476
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,180
Sangtae, you can do it.

477
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,380
You can do it.

478
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,780
You can do it.

479
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
You can do it.

480
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,580
Hey, Bomi.

481
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,780
Let go of this.

482
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,780
I'll do it.

483
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,880
Hey, Seo Taeyong.

484
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,980
Do your best.

485
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,780
Oh, this.

486
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,180
I'm a professional.

487
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,180
And this.

488
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,380
I'll help you.

489
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,380
I'll help you.

490
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,580
I'm a professional.

491
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,580
And this.

492
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,080
Roll it up.

493
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,280
Okay, and turn it on.

494
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,580
Hey, Bomi.

495
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,980
Let's go together.

496
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,380
Taeyong, can you do this?

497
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,580
What?

498
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,380
This.

499
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,880
Oh, my.

500
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,380
Oh, my.

501
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,380
One, two, three.

502
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
Hey, Seo Taeyong.

503
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
Sit down there.

504
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,980
Why are you being so rude to someone who's not doing anything?

505
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,580
Who's being rude?

506
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,180
You can't be more rude.

507
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,580
From now on, call me brother.

508
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,680
That's right.

509
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,380
I can't call someone who doesn't have a learning ability

510
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,880
brother even if I die.

511
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,780
But if you want to hear it,

512
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,980
give up the lead guitar.

513
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,980
It's my pride.

514
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,580
If I take it, there's no reason to be in a band.

515
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,380
Then we're done talking.

516
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,780
I'll let you know as a leader.

517
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,980
Please leave our team right now.

518
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,980
You're annoying me all of a sudden.

519
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,780
You're the one who's annoying.

520
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,180
Why are you following Bomi around like that?

521
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,580
Admit it or not.

522
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,580
I'm the identity of the two companies.

523
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,580
Please stop it.

524
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,780
Seo...

525
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,780
Seo...

526
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,780
Darn it.

527
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,780
Hey, hey.

528
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,780
Hey, hey.

529
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,780
Let go of me.

530
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,780
Let go of me.

531
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,780
I said let go of me.

532
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,780
Let go of me.

533
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,780
Hey.

534
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,780
Bomi.

535
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,780
Bomi.

536
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,780
Hey.

537
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,780
Darn it.

538
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,780
Let go of me.

539
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,780
Move.

540
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,780
This is a crime.

541
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,780
Move.

542
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,780
Move.

543
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,780
Sanghae.

544
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,780
Bomi.

545
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,780
Bomi.

546
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,780
Bomi.

547
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,780
No!

548
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,780
Stop!

549
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,780
Darn it.

550
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,780
Bomi, drink this.

551
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,780
Shouldn't we go to the hospital?

552
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,780
I don't think we should go to the hospital.

553
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,780
It'll be okay soon, right?

554
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,780
Hold on a second.

555
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,780
I'm here to buy medicine.

556
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,780
I'll be right back.

557
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,780
Sorry, Bomi.

558
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,780
I won't fight anymore.

559
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,780
I'll do as you say.

560
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,780
Position and angle...

561
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,780
You decide.

562
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,780
Don't be sick.

563
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,780
I'll follow your orders.

564
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,780
You're lying.

565
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,780
I don't believe you.

566
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,780
Hey, no!

567
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,780
Hey, really!

568
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,780
Hey, look.

569
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,780
Guys get along like this.

570
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,780
We're now best friends.

571
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,780
From today,

572
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,780
we're best friends.

573
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,780
Are you serious?

574
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,780
What if we fight again?

575
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,780
No.

576
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,780
I swear to God.

577
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,780
Then...

578
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,780
I'll decide for real.

579
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,780
You guys have no complaints?

580
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,780
The lead guitar...

581
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,780
is ruined.

582
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,780
Oh...

583
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,780
Really?

584
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,780
Is that okay?

585
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,780
I don't have to do anything.

586
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,780
But Taehyung can decide the song.

587
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,780
Whatever you want.

588
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,780
I'll do that.

589
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,780
Then what about the band leader?

590
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,780
Don't say that if you're tired.

591
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,780
I don't care.

592
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,780
I don't have to be the leader.

593
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,780
The leader...

594
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,780
is me.

595
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,780
You?

596
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,780
Yes.

597
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,780
I'll be the leader.

598
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,780
I can't trust you guys.

599
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,780
I'll have to drag the lead guitar.

600
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,780
I'm planning it anyway.

601
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,780
Mom!

602
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,780
Mom!

603
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,780
Mom, are you okay?

604
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,780
I bought you medicine.

605
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,780
How's your cough?

606
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,780
It's getting worse.

607
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,780
I don't know if I should take the medicine.

608
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,780
Really?

609
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,780
How did you fall into the water?

610
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,780
What's wrong with a girl like you who's good at swimming?

611
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,780
That's the thing.

612
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,780
Bomi...

613
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,780
swims?

614
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,780
Yes, she's really good at swimming.

615
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,780
She went to the boys' competition when she was a kid.

616
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,780
You didn't even get a license to save people in the States.

617
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,780
Stop it.

618
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,780
A license to save people?

619
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,780
Kim Bomi, so you...

620
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,780
You lied?

621
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,780
You pretended to be in the water on purpose, right?

622
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,780
Then you caught a cold?

623
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,780
You caught a cold?

624
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,780
Yes, I lied.

625
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,780
Why would anyone come all the way here and lie?

626
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,780
I thought I was going to die if I made her apologize.

627
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,780
Hey, Kim Bomi!

628
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,780
Hey, Kim Bomi!

629
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,780
Hey, Kim Bomi!

630
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,780
Hey, hey!

631
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,780
Hey, hey!

632
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,780
Hey, stop!

633
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,780
Kim Bomi

634
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,780
The number you have dialed is busy...

635
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,780
Kim Bomi

636
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,780
If you know Kim Bomi...

637
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,780
If the police investigation begins...

638
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,780
Game start! Game start!

639
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,780
I.M. Ground, start now!

640
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,780
What? What?

641
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,780
What are you doing?

642
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,780
Why is he so funny?

643
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,780
He's not funny at all.

644
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,780
Hey, hey, hey!

645
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,780
It's a brand new song.

646
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,780
Why didn't they sell this?

647
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,780
Hey, get the money.

648
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,780
Oh, really?

649
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,780
Then give me 10 seconds.

650
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
Hey, this is a foul.

651
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,780
I'm not going to let you get away with this.

652
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,780
I'm not going anywhere.

653
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,780
Kim Bomi

654
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,780
Did you have fun?

655
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,780
Here it is.

656
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,780
I'm so nervous.

657
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,780
There's nothing to be nervous about.

658
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,780
I'm not committing a crime.

659
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,780
I'm just curious.

660
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,780
I'm just curious about how much money there is.

661
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,780
If there's a lot, I'll do better than now.

662
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,780
Who is it?

663
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,780
Who is it?

664
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,780
You're so annoying.

665
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,780
Who's playing around?

666
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,780
I'm going to kill you!

667
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,780
You little punk.

668
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,780
Oh, my God.

669
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,780
I'm...

670
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,780
Who are you?

671
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
I'm Seo Tae-yang's father.

672
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,780
I left my child behind and I'm late for a greeting.

673
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,780
Oh, yes, Tae-yang's father.

674
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,780
Tae-yang's father.

675
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,780
Teacher!

676
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,780
Oh, my mother, teacher!

677
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,780
Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know.

678
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,780
Oh my god.

679
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,780
You're on TV a lot.

680
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,780
I saw it all before you came out.

681
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,780
Oh my God.

682
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,780
Is Tae-yang not home right now?

683
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,780
Oh, yeah, he's not home right now.

684
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,780
Tae-yang went to the band's MT yesterday.

685
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,780
He said he'd sleep for a day and go to school today.

686
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,780
Oh, my.

687
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,780
Oh, I didn't tell you.

688
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,780
That's what kids these days are like.

689
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,780
They don't know how parents feel, right?

690
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,780
Can I see Tae-yang's room?

691
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,780
What?

692
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,780
I have to take my child's luggage.

693
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,780
Oh, my. Why do you need luggage?

694
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,780
I didn't hear you say you were moving out.

695
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,780
I just need to take the books.

696
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,780
Can I go in for a second?

697
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,780
Oh, yes, of course.

698
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,780
The house is small and pretty.

699
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,780
It is pretty.

700
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,780
When Bomi was alive,

701
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,780
this house was the best in this neighborhood.

702
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,780
There are so many flowers in the garden.

703
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,780
Oh, here. Have some coffee.

704
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,780
How did Bomi's mother die?

705
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,780
A car accident.

706
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,780
The car slipped on the way.

707
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,780
It was such a strange day.

708
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,780
It was the first day of my life like that.

709
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,780
It was an accident.

710
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,780
What a shame.

711
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,780
Don't you remember?

712
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,780
Why six years ago?

713
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,780
The news was all about the weather change.

714
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,780
I don't know.

715
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,780
I don't remember.

716
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,780
I know.

717
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,780
Everyone forgets about it.

718
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,780
We should forget about it too.

719
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,780
So you live with your aunt.

720
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,780
Yes.

721
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,780
When Tae-yang went to the U.S. for his study,

722
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,780
he met Bomi for the first time, right?

723
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,780
Yes, he said so.

724
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,780
Bomi studied music and went to study abroad early.

725
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,780
As soon as his mother died,

726
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,780
he left everything behind and came back,

727
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,780
but if he hadn't, he would've been in a lot of trouble.

728
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,780
Gwangsan Kimchi is smart.

729
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,780
Yes.

730
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,780
I'd like to meet Bomi.

731
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,780
Can I get her number?

732
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,780
5 billion dollars?

733
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,780
Are you serious, Mr. Cho?

734
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,780
You're donating so much money.

735
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:51,780
I'm so touched that I'm crying.

736
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,780
We can build another science museum

737
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,780
in the water pipe business.

738
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,780
That's right.

739
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,780
I'll name the building

740
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,780
after Mr. Cho and make it a memorial building.

741
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,780
I have a favor to ask.

742
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,780
Tell me anything.

743
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,780
I have to do something to make it happen.

744
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,780
I'd like to give a scholarship

745
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,780
to Kim Bomi, a freshman at the Department of Engineering.

746
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,780
A scholarship?

747
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,780
What kind of a request is that?

748
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:39,780
Please let Kim Bomi leave here as soon as possible.

749
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,780
The sooner, the better.

750
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,780
Okay.

751
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,780
Hello, Mr. Cho.

752
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,780
It's been a while. How have you been?

753
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,780
Have a seat.

754
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,780
I saw you at school once in a while.

755
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,780
I'm sorry I'm late.

756
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,780
It's okay.

757
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,780
Please feel free to talk to me.

758
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,780
Why would I talk to someone I don't know?

759
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,780
I don't hang out with anyone.

760
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,780
Okay.

761
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,780
Taeyang was at the house, right?

762
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:31,780
You heard from your aunt, but I went to get my things.

763
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,780
I really didn't know Taeyang came out without permission.

764
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,780
If I had known, I wouldn't have accepted it.

765
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,780
I'm sorry.

766
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,780
You're sorry to the end?

767
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,780
Now that you know, you can act like you're right.

768
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,780
Why did you ask to meet me?

769
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,780
My daughter is doing something she didn't do

770
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,780
when she was a teenager.

771
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,780
I didn't mind her being a band member

772
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,780
when she was in the department of gastronomy,

773
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,780
but she's a major now and she's studying.

774
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,780
I asked her to stop her club activities

775
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,780
and she left the house.

776
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,780
She's been skipping classes these days.

777
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,780
Did you know?

778
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,780
No, I didn't.

779
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,780
So I'm telling you,

780
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,780
send her back to her house somehow.

781
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,780
And don't get close to her.

782
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,780
What?

783
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,780
Don't even contact her.

784
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,780
You can't let her come into your house.

785
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,780
She needs to study.

786
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,780
She's a top student in a difficult school

787
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,780
and she's better than anyone else.

788
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,780
I hope you don't try to

789
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,780
make her feel bad.

790
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,780
Do you understand?

791
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,780
From now on, I want to work with my daughter

792
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,780
to save lives in the same hospital.

793
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,780
Please don't let my dream go to waste.

794
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,780
Enjoy your meal.

795
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,780
I'll go and make up for it.

796
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,780
I'll set the table.

797
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,780
What's wrong with him?

798
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,780
He's not eating.

799
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,780
I feel empty without him.

800
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,780
I'm not used to him around.

801
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,780
They're not dating, are they?

802
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,780
They're dating a lot.

803
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,780
No, the con man is following them.

804
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,780
The con man?

805
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,780
Yes.

806
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,780
The culprit?

807
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,780
Yes.

808
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,780
He's following them.

809
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,780
I was going to talk to you,

810
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,780
but can you come out for a minute?

811
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,780
I'll wait at the bus stop.

812
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,780
I forgot about my promise.

813
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,780
I'll be right there.

814
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,780
Where are you going?

815
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,780
Are you going to the beach?

816
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,780
Are they trying to get us together?

817
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,780
Don't be so selfish!

818
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,780
Did you wait for me?

819
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,780
Why are you asking me to meet here?

820
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,780
Let's go to a cafe.

821
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:29,780
No, do you want to eat first?

822
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,780
No, your father bought it for me.

823
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,780
It's an expensive tenderloin steak.

824
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,780
Did you meet my father?

825
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,780
What's wrong with you?

826
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,780
You're still in puberty.

827
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,780
Why are you acting like a rebel?

828
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,780
Don't make other people tired.

829
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,780
Go home, young man.

830
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,780
If I were to go home,

831
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,780
I wouldn't have come out.

832
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,780
I'm sorry.

833
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,780
He already took your stuff.

834
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,780
What?

835
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,780
How could he do that?

836
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,780
Listen to him.

837
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,780
Go home and fight, whether you're in a band or not.

838
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,780
Get your permission before you come out.

839
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,780
You're missing classes these days.

840
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,780
Why would he hit you when you're so bad at it?

841
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,780
Because I don't get along with him.

842
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,780
Then what's wrong with you?

843
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,780
How can you live with the right thing?

844
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,780
You died,

845
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,780
and your business went bankrupt.

846
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,780
Do you know what I thought then?

847
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,780
You selfish brat.

848
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,780
You lived with the things you wanted to do.

849
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,780
You gave up everything because of me.

850
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:58,780
That's why you swore.

851
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,780
You'll do everything I want

852
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,780
to do whatever I want.

853
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,780
That's why you're working part-time.

854
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,780
You want me to do whatever I want.

855
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,780
Do you think I'm living with

856
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,780
everything I want?

857
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:14,780
Yes.

858
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,780
You don't have to worry too much.

859
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,780
You're acting like a kid who's worrying.

860
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,780
Kim Bum...

861
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,780
I don't want you to come back to your father again.

862
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,780
Because

863
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,780
I was so jealous.

864
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,780
Because I had a dad who nagged me.

865
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,780
Bye.

866
00:45:58,780 --> 00:45:59,780
What?

867
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,780
How heartless, Kim Bum.

868
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,780
Bye.

869
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,780
You should've come earlier.

870
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:30,780
Where's the food?

871
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,780
I ate. What time is it?

872
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,780
With who? When and where?

873
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,780
Stop it.

874
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,780
Are you trying to make me lose my mind?

875
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,780
Can't you listen to me?

876
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,780
There's nothing wrong with being careful.

877
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,780
The world is so cruel.

878
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,780
I've lived in this neighborhood for 20 years.

879
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,780
I'm a woman who got a black belt in Taekwondo.

880
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,780
Okay.

881
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,780
You should be careful.

882
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:00,780
What about Seokhyeong?

883
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,780
What happened?

884
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,780
She was all gone.

885
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,780
Did she get dragged into the house like you said?

886
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,780
She's not independent.

887
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,780
Does she look like a pop-up?

888
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,780
You must be happy to be alone in your room.

889
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,780
You must be happy to be out of the house.

890
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,780
You should've been nice to me.

891
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,780
How do you feel about coming back?

892
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:44,780
Promise me you won't miss the class.

893
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,780
You should keep your promise.

894
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,780
That you won't go to Bomi again.

895
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:59,780
As long as you don't break your promise, I won't go to her.

896
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,780
I'll make sure the band is organized.

897
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,780
Don't ever get involved with her again.

898
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,780
Why?

899
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,780
Why do you hate Bomi so much?

900
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:09,780
It's not fair.

901
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,780
I don't want my parents to die.

902
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,780
That's not her fault.

903
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,780
If you think about it,

904
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,780
I'm the most mean person.

905
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,780
If you don't want to meet her, don't meet her.

906
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:26,780
Even if the sky breaks, she'll never be with you.

907
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,780
When I meet her again,

908
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,780
I don't know what I'll do.

909
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,780
You didn't forget to attend my surgery today, right?

910
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,780
It's at 2 p.m.

911
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,780
It's a major surgery that extracts liver, heart, and kidney

912
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,780
from a patient with a brain death.

913
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,780
It's a difficult surgery to see.

914
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,780
I think of you as a doctor's father.

915
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,780
Come with a thankful heart.

916
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,780
It's a perfect condition.

917
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,780
It's a study that only one person in our school

918
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,780
can get.

919
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,780
Bomi has good grades

920
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,780
and the professors' evaluation is good,

921
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,780
so I gave her a chance.

922
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,780
I don't have good grades.

923
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,780
It's at 2 p.m.

924
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:17,780
2 p.m.?

925
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,780
What grades?

926
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:24,780
You get good grades from all over the country.

927
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,780
Don't feel pressured or worried.

928
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,780
Go to a study that has a good budget

929
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,780
and a good technical department.

930
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,780
You can't even support your parents

931
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,780
who are in need of you.

932
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,780
That's true, but it's too random.

933
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,780
It's hard for parents to come to you

934
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,780
because they lost their children early.

935
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,780
But you're worried that they'll

936
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,780
compensate you here.

937
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,780
Come on. Sign here.

938
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,780
Sign here, Bomi.

939
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,780
I won't.

940
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,780
Why not?

941
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,780
Thank you for the suggestion,

942
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,780
but I don't feel sorry for you.

943
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,780
I'm not even allowed to apply for the training.

944
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,780
I have a lot of things to do here.

945
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,780
I have to perform here.

946
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,780
I bet two people are here to see me.

947
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,780
Bye.

948
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,780
I'm off.

949
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,780
Kim Bomi!

950
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,780
Hey, Kim Bomi!

951
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,780
128, please.

952
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,780
I'll take a look again.

953
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,780
I'll begin the surgery.

954
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:39,780
Yes, sir.

955
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,780
Mom!

956
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,780
Mom! I'm home!

957
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,780
Jota, get a grip.

958
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:33,780
Dad.

959
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,780
You're a jerk.

960
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,780
You're a jerk.

961
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,780
You ran over your mom and got beaten up.

962
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,780
How could you do that?

963
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,780
Don't tell Mom.

964
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,780
Who did this to Mom?

965
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,780
People who are weak always make excuses.

966
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,780
Did I raise you like that?

967
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,780
It's shameful that you're my son.

968
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,780
I'm sorry.

969
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,780
I'm sorry.

970
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,780
Did I raise you like that?

971
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,780
It's shameful that you're my son.

972
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,780
You weren't a proud father to me.

973
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,780
If you want to hit me more, hit me.

974
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,780
I'll beat you to death.

975
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:13,780
And don't ever talk about her again.

976
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,780
Again? Again?

977
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:16,780
You...

978
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:22,780
I don't know how much I have to let you go.

979
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,780
I know.

980
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,780
How can you give up on me?

981
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,780
If you can't dream again as a doctor,

982
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,780
will you give up on me?

983
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:35,780
What?

984
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,780
What are you doing?

985
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,780
If you have to be a doctor,

986
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,780
I'd rather be a button.

987
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,780
Seonjae! Are you crazy?

988
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,780
Are you a fool?

989
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,780
Why did you hurt your innocent son?

990
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:52,780
Where are all the people who fought with me?

991
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,780
You didn't know the basics of fighting?

992
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,780
Did you pretend to be good?

993
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,780
Are you going to hit me with your teeth or your feet?

994
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,780
Let go of me.

995
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,780
You should fight properly.

996
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,780
Don't bother.

997
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,780
I don't think you should get involved.

998
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:17,780
Is that so, sir?

999
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,780
I thought you liked getting involved

1000
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:23,780
because you're so broad-minded and you like Bomi.

1001
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,780
Let me do what I want because of Bomi.

1002
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,780
Enjoy your food.

1003
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:31,780
I'll pay for it.

1004
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,780
I'll set the table.

1005
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:45,780
Sir, you have to go in.

1006
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:48,780
You can't even take care of yourself.

1007
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,780
You can't even take care of yourself.

1008
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:06,780
If your father was a scapegoat for Bomi,

1009
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,780
you don't have to do that.

1010
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,780
I can't touch your father or Bomi.

1011
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,780
I'm a stalker for Kim Bom these days.

1012
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,780
I'm a total stalker.

1013
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,780
You should go.

1014
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,780
I'm going even if you tell me not to.

1015
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:31,780
If you don't live the way you want,

1016
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:32,780
you'll only be in trouble.

1017
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,780
Think about it, Seo Taeyang.

1018
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,780
Why is he doing this?

1019
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,780
Did he forget about the practice?

1020
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,780
I know.

1021
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,780
He's the one who made the song the hardest.

1022
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,780
How many hours has it been?

1023
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:51,780
Wait a little longer.

1024
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,780
You never kept your promise.

1025
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:54,780
Do it.

1026
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,780
He's waiting for his dear fraud brother.

1027
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:00,780
You don't have to go home like me.

1028
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,780
You didn't go home yesterday either?

1029
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,780
How do you always stay in the club room?

1030
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:05,780
Don't you have a house?

1031
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,780
No.

1032
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,780
Do I look like I have a house?

1033
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,780
No, not at all.

1034
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,780
Are you crazy?

1035
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,780
Did you sell your pride to a thug?

1036
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,780
If you're two hours late,

1037
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,780
you should apologize first.

1038
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:24,780
Stop it.

1039
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,780
Did you finish your class late?

1040
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,780
You should've answered the phone.

1041
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,780
It's okay if you're here.

1042
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:30,780
Just open your eyes.

1043
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:31,780
Okay.

1044
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:38,780
I'm going to start now.

1045
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,780
I'm going to start now.

1046
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,780
I'm going to start now.

1047
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:43,780
I'm going to start now.

1048
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,780
I'm going to start now.

1049
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:47,780
I'm going to start now.

1050
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,780
One, two, three, four.

1051
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:12,780
How did he know?

1052
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,780
What?

1053
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,780
Why is it not in balance?

1054
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,780
It's not making any sound.

1055
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,780
Do I have to turn up the volume again?

1056
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,780
No.

1057
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:30,780
How can I go on stage

1058
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:31,780
without any foundation?

1059
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,780
Is this why I can beat the Hanzo Band?

1060
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:34,780
Let's do it again.

1061
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,780
One, two, three, four.

1062
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:42,780
One, two, three, four.

1063
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:44,780
One, two, three, four.

1064
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:45,780
One, two, three, four.

1065
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,780
One, two, three, four.

1066
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:01,780
Who keeps making mistakes?

1067
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,780
This isn't a beat, it's a synch.

1068
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:04,780
Come in half a beat in advance.

1069
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,780
I went in right.

1070
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,780
I went in right too.

1071
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:09,780
They're not always like this.

1072
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:10,780
Do it again.

1073
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,780
Do you want to keep talking about it?

1074
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:15,780
The part where the syncopation comes in.

1075
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:16,780
If one person doesn't get the timing right,

1076
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:17,780
the sound gets messy.

1077
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:20,780
Look into each other's eyes and make a harmony.

1078
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:21,780
Bandana, harmony.

1079
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:22,780
Harmony.

1080
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,780
One, two, three, four.

1081
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:44,780
Come on.

1082
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,780
Come here.

1083
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,780
How is it?

1084
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,780
Good.

1085
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:02,780
Good.

1086
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:05,780
Come here.

1087
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:06,780
Good.

1088
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:10,780
Hey, you're stuck in the head.

1089
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:11,780
Stand there.

1090
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:12,780
Hey.

1091
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,780
Hey, hey, hey.

1092
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:20,780
Here again?

1093
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:25,780
Let's try to get the timing right again.

1094
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,780
Here we go.

1095
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,780
One, two, three, four.

1096
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:38,780
One, two, three, four.

1097
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,780
One, two, three, four.

1098
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,780
Who is it?

1099
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,780
I'm so hungry.

1100
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:16,780
Ro-a.

1101
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,780
We're going to perform at the wedding.

1102
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,780
We should come see you.

1103
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:20,780
Right?

1104
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,780
You're the one.

1105
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,780
Yes, Dawon.

1106
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:26,780
Hye-yeon.

1107
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,780
Juyeon.

1108
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,780
Are you up?

1109
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:38,780
What time is it?

1110
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,780
Three in the morning.

1111
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:41,780
Three in the morning?

1112
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,780
Then you should've woken me up.

1113
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,780
You're so sleepy.

1114
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,780
How can I wake you up?

1115
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:47,780
We have to go.

1116
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:48,780
If we stay out all night,

1117
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:50,780
we'll die right away.

1118
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:51,780
Take your time.

1119
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,780
The building is locked.

1120
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:54,780
We can't leave now.

1121
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,780
What?

1122
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:56,780
What do we do then?

1123
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:57,780
We have to sleep here?

1124
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:58,780
I know.

1125
00:59:58,780 --> 00:59:59,780
We can't leave.

1126
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:00,780
We can't leave.

1127
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:01,780
We can't leave.

1128
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:02,780
We can't leave.

1129
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:03,780
We can't leave.

1130
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:04,780
We can't leave.

1131
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,780
We have to sleep here?

1132
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:08,780
You should've woken me up!

1133
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:11,780
Why do you have to make it up to me?

1134
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,780
You couldn't sleep and you couldn't go home.

1135
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,780
Who are you to tell me this?

1136
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,780
Aren't you sorry?

1137
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,780
You...

1138
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:24,780
You didn't apologize to me.

1139
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:27,780
What do I have to apologize for?

1140
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:30,780
About that...

1141
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,780
You know.

1142
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:32,780
About what?

1143
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,480
Are you really going to stop being a drunk?

1144
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,820
You hugged me while pretending to be drunk

1145
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,020
after drinking, remember?

1146
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,480
But why did you leave without saying anything?

1147
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,520
Why should I apologize?

1148
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,260
I didn't do it because I was drunk.

1149
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:47,860
I just did it because I liked you.

1150
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,560
Didn't you also like me and stayed still?

1151
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,700
When did I like you?

1152
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,200
I just...

1153
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,800
I just thought of you.

1154
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,540
Oh, no!

1155
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,940
I think I turned off the lights. I'm scared.

1156
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,020
See?

1157
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:09,820
You like hugging me.

1158
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:14,360
It's dark now.

1159
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,460
I'm scared.

1160
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,300
Are you feeling better now?

1161
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,500
The moonlight is so bright.

1162
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:38,240
But why do you live so hard?

1163
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,440
I thought I was the hardest worker.

1164
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,520
I have to live twice as hard as my mom.

1165
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:58,220
I have to live.

1166
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,960
I have to live.

1167
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,160
And another reason is...

1168
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,340
You.

1169
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,400
Me?

1170
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:16,580
I want to raise you as my number one artist.

1171
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:17,780
You didn't know, right?

1172
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:21,420
That's why this performance is so important to me.

1173
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:26,220
Honey.

1174
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:27,940
Do you want to...

1175
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,320
Do it again?

1176
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,480
You should show them too.

1177
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,280
No matter how weak you are, you're still number four.

1178
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:42,100
You want to raise me?

1179
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:43,620
You?

1180
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,360
Do you have a contract?

1181
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,160
Why?

1182
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,340
Is the contract expensive?

1183
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,240
Yes. Of course it is.

1184
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,000
You said you're number four.

1185
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:55,760
You're being so mean.

1186
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,160
You have a lot of money. Just make it cheaper.

1187
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,760
You can give me more when I make money later.

1188
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,460
I'll give you wings.

1189
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:03,800
You have to pay for the contract

1190
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:07,440
so that artists can fly or fly rockets.

1191
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:12,540
First, if you sign the contract,

1192
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:13,640
I'll give it to you.

1193
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:15,380
Really?

1194
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:18,480
Then I'll sign it.

1195
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,220
Now?

1196
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,480
You know you can't waver when you sign a contract, right?

1197
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:41,860
Bong.

1198
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,100
I'm in your dream. I love it.

1199
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:59,220
I love you like my pain.

1200
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:03,220
You wrapped me up warmly

1201
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:06,220
and left me alone.

1202
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:12,220
You look at me and tell me.

1203
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:18,220
What should I do?

1204
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:19,220
Hey, four.

1205
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:21,220
Should we really go on a date?

1206
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,220
We met because it was our destiny.

1207
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:26,220
I've never been this happy.

1208
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:29,220
I think I'm dreaming of Yeji.

1209
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:32,220
Are you all ready to rip the stage?

1210
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:36,220
The weird guys came together

1211
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:38,220
and pretended to be four's fans?

1212
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:39,220
Is this your father's doing?

1213
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:41,220
What are you doing?

1214
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:43,220
Where's Bomi?

1215
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:45,220
Where is she?

1216
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:47,220
Where is she?
