00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,245
Whoa!

2
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,205
Dude, you're really
gonna film this right now?

3
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,499
Hey, it's our last day.
I wanna have something to remember it by.

4
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,461
"Something to remember it by"?
What is this, a school field trip?

5
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,920
Come on, you need to focus.

6
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,840
Watch out, hill!

7
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,304
1988 SAUDI ARABIA

8
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,249
Those crazy bastards.

9
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,927
They're here!

10
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,097
Quickly! Quick! Hurry up! Come out!

11
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,599
Okay! I'm coming!

12
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,820
Oh, no!

13
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:52,737
Oh!

14
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,704
What's up?

15
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:03,706
Yeah!

16
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,097
What the… These are guns?

17
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,309
-I knew this thing felt different.
-Get that sand off.

18
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,186
Brush the sand off!

19
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,773
These assholes
have never been in the army. Here.

20
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,443
Take it out.

21
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,906
Hmm. Mystery. Looks legit.

22
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,826
Is it a wanted poster or something?

23
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,414
Oh!

24
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,960
Oh my god.

25
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,129
Hey, Mr. Yoon!

26
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,549
Bro… I love you!

27
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,800
Ah! No, no, no! Hey!

28
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,802
I was just gonna rip up that shit.

29
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,305
-You'll really rip this up?
-You really like it?

30
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,223
It's Dong-wook's dream
to compete in that race.

31
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,022
Hey, you need a lot of money
if you want to compete there.

32
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,941
It's hard to make this kind of money
even in the States, you know that.

33
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,028
Anyway, if you wanna come back,
you're welcome any time.

34
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,655
I'd say you guys are the best drivers
in Saudi Arabia.

35
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,409
Hey, Mr. Yoon, sir. Um, Dong-wook
is the best driver in the world.

36
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,536
-Show respect and honor.
-Hey.

37
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,914
Even the Americans
can't compete against Dong-wook.

38
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:29,083
If you two start driving
around the US like that,

39
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,418
you're gonna be dead in no time.

40
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,961
Be careful, all right?

41
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:36,174
I was gonna charge you
for repairs and expenses,

42
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,968
but changed my mind. I like you guys.

43
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:39,928
Mr. Yoon…

44
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,056
May you live a long and happy life.

45
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,227
You have something for me? Huh?

46
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,895
You sons of bitches.

47
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,146
Of course, we do.

48
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,231
Oh.

49
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,315
-You do?
-Mr. Yoon.

50
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,859
Right, uh…

51
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,736
Get out of here!

52
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,947
You fucking assholes! Go home!

53
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,282
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

54
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,285
When you get back,
eat some jajangmyeon for me.

55
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:07,747
Hey, Mansour.

56
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,207
See you around!

57
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,750
Joon-gi, Dong-wook, where are you going?

58
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,086
We finished our job here. Going home.

59
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:14,921
Where is home?

60
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,800
Seoul!

61
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,468

Well, look who it is.

How's it hangin' guys?

69
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,583
You didn't get lost while you were playing
in the sandbox?

70
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,301
You two are lookin' pretty fresh today!

71
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,471
-Joon-gi
-Bok-nam!

73
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,307
Hey!

74
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:52,518
For you.

75
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,645
Wow! McDonald's!

76
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,106
-Yeah.
-Thanks, bro. You're the best, man.

77
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,151
Wow, what a time to be alive.

78
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,694
I can have McDonald's
whenever I want.

79
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,780
Hey, that's what's great
about the new Seoul.

81
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,783
You never heard that?

82
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,825
Hey!

83
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,660

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,874
Listen when I tell you,
"This is my car," huh!

86
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,334
Fine. Open the trunk.

87
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,212
I got a new car,
and I'm here to pick you guys up.

88
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,049
-Here.
-Good.

-Go.

93
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,690
-Drive!
-What? We didn't finish loading up.

94
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,692
Go, bro!

95
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,737
What is it? Huh?

96
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,655
Who are they?

97
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,866
I don't know. I've never seen them before.

98
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,951
You don't know?

99
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,829
Did you guys fuck things up
in Saudi Arabia?

100
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,664
Hey, hey. Hey!

101
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,332
I really wanted that burger.

00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,288
What's there to say?

112
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,290
They made a huge deal about fixing it up

113
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,332
because of the Olympics.

114
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,084
But knocked everything down anyway.

115
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,044
What did they call it?

116
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,380
Fucking "Priority maintenance
of visible areas."

117
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,715
Maintenance, my ass.

118
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,093
This is basically a war zone.
Look at it.

119
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,803
Sad.

120
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,724
Shit.

Ugh! That guy is such a dumbass.

132
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,104
What's his problem now?

133
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,232
Why does he hate you so much, Dong-wook?

134
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,192
What did you do, huh?

135
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,665
Whoa!

136
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,628
What the hell are you doing, Dong-wook?

137
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:08,839
Keep focusing, dumbass!

138
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,592
Watch this.
I'll show you the real Seoul "vibe."

Hey, Dong-wook!

143
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,155
Stop it! What the hell are you doing?

144
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,491
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

145
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,702
Oh yeah!

146
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,079
You're gonna break my car!

147
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,087
-Dong-wook! Dong-wook!
-Yeah!

148
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,759
Stop it, Dong-wook.
What are we doing?

149
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,220
-I'm gonna be sick! Stop!
-Whoo!

Turn on the wipers! Quick!

151
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,815
Argh! Where did he go? Damn it!

Hey. Thought you went to Saudi Arabia,
not North Korea.

166
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,384
Wow! You got so pretty.

167
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,094
Hi, Joon-gi.

168
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,471
How are you? I missed you so much.

169
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,181
-Did you miss me?
-Hey.

170
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,102
I told you not to ride that thing.

171
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,270
Hey.

00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,859
So you're an outlaw biker now?

175
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,862
No, that's what you are.

176
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,447
But you're on four wheels.

177

-Super hungry!

178
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,745
-She's right. That's who you are.
-…grill lots of meat.

179
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,956
-That's what you do.
-Whatever.

182
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,840
Hey you, come here!

183
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,270
Such a weirdo.

184
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,521
Hallelujah!

185
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,357
Brother Dong-wook, Brother Joon-gi,
welcome back to the fold.

186
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,567
Shit.

187
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,278
Forget about all those coarse sands.

188
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,907
This is a land overflowing
with milk and honey

189
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,992
called Holes R Us. Welcome to Joseon.

190
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,745
Welcome to Hanyang.

191
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,582
Why have you returned empty-handed.
Your comments, please.

192
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,501
Ah.

193
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,795
Oh! Oh, I forgot.

194
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,756
I left them at the airport because
some dudes were chasing us.

195
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,425
Ah, so you're saying
you didn't bring me a present?

196
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,720
Motherfucker! We almost died,
and you're worried about presents.

197
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,598
-Why is he so grumpy? He's hungry?
-Mm-hmm.

198
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,849
-Yeah, I got you.
-Hey!

199
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,560
What is this? This Jamaican?

200
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,271
How can you become even lamer
than you already are?

201
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,982
-It hurts me to even look at it.
-Oh.

202
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,486
Brother Dong-wook, you still have sand
in your eyes from the desert.

203
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,781
Let's get your eyes checked.
I think you need glasses.

204
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,033
Check it. This shit is fly as fuck!

205
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,536
Whatever. Where did you put my babies?

206
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,163
I put 'em in the back, asshole,
so they're out of the way.

207
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,335
Finally, it looks presentable.

208
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,587
Put this back where it belongs.

209
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,589
And get rid of all your tacky crap!

210
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,842
What's all this?

211
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,469
Have you forgotten, huh?

212
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,556
Who's been taking care of all this
for you?

213
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,058
And you didn't even say thank you…

214
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,063
What? Is that a customer?

215
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,066
Hey. Is that… those guys from…

216
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,610
Oh!

217
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,246
What are you doing?

218
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,373
Did you do something wrong?

219
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,125
-Come here. Don't…
-Who is it?

220
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,251
-Come back.
-No!

221
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,137
That sly son of a bitch.

222
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,056
Dong-wook, what'd you call me?

223
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,641
"Son of a bitch"?

224
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,270
Ah! There's a reason why they say
not to give people second chances.

225
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,855
You should be more respectful.

226
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,319
Anyway, Dong-wook,
you still know how to drive, right?

227
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,449
I just wanted to talk, and you keep
running away? What's that all about?

228
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,826
Oh! Would you look at these?

229
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,953
You never could give these up, huh?

230
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,582
This is why
you shouldn't be soft with ex-convicts.

231
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,960
-Hey, hey! That's burning. Careful.
-Shit.

232
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,421
Meat is expensive.
You shouldn't let it burn.

233
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,424
You're always talking about the US.
Is that why you're eating LA ribs.

234
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,426
Excuse me, sir!

235
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,762
Who are you? Can you show me a warrant?

236
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,389
Everybody always wants to see a warrant.

237
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,183
Kids these days, they watch too much TV.

238
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,685
-You watch Chief Investigator too?
-What's it to you?

239
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,646
You've never met a real prosecutor before.

240
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,647
AHN PYEONG-WOOK
PROSECUTOR

241
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,774
These guys met me a couple of times.

242
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,108
Here, give me that.

243
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,905
No, no. I've never seen him before.

244
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,074
-Don't touch that. You'll rip it!
-Okay.

245
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,159
You came here
just because we have this stuff?

246
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,827
What the hell! Are you kidding me?

247
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,664
You caught a lot of interesting things
in this camera. It's amazing.

248
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:00,250
I can't believe that you're Korean
with the balls that you have on you.

249
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,251
Yeah.

250
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,671
I told you not to film.

251
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:08,217
I know what you did last summer
in Saudi Arabia.

252
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,134
Hey.

253
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,972
What are you…

254
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,934
Wow.

255
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,939
Are you guys insane?
What on earth have you been doing?

256
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:25,693
You used to do illegal deals
with Americans in Dongducheon,

257
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,320
and now you do illegal jobs abroad
transporting dangerous goods,

258
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,364
violated the Foreign Exchange Control Act.

259
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,700
And then you put the money
you made in Saudi Arabia

260
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,660
into your mother's bank account in the US.

261
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,997
Your mother's in my file too.
Currency fraud.

262
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,961
You came all the way here
to arrest me for this?

263
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,963
A noble prosecutor like you?

264
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,840
You wanna make money abroad? That's fine.

265
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,299
But smuggling it into the country?
I'ts illegal.

266
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,300
11 YEARS IN JAIL

267
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,386
You wanna fix up a bbangkku? Fine.

268
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,096
But it's illegal
to customize your vehicle.

269
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,222
FIVE YEARS IN JAIL

270
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,434
Be a taxi driver? Great!
But not paying any taxes, that's illegal.

271
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,351
EIGHT YEARS IN JAIL

272
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,647
Do you wanna get the ladies. Fine.
But it's illegal to break their hearts.

273
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,648
3000 HOURS OF VOLUNTEERING

274
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,691
As for you…

275
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,361
you were born to the wrong family.
Guilt by association.

276
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,238
BAD FAMILY?
THREE YEARS OF REPENTING

277
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,615
What do you think you're doing?

278
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,243
Dong-wook, don't mess with me, okay?

279
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,746
At this rate,
you'll never make it to the US.

280
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,917
If I process on this,
it's not just an exit ban,

281
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,836
I'll also arrest you. Huh?

282
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,422
You'll get a longer sentence
because you're a repeat offender.

283
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,300
A visa? Not even in your wildest dreams.

284
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,803
Sorry to say that I'll be sending
this money to the national treasury.

285
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,222
But why would I decide to come
all this way for that?

286
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,934
Don't you think doing all this
is a waste of your talents?

287
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,603
You know what I mean, right?

288
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,522
You gonna live like an outlaw forever?

289
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,940
It's like moonwalking.

290
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,650
You keep going backwards.

291
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,862
Hey. You're a fan of Knight Rider, too?

292
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,865
That show has this really great quote.

293
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,117
"One man can make a difference."

294
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,578
So, what?

295
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,831
-Who are you and what do you want from us?
-Ah.

296
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,125
Who am I?

297
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,462
I'm the guy that'll get you to the States.

298
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,132
All right. Here's the deal.
I've got a job for you.

299
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,010
When it's done, I'll send you off myself.

300
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,429
America.

301
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,348
Let me get this straight…

302
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,310
You're asking us to become spies
for the prosecutor's office?

303
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,812
Bingo!

304
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,523
Yeah. Park Dong-wook,
you're all grown up now, right?

305
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,275
You're smarter now.

306
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,862
Why don't you take these cuffs off?

307
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,115
Then we can talk.

308
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,035
All right. Let's take a look
at our first target.

309
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,080
Kang In-sook, the president
of the loan-shark industry.

310
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,165
Now, she's the second
most powerful person in Korea.

311
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,836
Lee Hyeon-gyun,
a former Defense Security Command.

312
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,879
Now, he is Ms. Kang's sidekick.

313
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,090
These two manage
the former government's secret fund.

314
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,883
They're the worst of the worst.

315
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:59,721
However, recently the drivers
working for them have all been arrested.

316
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,432
So they'll be picking new mules, yeah?

317
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:06,436
I want you to go in there and get me
the information I need to take them down.

318
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,607
So you want to use us
to arrest Lee and Kang?

319
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,608
Incorrect.

320
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,568
Okay.

321
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,320
They're just the cherry. I want this guy.

322
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,240
REPEATED DICTATORSHIP

323
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,908
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, fuck!

324
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,034
You must be joking.

325
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,620
You mean the guy
without any hair up here? Oh, man.

326
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,957
You want to get the dictator
who likes to kill people?

327
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,711
Doesn't matter.
So we're just... gonna be mules, right?

328
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,753
That's right.

329
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,966
If you want to become their mules...
you'll need to pass their secret test.

330
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,676
And it won't be easy.

331
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,804
The drivers who are going to be there
will be the best of the best.

332
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,015
The test will be… tomorrow.

333
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,016
ENTRANCE TICKET
LA BAMBA

334
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,393
Tomorrow? But we don't even have a car.

335
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,853
Will a taxi work?

336
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,814
Say we pass the test, what then?

337
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:55,152
If you pass the test tomorrow, then
the Saudi Arabia problem will go away.

338
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:59,072
And if you find evidence
like their secret accounts ledger,

339
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,325
then I'll erase all your criminal records.

340
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,618
A clean slate.

341
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,661
And we're just supposed to believe you?

342
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,788
You're gonna forgive all our crimes?

343
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,582
Would you like it in writing?

344
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,000
That's not enough.

345
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,126
What?

346
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:15,756
If we pass the test,
I want visas for all of us.

347
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,299
We have a deal?

348
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,887
Okay.

349
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,889
Deal.

350
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,140
Is that all?

351
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,475
Oh, yeah... And John…

352
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,353
You'll be DJing in this plan.

353
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,272
I'll give you a separate set
of instructions, so be ready.

354
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,732
What "instructions"?

355
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,151
-Just be quiet, okay?
-Okay.

356
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,489
Get me some pictures with this, too.

357
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,033
I want to donate it
to the history museum, yeah?

358
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,910
I'll leave the car here.

359
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,995
It's new, so be careful when driving it.

360
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,998
Your tax money paid for it, okay?

361
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,918
What's he talking about?
We've never paid taxes.

362
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,337
I've been paying taxes recently.

363
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,590
You pay taxes,
but your license isn't legal.

364
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:06,306
Just like I thought, mules from
all over the world gathered in one place.

365
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,853
They're all gonna be desperate
to get some fame from this job.

366
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,771
JUNG-GU INTERIOR MAP

367
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,773
Give them this ticket,
they'll give you a film container.

368
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,441
You need to deliver that.

369
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:20,362
They'll start at Daehan Cinema,
and your destination will be Namsan Hotel.

370
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,780
You pick the route.

371
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,907
God, you're slow.

372
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,826
At this rate,
you're gonna be working all night--

373
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,911
Get the fuck out.

374
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,205
Unless you'd like to help, dumbass!

375
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,751
You have ten minutes, but your car
might get destroyed before that.

376
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,003
We'll get first place, right?

377
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,963
-We can do it.
-Yeah.

378
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,091
I could've carried these for you,
but they're so heavy.

379
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,801
What girl would ever marry you?

380
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,846
I don't care what happens to you,
just take care of the car.

381
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,556
Be prepared to fight.

382
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,267
I'm sure that it'll be dangerous
as hell out there.

383
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,061
Does he ever shut the fuck up?

384
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,313
What did you say?

385
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,983
Yes!

386
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,528
Ow! Ah, shit!

387
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,864
Moon Knight DJ, how is it going?

388
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,116
Hey, Dong-wook…

389
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,493
I'm no longer a DJ.

390
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,828
Then what are you?

391
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:13,165
S-P-Y. I'm a spy.

392
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,960
LARGE BBANGKKU

393
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,160
Ms. Kang.

394
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,126
He's in the sauna, ma'am.

395
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,049
-So what?
-You can talk to him when he's done?

396
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,780
A sauna first thing in the morning
is bad for you.

397
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,073
Don't be ridiculous.

398
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,036
Come, get in the bath with me.

399
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,373
It took me two hours to do my hair
and makeup this morning.

400
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,669
Sweating in the morning
helps you clear your mind.

401
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,462
You feel clean everywhere.

402
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,967
I can't.
I'm going to hire new drivers for us.

403
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,845
Fine. Get it done quickly.

404
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:54,474
He's going to start attacking us
right after the Olympics.

405
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:59,479
How can he do this to us especially
after we made him President.

406
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,857
That's how it works
around here.

407
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,443
But, if I'm being honest...

408
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,779
It's really getting on my nerves.

409
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,991
This should be considered our payment.
You agree, huh?

410
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,786
Our payment. That's funny.

411
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,082
Korea isn't some convenience store.

412
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,544
Anyway, it might seem
like he's soft,

413
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,463
but he is very ambitious.

414
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,468
He'll try to act like the boss now,
so prepare yourself.

415
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,887
After the Olympic's opening ceremony,

416
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,972
you should go somewhere with a great view,

417
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,474
and take a vacation.

418
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,558
Okay, I'm off.

419
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,941
A BETTER TOMORROW

420
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,570
Don't sell illegal tickets here!

421
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,244
Wow, what a beauty!
And it has an airdam too!

422
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,162
GANGWON 3

423
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,039
Just look at all these mods.

424
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,168
Oh! A BMW! Look!

425
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,128
And there's an M5, too.

426
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,838
Wow, M5. M5 is good.

427
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:08,924
M5 is okay.

428
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,842
An M5 can't beat a Grandeur.

429
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,469
-Grandeur's a superior car.
-Oh.

430
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,929
Hey, Galchi is here too!

431
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,015
What does he think he's doing here?

432
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,935
Wow.

433
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,896
This is quite a gathering.
Everyone came out.

434
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,109
Galchi, I never thought
I'd be happy to see you.

435
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,028
Thanks to you, we won't come in last.

436
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:30,946
Ooh!

437
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,284
John made this mix
just for our drive today. Check it.

438
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,453
I haven't liked his taste in music lately.

439
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,331
You know what John is always saying?

440
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,959
He says he's the inventor
of Korean hip-hop music.

441
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,336
-Yeah, really.
-He's being a dumbshit.

442
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,214
Just 'cause he's listened
to a lot of music, he's the best?

443
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,924
Hey, don't underestimate John.

444
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,426
John went to college
so he's got some good ideas.

445
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,053
We can't even dream of being like him.

446
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,433
Joon-gi, do you really need
a water tank like that?

447
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,727
Just worry about navigating the car.

448
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,105
Since the engine is bigger,
we need a bigger cooling tank.

449
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,606
Oh, for real?

450
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,919
RoboCop!

451
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,800
Top Gun!

452
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:36,761
Dirty Dancing!

453
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,930
Two Moon Junction.

454
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:43,977
La Bamba!

455
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:48,106
Ugh! I'm too busy for this.
Anybody for La Bamba?

456
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,442
La Bamba. La Bamba. Here!

457
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,198
DAEHAN CINEMA

458
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,483
Move over, motherfuckers.

459
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,986
All right. Let me begin
the safe drivers' navigation guide.

460
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,905
Turn right in 500 meters.

461
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,157
The curve is at two o'clock. Two o'clock.

462
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,129
Watch out, they're coming!

463
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,347
Ooh!

464
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,529
Ah, these assholes don't mess around!

465
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,740
Joon-gi, pump.

466
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:21,658
Yes, sir!

467
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,458
Whoo!

468
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,378
Oh, yeah!

469
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,111
Ah, ah…

470
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,073
Nicely done, Dong-wook!

471
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,783
Yes!

472
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,495
Dong-wook! Look!

473
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,955
Look!

474
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,790
Hold on, you guys.

475
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,258
Ooh… ooh.

476
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,936
-Where do we go now?
-Huh? Chungmu University is this way.

477
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,272
-Should I go in or not?
-Just hold on. Wait a second.

478
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,610
Go in! What's the worst that could happen?

479
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,862
Whoa!

480
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,951
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

481
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,831
What's up there?

482
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,334
It's the cops. Fucking pigs.

483
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,878
What…

484
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,924
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

485
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,133
OUR SENIORS AREN'T COMING BACK

486
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,969
-Who is this guy?
-What the hell, man? The hell is he doing?

487
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,397
Galchi's coming from the side!

488
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,067
Ah!

489
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,114
Hey!

490
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,617
Park Dong-wook!

491
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,829
Stop getting in my way! Son of a bitch!

492
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,581
Red Galchi, you're out!

493
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,047
-Dong-wook.
-Shit.

494
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,720
Shit! Fucking Galchi!

495
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,233
Dong-wook.

496
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,778
Up there.
Doesn't that motorcycle look familiar?

497
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,988
Why?

498
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,532
So sorry for the inconvenience.

499
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,159
We're regulating traffic for the Olympics.

500
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,036
Thanks for your cooperation.

501
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,708
Hey, what is she doing?

502
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,642
Yeah! She looks so good
as a motorcycle cop.

503
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:37,729
Shit.

504
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,377
What the fuck?

505
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,795
Oh! Whoo!

506
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,631
That's right! Eat that shit!

507
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,341
-See that?
-High five!

508
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,051
Yeah!

509
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,052
Me, too!

510
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,772
I'm going upstairs.
Make sure you get rid of those pigs.

511
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,814
Yes, sir.

512
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:28,613
Where is it?

513
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,365
La Bamba!

514
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,659
-La Bamba's in the house!
-Here, here, here.

515
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,160
Yeah.

516
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,955
Have fun watching it, huh?

517
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,166
Are we going somewhere?
Let's go. Come on.

518
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,087
Huh?

519
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,548
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is this?

520
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,884
-Hey, I don't know you.
-What the hell are you doing, man?

521
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,640
Oh, he's really sensitive.

522
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,725
-Whoa!
-Hi!

523
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,810
Hey.

524
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,770
What? Not gonna feel me up, too?

525
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,410
Come on, you dumbass.

526
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,703
She's here?

527
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,682
Congratulations.

528
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,643
-I heard that you came in first.
-Yeah, I guess.

529
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,021
Same team?

530
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,900
Yes, as you can see.

531
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,111
You got good style.

532
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,572
You look like a fun bunch.

533
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,160
This way.

534
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:44,665
Wow, she's pretty scary. Don't you think?

535
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,710
Are you scared? Don't be scared.
I've got a black belt.

536
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,800
Wow, MJ!

537
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:54,842
Huh?

538
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:59,013
I love this album.
Michael Jackson's my favorite.

539
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,557
Did we do all that shit
just to bring a record here?

540
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,976
Michael Jackson's a real artist.

541
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,605
I'm sorry I'm late.

542
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,530
Hey.

543
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,990
Have you ever been in the army?

544
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,785
Dong-wook and I were bunkmates.

545
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:24,664
-We both served as military drivers, sir.
-Huh?

546
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,790
And you?

547
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,127
Director Lee.

548
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,046
He's obviously too young to serve.

549
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,257
Men in the army are more trustworthy.

550
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:40,388
Now, you'll receive your job assignments
from Director Lee.

551
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,849
As you can see, he's a bit uptight.

552
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,642
You'll be dealing with him.

553
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,435
It's fine, ma'am. We're used to it.

554
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,775
Let me explain the rules to you.

555
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,069
First, do not ever touch the goods.

556
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,823
Second, do not tell anybody
where the goods came from.

557
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,994
And third, you work for us,
we are not your friends.

558
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,079
You'll be making ten deliveries.

559
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,498
And you'll make ten million won
per delivery.

560
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,917
-Holy shit!
-Ten million?

561
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,378
Ten million for each?

562
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,838
Totaling 100 million.

563
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,717
And if you need anything, feel free to--

564
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,926
I don't think that's enough.

565
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,846
-What?
-Have you gone crazy?

566
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:26,350
We don't even know what we're delivering.
One hundred million is not enough.

567
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:28,978
Oh…

568
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,230
That's what I think, too.

569
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,524
-Yeah, that's true.
-I agree.

570
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,984
Hey.

571
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,289
I like your style.

572
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:54,003
Once I step on the accelerator,
I don't stop until I go all the way.

573
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,631
That's good, all the way.

574
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:11,270
First five deliveries
will remain ten million won each.

575
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,482
After that, ten million per person.

576
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,567
Forty million per delivery. How's that?

577
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,028
That sounds fair.

578
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:22,448
In return, you have to make sure
you're worth the money.

579
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:27,286
Okay, then. But you start working for us,
there's no turning back.

580
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:32,875
Whoa.

581
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,045
Okay?

582
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,631
Now, go have fun.

583
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,017
You guys are so disgusting.

584
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,103
I think we're fucked.

585
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,021
-I bet that guy's gonna throw a hissy fit…
-Hey!

586
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,690
…'cause we fucked up the Sonata.

587
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,442
Or we can just buy him a new one.
No big deal.

588
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,320
How much can we get paid?

589
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,824
What?

590
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,619
Where do you think you're going?

591
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,331
You've got a job to do. Wake the fuck up!

592
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,459
Drop down to the ground!

593
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,919
What are you…

594
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,671
Yes, sir.

595
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:22,842
Down or up?

596
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:23,884
Don't.

597
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,769
-What are you doing? He's just a kid!
-This is not a game.

598
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,730
You really got drunk

599
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,233
just because Ms. Kang told you
to have some fun?

600
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,153
Are you some kind of bully?

601
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:45,197
Watch your mouth
if you want to keep your head.

602
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,841
Whoa! Oh, no!

603
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,888
Well, what now?

604
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,973
I can't work without my car.

605
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:16,145
Exactly. So you need to get a faster car.

606
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,690
Consider that the second test for you all.

607
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,443
You've had enough fun, get lost.

608
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,611
Dismissed!

609
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,244
He set the car on fire?

610
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,662
Yeah, that's what I said!

611
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,040
The camcorder was in there,
so it's also gone.

612
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,794
Ah, Lee Hyeon-gyun,
that crazy military nut.

613
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,003
He really is insane.

614
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:44,215
Well, be careful, all of you.

615
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,633
Can you get us a new car?

616
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,560
-Oh, my god.
-Ooh!

617
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,270
Pretty amazing, don't you think?

618
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,399
These were returned from the treasury.
Take a look around.

619
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,234
Wow!

620
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,444
Holy moly!

621
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,835
Wow!

622
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,212
Look at this! A BMW!

623
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,130
Wow!

624
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,923
Wow, it's a Porsche!

625
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,134
I didn't know these cars existed
in Korea, huh?

626
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,678
-This is paradise.
-This one. This one.

627
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,972
You can't tell me otherwise.
I need this car.

628
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,850
Come on! I'm the engineer.

629
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,811
-I need to pick the car!
-All of you, calm down.

630
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,688
Get your fill.

631
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,107
You'll only be spoiled
if you keep looking.

632
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,024
Come over here.

633
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:47,403
What? Seriously? What's he talking about?

634
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,535
What are these pieces
of junk here?

635
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,078
These are the cars.

636
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,330
This is the precious taxpayer's money.

637
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,082
You can pick one.

638
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,294
Or I can pick one out for you, yeah?

639
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,211
Huh?

640
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,672
Why are you doing this?

641
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,636
Isn't it your nephew's
first birthday party today, sir?

642
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,055
Why are you still at work?

643
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,558
Yeah. Don't overwork yourself.

644
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,352
You should go home occasionally.
Maybe try getting married.

645
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:24,356
Yeah, sure. I'll get to it.
Just stop nagging me. Okay?

646
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,816
Get to the point, I'm busy.

647
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,530
You really think this will work?

648
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,824
You're trying to get back
the previous government's pocket money,

649
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,784
is that worth losing everything to you?

650
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,913
It'll work, sir.

651
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,165
And if it doesn't, I'll make it work.

652
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,293
And it's not "pocket money."
It's their secret fund.

653
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,255
They're trying to launder the money
and run away with it.

654
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,049
I should just let them?

655
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,222
Well, they can try to launder that money
in their washing machine.

656
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,891
Their stain will never wash out.

657
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:02,144
You worked hard catching people
that are underneath Director Lee.

658
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,062
You get anything?

659
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,523
They're all from Squad 606.

660
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,274
Commando robots sent to North Korea.

661
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,901
Starting plan B with the mules

662
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,487
will be a lot faster
than waiting for them to start talking.

663
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:15,783
An illegal taxi driver and some kids
who smuggle goods in Saudi Arabia?

664
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,916
Look at them.

665
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,168
Strays, all of them.

666
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,962
That's why they're perfect
for the job, sir.

667
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:31,340
They're unknown, not by military,
police, or prosecutors.

668
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,301
What could be more perfect?

669
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,096
Hey. You know the person I work for
is the President, right?

670
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,016
And you know why he's not doing anything?
It's because his opponents are tough.

671
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,060
If things go wrong,
all the blame will fall on you.

672
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,604
I've already started it, sir,
might as well go all-in.

673
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,649
Pyeong-wook.

674
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,442
I don't know what you're thinking…

675
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,736
but this is it for me.

676
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,114
You're on your own from here on out.

677
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,740
It's unofficial.

678
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,534
A secret investigation.

679
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,244
Understood?

680
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,164
You're even worse than Kim Il-sung.

681
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,125
Yes, sir!

682
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,965
If you're done picking out your car,
go and get ready.

683
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,386
This car's a piece of junk.

684
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,263
What are we supposed to do
with this thing?

685
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:22,850
Hey. That's why I brought you here.
Figure it out.

686
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:27,354
Okay. We'll give up an imported car,
but we want an extra car.

687
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,692
You're the only person driving,
why do you need three cars?

688
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,360
Oh, this guy.

689
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,279
We need at least three cars for us--

690
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:39,908
Rule number four.
Do not ever question our methods.

691
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,160
Rule number four?

692
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,912
What are the other three?

693
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,624
Anyway, give us one more car.

694
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,875
I want the Grandeur.

695
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,752
Huh? There's a Grandeur here?

696
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,045
I didn't see it, either.

697
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,173
It's right over there!

698
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,719
No, there's not.

699
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,347
-There's no Grandeur available.
-Let's go.

700
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,015
Why not? You told us
to pick one out from here.

701
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,643
Well, we don't have
a Grandeur available, okay?

702
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,396
Oh!

703
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,774
What's that? Isn't that a Grandeur?

704
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,609
Hey!

705
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,110
That's…

706
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,238
That's my car.

707
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,741
You can't have that.

708
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,088
Hey, hey, hey!

709
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,302
My brand-new car.

710
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,183
Move your smelly feet.

711
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,893
-Come on!
-My feet aren't smelly!

712
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,603
-It smells unbelievable disgusting.
-Gross, man!

713
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,438
-Come on, get out!
-It doesn't make any sense.

714
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,816
-Hurry up! Get out!
-We're gonna die at this rate.

715
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,150
-Dude, get going!
-I'm trying!

716
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,860
Get out of my way!

717
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:57,778
Hello, sir.

718
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,072
Joon-gi, why's your tailbone so sharp?

719
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,532
Are you all going in at once?

720
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,200
Why?

721
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,787
Do you travel as a pack everywhere?
It's so noisy.

722
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:08,747
Yeah.

723
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,208
Let's go.

724
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,836
We make too much noise?

725
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,456
Try not to be too surprised.

726
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,207
Pssh.

727
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:53,917
Here!

728
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,508
Oh my god.

729
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,927
How much is that?

730
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,388
About… five billion won?

731
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,141
-Probably a bit more than that.
-Five billion won?

732
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,727
Not 500 won? I see now.

733
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:16,273
Well, it's not that much, so you should
be able to get the job done quickly.

734
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,859
What you need to do
is to take this money and buy

735
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,569
what I tell you to buy.

736
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,488
Simple, yes?

737
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:23,405
Mmm.

738
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,833
THE DELIVERY PLAN

739
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,846
-Let's go.
-Okay!

740
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:52,434
First, our car needs to be cool.

741
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,645
We'll turn it into a Pony pick-up.

742
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,730
Engine's coming down.

743
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,690
The engine will be from the Grandeur.

744
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,151
The suspension and the seats
will be from the Concord.

745
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,863
We'll combine three cars into one.

746
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,908
The three of us need to be in the car,

747
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:11,245
so we'll upgrade the Pony
to sit three people.

748
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,664
-The key part of this plan…
-Stop!

749
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:14,915
…is the intercooler.

750
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,334
This is so cool.
I've always wanted to do this.

751
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,297
Cooler, cooler, intercooler!

752
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,215
Cool!

753
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,220
What color should it be? All black.

754
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,102
Good job.

755
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,106
We'll inch up the tires

756
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,399
and lower the body.

757
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,029
The handle will be a D-curve.

758
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:48,866
Yes.

759
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,203
With a side of hydraulics.

760
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,963
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah…

761
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,715
Yo, yo!

762
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,051
Mixtape to make you drive faster.

763
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,638
You get it? Your own vibe.
Drift the car with a tempo. Okay?

764
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,473
-Okay?
-Peace!

765
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,433
Good shit.

766
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,602
Let's go.

767
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,987
Have fun now. You got this!

768
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:27,988
Let's do this!

769
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,159
LARGE BBANGKKU

770
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:42,502
Driver!

771
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,633
Start your engine!

772
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,516
Go!

773
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,359
SEOUL STATION

774
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,781
You'll start your deliveries today.

775
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,576
You must make sure that you're never late.

776
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,580
Once you've completed your delivery,
you'll get a stamp.

777
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,665
WELL DONE!

778
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,834
NAMDAEMUN

779
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:26,171
Make half the deliveries
and you'll get a bonus from the president

780
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,798
each time you get five stamps.

781
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,384
-We got another stamp?
-Good work, right?

782
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,350
HAN RIVER

783
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,338
Thank you.

784
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,306
Thank you!

785
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,309
Dong-wook,
one apple and one grape.

786
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,227
EULJIRO

787
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,778
Dong-wook! Hurry, hurry!
What's going on?

788
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:36,783
Get up!

789
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,452
Stop right there!

790
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,619
Hey, you!

791
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,829
It's the cops!

792
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:43,248
-Ah!
-We need to go!

793
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:16,114
Well, that's why you were followed.
It's not a fucking fashion show.

794
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,242
Why do you have to be so ostentatious?

795
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:20,702
Do you have no shame?

796
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,162
I'm not ashamed, sir.

797
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,997
True.

798
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,542
No matter where we go,
the cops always find us.

799
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,504
Director Lee has me worried.
He's watching.

800
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,964
That's because Lee Hyeon-gyun
doesn't trust you.

801
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:34,925
And the cops, they have orders.

802
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,468
The new resident of The Blue House

803
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,261
is trying to get the dirt
on the former resident.

804
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,056
He wants him to cough out
the money he stole.

805
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,392
You guys are moving it
before he can get it.

806
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,519
Hmm.

807
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,395
Which house is the blue one?

808
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,855
-Hey.
-Hey.

809
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,233
Please don't talk.

810
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:55,320
Also, I saw their men take
something else out of the boxes

811
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:57,781
other than the stuffed tigers.
You know about this?

812
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:20,178
There's also a secret room
inside the penthouse.

813
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,304
Really?

814
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,224
The accounting ledger
is probably hidden in there.

815
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,184
Ms. Kang is very careful.

816
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:29,020
You know, Ms. Kang likes me a lot.

817
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,355
So I can look into it.

818
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:31,982
Just watch what they're doing.

819
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,484
Don't do anything stupid. Don't get hurt.

820
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,236
I'm gonna make some drinks.
Give 'em to me.

821
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,323
-How many deliveries you have left?
-We're almost done with them.

822
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,577
-We have a couple more and--
-Why would you mix beer and soju?.

823
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,539
I wish you success with your deliveries.

824
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,166
May they go smoothly.

825
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,333
Here, drink up.

826
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,920
This is my invention.
It's called "so-beer."

827
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,505
-It's totally bomb.
-Hey!

828
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,591
Yo!

829
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,660
BONUS

830
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,829
We got a bonus!

831
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,521
Hey! What are you doing?

832
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,856
-Take a look at this.
-Huh?

833
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:57,776
Ooh!

834
00:53:58,526 --> 00:53:59,361
It's not bad.

835
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,197
Coke!

836
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,369
Yeah!

837
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,079
John! Whoo!

838
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,749
Yeah! Whoo!

839
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,004
-What's gotten into him? Hey!
-Hey!

840
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,301
You asshole!

841
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,055
-All right! Here we go!
-You're asking for it now.

842
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:35,939
Hmm.

843
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:40,527
You're looking good lately.
Not working too hard?

844
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,321
Is it obvious? I get paid ten times more
than at the clubs.

845
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,365
I'll be fine working
at Madam President's parties.

846
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,866
-Best job ever.
-Whatever.

847
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,578
"Madam President"? You're basically
her lapdog now, aren't you?

848
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,372
I'm a real piece of shit.

849
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,374
At school, I was worried
about social justice and stuff.

850
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,377
For someone who's never been to America,
you sure talk like one.

851
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,004
It's like you were born there.

852
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,673
Appearance is all that matters.

853
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:05,302
Faith, hope, love, and good looks.

854
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,221
I can tell that you majored
in theology in college.

855
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:11,641
-I am so blessed.
-My Lord! Hallelujah!

856
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,810
How much do you think
an apartment like that costs?

857
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,813
One hundred million won.
That's what people said on TV.

858
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,898
That's expensive as hell.

859
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,734
It doesn't even look that cool.

860
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,277
It looks really cool, actually.

861
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,739
Hey, shouldn't you head out?
What if you get caught?

862
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,408
I was about to leave anyway.

863
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,368
I have something to do in Apgujeong.

864
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,203
Are you going on a date?

865
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,913
Who is it this time? Yoon-gea?

866
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:35,790
You psychic or something?

867
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:41,504
-Help me, Lord! Amen. Bye.
-Bye.

868
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,673
What? Do we know her, huh?

869
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,969
Those glasses are ugly.
Why did you buy them?

870
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,220
They're not ugly.

871
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:52,265
-Wait. What's that? Hey. What's that?
-It looks good on you.

872
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,267
-Wow! That's…
-Wow. Cool!

873
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,727
Look at this, Joon-gi.

874
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:59,397
-It's a Mercedes-Benz!
-It has wipers on the headlights!

875
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:02,317
-Wow. Those tires!
-Steel-belted radios, they're so cool.

876
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,863
-Look at this stamp, Joon-gi.
-Wow, Mercedes-Benz is a nice car.

877
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,448
Why is this window so dark?

878
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:12,202
Holy shit! Excuse me, Madam President.
How are you?

879
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,288
Oh, hello.

880
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,332
You all look so stylish.

881
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,834
Hey, what can I say?
We do clean up nicely.

882
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,753
That's nice.

883
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:24,506
I prepared something for you,
since you're all getting a present today.

884
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,590
-I hope you like them.
-A present!

885
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,593
You can get it from my secretary.

886
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,222
-What does she have there? Is it a bag?
-What is it?

887
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,600
Okay. See you all later.

888
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,435
-Goodbye, Ms. Kang.
-Thank you.

889
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,395
Goodbye, then.

890
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,732
Beautiful car.

891
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:46,861
An envelope.

892
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,572
What is it?

893
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,159
Purchase contract?

894
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:54,411
An apartment?

895
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,371
-Huh?
-Is this…

896
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:59,207
-That's right. It's your bonus.
-Oh, wow.

897
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:02,210
Wait, th-this apartment, where is it?

898
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,716
It's that one!

899
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:11,845
Oh my god!

900
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,764
Dong-wook… Dong-wook, we're rich now!

901
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:19,853
Yeah! That's like… like, the Los Angeles
and Beverly Hills of Korea! Right?

902
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,771
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Wow!

903
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,274
Look, guys,
this place has two whole bathrooms!

904
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,025
Oh my god! I get my own bathroom!

905
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,820
-Do we need to go to California?
-Oh!

906
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,157
Here's the key and some money for dinner.

907
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:35,535
You don't have any deliveries today
so just enjoy yourselves.

908
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:36,703
Wow!

909
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,164
-Apgujeong!
-Wow.

910
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,961
Joon-gi, how many zeros are there?

911
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:50,717
One, two, three, four
five, six, seven, eight, 100 million.

912
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,385
-Whoa!
-Oh, yeah!

913
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,472
Step on it!

914
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,522
Faster!

915
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,608
MBC CAMERA RAID

916
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,694
We're in front of a night club in Itaewon.

917
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,112
It is now past midnight.

918
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:15,158
This place is an entertainment district
with over 280 neon signs.

919
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,660
-Hey! Whoa!
-Sir, can you tell me why you're fighting?

920
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,121
-This asshole hit me first.
-What are you doing?

921
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,414
-He hit me first!
-You're drunk!

922
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:24,959
These men are causing
a very public disturbance here tonight.

923
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,753
-Please, sir, go home.
-Did you hit me?

924
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:27,962
It wasn't me, sir.

925
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,423
I've tried to stop them…

926
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,091
Nobody's else is trying to stop them.

927
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,010
-Asshole!
-Please don't do this, sir.

928
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:37,597
They look so stupid when they're drunk
and fighting like little boys.

929
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,515
Let go of me.

930
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,768
You need to be able
to control yourself sometimes.

931
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,561
You can't stay there!

932
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:44,896
You're out here pretty late.

933
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:47,273
Are you not worried
about what other people will think?

934
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:50,401
Not at all. I don't care
what people think.

935
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,320
I wear what I want.

936
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:54,572
Because I love the way I look.

937
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,115
Very good.

938
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,577
I'm Reporter Ji Pyeong-hwan,

939
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,663
reporting for MBC Camera Raid.

940
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,498
Have you lost your minds?

941
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,500
Why would you let your face
be caught on camera?

942
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,918
Are you insane? Huh?

943
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:08,711
Stay on your toes!

944
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,298
The festival is arranged by the…

945
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,218
Wow, I can't believe we made the news.
What a milestone!

946
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,220
This should be a family heirloom.

947
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,764
Wow, Joon-gi.
Your liver must be made of steel.

948
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,100
I'm suffering over here.

949
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,143
SEOUL OLYMPIC LIVE BROADCAST
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER

950
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,103
What's that?

951
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,145
PRE-SHOW EVENT
SOBANGCHA

952
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,356
Hey, that's SoBangCha.
Let's go see SoBangCha!

953
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,025
Come on, let's go see SoBangCha!

954
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,112
Please? Can we go see SoBangCha? Come on.

955
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,030
Please. You can ride
on my motorcycle if we go.

956
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,616
-Let's go, please.
-SoBangCha? You're making me nauseous.

957
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,618
I'm still hungover. I'm not going.

958
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:44,205
-…SoBangCha, Byeon Jin-su, Lee Ji-young…
-Lee Sang-eun.

959
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,708
You know that song "Damdadi"
by Lee Sang-eun?

960
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:51,963
-Listen, you wanna go see "Damdadi."
-Stop bugging me.

961
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:55,383
Why haven't you started
your motorcycle yet?

962
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,469
Should I go start it?

963
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,638
You know that we have a delivery
at three today, right?

964
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:03,016
-Yeah.
-Don't get caught on camera!

965
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,978
Why do you encourage her?

966
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:30,126
Hey, they're together,
so I'm sure they'll get through.

967
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,130
You get both duties today.
Come sit up front.

968
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:46,851
I think we're gonna be late.

969
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,812
It's not like I'm an amateur.

970
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:33,981
Dong-wook, watch out!

971
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,200
Ah, shit!

972
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,372
Huh?

973
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:51,416
Are you not gonna greet your superior?

974
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:54,335
-What?
-Ah, shit.

975
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,421
Such bad manners.

976
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,549
I'll fix that today, for sure.

977
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:07,640
Shit!

978
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,520
-What do you think you're doing?
-Oh, I'm so scared.

979
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:14,772
But, you're the ones who should be.

980
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:17,525
None of you were taking this seriously.
Right?

981
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:21,696
Oh, no.

982
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,574
All right, who wants to choose?

983
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:26,743
You want to?

984
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:30,413
You fucking psycho.
What are you talking about?

985
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,374
Ah! Ow!

986
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,792
-Hey.
-Shit.

987
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,085
Stay still.

988
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,003
Dong-wook!

989
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,554
Why did you meet with him?

990
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,725
What are you doing,
you crazy son of a bitch?

991
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:53,519
Meet up with who?
We didn't meet with anyone?

992
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,230
You really thought
that I wouldn't find out?

993
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,859
If you don't start talking
by the time I count to three,

994
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,570
I'm gonna blow
your little sister's head off. One.

995
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:04,906
We didn't meet with anyone, please don't!

996
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:06,157
Director Lee, please!

997
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,617
No, no, no, Director.

998
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,410
Why are you doing this? Why?

999
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,162
We don't know anything, I swear.

1000
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:13,372
Stop fucking around and put that gun away!

1001
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,540
-You son of a bitch!
-Two…

1002
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,125
Okay, stop. Please!

1003
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:19,337
Hey, shoot me! Shoot me!
Kill me! You crazy asshole!

1004
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,422
Kill me, not her!

1005
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,174
All right.

1006
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:37,730
-Dong-wook, dont!
-No!

1007
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,193
Do you have any last words?

1008
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:52,620
Three.

1009
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,881
Hey, hey. Did I scare you?

1010
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,425
I did. Yeah, you're scared.

1011
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,181
I'm not gonna kill you, you dumbasses.

1012
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,565
Hey! I was just messing with you.

1013
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,233
Don't look so upset.

1014
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,318
You passed the test!

1015
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,113
Real men know how to keep a secret.

1016
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,116
THE 12TH PRESIDENT

1017
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,244
Since you've passed the test,
let me give you your price.

1018
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:34,662
And remember,

1019
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:38,291
don't get sloppy because you think
Ms. Kang's got your back.

1020
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:42,086
If you try to fuck with the general's
business, I will kill you.

1021
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:47,091
You will all get a bullet
straight to the face! You got that?

1022
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:50,553
Don't lose focus, you hear me? Dismissed!

1023
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,820
One of the smugglers
was caught by the police.

1024
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,530
What a useless piece of shit.

1025
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:12,074
Before any information is learned,

1026
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,619
quickly take care of the money
left in the temple.

1027
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:31,010
Yoon-jae.

1028
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:36,474
Is there a party tonight?

1029
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,311
Oh. I'm sorry. I forgot to contact you.

1030
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:41,562
It was canceled.

1031
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:43,731
Oh, well, there's no need to be sorry.

1032
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,322
Have you had dinner yet?

1033
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:09,256
Yeah.

1034
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:13,386
Don't know why she wanted to play golf
in the middle of the night.

1035
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,720
Isn't this nice, though?

1036
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:18,724
Mr. Lee, remind me,
which sport were you in charge of?

1037
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:19,976
Probably wrestling.

1038
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:23,854
You should just watch sports on TV.
Why would they make you do all that?

1039
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:26,023
Huh? Oh.

1040
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,776
There's Ms. Kang.

1041
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:31,028
Gentlemen, have you been having
a good time?

1042
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:34,532
We've just been here waiting for you,
Ms. Kang.

1043
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,702
Oh, stop it, Mr. Lee.

1044
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:38,786
Now, Ms. Kang...

1045
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:42,623
things are feeling a bit tense nowadays,
with these tax audits.

1046
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:44,250
Right, the tax audits.

1047
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,794
Well, if you don't like the tax audits,

1048
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,505
you should make sure
to get a lot of gold medals.

1049
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:51,549
Remember what the general said?

1050
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:53,884
He promised that if you get
good results in the Olympics,

1051
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,594
he wouldn't do tax audits. Right?

1052
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:59,056
We don't know if the next big man
will keep that promise, you see?

1053
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:02,476
Darn, now I wish I'd went
to the Korean Military Academy!

1054
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:06,022
-Listen to this guy.
-Uh…

1055
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:12,278
You're acting like a bunch
of whiny babies.

1056
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:15,781
Do understand that the general
would never steal

1057
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,075
from someone else's... pockets.

1058
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:22,580
The donations that you gave
will only be used for one purpose.

1059
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:26,125
We're going to use those funds
to build a new foundation.

1060
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:29,587
Now, it's almost time
for the general to arrive.

1061
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,672
So let's wrap things up, shall we?

1062
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:34,592
I called
the Public Prosecutor General today.

1063
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:04,121
Wow, you put something like this
on your arm?

1064
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:07,124
Looks like you have a pretty wild side.

1065
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,544
I wish that was true.

1066
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:13,172
It's just a mark.

1067
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,508
An honorary scar.

1068
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,638
Yeah, she doesn't give this mark to...
just anyone.

1069
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,016
Ms. Kang did this?

1070
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:27,853
Wow, that's messed up.

1071
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:30,564
She's a scary woman.

1072
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:33,526
That's why even the general
won't mess with her.

1073
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,240
So, are we dead meat
if we get caught together?

1074
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:44,495
Don't even joke about that.

1075
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,498
We'd get in a huge trouble.

1076
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:51,627
I'll go shower first.

1077
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:19,864
I sent my boys to Holes R Us
to check everything.

1078
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:23,159
They didn't find
any eavesdropping devices.

1079
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,413
This is it. I want out.

1080
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:30,791
Didn't you start all this knowing
that it wasn't gonna be easy?

1081
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:35,004
I thought I agreed to be a mule,
nothing more, nothing less.

1082
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,715
So why does that keep changing?

1083
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,634
I've gotten a lot of information,
thanks to you.

1084
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:42,720
Now, if John gets me a copy of that key--

1085
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:45,723
Do you think that John
is an actual spy or something?

1086
01:09:45,806 --> 01:09:50,186
You know that if we get that key, then we
can get a hold of their secret ledger?

1087
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:52,646
Fuck the ledger!
John could get killed working for you!

1088
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,526
Okay, Dong-wook.

1089
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:01,822
Let's take a minute to think about this
from the very beginning.

1090
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:04,033
You want to go to the US?

1091
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:06,952
Did you forget our agreement already?

1092
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:08,370
Besides,

1093
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,957
if I wanted to,
I could send you all to prison.

1094
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,001
You can forget about the United States.

1095
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,423
Do whatever you want,
but my mind's made up.

1096
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:23,219
I'm getting out of this shit.

1097
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:25,846
Hey, Park Dong-wook!

1098
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:32,478
Don't you want to know how corrupt
your country is behind the scenes?

1099
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:37,107
Don't you wanna know why
I'm trying so hard to throw that fucking

1100
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:38,943
piece-of-shit, dictator in jail?

1101
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:41,445
I love my country.

1102
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:45,157
The US and cars.
That's all you think about.

1103
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,953
Vain, thoughtless dickheads
like you are the reason

1104
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,622
why those assholes can step
all over our citizens

1105
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:53,540
and live like kings off their backs!

1106
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,418
That money that you're delivering

1107
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,587
was made from the blood and sweat
of people like us.

1108
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:03,050
If we don't stop them, there's no way
to keep them from taking everything.

1109
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:08,013
Do you think that…
that you could live with that?

1110
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:14,603
I didn't realize until today
that you could be so self-righteous.

1111
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:19,525
I'm sorry, but I only care about myself.

1112
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:23,445
Things like patriotism or justice?

1113
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,948
I'm more important to me
than any of that shit.

1114
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:28,826
And the reason why I want to move
to the United States…

1115
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:32,788
is not because of vanity.

1116
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,040
It's because I have a dream.

1117
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:48,304
Keys in my pocket. John in the house!

1118
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:50,097
Joon-gi, what are you doing?

1119
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:52,391
Shh!

1120
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:56,562
What?

1121
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:59,106
What happened? Did someone die?

1122
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:01,525
Bok-nam.

1123
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:04,403
Why is he so quiet? Is he sick?

1124
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:07,614
That damn "Damdadidam."

1125
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:10,784
It's not like we knew that would happen.
What did we do wrong?

1126
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,578
Come on, what's going on?

1127
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,079
Shit.

1128
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,873
Well, a few hours ago, we…

1129
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:17,624
Never mind.

1130
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,085
Why did you come back so early, John?

1131
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:24,214
The Holes R Us spy mission complete.

1132
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:26,967
My name is Bond, John Bond.

1133
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:28,552
Huh?

1134
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:29,887
Is this it? Really?

1135
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,680
Wow! Did you really get it?

1136
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,349
You did all the hard work.

1137
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:35,934
Made by Joon-gi!

1138
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,478
This is it.

1139
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:40,064
We can get all those
sons of bitches with this.

1140
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:42,149
With this, we can get rid
of that piece of shit!

1141
01:12:42,232 --> 01:12:43,650
Whoo!

1142
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:46,695
I want Dong-wook to witness
my accomplishment. Where is he?

1143
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:49,448
Dong-wook is in the office. He's packing.

1144
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:50,366
Why?

1145
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:52,242
Where is he going?

1146
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:57,706
Dong-wook, what's up?

1147
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:04,254
A friend from Saudi Arabia
told me that he got a ship.

1148
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:07,424
I'm gonna take everyone and leave Korea.

1149
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:08,717
And where are you gonna go?

1150
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:11,345
Didn't you hear what happened?

1151
01:13:11,428 --> 01:13:12,471
Yeah, I did.

1152
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:16,558
But they're okay now.
Director Lee is a lunatic, you know that.

1153
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:18,936
Someone could have died, asswipe.

1154
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:22,898
Yoon-hee and Bok-nam could have died,
you fucking dumbass!

1155
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:25,359
Hey, don't get so pissed.

1156
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:27,486
Dong-wook.

1157
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:32,324
I finally got the key.
Once we get the ledger, we're done.

1158
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:34,284
Are you insane?

1159
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:38,372
Do you really think you're a real spy?

1160
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:41,583
Wake the fuck up, John.

1161
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:43,001
Hey.

1162
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:45,170
I risked my life to do this.

1163
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:47,673
You think I'm not fucking scared?

1164
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:50,759
What if something bad happens?
Will you take responsibility?

1165
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:54,138
How can you say that
after hearing what happened to us?

1166
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:57,808
I'm getting out of here as soon
as possible. This whole thing's been

1167
01:13:57,891 --> 01:14:01,770
-too big for us from the very beginning.
-"Too big for us" my ass, Dong-wook!

1168
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:05,190
Hey. You feel good about yourself
running away like this?

1169
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,568
Last time, Saudi Arabia.
Where are you gonna go this time?

1170
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:09,611
He will erase our criminal records.

1171
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,530
He said we'll get our visas.

1172
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:15,159
Do you still think
we can trust Prosecutor Ahn?

1173
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:17,327
Erase our records? Visas?

1174
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,789
That was all just bait, you dumbshit.

1175
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,708
You're a fucking coward.

1176
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:29,339
You feel better blaming Prosecutor Ahn?
He forced you to do this?

1177
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,842
We knew what we were getting into
from the beginning.

1178
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:36,597
If we can do it…
No, we're the only ones that can do it.

1179
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:39,349
You want to quit here
and be a low-level thug

1180
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:41,268
the rest of your life, huh?

1181
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:45,731
You think you're
some superior motherfucker.

1182
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:46,648
Wow.

1183
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:48,650
Shit.

1184
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:51,737
Shit.

1185
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:06,084
Dong-wook.

1186
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:12,174
When you're racing, where are you looking?

1187
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:15,260
What are you talking about?

1188
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:18,305
Never mind.

1189
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,766
Hm. Forget it.

1190
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:37,574
THE 12TH PRESIDENT

1191
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:47,167
Is this the right place?

1192
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:48,710
Huh? Over there?

1193
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,254
-Go in that way.
-Oh, over here. Here?

1194
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:51,421
Go in that way. Yeah.

1195
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:53,423
Wow.

1196
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:56,176
Oh.

1197
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,970
Hello, Prosecutor Ahn.

1198
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,056
Hello, sir?

1199
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:05,686
Good work.

1200
01:16:06,186 --> 01:16:08,480
-We just need to get the ledger, right?
-No.

1201
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:11,984
You're done now, too.

1202
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,611
I don't think you're able to get in there
and get the book.

1203
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:15,988
Who else is gonna do it?

1204
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:19,449
You don't trust us?
After all that you made us do?

1205
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:20,784
It's not that.

1206
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,745
Dong-wook talked to you, guys?

1207
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,001
I didn't think they would do
something so crazy.

1208
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:31,128
You're really tripping me up here.

1209
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:33,338
Why so serious all of a sudden?

1210
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:36,174
I'm totally fine. We're totally fine.

1211
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,426
Yeah, we are.

1212
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:40,554
Director Lee might be a nutjob,
but he's nothing compared to Yoon-hee.

1213
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:43,056
-Yoon-hee is the biggest nutjob I know.
-Shut it.

1214
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,100
Director Lee, that fucking pyscho?

1215
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:47,144
How dare he do that to us?

1216
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:48,520
You see?

1217
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,898
We can't back out now.
Let's finish this. We have our pride.

1218
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:55,569
We know that you don't have anyone else,
so just tell us what to do.

1219
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:59,072
Yeah, we want to get the job done.

1220
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,533
Bunch of idiots.

1221
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:05,662
You can do this?

1222
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:07,873
Don't you worry.

1223
01:17:08,665 --> 01:17:11,293
Normal people like us
are perfect for jobs like this.

1224
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:14,671
No one will even notice
we screwed over those scumbags.

1225
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:16,131
Right?

1226
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:17,549
Yeah, let's get it!

1227
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,593
Let's go! Whoo!

1228
01:17:23,263 --> 01:17:26,558
You see, I'm actually
a very skilled black belt.

1229
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:29,895
-Oh, he's lying again.
-Director Lee, I could totally take him.

1230
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:31,271
By the way…

1231
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:38,820
-I'm returning them.
-Thank you.

1232
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:47,954
The athletes
are entering the country

1233
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:51,166
in order to compete in the Seoul Olympics,
the big global festival.

1234
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:54,586
They are all looking bright and strong,
just like our beautiful fall weather.

1235
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:58,215
Ms. Kang is gonna be
out of the hotel for an event.

1236
01:17:58,298 --> 01:18:00,384
She's got more security than normal.

1237
01:18:00,884 --> 01:18:04,137
You need to work quickly
and get out of there as soon as possible.

1238
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,060
I left something inside.

1239
01:18:12,312 --> 01:18:14,815
Mm. Shh.

1240
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,197
You think she's gonna be out late?

1241
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,449
We'll see,
depends if there's a party after.

1242
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:35,752
-What's wrong with this thing?
-Hey, turn it down!

1243
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:36,753
Yeah, yeah.

1244
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:41,425
This thing suddenly stopped working.

1245
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:42,968
Hey, move out of the way, DJ.

1246
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:45,262
Why'd you mess with it? Oh, man.

1247
01:18:46,471 --> 01:18:47,931
Come on, turn it off.

1248
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,767
-Why did this turn on?
-We didn't touch it.

1249
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:54,688
Huh?

1250
01:18:54,771 --> 01:18:56,022
Excuse me.

1251
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:58,734
The master key in my cabinet…

1252
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:07,325
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1253
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:11,955
-Search everywhere.
-Yes, ma'am.

1254
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:13,623
Just unplug it.

1255
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:16,418
Wait, if you unplug it like that…

1256
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:18,587
Oh, great, the music finally turned off!

1257
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:51,578
-Shit!
-Huh?

1258
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:53,914
-You scared the fuck out of me!
-Ow! Why'd you hit me?

1259
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:55,332
I'm gonna kill you!

1260
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:08,261
-What?
-Kang.

1261
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:09,721
-What'd you say?
-Ms. Kang is here!

1262
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:11,223
-What?
-Go back over there, okay?

1263
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:12,724
I'm going.

1264
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:25,278
Oh!

1265
01:20:27,447 --> 01:20:28,740
Madam President.

1266
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,202
Mm.

1267
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:34,329
Ah, to be young.

1268
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,874
You're at the age where you think
you're invincible. We'll see you soon.

1269
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,086
Yes, ma'am. See you soon.

1270
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:10,949
There!

1271
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:13,618
-Hey! Stop right there!
-Oh, shit!

1272
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:33,555
Asshole! You could've gotten me killed!

1273
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:35,432
Well, you're not dead, are you?

1274
01:21:36,016 --> 01:21:36,850
Sh…

1275
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:41,688
How did you know I was here?
Did you talk to the prosecutor?

1276
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:45,817
I figured you'd do it without me,
but you'd be lost.

1277
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:49,779
Anyway, this is finally over.

1278
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:52,657
Let's hand over the books, get our visas,

1279
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:54,784
and go to LA!

1280
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:01,291
By the way, your makeup…

1281
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,461
Can you do something about that
before you go to LA…

1282
01:22:04,544 --> 01:22:06,338
It's not just makeup.

1283
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:09,090
-You're gonna make me crash the car.
-It's a disguise.

1284
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,012
You might as well be wearing a mask.

1285
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:15,555
-Not another word.
-We're gonna crash.

1286
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:18,141
-That mouth of yours, I'm gonna…
-I'm gonna crash for real!

1287
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,477
Where are you gonna go this time?

1288
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,687
He will erase our criminal records.

1289
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,398
He said we'll get our visas.

1290
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:28,234
Do you still think
we can trust Prosecutor Ahn?

1291
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:32,197
Erase our records? Visas?

1292
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:35,158
That was all just bait, you dumbshit.

1293
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:41,331
What do you think you're doing?

1294
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:45,210
They stabbed you in the back, Ms. Kang.

1295
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:49,339
It's not a big deal.

1296
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:52,634
Let's talk about this calmly and quietly.

1297
01:22:52,717 --> 01:22:56,972
Our delivery drivers are working
for the prosecutor's office.

1298
01:22:59,599 --> 01:23:00,600
So what?

1299
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:03,478
So they have ruined
all of the general's plans!

1300
01:23:03,561 --> 01:23:07,565
Those fuckers have taken our books
and gave it to the enemy!

1301
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:10,276
I'm gonna catch those assholes
and kill every one of them!

1302
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,279
All of this happened,
because you're too soft on them!

1303
01:23:14,197 --> 01:23:16,866
Hey! I'm gonna report this to the general.

1304
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:20,829
This… This… He would never stand for this!

1305
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:23,915
Ah!

1306
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:30,714
Director Lee.

1307
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:32,340
No.

1308
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:34,009
Hyeon-gyun.

1309
01:23:35,635 --> 01:23:39,806
If you're barking at the person
who's taking care of you,

1310
01:23:39,889 --> 01:23:45,228
then you're going to learn to control
your volume, you son of a bitch, huh?

1311
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:53,111
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1312
01:23:57,615 --> 01:23:58,450
Now, leave.

1313
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:14,299
Ms. Kim.

1314
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:16,259
Ma'am.

1315
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:18,011
Go to Myeongdong,

1316
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:22,515
and get ready to exchange the money
in the temple to US dollars.

1317
01:24:23,683 --> 01:24:25,685
That will make it easier to transport.

1318
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:28,188
Right away, ma'am.

1319
01:24:31,024 --> 01:24:32,025
Yoon-jae.

1320
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:35,445
Yes, ma'am.

1321
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:48,124
Wait to eat dinner.

1322
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:51,753
When you get back, we can eat together.

1323
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:56,591
Okay.

1324
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:13,233
Hey, they're here, they're here.

1325
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:16,945
-You traitors!
-Are you okay? Are you hurt?

1326
01:25:17,028 --> 01:25:18,613
Does loyalty mean anything to you?

1327
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:21,491
-How could you just leave me back there?
-What are you talking about?

1328
01:25:21,574 --> 01:25:23,993
-I was coming back for you. Hey, come on.
-I'm gonna kill you!

1329
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:26,496
-Can't hold her back.
-I'm gonna kill you! Come here!

1330
01:25:26,996 --> 01:25:29,374
You made your entrance at the very end

1331
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:31,751
-so you can look cool?
-Ow! Why'd you do that?

1332
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:32,752
Why did you come back?

1333
01:25:34,003 --> 01:25:35,421
I'll take that as "thanks."

1334
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:49,561
Huh?

1335
01:25:51,437 --> 01:25:52,522
Look at this.

1336
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:07,829
Hey.

1337
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:10,415
-Is this the right place?
-Yeah.

1338
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:13,084
This is Prosecutor Ahn's desk.

1339
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:16,004
What the fuck happened here?

1340
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:31,102
Hey, look at this.

1341
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,228
These are our visas.

1342
01:26:38,067 --> 01:26:39,611
Let's get out of here. Quick.

1343
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:45,491
Hey, wait, wait.

1344
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:48,828
That's Prosecutor Ahn.

1345
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,082
Hey, go to the car and wait for me.

1346
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:57,128
You go and start the car.
I'll take a quick look.

1347
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:45,718
Go…

1348
01:27:50,723 --> 01:27:51,641
Go…

1349
01:27:57,814 --> 01:27:58,982
Dong-wook!

1350
01:27:59,065 --> 01:28:00,733
-Dong-wook!
-Get him!

1351
01:28:01,317 --> 01:28:03,486
Start the car! Start the car!

1352
01:28:07,573 --> 01:28:09,284
-Dong-wook!
-Stop right there!

1353
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:16,541
-Dong-wook! Dong-wook!
-Stay still!

1354
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:21,212
Go, you idiot! Go! I said go!

1355
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:22,797
Open the door! Open it!

1356
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,340
-You son of a bitch!
-Dong-wook!

1357
01:28:27,593 --> 01:28:28,720
Dong-wook!

1358
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:31,055
Hey, open the door! Quickly! Open it!

1359
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:32,640
-Go, you idiot!
-Shut up!

1360
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,393
Hey!

1361
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:36,519
Hey!

1362
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:24,692
Here's Dad's ignition switch.

1363
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,990
Dong-wook, what should we do now?

1364
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:35,203
Director Lee's a son of a bitch.

1365
01:29:38,581 --> 01:29:41,959
We need to go. We have to find John.
We can't leave him.

1366
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:45,129
Yeah, let's go.

1367
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:09,529
You son of a bitch!

1368
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:14,075
Stop it, Director Lee.

1369
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:16,494
We don't have the time for this.

1370
01:30:19,705 --> 01:30:22,625
Did you know people
can really endure a lot of pain?

1371
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:26,587
Unwrap it and show him what we have.

1372
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:36,013
Look at it, Mr. DJ.

1373
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:37,557
Whose is this?

1374
01:30:39,058 --> 01:30:41,644
You know this hand, don't you? Right?

1375
01:30:41,727 --> 01:30:44,689
What did you do? Huh?

1376
01:30:46,649 --> 01:30:49,235
-People don't die just from losing a hand.
-Fuck!

1377
01:30:49,318 --> 01:30:51,028
You call yourselves human beings?

1378
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:55,283
I guess our poor DJ really liked Ms. Kim.

1379
01:30:57,660 --> 01:31:00,913
Still, love is just love.
Your life is more important, yes?

1380
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:04,208
Where's the ledger?

1381
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:05,293
Fuck you.

1382
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,671
Fuck you! You bitch!

1383
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:11,841
Wake him up.

1384
01:31:12,758 --> 01:31:16,471
It's fine. That's enough.
He's not gonna talk.

1385
01:31:18,764 --> 01:31:19,891
You can come in.

1386
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:25,188
How did you--

1387
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:28,316
We wouldn't get help
from any old prosecutor.

1388
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:30,985
I talked to the Public Prosecutor General
to get them out.

1389
01:31:31,068 --> 01:31:35,406
So take them to the temple with you,
and take care of the money.

1390
01:31:49,378 --> 01:31:50,755
Quick, the news, it's starting.

1391
01:31:50,838 --> 01:31:52,632
-Yoon-hee.
-Yeah.

1392
01:31:52,715 --> 01:31:54,717
I'm calling Mom.
Keep calling till she picks up.

1393
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,718
-Go.
-Hurry. Hurry.

1394
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:59,055
He was beaten
by the main suspect,

1395
01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:00,598
Park Dong-wook and his accomplices.

1396
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:03,684
After beating Prosecutor Ahn,
Park Dong-wook and his gang

1397
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:06,479
-pushed him out of the fourth floor…
-What are they saying?

1398
01:32:06,562 --> 01:32:09,440
-Prosecutor Ahn fell on top of a car…
-Can you believe this bullshit?

1399
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:11,692
They're saying we killed the prosecutor!

1400
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:13,110
Whoa, they think we did it?

1401
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:14,987
Assholes!
They've crossed the line!

1402
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:16,989
Fuck!

1403
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:21,285
Dong-wook, Mom says
everything's okay on her end.

1404
01:32:21,994 --> 01:32:25,456
Bundles of cash, worth around
one billion won, and 300 artifacts,

1405
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,792
were discovered in the walls
of the master bedroom.

1406
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:29,961
This apartment
was under the name of Park Yoon-hee,

1407
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:32,713
a woman who has recently been confirmed
to be their accomplice.

1408
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:35,383
In addition, Park Yoon-hee
was confirmed to be the sister

1409
01:32:35,466 --> 01:32:36,968
of the main culprit, Park Dong-wook.

1410
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:39,929
The police, who are tracking the culprits,
think that they are still hiding

1411
01:32:40,012 --> 01:32:41,264
within the city of Seoul,

1412
01:32:41,347 --> 01:32:44,225
and have increased the frequency
of vehicle searches at checkpoints.

1413
01:32:44,308 --> 01:32:47,061
However, they have not yet pinpointed
their exact location.

1414
01:32:47,144 --> 01:32:49,355
The police advice the culprits
to turn themselves in

1415
01:32:49,438 --> 01:32:51,190
before they are caught--

1416
01:33:00,866 --> 01:33:02,868
Excuse me for a moment,
General Jeon,

1417
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:04,954
why don't you say a few words for us

1418
01:33:05,037 --> 01:33:08,165
since the Public Prosecutor General
came all this way to play golf?

1419
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:10,251
Yes, of course. Yes.

1420
01:33:10,334 --> 01:33:12,545
I won't forget each of you

1421
01:33:12,628 --> 01:33:14,630
who showed your loyalty to your country.

1422
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:17,675
Thanks to you, this country
has become a better place to live.

1423
01:33:18,175 --> 01:33:20,052
Aside from setting up our foundation,

1424
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:23,931
there will be a lot more opportunities
for us to collaborate in the future.

1425
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:26,601
GAJU CONSTRUCTION

1426
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:49,081
Why did you want to see me?
To turn yourself in?

1427
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:52,793
This is Ms. Kang's accounts ledger.

1428
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:55,671
And the location of everything…

1429
01:33:57,882 --> 01:33:58,758
is in here.

1430
01:34:08,684 --> 01:34:10,061
I'm sorry,

1431
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:12,647
but this is out of my hands now.

1432
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:15,149
The Public Prosecutor General
is working for them.

1433
01:34:15,232 --> 01:34:17,735
Even if you bring me the original,
there's nothing I can do.

1434
01:34:17,818 --> 01:34:19,403
I'm gonna prove we're innocent.

1435
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,698
I'll show them who the real criminals are.

1436
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:25,743
I'm going to get all the money
that we've delivered

1437
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:27,203
and everything that's left…

1438
01:34:29,121 --> 01:34:32,083
and destroy it right in front
of those motherfucker's faces.

1439
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:35,670
They won't get a single one.

1440
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:38,673
You'll need more
than circumstantial evidence.

1441
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:39,590
Yeah.

1442
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:41,592
Mm. Let this go.

1443
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:44,011
Let this go? Really? Shit.

1444
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:48,516
I don't even know if my friend
is fucking alive or dead, goddamnit!

1445
01:34:50,142 --> 01:34:52,353
I will do this, even if it kills me.

1446
01:34:54,313 --> 01:34:56,399
That is the promise I am making to you.

1447
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:02,279
What's this?

1448
01:35:04,615 --> 01:35:06,450
It was in Prosecutor Ahn's car.

1449
01:35:07,451 --> 01:35:11,080
The man who gave his life for that
probably wouldn't have hesitated.

1450
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:55,833
Hey.

1451
01:35:56,959 --> 01:35:58,294
What are you doing?

1452
01:35:58,377 --> 01:36:00,087
I need to see where they're going.

1453
01:36:00,671 --> 01:36:01,547
Wait here.

1454
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:03,841
What do you mean, wait?
Hey, come back, Dong… No.

1455
01:36:04,633 --> 01:36:06,427
-Where is he going?
-What's he doing?

1456
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:07,845
What's gotten into him.

1457
01:36:09,221 --> 01:36:10,139
Dong-wook!

1458
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:33,287
-Huh? Where's Dong-wook going?
-Oh! Oh!

1459
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:34,371
Dong-wook!

1460
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:55,893
Look, look.

1461
01:37:14,036 --> 01:37:16,080
-So there's just one left, correct?
-Yes, ma'am.

1462
01:37:16,163 --> 01:37:18,541
First load is headed to the airport,
the rest will be sent

1463
01:37:18,624 --> 01:37:21,335
-the day of the opening ceremony.
-That good. The opening ceremony.

1464
01:37:21,418 --> 01:37:23,128
That's the perfect day,
won't draw attention.

1465
01:37:23,754 --> 01:37:25,214
Okay. I'll see you then.

1466
01:37:25,798 --> 01:37:26,799
Yes, ma'am.

1467
01:37:32,972 --> 01:37:33,889
Oh, shit.

1468
01:37:34,515 --> 01:37:35,850
Where did he go?

1469
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:08,382
Hi-ya! Hi-ya!

1470
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:12,177
You know I'm a really impressive guy.

1471
01:38:12,261 --> 01:38:14,680
Joon-gi, it's our turn. Are you ready?

1472
01:38:14,763 --> 01:38:15,723
I'm ready.

1473
01:38:17,933 --> 01:38:19,685
I found them.

1474
01:38:22,646 --> 01:38:24,148
Whoa!

1475
01:38:34,199 --> 01:38:35,910
Come out, you crazy nutjob!

1476
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:43,918
I didn't hit you?

1477
01:38:49,465 --> 01:38:52,009
It's so hard to aim these things.

1478
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:54,845
What?

1479
01:38:56,597 --> 01:38:58,849
-What?
-I want John back.

1480
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:02,227
Oh, that's so touching.
What if I don't want to?

1481
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:04,563
Oh, you'll want to,

1482
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:07,024
when you see my cards.

1483
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:16,200
What's this?

1484
01:39:16,283 --> 01:39:17,576
You got nothing.

1485
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:19,870
"I fold." Yeah.

1486
01:39:24,166 --> 01:39:26,835
I've got an ace up my sleeve.
Wanna see it?

1487
01:39:27,419 --> 01:39:28,754
Go ahead. Show 'em.

1488
01:39:28,837 --> 01:39:30,255
I want John first.

1489
01:39:32,466 --> 01:39:33,884
Bring him out.

1490
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:38,931
Aah!

1491
01:39:40,099 --> 01:39:41,725
John!

1492
01:39:43,602 --> 01:39:47,147
What a nice reunion.
Your friend is pretty weak, this one.

1493
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:49,400
He should have stuck to the DJ booth.

1494
01:39:49,483 --> 01:39:51,276
Not sleeping with the wrong woman.

1495
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,903
You sons of bitches!

1496
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:54,238
Shit!

1497
01:39:55,614 --> 01:39:59,284
Fuck, you really are just a dumb dog.

1498
01:40:00,285 --> 01:40:04,081
That's why you didn't notice
that your master abandoned you.

1499
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:05,541
What are you saying?

1500
01:40:05,624 --> 01:40:06,667
Joon-gi.

1501
01:40:11,505 --> 01:40:12,548
Here!

1502
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:15,009
This is today's song.

1503
01:40:17,511 --> 01:40:21,348
I won't forget each of you
who showed your loyalty to your country.

1504
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:24,268
Thanks to you, this country
has become a better place to live.

1505
01:40:24,351 --> 01:40:26,562
Aside from setting up our foundation,

1506
01:40:26,645 --> 01:40:29,314
there will be a lot more opportunities
for us to collaborate

1507
01:40:29,398 --> 01:40:30,733
-in the future.
-What's this?

1508
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,318
You need to listen all the way through.

1509
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:37,364
Excuse me, sir,
and if the foundation doesn't work out,

1510
01:40:38,115 --> 01:40:39,908
then who will take the fall?

1511
01:40:39,992 --> 01:40:43,078
That sounds like a question for me.

1512
01:40:43,162 --> 01:40:45,789
All the necessary preparations
have been made.

1513
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:48,834
Remember meeting Director Lee Hyeon-gyun?

1514
01:40:51,003 --> 01:40:54,548
This is the perfect time
for a commercial break, isn't it?

1515
01:40:54,631 --> 01:40:56,050
Shut up and play it!

1516
01:41:00,137 --> 01:41:04,475
Ah, he loves to sacrifice himself.

1517
01:41:04,558 --> 01:41:06,018
Hm, that's right.

1518
01:41:06,101 --> 01:41:08,437
He was too stupid
to go to the Military Academy.

1519
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:09,980
But he's loyal.

1520
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:12,733
He can take quite a few hits.

1521
01:41:12,816 --> 01:41:13,901
So there's no need to worry.

1522
01:41:13,984 --> 01:41:15,569
Bring that shit over here.

1523
01:41:15,652 --> 01:41:18,989
Oh, General Jeon, you're funny!

1524
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:23,118
Fuck, is this all you have?

1525
01:41:24,286 --> 01:41:26,371
You motherfuckers! Who do you think I am?

1526
01:41:26,455 --> 01:41:28,165
Shit! I'll fucking kill you.

1527
01:41:28,248 --> 01:41:29,875
-You goddamn son of a bitch.
-Oh, come on.

1528
01:41:29,958 --> 01:41:32,294
You broke it, but it doesn't matter.

1529
01:41:32,377 --> 01:41:34,797
I can get you 100 copies of it
if you'd like.

1530
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:51,980
Someone's making more copies
as we speak, Director Lee.

1531
01:41:54,483 --> 01:41:56,318
To those bastards,

1532
01:41:57,444 --> 01:42:00,405
you are nothing but a dog.

1533
01:42:01,031 --> 01:42:02,783
You gonna run with your tail
between your legs

1534
01:42:02,866 --> 01:42:05,494
after you help steal the money
just 'cause your master abandoned you?

1535
01:42:05,577 --> 01:42:07,079
What are you saying?

1536
01:42:07,162 --> 01:42:08,914
You think the prosecutor you killed

1537
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:12,376
was working on this alone?

1538
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:16,130
Prosecutor's office should be here soon.

1539
01:42:16,713 --> 01:42:17,673
Why should I care?

1540
01:42:17,756 --> 01:42:19,716
I'm saying that I'll help you.

1541
01:42:21,009 --> 01:42:21,844
You?

1542
01:42:23,011 --> 01:42:23,887
Help me?

1543
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:26,682
Just give me the location,
and I'll make the delivery.

1544
01:42:27,933 --> 01:42:28,892
Don't you know?

1545
01:42:29,393 --> 01:42:31,311
I'm the best driver in the world.

1546
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:33,355
So you want me to betray the general?

1547
01:42:34,815 --> 01:42:36,775
For a billion won, I'll do it for you.

1548
01:42:39,319 --> 01:42:43,365
Or you could go to prison for them.
You could take a few hits, after all.

1549
01:42:44,366 --> 01:42:46,034
Shit.

1550
01:42:57,129 --> 01:43:01,425
If you're fucking with me,
I'll kill you for real.

1551
01:43:03,093 --> 01:43:05,387
And this time,
my guys will be joining you.

1552
01:43:06,763 --> 01:43:08,348
I hope they don't get car sick.

1553
01:43:10,559 --> 01:43:12,519
It'll be one hell of a ride.

1554
01:43:16,773 --> 01:43:18,692
-Ah, cute.
-Yeah.

1555
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:21,528
You're so handsome.
Who do you take after?

1556
01:43:21,612 --> 01:43:22,613
Me. Me.

1557
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:25,616
You look like me, don't you? Hm?

1558
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:27,284
So handsome.

1559
01:43:27,367 --> 01:43:28,452
Hey!

1560
01:43:28,535 --> 01:43:29,745
-No, Ma!
-Oh!

1561
01:43:32,164 --> 01:43:34,166
I told you not to do that!

1562
01:43:34,249 --> 01:43:37,211
-This is the best spot to dry them.
-Those peppers--

1563
01:43:37,294 --> 01:43:39,421
Then why don't you park your car
somewhere else, huh?

1564
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:41,924
You're gonna make my car all hot!

1565
01:43:42,424 --> 01:43:43,258
Bullshit.

1566
01:43:50,849 --> 01:43:53,185
Auntie. I'm here.

1567
01:43:53,268 --> 01:43:55,312
-Oh my goodness.
-Auntie!

1568
01:43:55,395 --> 01:43:56,230
Hey!

1569
01:43:56,313 --> 01:43:58,565
What do you think you're doing,
you murderers?

1570
01:43:58,649 --> 01:44:00,943
How dare you come here? Get lost!

1571
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:02,819
Ow!

1572
01:44:02,903 --> 01:44:04,863
Hee-young, you be nice to your friends.

1573
01:44:05,489 --> 01:44:07,699
-Ah, Dong-wook!
-Auntie!

1574
01:44:07,783 --> 01:44:08,909
-Auntie!
-Joon-gi!

1575
01:44:11,995 --> 01:44:13,830
Welcome. Welcome, boys.

1576
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:15,958
-Have you eaten already?
-Yes, ma'am.

1577
01:44:16,041 --> 01:44:17,334
Hey.

1578
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:21,255
It's a shame what happened to Holes R Us.
It's just a tragedy.

1579
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:23,507
My mom wanted me to say hello
from America.

1580
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:25,842
I was just about to send her
a letter as well.

1581
01:44:25,926 --> 01:44:26,969
Auntie…

1582
01:44:28,178 --> 01:44:29,137
could we…

1583
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:32,307
use your garage for a day or two?

1584
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:34,184
What?

1585
01:44:35,978 --> 01:44:36,895
No way!

1586
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:39,690
No! No way!

1587
01:44:39,773 --> 01:44:41,233
Ah!

1588
01:44:41,733 --> 01:44:43,944
Yes. Of course, you can. Anything for you.

1589
01:44:44,027 --> 01:44:46,530
-Go ahead, take whatever you need.
-Yeah!

1590
01:44:46,613 --> 01:44:47,698
But, Mom!

1591
01:44:47,781 --> 01:44:50,450
What are you doing?
You know that they're our competition.

1592
01:44:51,034 --> 01:44:52,202
Ah! Ah!

1593
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:55,372
Put on a real shirt. Do you have anything
other than filthy tank tops?

1594
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:57,833
-This is called fashion!
-Fashion?

1595
01:44:57,916 --> 01:44:59,209
You don't dress me anymore.

1596
01:44:59,293 --> 01:45:02,004
This is fashion!

1597
01:45:02,087 --> 01:45:04,089
That's a bunch of bullshit, you know that?

1598
01:45:05,215 --> 01:45:07,259
I'll whip up something
for you to eat, okay?

1599
01:45:07,342 --> 01:45:08,969
Thanks.

1600
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:17,644
No way.

1601
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:20,647
I won't… ever allow it.

1602
01:45:21,732 --> 01:45:23,859
RUN-DMC, Raising Hell.

1603
01:45:25,652 --> 01:45:29,156
Still no. No. No. Can't do it.

1604
01:45:32,534 --> 01:45:34,202
I didn't wanna have to do this.

1605
01:45:42,044 --> 01:45:44,588
Air Jordan Three, limited edition.

1606
01:45:46,214 --> 01:45:47,466
Jordan Three?

1607
01:45:47,549 --> 01:45:48,592
Limited edition.

1608
01:45:49,926 --> 01:45:50,761
Wow!

1609
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:53,263
Wow.

1610
01:45:54,264 --> 01:45:56,141
-Look!
-Wow.

1611
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:57,059
One day.

1612
01:45:58,894 --> 01:46:01,688
Just… one day.

1613
01:46:02,397 --> 01:46:03,273
Deal.

1614
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:05,442
-Wow.
-Whoa.

1615
01:46:06,068 --> 01:46:07,361
-A Jordan.
-Holy shit!

1616
01:46:08,028 --> 01:46:09,738
Whoa!

1617
01:46:09,821 --> 01:46:10,655
Amazing.

1618
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:13,575
Our D-Day is
the opening ceremony of the Olympics.

1619
01:46:13,658 --> 01:46:16,912
I'll move the money and the goods
left in the safe all at once.

1620
01:46:20,916 --> 01:46:23,085
My destination, the Port of Incheon.

1621
01:46:23,168 --> 01:46:26,463
Director Lee seems to be planning
to run away with the goods.

1622
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:29,132
Our priority, getting John back.

1623
01:46:29,216 --> 01:46:32,177
Once John is safe,
that's when we'll make our move.

1624
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:33,637
-What about--
-The car?

1625
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:35,889
-You think this car will work?
-We'll make it work.

1626
01:46:35,972 --> 01:46:37,265
We'll do it our way.

1627
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:40,811
In one...

1628
01:46:40,894 --> 01:46:43,438
-One…
-Two, three!

1629
01:46:43,522 --> 01:46:45,524
Come on!

1630
01:46:45,607 --> 01:46:48,151
We're doing this Olympic-style.

1631
01:46:51,571 --> 01:46:53,782
You're doing everything
just like we planned?

1632
01:46:54,783 --> 01:46:56,201
Don't worry about the tapes.

1633
01:46:57,202 --> 01:46:58,829
Don't worry about the recording.

1634
01:46:59,329 --> 01:47:02,707
I'll be sure to fill in
the empty spot left by John.

1635
01:47:08,463 --> 01:47:09,339
Here.

1636
01:47:11,174 --> 01:47:12,134
Okay.

1637
01:47:12,217 --> 01:47:14,052
All of you, remember this.

1638
01:47:14,136 --> 01:47:15,053
88 SEOUL VIBE

1639
01:47:15,137 --> 01:47:17,139
Joon-gi, you've got Hangang Park.

1640
01:47:17,222 --> 01:47:18,432
Bok-nam, you got Olympic-daero.

1641
01:47:18,515 --> 01:47:21,393
Galchi, you've got the parade
at the main stadium.

1642
01:47:21,476 --> 01:47:23,019
Yoon-hee, airport.

1643
01:47:24,563 --> 01:47:25,772
Not Gimpo, but Seongnam.

1644
01:47:26,565 --> 01:47:29,943
We are going to get Ms. Kang
and Director Lee in the same place.

1645
01:47:30,026 --> 01:47:32,654
And, we'll drag them down with us.

1646
01:47:33,405 --> 01:47:35,782
Don't forget to be
really fucking annoying, too.

1647
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:38,535
-Here.
-Bravo!

1648
01:47:39,536 --> 01:47:40,454
Enjoy!

1649
01:47:52,924 --> 01:47:55,469
It's one of John's.
I made some improvements.

1650
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:56,636
All pop songs?

1651
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,139
You can listen
to all the hip-hop you want in LA.

1652
01:47:59,222 --> 01:48:01,766
-Today you get this.
-You remember what to do?

1653
01:48:01,850 --> 01:48:04,144
When you get the call, make sure you…

1654
01:48:06,354 --> 01:48:08,273
Shit.

1655
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:15,030
Three.

1656
01:48:15,864 --> 01:48:16,907
Two.

1657
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:19,201
One.

1658
01:48:20,869 --> 01:48:21,870
Go!

1659
01:48:44,434 --> 01:48:45,936
Come on. Move!

1660
01:48:46,853 --> 01:48:47,687
It's okay.

1661
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:51,775
How come I've got the B Team wannabes.

1662
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:56,279
The plan, sir… Operation Seoul Vibe.

1663
01:48:56,363 --> 01:48:58,073
"Operation Seoul Vibe"?

1664
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:05,789
Make sure to tell Dong-wook
that I've put my life on the line too.

1665
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:07,707
Roger that, sir.

1666
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:10,418
All right. You can leave.

1667
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:14,047
Before you give me a headache. Leave.

1668
01:49:16,925 --> 01:49:19,761
Commoners unite
when faced against the authority!

1669
01:49:28,562 --> 01:49:30,397
You just can't be subtle, can you?

1670
01:49:31,606 --> 01:49:33,191
Think this car is loud enough?

1671
01:49:33,275 --> 01:49:35,277
Just load it up. Okay.

1672
01:49:36,695 --> 01:49:38,321
-Load it.
-Yes, sir!

1673
01:49:54,963 --> 01:49:57,340
All right, then. Let's do this.

1674
01:49:58,258 --> 01:50:00,093
Start the operation. Start the operation.

1675
01:50:00,176 --> 01:50:02,304
Breaking the barriers of ideology,

1676
01:50:02,387 --> 01:50:04,055
the 24th Olympics, held in Seoul,

1677
01:50:04,306 --> 01:50:06,600
is a festival for all five billion people
in the world…

1678
01:50:07,517 --> 01:50:08,476
Brother.

1679
01:50:09,811 --> 01:50:10,687
John?

1680
01:50:14,482 --> 01:50:17,360
Hallelujah. I'm so happy to see you.

1681
01:50:20,905 --> 01:50:23,867
Yoon-hee, give me that planter over there.

1682
01:50:26,161 --> 01:50:29,497
After the host country
for the 24th Olympics was decided

1683
01:50:29,581 --> 01:50:32,250
on September 30th, 1981 in Baden-Baden,

1684
01:50:32,334 --> 01:50:37,672
the whole country came together
to prepare 13,626 athletes

1685
01:50:37,756 --> 01:50:40,717
from 160 countries from around the globe
are in attendance…

1686
01:50:42,552 --> 01:50:44,846
I'll miss this damn country.

1687
01:51:14,709 --> 01:51:15,960
Oh! What's that?

1688
01:51:21,966 --> 01:51:23,635
Wh-what?

1689
01:51:25,595 --> 01:51:27,847
Okay, first strike.

1690
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:29,599
Let's go!

1691
01:51:29,683 --> 01:51:31,059
Don't let him get away!

1692
01:51:32,936 --> 01:51:34,104
Shit.

1693
01:51:38,692 --> 01:51:40,276
Stop the car, you asshole!

1694
01:51:42,654 --> 01:51:44,739
I said, stop the car, you son of a bitch!

1695
01:52:18,523 --> 01:52:20,150
Shit!

1696
01:52:26,156 --> 01:52:27,407
No, you don't!

1697
01:52:33,246 --> 01:52:34,706
Dong-wook!

1698
01:52:34,789 --> 01:52:37,292
I'll block them for you! Okay?

1699
01:52:37,375 --> 01:52:38,209
Yeah?

1700
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:46,342
Shit!

1701
01:52:47,969 --> 01:52:49,596
You're not going anywhere!

1702
01:52:51,598 --> 01:52:53,516
Where are you going, you son of a bitch?

1703
01:53:30,053 --> 01:53:30,929
Shit.

1704
01:53:37,894 --> 01:53:38,728
Damn.

1705
01:54:18,601 --> 01:54:20,353
Where the hell is Galchi?

1706
01:54:24,816 --> 01:54:26,693
Hi-ya! Hi-ya!

1707
01:54:27,485 --> 01:54:29,404
Hi-ya! Hi-ya!

1708
01:54:54,804 --> 01:54:56,764
Get out of my way!

1709
01:54:56,848 --> 01:54:58,766
Move, you damn tiger!

1710
01:55:00,768 --> 01:55:03,146
You idiots!
Are you sure Park Dong-wook is here?

1711
01:55:12,822 --> 01:55:14,490
Hey, hey!

1712
01:55:16,117 --> 01:55:18,036
I kept those shoes in mint condition!

1713
01:55:18,661 --> 01:55:20,747
Why the fuck would you wear them?

1714
01:55:21,831 --> 01:55:25,001
What do you care?
I could do whatever I want with them!

1715
01:55:25,084 --> 01:55:26,210
-Take them off.
-No.

1716
01:55:26,294 --> 01:55:27,420
-Take them off.
-No!

1717
01:55:27,503 --> 01:55:30,048
Take them off. Ugh!

1718
01:55:32,133 --> 01:55:33,593
Look, they're over there! See?

1719
01:55:33,676 --> 01:55:35,094
-Stop the car.
-On the right.

1720
01:55:35,178 --> 01:55:36,012
Take them off!

1721
01:55:36,095 --> 01:55:37,472
Get in there. Grab them!

1722
01:55:37,555 --> 01:55:39,390
Hey, move! Get out of the way!

1723
01:55:40,683 --> 01:55:42,226
-I said move!
-Stop!

1724
01:55:42,310 --> 01:55:43,144
I told you to move!

1725
01:55:43,227 --> 01:55:45,146
Stop messing around. Blast them now.

1726
01:55:45,939 --> 01:55:47,440
-No.
-What?

1727
01:55:48,107 --> 01:55:49,859
Out of the way!

1728
01:55:49,943 --> 01:55:50,985
Just call me "sir."

1729
01:55:51,945 --> 01:55:52,946
Shit.

1730
01:55:53,029 --> 01:55:54,572
Move the fuck out!

1731
01:55:54,656 --> 01:55:55,823
Move!

1732
01:55:55,907 --> 01:55:57,033
Stop the car!

1733
01:55:57,909 --> 01:56:00,495
-Hm.
-Fuck this.

1734
01:56:02,205 --> 01:56:03,039
Sir.

1735
01:56:03,998 --> 01:56:06,000
-I can't hear you!
-Sir!

1736
01:56:06,084 --> 01:56:07,710
Okay!

1737
01:56:16,636 --> 01:56:18,972
Dong-wook,
this is old-school, motherfuckers!

1738
01:56:25,103 --> 01:56:27,188
Wow, it's a smoke truck!

1739
01:56:27,271 --> 01:56:28,106
Shit!

1740
01:56:28,189 --> 01:56:30,400
Yeah! I got a smoking car! Whoo!

1741
01:56:30,483 --> 01:56:32,860
What the fuck! This guy's totally bonkers.

1742
01:56:33,611 --> 01:56:37,115
Put your hands up!

1743
01:56:49,585 --> 01:56:51,337
What the hell is that? Oh!

1744
01:56:58,594 --> 01:57:00,555
Oh, no. Shit, shit, shit!

1745
01:57:00,638 --> 01:57:02,223
Oh!

1746
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:18,740
Huh?

1747
01:57:38,342 --> 01:57:40,636
That's right, all of you, follow me.

1748
01:57:41,137 --> 01:57:42,889
Stop the car!

1749
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:01,282
You know, I'm injured too.

1750
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:05,912
Shit! I'm the one that should be helped.

1751
01:58:06,871 --> 01:58:10,792
John, I'd be fried chicken
if you hadn't shown up.

1752
01:58:10,875 --> 01:58:13,044
Yeah? You were totally shitting yourself.

1753
01:58:13,544 --> 01:58:16,631
Do you think this is a movie?
A car doesn't blow up that easy.

1754
01:58:21,469 --> 01:58:23,429
-Oh, shit.
-Yeah.

1755
01:58:27,391 --> 01:58:28,726
We were almost fucked.

1756
01:58:28,810 --> 01:58:30,645
Oh, fuck. Ow!

1757
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:46,327
Shit.

1758
01:58:57,672 --> 01:59:00,091
Yeah, rock 'n' roll, baby!

1759
01:59:04,971 --> 01:59:05,930
Oh, shit!

1760
01:59:15,106 --> 01:59:15,940
Oh!

1761
01:59:28,744 --> 01:59:31,205
Get him! Don't let him escape!

1762
01:59:44,468 --> 01:59:46,095
SOUTH SEOUL AIRPORT

1763
01:59:46,179 --> 01:59:48,890
Watch how it's done, assholes.

1764
01:59:49,807 --> 01:59:51,350
This is Seoul Vibe.

1765
02:00:21,130 --> 02:00:23,007
Strike two.

1766
02:00:30,723 --> 02:00:32,725
Bastards, get the hell out of the way!

1767
02:00:39,148 --> 02:00:41,025
Madam, we have a problem.

1768
02:00:41,734 --> 02:00:43,444
A problem? What problem?

1769
02:00:43,527 --> 02:00:45,738
-You need to go now, Ms. Kang.
-What?

1770
02:00:45,821 --> 02:00:48,282
I still haven't gotten all the money yet.
What…

1771
02:00:49,784 --> 02:00:51,619
…theme of "Overcoming the Wall,"

1772
02:00:51,702 --> 02:00:54,330
and it carefully aims
to express the dream of mankind

1773
02:00:54,413 --> 02:00:56,207
and the ideal of the Olympics.

1774
02:00:56,290 --> 02:00:57,792
The audience has made the…

1775
02:00:57,875 --> 02:00:58,834
What's going on?

1776
02:00:59,669 --> 02:01:00,711
What are they doing?

1777
02:01:19,188 --> 02:01:21,107
He's gotten a bit impatient.

1778
02:01:23,484 --> 02:01:27,280
Die, you sons of bitches!

1779
02:01:27,363 --> 02:01:31,617
Hey, hey. Watch where you're shooting
that thing, stupid asshole!

1780
02:01:31,701 --> 02:01:33,703
I'm gonna kill you!

1781
02:01:40,626 --> 02:01:41,669
Shit!

1782
02:01:46,674 --> 02:01:49,385
You motherfuckers!

1783
02:02:21,334 --> 02:02:22,376
Huh?

1784
02:02:23,919 --> 02:02:25,588
Huh?

1785
02:02:55,201 --> 02:02:57,370
Fuck, that bald piece of shit!

1786
02:02:58,162 --> 02:03:02,583
I'll see you all in hell,
you motherfuckers!

1787
02:03:24,855 --> 02:03:26,941
Let's go, let's go!

1788
02:03:45,251 --> 02:03:46,168
Shit.

1789
02:03:48,170 --> 02:03:50,673
John, can you do it?

1790
02:03:50,756 --> 02:03:51,966
What can I say?

1791
02:03:52,049 --> 02:03:54,427
-Huh?
-Nothing's impossible in Korea.

1792
02:04:06,439 --> 02:04:10,776
Dong-wook, when you're racing,
where are you looking?

1793
02:04:12,945 --> 02:04:14,530
Where am I looking?

1794
02:04:23,747 --> 02:04:24,957
What the hell?

1795
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:26,000
Close the hatch!

1796
02:04:30,754 --> 02:04:33,132
Yeah!

1797
02:04:47,771 --> 02:04:48,647
Ready…

1798
02:04:50,065 --> 02:04:51,066
Action.

1799
02:05:03,454 --> 02:05:04,288
Yeah!

1800
02:05:12,421 --> 02:05:14,131
You insolent little…

1801
02:05:15,424 --> 02:05:18,010
How dare you drive your car
on to my plane.

1802
02:05:21,263 --> 02:05:22,223
Shit.

1803
02:05:24,475 --> 02:05:25,976
I delivered everything to you.

1804
02:05:28,729 --> 02:05:30,231
That's right, you did. Yeah.

1805
02:05:31,023 --> 02:05:31,941
And whose is it?

1806
02:05:33,025 --> 02:05:34,527
Answer me, you piece of shit.

1807
02:05:34,610 --> 02:05:37,488
Who does it belong to? Huh?

1808
02:05:37,571 --> 02:05:39,323
Whose is it? Whose is it?

1809
02:05:39,406 --> 02:05:42,368
Whose is it? Who does it belong to?

1810
02:05:42,451 --> 02:05:44,495
That's right. It's mine! It's mine!

1811
02:05:45,663 --> 02:05:47,831
Ugh!

1812
02:05:52,670 --> 02:05:54,046
Listen, old lady.

1813
02:05:54,129 --> 02:05:55,214
"Old lady"?

1814
02:05:55,297 --> 02:05:56,632
Yeah, old lady.

1815
02:05:56,715 --> 02:05:58,801
You stupid son of a bitch.

1816
02:05:58,884 --> 02:06:00,052
I hope…

1817
02:06:00,678 --> 02:06:04,431
you and the bald man meet again
in a museum somewhere.

1818
02:06:05,182 --> 02:06:06,016
What?

1819
02:06:06,809 --> 02:06:08,227
I'm getting off here.

1820
02:06:15,859 --> 02:06:17,278
Fuck this, give me your gun!

1821
02:06:18,279 --> 02:06:20,781
-Madam, we're flying.
-Give me your gun, you idiot!

1822
02:06:24,368 --> 02:06:25,202
Ah!

1823
02:06:34,461 --> 02:06:36,964
What are you doing, son of a bitch?
Move your ass!

1824
02:06:37,047 --> 02:06:37,923
Yes, ma'am!

1825
02:06:39,174 --> 02:06:40,718
Ah!

1826
02:06:47,641 --> 02:06:48,559
Open the door!

1827
02:07:02,531 --> 02:07:04,158
-Shit.
-Oh, shit.

1828
02:07:04,241 --> 02:07:05,367
Whoa!

1829
02:07:15,044 --> 02:07:16,420
Shit.

1830
02:07:17,921 --> 02:07:19,298
Damn it.

1831
02:07:28,265 --> 02:07:29,725
It's over, you fucker.

1832
02:07:35,022 --> 02:07:36,607
Huh?

1833
02:07:38,525 --> 02:07:39,443
Oh.

1834
02:07:41,570 --> 02:07:43,697
Shit! Fuck!

1835
02:07:45,574 --> 02:07:47,242
Strike three! You're out.

1836
02:07:47,326 --> 02:07:48,952
Time to switch the teams.

1837
02:08:32,746 --> 02:08:34,373
Why won't this thing work, fuck!

1838
02:08:34,456 --> 02:08:36,250
I don't wanna die!

1839
02:08:39,878 --> 02:08:41,130
Work, goddamn it!

1840
02:09:00,607 --> 02:09:02,067
Huh? Dad, look.

1841
02:09:05,487 --> 02:09:07,322
Hey, hey, look over there!

1842
02:09:12,286 --> 02:09:14,371
Ah! Mommy!

1843
02:09:35,559 --> 02:09:37,811
Hey! Park Dong-wook!

1844
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:39,855
Dong-wook!

1845
02:09:39,938 --> 02:09:41,023
Oh!

1846
02:09:42,524 --> 02:09:43,484
Park Dong-wook!

1847
02:09:46,236 --> 02:09:47,070
Hey!

1848
02:09:47,905 --> 02:09:48,781
Get him out!

1849
02:09:50,699 --> 02:09:53,035
-Ooh. Careful, careful.
-Grab him.

1850
02:09:53,827 --> 02:09:54,912
Slowly, slowly.

1851
02:09:57,831 --> 02:09:59,333
Hey! Hey!

1852
02:09:59,917 --> 02:10:01,126
Dong-wook!

1853
02:10:01,210 --> 02:10:03,337
You guys… close your eyes for me.

1854
02:10:16,683 --> 02:10:17,935
What are you doing?

1855
02:10:18,018 --> 02:10:19,394
-Ah!
-I'm alive.

1856
02:10:19,478 --> 02:10:20,771
I thought you were dead!

1857
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:23,565
I thought you wanted me dead.

1858
02:10:23,649 --> 02:10:26,068
Dong-wook… are you okay?

1859
02:10:26,151 --> 02:10:27,528
You're alive!

1860
02:10:27,611 --> 02:10:29,071
Ugh! Couldn't you just die?

1861
02:10:36,411 --> 02:10:39,414
Oh! What's this? It's money!

1862
02:10:39,998 --> 02:10:42,042
Hey, it's money! Money!

1863
02:10:47,297 --> 02:10:48,173
-Wow!
-Money!

1864
02:10:50,050 --> 02:10:51,301
Breaking news.

1865
02:10:51,385 --> 02:10:54,263
Ms. Kang In-sook, also known
as the Master of the Loan Sharks

1866
02:10:54,346 --> 02:10:56,431
and the President
of the Underground Economy,

1867
02:10:56,515 --> 02:10:57,975
has been arrested this afternoon.

1868
02:10:58,058 --> 02:11:00,060
Reporter Hong Ye-ji is here with more.

1869
02:11:00,143 --> 02:11:03,146
The prosecutors have
secured evidence that Ms. Kang laundered

1870
02:11:03,230 --> 02:11:06,024
over 50 billion won in cash,
and they planned to summon

1871
02:11:06,108 --> 02:11:08,735
all the people listed in her ledger
for an investigation.

1872
02:11:08,819 --> 02:11:11,613
After the police investigated
Kang's bank account details,

1873
02:11:11,697 --> 02:11:13,740
it was revealed that Kang
and her accomplices

1874
02:11:13,824 --> 02:11:14,825
not only laundered money,

1875
02:11:14,908 --> 02:11:17,953
but also engaged in real estate
speculation and tax evasion…

1876
02:11:24,459 --> 02:11:27,796
THE GUARDIAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
PROSECUTOR AHN PYEONG-WOOK

CIVIL SERVANT IDENTIFICATION CARD
AHN PYEONG-WOOK

1878
02:11:40,267 --> 02:11:42,853
This feels weird.

1879
02:11:43,353 --> 02:11:44,521
Is it really over?

1880
02:11:45,105 --> 02:11:46,732
I don't know. It doesn't feel real.

1881
02:11:47,399 --> 02:11:48,400
Why?

1882
02:11:48,483 --> 02:11:50,736
Do you wanna get the rest of the stamps
in that notebook?

1883
02:11:50,819 --> 02:11:52,529
Hey, hey, what the fuck?

1884
02:11:52,613 --> 02:11:54,323
-What's wrong with you?
-Whatever.

1885
02:11:54,948 --> 02:11:55,908
Hey, John Woo.

1886
02:11:56,408 --> 02:11:59,161
You should quit being a DJ.
Come and work in the field.

1887
02:11:59,244 --> 02:12:01,955
No. Sweating like that
is not really my thing.

1888
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:05,792
That's what I thought. You kinda suck.

1889
02:12:09,212 --> 02:12:10,047
Ow!

1890
02:12:10,923 --> 02:12:11,757
Ow!

1891
02:12:12,507 --> 02:12:14,092
Hee-young. I mean…

1892
02:12:14,176 --> 02:12:15,636
Galchi.

1893
02:12:18,096 --> 02:12:19,056
I owe you one.

1894
02:12:21,683 --> 02:12:24,019
What will you guys do without me?
You'll be so bored.

1895
02:12:24,102 --> 02:12:24,937
No way.

1896
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:27,314
That's not true. I don't need you.

1897
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:31,443
Okay, sure.

1898
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:37,157
Wait. How are we gonna get to Los Angeles?
Everything we've saved went up in flames.

1899
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:40,077
I don't know. I have no idea.

1900
02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:41,954
What're you doing?
Why are you talking like that?

1901
02:12:42,037 --> 02:12:45,040
Hey, what's there to be suspicious about?

1902
02:12:45,123 --> 02:12:46,208
What's that?

1903
02:12:46,291 --> 02:12:47,960
You were able to get some cash from them?

1904
02:12:48,043 --> 02:12:49,836
-Like some kinda weasel.
-Like a weasel?

1905
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:52,464
Yeah, you are like a weasel. You--

1906
02:12:52,547 --> 02:12:55,175
Bok-nam, I saw everything.

1907
02:12:55,258 --> 02:12:56,593
-What'd you see?
-This!

1908
02:12:56,677 --> 02:12:57,761
-Cash!
-Oh, wow!

1909
02:12:57,844 --> 02:12:59,221
Wow. There's so much here.

1910
02:12:59,304 --> 02:13:00,764
-Why are you doing this?
-What's this?

1911
02:13:00,847 --> 02:13:02,641
-What are you doing?
-Take all his clothes off.

1912
02:13:02,724 --> 02:13:04,810
-Get his pants off.
-Why would you take my pants off?

1913
02:13:08,397 --> 02:13:09,231
Hmm.

1914
02:13:13,402 --> 02:13:14,277
Ta-da!

1915
02:13:14,903 --> 02:13:15,737
Oh…

1916
02:13:16,363 --> 02:13:17,864
Oh.

1917
02:13:17,948 --> 02:13:19,241
-What the…
-Wow.

02:13:19,866 --> 02:13:21,243
You never disappoint me.

1919
02:13:23,245 --> 02:13:24,579
Damn.

1920
02:13:24,663 --> 02:13:30,043
We should really upgrade
before moving to Los Angeles. Hm?

1921
02:14:04,870 --> 02:14:07,998
Without people, there is no money,

1922
02:14:09,916 --> 02:14:11,251
not the…

1923
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:15,172

1924
02:14:21,636 --> 02:14:22,554
Damn!

1925
02:14:35,317 --> 02:14:38,028
What… What is it? What the hell is that?

1926
02:14:46,536 --> 02:14:48,413
Ow! Ow!

1927
02:14:49,247 --> 02:14:50,248
Stop it!

1928
02:14:50,832 --> 02:14:52,959
Stop it!
