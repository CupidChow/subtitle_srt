1
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,080
Your Highness, let's go.

2
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,700
Leng Nan.

3
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:44,950
Tianchen.

4
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,700
Lunar.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,540
Put it down.

6
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,200
Put it down!

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,450
But she wants to kill you.

8
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,950
I told you to put down the crossbow.

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,120
Yun Shang Zhou.

10
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,700
I'll let you die for

11
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,660
who died for me.

12
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,080
Let's go.

13
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,250
Go!

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,830
Go!

15
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
Leng Yan.

16
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,250
Lunar.

17
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,370
Lunar.

18
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,250
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,870
Why did you hide it from me?

20
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,000
to do such a dangerous thing alone?

21
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:40,000
Do you know

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,789
I thought I would never see you again.

23
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,870
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,579
I won't do it again.

25
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,829
For a woman,

26
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,410
for a woman?

27
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,700
For her,

28
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,500
for her.

29
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,410
Kill King of Freedom.

30
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,620
You are the King of Yun.

31
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,370
I have all kinds of women.

32
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,079
How can they compare to my moon?

33
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:55,829
You...

34
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,500
I'm warning you.

35
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,540
Don't try to hurt my Lunar.

36
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,410
Otherwise,

37
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,700
don't blame me for not considering the past.

38
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,830
I was hoping

39
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,910
to help me achieve my great cause.

40
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,700
Now it depends on you.

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,370
Looks like I have to plan again.

42
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,250
Why are you here?

43
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:47,079
Your Highness, please take us in.

44
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,950
Guys, get up.

45
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,250
Now I can’t protect myself.

46
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,079
How can I implicate you?

47
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,660
Your Highness, what do you mean?

48
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,790
Only by following you

49
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,330
that's called the cavalry.

50
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,910
Now General Leng is gone.

51
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,160
If you don't take us in,

52
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,080
our brothers

53
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,200
have no home.

54
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:06,830
Yes.

55
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,620
We have always admired you.

56
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,830
Brothers, we are willing to follow you to the death!

57
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,330
Yes, we'll follow you to the death!

58
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,660
From now on,

59
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,790
as long as I am alive,

60
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,080
I will never give up on you.

61
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,870
You want to hurt me?

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,620
Does it hurt?

63
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,040
No.

64
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,580
But it hurts.

65
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,450
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

66
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,160
I mean my heart.

67
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,750
Do you know

68
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,370
what your identity is exposed?

69
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,830
I understand.

70
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,660
But you were in danger.

71
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Si Han.

72
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,540
Heiyi Pavilion.

73
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,620
Give it to me.

74
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,370
Why?

75
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,910
Are you abandoning me?

76
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,620
You're being emotional.

77
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,500
You can't manage it anymore.

78
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,370
Since you're exposed, stop hiding.

79
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,450
Come to me.

80
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,540
Your Highness.

81
00:05:59,159 --> 00:05:59,830
Run!

82
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,080
Protect His Highness!

83
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,370
Your Highness, go!

84
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,870
No, Li Ran.

85
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,750
May I clear my name as soon as possible

86
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,790
May the country

87
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,950
no more smoke.

88
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,620
I

89
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,450
and the late emperor.

90
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,620
and the people.

91
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,660
But only you

92
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,660
let you down.

93
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,159
Heiyi Pavilion recruits new members.

94
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,000
We found this during our investigation.

95
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,250
It is said that

96
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,450
has been changed.

97
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,750
Everyone was killed before.

98
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,580
What about their master Si Han?

99
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,660
She has resigned.

100
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,700
Only she

101
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,200
stayed by the Regent's side.

102
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,750
I heard from the Grand Tutor that

103
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,160
this Heiyi Pavilion

104
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,620
is a private institution

105
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,160
to eliminate dissidents.

106
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,410
They only hire orphans.

107
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,540
The Grand Tutor is still in the imperial prison.

108
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,790
If you want to save him,

109
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,290
you have to sneak into Heiyi Pavilion.

110
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,160
and the fake Crown Prince.

111
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,540
We might be able to find the truth here.

112
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,700
Looks like we can only go to him.

113
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,500
Your Highness.

114
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,620
Your new ID cards are ready.

115
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,750
They won't find out your identity.

116
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,450
Thank you again.

117
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,160
Give me your ID card.

118
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,410
You two wait here.

119
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,830
Ye Xuan, Shi Da.

120
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,080
Identity approved.

121
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,950
You two come here.

122
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,830
Master Lin.

123
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,000
They are good.

124
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,450
and identification.

125
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,250
No problem.

126
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,410
Okay.

127
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,910
Take these two

128
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,330
into the Creeping.
