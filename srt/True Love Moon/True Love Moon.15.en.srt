1
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,750
Regent.

2
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,410
Long time no see.

3
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,700
You finally came back.

4
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,000
King Xiao Yao is still alive.

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,500
How can I let you deal with him alone?

6
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,370
King of Culture is still alive?

7
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,080
Now he's working with Luo Mingyue from Gaoshang Department,

8
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,910
there will be a bloody storm.

9
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,330
I am the regent now.

10
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,580
Why do you have to be so arrogant

11
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,789
and ruin your own prestige?

12
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:41,120
We can’t underestimate the power of King of Xiaoyao.

13
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,700
He was alone

14
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,789
to save the envoy.

15
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,039
So what?

16
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,580
Now we have the chance to win.

17
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,950
He and Luo Mingyue

18
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,000
can't change the outcome.

19
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,870
Your Majesty.

20
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,870
All potential dangers must be eliminated.

21
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,580
The Grand Tutor is not in your hands now.

22
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,370
Why don't you use the grand mentor

23
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,620
to catch them all.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,370
Just do as you said.

25
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,620
Grand Tutor.

26
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,040
I didn't expect

27
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,660
this day would come.

28
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,660
I, Changke, was appreciated by the late emperor.

29
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,950
I've been loyal and loyal all my life.

30
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,700
I didn't expect

31
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,829
would end up like this.

32
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:59,040
I feel guilty to the late emperor.

33
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,660
Yun Shang Zhou.

34
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,250
How dare you set me up...

35
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,450
to frame me.

36
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,500
Frame?

37
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,290
What do you mean?

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,250
The evidence in front of you is solid.

39
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,250
You fabricated the evidence.

40
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:18,660
Grand Tutor,

41
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,950
You made the same mistake

42
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:22,450
as Jin Xiao.

43
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,329
Don't say it

44
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,540
don't say it so easily.

45
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:27,540
By the way,

46
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,160
In a few days,

47
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,950
I will officially ascend the throne.

48
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,329
By then,

49
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,290
I will let you see

50
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,870
your choice

51
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,950
is wrong.

52
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:41,950
Guards!

53
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,660
What are you doing?

54
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:46,750
Watch the show.

55
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,829
Xiao Ran.

56
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,040
General Leng.

57
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:58,660
Where's His Highness?

58
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,080
He's inside.

59
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,870
I brought you Sun's dessert.

60
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,330
Thank you, General Leng.

61
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,700
Your Highness.

62
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,620
This is obviously a trap.

63
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,200
Why did you risk your life?

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,200
As long as there is a glimmer of hope,

65
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,910
I won't let it go.

66
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,250
I'll ask Lunar to send Xiao Ran back.

67
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:35,370
Leave the rest

68
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,080
to me.

69
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,120
Your Highness.

70
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,909
You don't allow Luo Mingyue to attend.

71
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,950
I can

72
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,950
on my own.

73
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,790
If she were here,

74
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,909
I'll be distracted.

75
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,790
And

76
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,159
when you're outside,

77
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,159
don't expose yourself

78
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,120
don't expose your identity.

79
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,659
But...

80
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:57,659
No buts.

81
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,870
This is an order.

82
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,080
Yes.

83
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,540
Everything is ready.

84
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,500
After you leave,

85
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,700
for half a month.

86
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,790
One package is enough.

87
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,450
Leng Nan has arranged

88
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,450
for you.

89
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,910
There are fewer soldiers on the water.

90
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:21,950
It's not easy to be found.

91
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,370
Be careful.

92
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,950
Sister Lunar, we're ready.

93
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,000
Let's go.

94
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,159
Lunar.

95
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,950
Take care of yourself.

96
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:42,620
Wait for me.

97
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,909
When did you become so clingy?

98
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,700
Don't make fun of him.

99
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:50,500
Let's go.

100
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,330
Lunar.

101
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,910
I hope we can meet again.

102
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,290
Your Highness.

103
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,830
I've arranged the guards inside.

104
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,580
Sister Lunar.

105
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,950
I wonder how Father and Mother are now.

106
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,120
I miss them so much.

107
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,000
My Lord.

108
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,409
My parents live in the city.

109
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:41,000
Why must you send me back to Jiangxia?

110
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,330
I was waiting for their news.

111
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,500
Your uncle and aunt are in the city.

112
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,200
Tianchen must be hiding something from me.

113
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,000
Boatman.

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,870
Turn around and go down the city.

115
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,370
Okay.

116
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,540
Your Highness.

117
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Take him away.

118
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,750
Grand Mentor, I'll take you away now.

119
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,830
King of Culture.

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,080
You can’t escape.

121
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,580
My uncle!

122
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,409
You really dare to break into the execution ground alone.

123
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,290
I've long heard about your heroic deeds in the border.

124
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,370
You're indeed brave.

125
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,500
Yun Shang Zhou.

126
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,910
We finally meet again.

127
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,410
Uncle,

128
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,000
You are really lucky.

129
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,450
You didn't even fall off the cliff.

130
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,750
How could God let me die?

131
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,200
He wants me to punish you

132
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,410
who killed his brother and father.

133
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,950
Don't slander me!

134
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,450
Attention, generals.

135
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,750
King Xiaoyao plotted to rebel.

136
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,330
Kill him on the spot.

137
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,289
Your Highness.

138
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,159
Leng Fu.

139
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,040
How dare you!

140
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,080
How dare you conspire against me!

141
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,450
I

142
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,250
Prince Xiaoyao has been guarding the border for more than ten years.

143
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,660
and loyal to his people.

144
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,500
If you hadn't framed him,

145
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,200
he would still be guarding the border.

146
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,160
What rebellion? Your Majesty.

147
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,950
Today,

148
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,120
I swear to protect King Xiao Yao.

149
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,290
Then none of you will live.

150
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,450
All royal army, listen to my command.

151
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,950
Fight to protect Prince Xiao Yao and leave!

152
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,910
Your Highness, run!

153
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,450
Leng Nan.

154
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,700
Tianchen.

155
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,330
Lunar.
