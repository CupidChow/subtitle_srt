1
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,330
General Leng, please come in.

2
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:42,950
My lords.

3
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:43,870
General Leng.

4
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,830
Your Highness.

5
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,830
Greetings, Your Highness.

6
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,660
I misunderstood you.

7
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,950
Ye Ran and I will go first.

8
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,750
Leng Nan, lead the troops to follow us.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,160
When we arrive in the capital,

10
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,580
they stationed at the outskirts of the capital.

11
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,370
Lieutenant Leng.

12
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,910
I'm so clumsy.

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,500
I should call you

14
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,200
General Leng.

15
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:19,539
That's all.

16
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,450
Thank you, Eunuch Liu.

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,750
Thank you for coming.

18
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:25,039
I also asked someone to prepare some gifts for you.

19
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,160
Please accept it.

20
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,410
We're friends.

21
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,620
Don't be so polite.

22
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,330
I'm glad you don't mind.

23
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,620
Thanks to you,

24
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,289
I can lead

25
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:37,500
the garrison army

26
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,000
Return the royal power.

27
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,370
Thank you on behalf of the late emperor.

28
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,410
You're exaggerating.

29
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
Grand Tutor

30
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,370
about everything.

31
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,289
His Highness saw that I was overwhelmed

32
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,620
to please Servant Liu.

33
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,160
It's understandable that

34
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,080
for turning against me.

35
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,250
It must be hard for you.

36
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,039
You pretended to surrender

37
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,160
so that all the soldiers survived.

38
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:00,910
But Ye Ran and the others...

39
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,000
Luo Mingyue.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,539
Leng Nan.

41
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,120
Luo Mingyue.

42
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,660
You killed my brother and you're still alive.

43
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,290
Why do you say that, General Leng?

44
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,040
You saved me with Prince Luo.

45
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,829
Is there any misunderstanding?

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,910
Impossible.

47
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,290
When I found out that His Highness and my brother

48
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,790
were killed by Gao Hang Si,

49
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,250
I searched every corner of the Highland Department.

50
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,410
I will never forget your face.

51
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,700
Your Highness.

52
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,750
Why are you with her?

53
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,120
Back then, Gao Hanji was also used by someone.

54
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,000
Now, she and I are investigating the truth together.

55
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,040
Besides,

56
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,290
Lunar saved me several times.

57
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,790
To me,

58
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,000
she saved my life.

59
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,579
I've never seen you have feelings for any woman.

60
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,620
but you're so biased towards her.

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,200
It seems that whatever I do

62
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,870
to do anything.

63
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,450
In that case,

64
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,370
let bygones be bygones.

65
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,200
Your Highness, General Leng, don't stand there.

66
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,370
Please take a seat.

67
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,410
Have a taste.

68
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,000
Ran, don't you like His Highness?

69
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,120
Why is he the last one?

70
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
Serve tea to His Highness.

71
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,750
I didn't know your identity before.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,870
Ran, I'll make another bowl.

73
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,329
Don't bother.

74
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,000
This smoke tea is rare.

75
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,329
I thought Miss Luo would like it.

76
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,620
Please wait a moment.

77
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,120
Your Highness.

78
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,040
Please.

79
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,079
Lunar, try it.

80
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,160
Your Highness.

81
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,910
I've always been concerned about you.

82
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,500
I know you like this smoked tea.

83
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,250
so I prepared it early in the morning.

84
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,500
Since you made it for His Highness,

85
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,330
how can I overstep my boundaries?

86
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,079
Please enjoy.

87
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,620
I'll take my leave.

88
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,790
I've long heard that Grand Tutor's daughter is knowledgeable.

89
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,910
She's also good at making tea.

90
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,830
I have to taste it today.

91
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,330
You deserve your reputation.

92
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,909
Thank you, Minister.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,500
It's rare that your daughter is thoughtful.

94
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,580
If I can marry you,

95
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,409
it would be a good story.

96
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,200
Your Highness, this is Zong Yan, Minister of Revenue.

97
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,750
He's a trusted aide of the Crown Prince.

98
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,790
He's one of us.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,330
Your Highness, I've checked.

100
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,409
The Crown Prince...

101
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:51,830
by Yun Shang zhou.

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,909
by Yun Shang Zhou.

103
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,000
Yun Shang Zhou framed His Highness.

104
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,370
Now we know he's the mastermind.

105
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,120
Your Highness.

106
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,910
After I go with my brothers,

107
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,500
save the Crown Prince first

108
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,580
and then put him out.

109
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,200
No.

110
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,410
The court...

111
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,660
has been controlled by Yun Shang zhou.

112
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,540
This time, he's a nobody.

113
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,950
and no evidence.

114
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,620
It's no different from throwing himself into the net.

115
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,000
You're right, Your Highness.

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,160
Regarding saving the Crown Prince,

117
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,040
about saving the Crown Prince.

118
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,120
But I'm worried that...

119
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,370
if the Crown Prince

120
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,580
will the Crown Prince be killed?

121
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,330
I have an idea.

122
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,250
Go ahead.

123
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,410
Since we're surrounded by the Imperial Guards,

124
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,409
we can't get in without the order from Yun Shang zhou.

125
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,409
Then...

126
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,790
to get in.

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,080
This is a good idea.

128
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,540
But as far as I know,

129
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,120
the disguise has long been lost.

130
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,580
Where should I learn this?

131
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,620
You mean...

132
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:46,950
Cang Jiu?

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,540
That's right.

134
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:49,950
Doctor Ghost.

135
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,080
Cang Jiu.

136
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,000
Your Highness.

137
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,160
Your Highness.

138
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
I'm going back to the military camp today.

139
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,450
Take care of yourself.

140
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,410
Don't worry, Your Highness.

141
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,830
Yun Shang Zhou has already regarded me as a coward.

142
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,120
I'm not on guard.

143
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,200
It's convenient for me to act.

144
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,540
If you have any news,

145
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,870
I will ask the Grand Tutor

146
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,120
to pass the message.

147
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:32,870
Take care, Your Highness.

148
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,120
I'll take my leave.

149
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,909
Your Highness.

150
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:43,200
I have something for you.

151
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,659
I have something to do.

152
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,909
See you.

153
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:52,540
Lunar.

154
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,250
I didn't expect

155
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,290
a powerful prince on the battlefield

156
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,370
has such a helpless situation.

157
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,790
Maybe I made you

158
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,500
that made you misunderstand.

159
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,040
His Highness has never

160
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,540
to make Xiao Ran misunderstand.

161
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,080
It was my wishful thinking.

162
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,790
But now,

163
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,580
I know what you mean.

164
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,620
That's good.

165
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,080
This gift box

166
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,160
is a gift for you and Miss Luo

167
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,540
for saving my father.

168
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,410
Unexpectedly,

169
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,080
I caused you a misunderstanding.

170
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,660
I'll accept

171
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,620
on behalf of Lunar.

172
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,750
However,

173
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,410
No need to be so courteous.

174
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,120
Grand Tutor, you're doing this for the country and the people.

175
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,080
Lunar and I

176
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,500
will protect him.

177
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,790
Thank you, Your Highness.

178
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,200
If there's nothing else,

179
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:39,330
I'll take my leave.

180
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,370
Lunar.

181
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,500
Lunar!

182
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,659
Lunar.

183
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,620
When His Highness and Grand Tutor's daughter get married,

184
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,909
you must choose

185
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,870
a beautiful night.

186
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,620
It will be beautiful then.

187
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,910
In the border,

188
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,870
in the border.

189
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,910
When the sunset sets,

190
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,540
God is the kindest and affectionate one.

191
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,160
Most women can wait

192
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,750
who returned home with sheep.

193
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,620
The senior once asked us

194
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,450
if we met

195
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,540
who made me

196
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,250
and desperate

197
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,370
and live and die together.

198
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,410
Now,

199
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,660
I've met

200
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,250
That person

201
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,620
is you.
