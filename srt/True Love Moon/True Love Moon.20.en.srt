1
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,450
You must have lied to me.

2
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,120
Just give it a try.

3
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,450
Are you okay?

4
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,830
I'm fine.

5
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,789
Let's go.

6
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:15,910
Luo Mingyue ran away.

7
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,039
Go after him!

8
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,039
The well is so deep.

9
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,080
How can we get out?

10
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,660
I'll lift you up to see if we can get out.

11
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,370
Can you reach it?

12
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,160
No.

13
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,540
Try again.

14
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,790
Try again.

15
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,250
OK.

16
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,290
Tianchen. Tianchen.

17
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,370
Tianchen.

18
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,870
Tianchen, how are you?

19
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,000
Tianchen.

20
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,660
You are poisoned.

21
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,120
Tianchen.

22
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,120
Tianchen.

23
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,250
Yun Shang Zhou.

24
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,500
Ridiculous.

25
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,790
a pawn

26
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,829
that you can manipulate.

27
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:45,329
Turns out

28
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,660
Fang Shan forced my father to die

29
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,450
was set up by you.

30
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,950
Yun Shang Zhou.

31
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,080
[I must...]

32
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,200
Fushi!

33
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,160
Fushi!

34
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,160
So cold.

35
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,580
Fortunately, the poison is not deep.

36
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,329
It's still cold.

37
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,159
Yue.

38
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,700
When everything is over,

39
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,040
I want to marry you.

40
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,500
Will you marry me?

41
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,620
I thought I caught some big prey.

42
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,290
But there are two living people.

43
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,040
Sir,

44
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,450
can you pull us up?

45
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,200
Sorry, wait.

46
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,580
What did you say?

47
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,540
Yun Shang Zhou is from Yu State.

48
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,500
I heard it with my own ears.

49
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,500
Back then,

50
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,830
when His Majesty brought the Crown Princess of Laoyu State to the palace,

51
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,500
she was pregnant.

52
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,080
Yun Shang Zhou's biological father...

53
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,540
is the Crown Prince of Yu.

54
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,830
How could this happen?

55
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,620
Yun Shang Zhou knows his origin.

56
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,790
More importantly,

57
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,580
Mo Qi has been instigating him to restore the country.

58
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,330
Since he has the blood of Yu,

59
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,450
we can't let him continue to control the court.

60
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,620
What are you going to do?

61
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,409
Steal the Tiger Tally?

62
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,700
Okay, I'll go with you.

63
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,330
The situation in the palace is unknown.

64
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,120
I'll go and check it out.

65
00:06:59,250 --> 00:06:59,870
Cheer up.

66
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,700
Yes.

67
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,000
How is it?

68
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,250
We've reinforced the guards.

69
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,950
There's no way to get close.

70
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,750
Yun Shang Zhou has always been cautious.

71
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,000
Looks like we need to think about it.

72
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,120
Sir, you can't go in.

73
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,500
Get lost!

74
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,450
Please allow me to inform him.

75
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:36,950
My lord.

76
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,370
I failed to stop him.

77
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,120
Forgive me, Your Highness.

78
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,790
Forget it.

79
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:44,700
You may leave.

80
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:45,830
Yes.

81
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,330
If other ministers

82
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,659
know you are so rude,

83
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,290
I can't protect myself.

84
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,750
I'm not afraid of those old men.

85
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,250
Why have you been avoiding me lately?

86
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,620
I'm busy today.

87
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,160
I have no time to take care of you.

88
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,750
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

89
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,040
When did you start

90
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,120
When did you start

91
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,040
change the national number?

92
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
I must plan it well.

93
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,700
Don't be perfunctory.

94
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,040
Yun is our enemy.

95
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,620
Only by regaining the title of Yu,

96
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,540
can we clear our shame back then.

97
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,789
All these years, have you forgotten

98
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,450
Have you forgotten who your ancestors are?

99
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,120
Or

100
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,580
you're not interested

101
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,950
who insulted your mother

102
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,250
with your mother?

103
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,500
He has always favored the Crown Prince.

104
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,160
How could there be any feelings?

105
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,870
I'm just thinking

106
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,660
if you want to restore the country

107
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,000
for Yu State

108
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,910
or for

109
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,750
for yourself?

110
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,160
I'm your biological father.

111
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,660
How could you think of me like that?

112
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,450
Maybe I was overthinking.

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,540
But I'm always suspicious.

114
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,160
You taught me that.

115
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,200
Okay.

116
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,830
Yun Shang Zhou.

117
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,250
If one day,

118
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,540
your background...

119
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,330
is known by the people of Yun.

120
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,870
will you still be able to...

121
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,290
the throne of Yun?
