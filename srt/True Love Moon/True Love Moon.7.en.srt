1
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,500
Si Han.

2
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,410
Are you okay?

3
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,000
Thank you for saving my life, Your Highness.

4
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,620
You're welcome.

5
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,870
If you hadn't saved me in time,

6
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,160
my father would have been killed.

7
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,120
That day, after Lord Qi and Lord Zhuang...

8
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,950
ran into Yun Shang Zhou with me,

9
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,580
they passed away one after another.

10
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,870
What we can be sure of now is that

11
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,620
Qi and Zhuang didn't die suddenly.

12
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,250
They must have been murdered.

13
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,500
The mastermind...

14
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,080
is most likely Yun Shang Zhou.

15
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,830
Father.

16
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,000
I remember

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,620
Mr. Kim went with you that day.

18
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,910
In that case,

19
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,200
wouldn't it be...

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't worry.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,410
I've informed Lord Jin

22
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,620
to strengthen the defense in his mansion.

23
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,039
Yun Shang Zhou's plan...

24
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:49,080
is clearly eliminating dissidents.

25
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,580
Maybe the Crown Prince

26
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,289
has been controlled by him.

27
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,000
He is vicious.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,080
His purpose is obvious.

29
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,700
Could it be that...

30
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,289
was also done by Yun Shang Zhou?

31
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,620
Who is the beneficiary of this matter?

32
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,910
the one who framed me

33
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,620
and Gao Hanji.

34
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,750
Ridiculous!

35
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,539
Yun Shang Zhou is crazy.

36
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,620
How can he rule Yun?

37
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,370
and ascend the throne?

38
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,870
But there is no evidence now.

39
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,450
These days,

40
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,829
we'll find a way to confirm Crown Prince's safety.

41
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,329
We'll discuss it later.

42
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,660
Lunar.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,910
Lunar, calm down.

44
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:30,910
Let go!

45
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,750
Since you know where I'm going,

46
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,660
don't stop me.

47
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,750
But if you go there now,

48
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,950
you'll be caught.

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,700
I just want to ask her

50
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,410
why she is so cruel.

51
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:40,700
She disregarded our friendship

52
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,750
and her master.

53
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,620
Why did she do that?

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,870
I know.

55
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,200
you must be very sad

56
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,829
by the person he trusted the most.

57
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,620
But this is not a trivial matter.

58
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,910
Just wait.

59
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:56,950
Once we find the evidence,

60
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,910
we'll be able to expose Yun Shang Zhou's conspiracy.

61
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,660
She's really not a man.

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,870
Could it be that His Highness and her...

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,700
Master Lin.

64
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,750
Was there an accident during the assassination?

65
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,829
Grand Tutor's Residence?

66
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,040
I don't know when there was a martial arts master.

67
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,370
My hand was hurt by him.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,079
Looks like

69
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,040
the two old ghosts' deaths

70
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,829
what did the grand mentor notice?

71
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,329
We can't do anything recently.

72
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,370
By the way,

73
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,370
Luo Mingyue

74
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,579
is there too.

75
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,450
What?

76
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,000
She hid there?

77
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,120
I'll send someone

78
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,160
to bring her back.

79
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,580
No need.

80
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,040
She will come to me herself.

81
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,370
Master Lin.

82
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,330
Someone shot the arrow just now.

83
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,040
and shot this letter from outside.

84
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,160
Tinglan Mountain.

85
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,200
Today is your birthday.

86
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:57,250
I didn't expect

87
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,870
to let you live such a simple life.

88
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,790
so that you can escape from death.

89
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,290
Being with you

90
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,370
is already my best birthday gift.

91
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,580
I hope we can be together

92
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,910
on my next birthday.

93
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,160
How about

94
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,040
watch the sunrise at Tinglan Mountain?

95
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,120
Sure.

96
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,330
Just like before.

97
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,870
From now on, we'll celebrate every birthday together.

98
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,580
We can't see the sunrise together.

99
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,830
Why did you do that?

100
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,159
I just want to avenge my parents.

101
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,370
What?

102
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,790
Back then,

103
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,370
Fang Shan killed my parents

104
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,830
he even killed my parents.

105
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:52,370
Now,

106
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,540
I'm doing this

107
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,450
is just an eye for an eye.

108
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,950
Why not?

109
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,080
Impossible.

110
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,910
Master can't be the murderer who killed your parents.

111
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,700
Fine.

112
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,250
Even if

113
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,750
for your personal grudge,

114
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,700
for your personal revenge.

115
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,910
That's dozens of lives.

116
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,620
Say no more.

117
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,410
I just want to avenge my parents.

118
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,790
As for their lives,

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,950
what does it have to do with me?

120
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,500
So besides the Imperial Guards,

121
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,160
the one who has been after me

122
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,500
is you.

123
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,870
After all,

124
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,080
we're sisters.

125
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,950
Unfortunately,

126
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,409
you know too much.

127
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,330
I can't let you stay.

128
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,250
Why are you working for Yun Shang Zhou?

129
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,540
Only the dead...

130
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,250
deserve to know.

131
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,370
Lunar.

132
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,160
Wake up!

133
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,040
Hang in there.

134
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,160
I'm Yun Tianchen, here to see a doctor.

135
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,910
She is the first person

136
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,290
who dares to reject me.

137
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,910
Why are you begging me again after something happened?

138
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,950
I apologize on behalf of Luo Mingyue again.

139
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,120
It's a matter of life and death.

140
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,700
Please forgive me.

141
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,950
I'll agree to any conditions.

142
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,620
Okay.

143
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,200
Come in, little boy.

144
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:45,870
Come on.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,080
Be careful.

146
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,000
Come on.

147
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,909
Kid,

148
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,290
Do you keep your promise?

149
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,200
I've been studying a lot of new medicines lately.

150
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,620
I need someone to test the medicine.

151
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,750
As long as you agree to save me,

152
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,370
I'm willing to test the medicine.

153
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,500
Think carefully.

154
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,200
You ran away

155
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,830
because you couldn't stand this torture.

156
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,950
Now you're here.

157
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,910
If you want to go back on your word,

158
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,750
it's not too late now.

159
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,409
I won't regret it.

160
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,120
Please save me in time.

161
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,409
Okay.

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,620
Who is this little girl to you?

163
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,250
How dare you sacrifice so much for her?

164
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,660
She and I have been through life and death together.

165
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,290
Now,

166
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,750
a best friend.

167
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,540
Come here.

168
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,250
Thank you for saving me.

169
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,700
Granny!

170
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,790
Let go of me!

171
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,160
Who told you to bring them in?

172
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,910
Granny.

173
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,250
Saving a life

174
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,830
is better than building a seven-level pagoda.

175
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,000
Let go of me!

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,450
Fine.

177
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,580
I'll let you go if you beg me.

178
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,120
Granny, don't push your luck.

179
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,000
If you don't let go,

180
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,830
I'm going to fight back.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,910
Really?

182
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,250
I'd like to see

183
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,450
how you can repay me.

184
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,950
Aren't you childish?

185
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,330
You always bully me at your age.

186
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,950
Childish.

187
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,120
Not only am I childish,

188
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,450
20 years ago,

189
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,620
I was blind.

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,160
I was blinded by oil.

191
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,620
You left your daughter alone

192
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,410
and insisted on going down the mountain with you.

193
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,040
Look at you.

194
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,830
You dare not admit what you did.

195
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,910
You hid from me for decades.

196
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,410
Your father is my master.

197
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,160
He saved my life

198
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,500
saved my life.

199
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,790
He helped me with my rebirth.

200
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,580
He didn't allow us to be together.

201
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,250
What can I do?

202
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,410
I don't care.

203
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,910
Now I finally caught you.

204
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,160
All these years,

205
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,500
you have to give me an explanation.

206
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,500
I...

207
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,700
run anymore.

208
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,750
My bad.

209
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,290
Please forgive me.

210
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,660
That's more like it.

211
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,790
That old lady is so cruel.

212
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,160
I'm listening.

213
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,700
What did you say to that young man?

214
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,330
I knew you wouldn't admit it.

215
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,500
I rejected you before I got mad at that girl.

216
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,330
So?

217
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,620
I just want to vent my anger on you.

218
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,120
to fool them.

219
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,500
Enough.

220
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,080
Don't be too cruel.

221
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,620
I know what to do.

222
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,120
Miss, how's your injury?

223
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,700
She's badly injured.

224
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,250
But I asked him

225
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,410
to take a herbal bath.

226
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,830
What?
