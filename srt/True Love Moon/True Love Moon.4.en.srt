1
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,580
Hurry up! After them!

2
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,620
Yes. Okay.

3
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,330
Stop! Stop!

4
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,750
Stop!

5
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,160
Stop!

6
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,370
Your Highness.

7
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,750
It's good to see you.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,870
Do you know me?

9
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,330
Three years ago,

10
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:15,539
I once worked

11
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,500
for a year.

12
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,039
Later, he had a relapse of injury.

13
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,250
I had to go back to my hometown.

14
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,410
and became a butler in Mo Qiao's residence.

15
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,330
A few days ago,

16
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,039
I accidentally

17
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,120
I heard Mr. Mo Heng

18
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,660
in the study with a man.

19
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:37,750
Recently,

20
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:40,160
mentioned the Crown Prince many times.

21
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,870
What did he say?

22
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,950
to send all the trusted aides of the Crown Prince...

23
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,910
Then,

24
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,080
they found me.

25
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,410
After that,

26
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,910
I saw the Imperial Guards barging into the mansion.

27
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,540
and slaughtered everyone in the mansion.

28
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,790
What about Mo Qiao?

29
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,830
At that time,

30
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,080
I just wanted to run away.

31
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,910
I didn't have time, Mr. Mo.

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,120
Baili Chuan.

33
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,290
Baili Chuan!

34
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,040
You guys, go over there.

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,410
Yes.

36
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,250
Luo Mingyue.

37
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,040
We haven't visited you yet.

38
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,829
but you come here yourself.

39
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,910
You are not Imperial Guards.

40
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,790
Who are you?

41
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,750
According to the order,

42
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,500
whoever kills Luo Mingyue

43
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,540
will be rewarded.

44
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,790
Luo Mingyue, where are you?

45
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,660
Do you hear me?

46
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,700
Answer me if you hear me.

47
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,659
Let's go.

48
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,659
Luo Mingyue, I hope it's not you.

49
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,080
Master Lin.

50
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,950
Luo Mingyue is dead.

51
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,750
You can rest assured now.

52
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,000
Luo Mingyue is not an ordinary person.

53
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,200
As long as we can't find her body,

54
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:41,830
One day,

55
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,120
don't take it lightly.

56
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:44,790
I understand.

57
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,870
I've arranged men to search.

58
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,870
Gao Hanji was destroyed.

59
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,250
Where is she?

60
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,870
She must be looking for clues

61
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,830
and find the truth.

62
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,750
Don’t worry.

63
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,200
The body of Baili Chuan

64
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,620
was found in his house and cellar.

65
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,450
Luo Mingyue fell into the water severely injured.

66
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,830
There's no chance of survival.

67
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,790
Luo Mingyue.

68
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,410
Are you really dead?

69
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,250
Why did you force Luo Mingyue to die?

70
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,910
Why? Why?

71
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,250
Luo Mingyue is a fugitive of Gaoshou.

72
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,700
Now we found Baili Chuan.

73
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,790
As the master of Heiyi Pavilion,

74
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,750
I was ordered to investigate.

75
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,160
It’s not what I want

76
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,040
is not what I want.

77
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,330
I acted on impulse just now.

78
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,409
You did well.

79
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,200
If you want anything,

80
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,040
just let me know.

81
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,500
Si Han, I want nothing else.

82
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,450
I just want

83
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,450
to be with you forever.

84
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,700
Okay.

85
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,830
Go down and rest.

86
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,870
You're back.

87
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,950
Be careful next time.

88
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,290
Don't be so reckless.

89
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,659
It's okay. It's just a minor injury.

90
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,250
I can draw my sword faster next time.

91
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,540
You...

92
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,080
Lunar.

93
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,080
You're back.

94
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,330
Your Highness.

95
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,540
What happened to your face?

96
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,250
Maybe it was scratched by accident.

97
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,250
Let me wipe it for you.

98
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,250
You're injured.

99
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,040
I'm working at the Bureau of Gaoshang.

100
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,950
This is a minor injury.

101
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,080
Lunar.

102
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,540
It's so dangerous.

103
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,250
How about I tell my father

104
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,370
to change your position?

105
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,200
Why?

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,870
Gao Hanji raised me and raised me.

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,330
Master is like my father.

108
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,500
I can't leave him.

109
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,750
But I'm worried about you.

110
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,120
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

111
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,040
I'm leaving.

112
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,790
Your silk.

113
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,660
Back then,

114
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,410
in the name of Gao Hanji,

115
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,040
I did all this for you.

116
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,910
I hope you can enjoy everything

117
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,200
you can enjoy it safely.

118
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,080
But why did you

119
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,080
choose to leave me?

120
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,500
Gao Hang Department committed a crime against the superior and murdered Xiaoyao Dynasty.

121
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,870
From now on, the imperial court will no longer be the Chief of Judicial Court.

122
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,950
Luo Mingyue.
