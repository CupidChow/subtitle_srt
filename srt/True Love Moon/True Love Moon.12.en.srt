1
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,370
Go!

2
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,750
Si Han, I've let you down.

3
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,290
In the end,

4
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,830
Luo Mingyue escaped.

5
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,120
Today,

6
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,039
today.

7
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,660
Master Lin.

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,750
The higher-ups said

9
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,120
to meet you at the usual place.

10
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,329
Look at me.

11
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,410
Do I look like Luo Mingyue?

12
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,660
How can a fugitive

13
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,579
compared with you?

14
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,790
I just want you to answer me whether I look like him or not.

15
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,790
No.

16
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,329
Your beauty

17
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,160
is unique

18
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,829
in my heart.

19
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,750
If he thinks so,

20
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,910
I'll be content.

21
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:21,950
Your Highness.

22
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,250
Miss Si Han is here.

23
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,040
Your Highness.

24
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,500
Are you hiding something

25
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,160
from me?

26
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,120
I've been doing my best

27
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,160
to serve His Highness the second.

28
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,410
I never hide anything.

29
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,040
I trust you.

30
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:50,410
I understand.

31
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:52,790
Why did you lie to me?

32
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,750
I didn't.

33
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,870
I really didn't.

34
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,870
I'll give you another chance.

35
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,120
Let me help you recall it.

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,660
Amazing.

37
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,160
Hanging.

38
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,580
Tsukasa.

39
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:15,950
I...

40
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,290
I know I was wrong.

41
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,540
What did you do wrong?

42
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,790
I shouldn't have kept it a secret.

43
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,370
that Luo Mingyue faked her death.

44
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,120
Luo Mingyue is still alive.

45
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,080
You can do this?

46
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,830
You always play with swords.

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,200
If you don't learn,

48
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:57,080
you will die alone.

49
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,540
If there is nothing else, Your Highness,

50
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,290
I'll take my leave.

51
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,080
You look

52
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,410
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.

53
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,870
Your Highness.

54
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,870
has never looked at me so seriously.

55
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,500
Are you angry?

56
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,120
I was reckless just now.

57
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,410
I dare not.

58
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,950
I swear

59
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,620
it won't happen again.

60
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,660
Because I love you,

61
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,700
because I love you.

62
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,200
Please forgive me.

63
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,409
Ming...

64
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,620
Where is Lunar?

65
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,290
Why isn't she back yet?

66
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,790
I'll get you some medicine.

67
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,159
Master left me some medicine.

68
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,000
Where is the medicine?

69
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,040
Over there.

70
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,159
That was close.

71
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,580
Take the medicine.

72
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,790
From now on,

73
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,950
you should recuperate.

74
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,540
Don't worry about other things.

75
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,790
Yes.

76
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,160
Yes, Your Highness.

77
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,750
Did Shangzhou recognize you?

78
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,620
Yes.

79
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,410
I also

80
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,750
I also find it strange.

81
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,410
I was wearing a scarf.

82
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,410
But he recognized me right away.

83
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,120
And...

84
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,620
after he recognized me,

85
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,370
he didn't mean to kill me.

86
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,910
Shangzhou designed

87
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,870
and wiped out the entire family of Gao Xu Si.

88
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,580
Logically,

89
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,540
he would kill you.

90
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,040
Now you're running away from him.

91
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,370
Could it be...

92
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,330
he has feelings for you?

93
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,950
Yes.

94
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:57,750
What are you doing?

95
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,580
Yun Shang Zhou.

96
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,000
Your mother is from Yu State.

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,080
You don't deserve to stay here.

98
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,750
You, leave now.

99
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,370
Don't bully His Highness the second.

100
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,330
Luo Mingyue.

101
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,620
How dare you!

102
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,000
You're an orphan adopted by Gaoshang Department.

103
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,830
How dare you go against me?

104
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,830
Beat her!

105
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,450
Don't hit her!

106
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,790
When I was young,

107
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,370
I couldn't stand the princes

108
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,700
to be arrogant and domineering,

109
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,409
So I helped him.

110
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,200
He also helped me.

111
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,950
Could it be...

112
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,659
because of this?

113
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,200
If I had known

114
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,750
he had become like this,

115
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,909
I don't care about him.

116
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,370
The mother of Shangzhou

117
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,370
left him when he was very young.

118
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,040
The Empress raised him.

119
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,370
But because his mother was from the Rain State,

120
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,620
because his mother was from Yu State.

121
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,750
Maybe

122
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,250
That's why he looks like this.

123
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,750
I see.

124
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,160
Disguising?

125
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,950
That person must have disguised as me

126
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,950
and sneaked into the Crown Prince's mansion.

127
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,290
Your Highness.

128
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,290
I heard that

129
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,080
there is

130
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,160
there is a person called Ghost Doctor Cang Jiu

131
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,250
who knows this sorcery.

132
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,750
Why is the Crown Prince in contact with people in Jianghu?

133
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,000
Search carefully.

134
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,370
Ask Heiyi Pavilion

135
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,540
to investigate.

136
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,290
How is the search going?

137
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,790
It's all set.

138
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,830
Your Highness.

139
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,450
How many days do we have left?
