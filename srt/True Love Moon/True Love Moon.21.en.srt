1
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,080
Yun Shang Zhou.

2
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,450
Think about it.

3
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,830
If one day,

4
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,830
your background...

5
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,910
is known by the people of Yun.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,370
will you still be able to...

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,330
the throne of Yun?

8
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,910
What do you mean?

9
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,200
Now in front of you,

10
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,580
in front of you.

11
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,750
First, when you were in power,

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,290
when you have great power.

13
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,870
You can hide everything...

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,290
and continue to be the king of Yun.

15
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,700
But don't blame me for not reminding you.

16
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,750
Paper can never cover the fire.

17
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,789
If one day, when you are unprepared,

18
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,200
your background is exposed,

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,750
you'll be doomed.

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,120
Are you threatening me?

21
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,330
It's for your own good.

22
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,660
No one can know

23
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:29,410
my identity.

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,870
Why are you so angry?

25
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:36,500
I'm really starting.

26
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,160
I just need time.

27
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,080
Right?

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,950
Have some tea.

29
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,750
Calm down.

30
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,370
Give me an exact time.

31
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,370
When will you come back?

32
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,040
I said give me an exact time.

33
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,539
There's no need for that.

34
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,120
After you die,

35
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,580
you can see the rainland there.

36
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,000
What do you mean?

37
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,040
You...

38
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,329
I hate it when people threaten me.

39
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:36,870
How dare you kill your father?

40
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,700
to achieve your goal.

41
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,910
You taught me that too.

42
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,950
You'll see the people of the Rain soon.

43
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,700
They will call you

44
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,200
Your Highness.

45
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,660
Go fulfill your dream of reviving the country.

46
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,870
Sir.

47
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,750
I'm here to see you.

48
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,079
Master.

49
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,290
Si Han, you've been working late these days.

50
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,079
so I made some ginseng soup for you.

51
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,000
Thank you.

52
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,450
Put it down.

53
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,040
Poor the century-old ginseng.

54
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,160
If you drink it after it's cold,

55
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,120
it'll be a waste.

56
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,790
Si Han.

57
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,250
Give it to me.

58
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,540
If I don't drink it while it's hot,

59
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,120
I guess

60
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,200
you won't make soup for me anymore.

61
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,250
You know me well.

62
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,580
Good skill.

63
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,870
What's going on?

64
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,790
Is the soup poisonous?

65
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:39,290
Master.

66
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:43,909
Let's go.

67
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:49,909
I know.

68
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,830
I made too many mistakes.

69
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,159
I dare not ask for your forgiveness.

70
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,580
But now,

71
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,830
I really don't know

72
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,200
where to go.

73
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,790
and talk to.

74
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,580
Master.

75
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,540
I...

76
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,950
I know you're here.

77
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,620
Come out.

78
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,200
I believed in slanders

79
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,500
and killed my master.

80
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,290
Lunar.

81
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,080
Kill me.

82
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,580
Kill me.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,909
What do you know?

84
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,500
I found a secret letter

85
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,450
in Yun Shang Zhou's study.

86
00:05:58,409 --> 00:05:59,159
It turns out

87
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,790
it wasn't Master who killed my father.

88
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,830
It was Mo Qi.

89
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,160
I was wrong.

90
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,040
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,450
I was wrong.

92
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,410
I've been investigating their whereabouts.

93
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,159
but there was no news.

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,080
I didn't expect that...

95
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,290
Yun Shang Zhou.

96
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,830
You are a devil.

97
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,870
You finally know who he really is.

98
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,909
Previously,

99
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,870
I trusted him too much

100
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,540
I was too emotional.

101
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,290
Can you do us a favor?

102
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,120
What can I do for you?

103
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,410
Your Highness.

104
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,660
One more drink.

105
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,500
Your Highness.

106
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,040
Drink more.

107
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,950
Your Highness.

108
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,200
I can't drink anymore.

109
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,370
Your Highness.

110
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,750
Your Highness.

111
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,160
You guys.

112
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,910
take care of His Highness.

113
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,370
I'll ask the kitchen to make some hangover soup.

114
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,200
Yes.

115
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,040
This is what you want.

116
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,000
Great.

117
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,250
Thank you, Si Han.

118
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,580
The most important thing now

119
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,620
is to save the Crown Prince first.

120
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,000
The Crown Prince's mansion is heavily guarded.

121
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,500
You must be very careful.
