1
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,370
How's your injury?

2
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,950
She's badly injured.

3
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,500
But I asked him

4
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,660
to take a herbal bath.

5
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,200
What?

6
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,120
What are you doing there?

7
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,620
I can't let that brat

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,040
take advantage of my good disciple.

9
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,370
Look.

10
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,910
You're really senile.

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,790
They both have feelings for each other.

12
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,910
I'm afraid they don't even know.

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,250
That makes sense.

14
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,750
The bystander is clear.

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,750
How about this?

16
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,410
Let's help them

17
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:15,200
so that they won't be like us when we were young.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
like us when we were young.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,750
You don't even know you have someone you like.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,830
That's right.

21
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,250
You're awake.

22
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:48,950
Senior.

23
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,450
Why am I here?

24
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,870
You're seriously injured.

25
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,789
That jerk sent you here.

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,160
Take the medicine.

27
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,500
Thank you for your help.

28
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,080
If I offended you before,

29
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,080
please forgive me.

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
No need.

31
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,870
You were ungrateful before.

32
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,080
and refused to be my disciple.

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,000
Now that something happened,

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,700
and asked him to bring you to me.

35
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,660
What do you take me for?

36
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,200
You come and go whenever you want.

37
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,410
Someone is already atoning for your sins.

38
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,250
What do you mean?

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,620
My flowing rules

40
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,790
A life for a life.

41
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,750
Everything must be equivalent exchange.

42
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,040
How is he now?

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,370
In order to save you,

44
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,829
to save you.

45
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:38,790
Senior.

46
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,410
Please let him go.

47
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,750
I'm the one who was saved.

48
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,370
I'll try the medicine.

49
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,079
Girl.

50
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:48,079
Who is he to you?

51
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,370
Why are you so nervous about him?

52
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,500
Since it's an alliance ceremony,

53
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,790
one for each.

54
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,200
He can’t test the medicine.

55
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,250
He’s the King of Cultivation.

56
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,870
I don’t care who he is.

57
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,700
As long as you are willing to test the medicine for him,

58
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,000
he can leave.

59
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay.

60
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,500
I promise to test the medicine.

61
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,410
If anything happens,

62
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,870
please

63
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,450
Please tell him.

64
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,290
Tell him

65
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,120
Don't worry.

66
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,410
Don't say I took advantage of you.

67
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,290
But I can't break the rules.

68
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:51,040
Since you helped me find the old man,

69
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:51,750
How about this?

70
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,829
I'll give you a chance.

71
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,950
Either take this medicine,

72
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,500
or promise to be my disciple.

73
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,120
Whether you live or die,

74
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,660
you choose.

75
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,000
So?

76
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,410
this little doll

77
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,950
promised us

78
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,870
to test the poison ourselves.

79
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,410
What?

80
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,500
Lunar promised to test the medicine with her body.

81
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,040
That's right.

82
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,250
She said

83
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,500
who owes

84
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,080
who will pay the debt?

85
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,500
What about you?

86
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,040
You can go now.

87
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,620
Are you okay?

88
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,290
Are you okay?

89
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,040
Stop talking.

90
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,620
I'll take you to another doctor.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,750
Kid.

92
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,750
Where are you going?

93
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,450
Please forgive us.

94
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,330
What do you want?

95
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,580
I’ll take it.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,250
Enough, old man.

97
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,790
Don't scare my good disciple

98
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,660
and that silly boy.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,790
Senior.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Has Lunar recovered?

101
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,410
Kid,

102
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,620
Your love

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,410
will be fine.

104
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,580
Senior.

105
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,500
How can you force me

106
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,200
to force me to be your disciple?

107
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,700
What? Are you going back on your word?

108
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,750
Girl.

109
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,330
You can't say that.

110
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,250
We just want to verify

111
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,870
how much

112
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,000
really cares about you,

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,830
Right?

114
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:52,790
Old man.

115
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,159
We...

116
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,250
We are just allies.

117
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,160
ally?

118
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,450
Really?

119
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,330
You're all here.

120
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,750
to give up

121
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,370
for each other.

122
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,120
Yes.

123
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,950
Isn't this Beloved?

124
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
What is it called?

125
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,620
What is it called?

126
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,540
Old lady.

127
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,450
I think you're getting old.

128
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,750
The doll just said

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,950
they were just allies.

130
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,540
You're right.

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,450
Lunar,

132
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,409
what kind of girl do you like?

133
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,000
We can help you find someone.

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,409
Yes, tell us.

135
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:47,409
I won't fall in love with anyone

136
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:49,370
I won't fall in love with anyone.

137
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,580
How long do we have to wait?

138
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,370
Lunar will meet

139
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,700
who can

140
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,500
sacrifice herself

141
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,580
and make her unable to control herself.

142
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,910
and let her live and die together.

143
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,500
Yes.

144
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,080
You must tell us.

145
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,750
Yes, tell us.

146
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,160
I wonder

147
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,700
have you met someone like this?

148
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,410
We have something to do.

149
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,830
We're leaving.

150
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,290
I'm going to get dressed.

151
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,450
How dare you!

152
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,409
I want to see the Crown Prince.

153
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,200
The Crown Prince ordered not to see anyone.

154
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:53,290
How dare you!

155
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,120
I must see the Crown Prince today.

156
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,200
Get out of my way!

157
00:07:58,909 --> 00:07:59,330
Let go!

158
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:00,700
What's all the noise?

159
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,950
It's Chief Secretariat.

160
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,660
If you make such a noise outside,

161
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,540
you'll disturb the Crown Prince.

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,540
The Crown Prince hasn't recovered from his long illness.

163
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,910
I

164
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,080
visited a famous physician outside the palace.

165
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,790
I'm here to treat you.

166
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,620
Move.

167
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,160
Kruchi!

168
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,370
What do you mean?

169
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,500
Lord Jin.

170
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,580
I advise you not to disobey the order.

171
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,660
It's natural for the ministers to see the Crown Prince.

172
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,000
You are just the leader of the Imperial Guards.

173
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,620
who are you to stop me?

174
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,409
I'm just a humble person.

175
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,039
But under the order of the Crown Prince,

176
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,870
anyone who trespasses the Crown Prince's residence will be executed.

177
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,159
How could the Crown Prince give such an order?

178
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,039
It was you.

179
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,250
You faked the order.

180
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:43,870
Chief Secretariat.

181
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,370
If you dare to talk nonsense again,

182
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,000
don't blame me for being rude to you.

183
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,000
You...

184
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,040
Get it together.

185
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,790
Yes.

186
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,580
General, Grand Tutor wants to see you.

187
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,620
Grand Tutor.

188
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,000
Please.

189
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,290
General Leng, how have you been?

190
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,200
Grand Tutor, why are you here?

191
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,000
I remember that you like clear jade the most.

192
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,160
General Leng, would you like to drink with His Highness again?
