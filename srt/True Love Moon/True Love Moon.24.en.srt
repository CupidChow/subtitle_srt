1
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,120
Why are you coughing again?

2
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,370
I asked you to bring a cape.

3
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,200
but you didn't listen.

4
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,370
Don't be so nervous.

5
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,160
I've recovered.

6
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,040
No.

7
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,450
I need an imperial physician

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,500
before I can rest assured.

9
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,040
Okay.

10
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:51,910
I'll listen to you.

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,790
King of Carefree.

12
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,660
Miss Luo.

13
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,080
His Majesty must be waiting for you.

14
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,370
We'll be right there.

15
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,160
No.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,790
The one in the cold palace is not good.

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,160
You mean...

18
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,580
If possible,

19
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,120
please take a look.

20
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,620
I'll go with you.

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,660
Yue, where are you?

22
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,700
Don't run!

23
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:27,660
I'm here.

24
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:29,370
Yue!

25
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,410
Yue, don't run!

26
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,200
Your Highness, I'm here.

27
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,080
I got you!

28
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,330
Yue.

29
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,950
Let's stop playing hide-and-seek.

30
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,289
Can you accompany me to see Father?

31
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,450
Okay.

32
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,910
Your Highness.

33
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,080
What happened?

34
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,410
The imperial physician said he was severely stimulated

35
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,580
he lost his mind.

36
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,370
He only remembers you and the late emperor now.

37
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,080
Where's the handkerchief?

38
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,790
Where's my handkerchief?

39
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,700
Where is my handkerchief?

40
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,950
Where's my handkerchief?

41
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,250
Where is my handkerchief?

42
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,039
Your Highness.

43
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,290
Are you looking for this?

44
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,200
I found it.

45
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,450
Yue gave it to me.

46
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,329
Don't throw it away.

47
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,329
Don't throw it away.

48
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,750
The handkerchief is dirty.

49
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,620
I need to wash up.

50
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,790
Although I'm not greedy enough,

51
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,660
he deserved it.

52
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,250
But he's still a poor man.

53
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,870
His Majesty is waiting.

54
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,410
Let's go.

55
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,540
It's fine, Your Highness II.

56
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,950
Let's wash up later.

57
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,700
We'll take our leave.

58
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,290
Uncle, Luo Mingyue.

59
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:56,829
Wait.

60
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,950
Recently, there's been chaos.

61
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,330
You saved me from the fire.

62
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,290
You two did a great job.

63
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,790
Are you satisfied with my reward?

64
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,370
I appreciate

65
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,750
your kindness.

66
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,870
But I hope Your Majesty

67
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,620
give these rewards

68
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,200
to my generals.

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,950
and restore their posts.

70
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,290
Okay.

71
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,950
What about Luo Mingyue?

72
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,500
I want to rebuild the suspension.

73
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,870
I hope

74
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,700
can become a real supervision organization.

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,370
That's my master's wish.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,450
I agree.

77
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,500
I have another request.

78
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,500
Recently, the border has been frequently invaded by foreigners.

79
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,620
Their barbaric ways

80
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,040
did make the generals suffer a lot.

81
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,540
In a short time,

82
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,750
in a short time.

83
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,790
I'd like to ask you to come here.

84
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,660
May I...

85
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,750
Among the generals,

86
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,040
only I know the situation in the border best.

87
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,700
I should go to fight the enemy

88
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,950
to share your burden.

89
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,750
Thank you, uncle.

90
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,580
I'm in the city

91
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,750
waiting for my uncle's triumphant return.

92
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,540
You must come back safely.

93
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,450
Wait for my news of victory.

94
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,410
With it by my side,

95
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,080
just like you by my side.

96
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,000
Now there are many dangers.

97
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,660
I made you a safe card.

98
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,250
I hope I can protect you.

99
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,620
Stand in the capital and guard the border.

100
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,950
You guard the border and I'll wait for the news of victory.

101
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:29,870
It's been a long time

102
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,080
for a long time.

103
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,450
Greetings, Commander Luo. Greetings, Your Majesty.

104
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,700
News of victory from the frontier.

105
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,290
I'm Yun Tianchen, here to see a doctor.

106
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,660
I thought I would never see you again.
