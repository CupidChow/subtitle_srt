1
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,290
Who are you?

2
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,410
Now that I've become like this,

3
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,870
I can't even hold my sword.

4
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,160
How can we investigate?

5
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,080
Hey, kid!

6
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,370
Good boy.

7
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,120
I've been looking for you.

8
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,789
Since you don't want to be my disciple,

9
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,039
Fine.

10
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,870
As long as you find Cang Jiu for me,

11
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,950
I'll cure the poison in your body.

12
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,830
Cang Jiu, let go of me!

13
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,500
How is that possible?

14
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,539
You're the rarest medicine in my place.

15
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,370
I don't want to

16
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,700
You sneaked out today.

17
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,620
if you sneak out today.

18
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:36,120
Come back with me.

19
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,789
I need to test the medicine with you.

20
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,789
Cang Jiu, let go of me!

21
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,950
Stop struggling.

22
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,870
Come with me.

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,000
Let's go.

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,500
Let go of me!

25
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,700
Let go of me!

26
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,120
Master Cangya!

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,830
Please let him go.

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,789
Young lady.

29
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,000
Do you know me?

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,790
Ghost Doctor Cang Jiu.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,830
Everyone in Jianghu knows it.

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,040
But bullying

33
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,949
a weak kid.

34
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:11,039
It's a disgrace to your reputation.

35
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,870
Young lady,

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,620
You have no idea

37
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,579
This little girl.

38
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,750
Why did you bring me here?

39
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:33,579
Let go of me!

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,250
Then tell me why you killed me.

41
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,250
Why are you here?

42
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,040
Let's go.

43
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,200
Come on.

44
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,290
I'm here to hand in the task in advance.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I found Cang Jiu.

46
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,750
Give me the antidote first.

47
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,120
and I'll tell you.

48
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,329
Tell me first.

49
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,329
Otherwise, how would I know if it's true?

50
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,450
He is my disciple

51
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,000
in Xiangyun Town.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,290
Have you made up your mind?

53
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,000
Thank you for your love.

54
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,200
I have a master.

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,660
I can't be her disciple anymore.

56
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,950
You just leave like this?

57
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,579
Aren't you afraid that after leaving this door,

58
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,829
after leaving this door?

59
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,750
What do you mean?

60
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,040
The medicine just now...

61
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,950
Don't be nervous.

62
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,290
The poison in your body has been detoxified.

63
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,290
Not you.

64
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,700
It's the boy beside you.

65
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,579
I think he's poisoned.

66
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:41,200
It must be Cang Jiu's masterpiece.

67
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:42,750
You can detoxify me?

68
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:44,450
Of course.

69
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,700
I'm the only one who can detoxify him.

70
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,329
Stop!

71
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,750
You two kids.

72
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,079
Where are you going?

73
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,000
Old man,

74
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,790
I've been chasing you for ten years.

75
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,370
You finally show up.

76
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,750
Go!

77
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,700
Honey.

78
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,250
You...

79
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,500
If you leave,

80
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,870
just wait to collect his body.

81
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,080
What poison did he get?

82
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,040
As long as you promise to be my disciple,

83
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,580
I promise you to help him.

84
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,120
Young lady.

85
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,370
Don't listen to her.

86
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,829
She's not capable.

87
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,620
I'm not capable, right?

88
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,540
Fine.

89
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,370
Eat it.

90
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,750
I can detoxify you after taking your poison.

91
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,790
Granny.

92
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,580
You ruined my plan.

93
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,540
I...

94
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,290
It's you.

95
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,290
You old hag.

96
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,909
You always ruin my plan.

97
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,159
Stop calling me old.

98
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,830
How dare you

99
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,830
You pretended to be dead.

100
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,750
to frame me

101
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,330
for murdering Prince.

102
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,330
I have dozens of people

103
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,370
were all killed except me.

104
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,830
You really know how to accuse me first.

105
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,290
You chased me first

106
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,700
and forced me into a cliff.

107
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,290
Now you're questioning me.

108
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,409
We're just following orders.

109
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,450
By order?

110
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,500
Who ordered you to

111
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,250
to kill me?

112
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,500
Gao Hanji

113
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,120
and listen to His Majesty.

114
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,500
That day,

115
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,700
the Crown Prince's trusted subordinate Mo Ji

116
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,000
He came with an imperial decree.

117
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,830
After I returned to report,

118
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,910
I was besieged by the Imperial Guards.

119
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,120
They claimed that Gao Xuan Department murdered His Highness.

120
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,410
and ordered to kill him without mercy.

121
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,000
It's Mo Qi again.

122
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,790
When he came to my camp,

123
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,290
saying the late emperor was in critical condition.

124
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,120
The Crown Prince asked me for help.

125
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,580
He asked me to bring troops back to protect His Majesty.

126
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,200
At the city gate,

127
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,910
at the gate of the city.

128
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,040
But the Imperial Guards

129
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,290
on you.

130
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,159
You may not believe me.

131
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,040
At first, I doubted you

132
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,500
I did suspect you.

133
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,620
Master.

134
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,750
Prince Xiaoyao has guarded the border for many years.

135
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,040
and has been favored by the people.

136
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,830
Why did you suddenly rebel?

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,750
Have you forgotten what I told you?

138
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,200
I, Gao Hanji, obey the command of the court.

139
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,580
I have no right to intervene.

140
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,410
Just follow orders.

141
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,500
But we can't disobey His Majesty's order.

142
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,290
We're just following orders.

143
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,080
Even if someone is behind this,

144
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,750
you can’t deny

145
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,370
my trusted generals

146
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,290
were killed by you.

147
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,750
Wait.

148
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,450
This might help you.

149
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,620
He's the only one

150
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,080
that day.

151
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,790
We've searched everywhere.

152
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,450
but we didn’t find Baili Chuan.

153
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,830
Have you been to his place?

154
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,750
Why did he go back to his house?

155
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,250
Isn't that

156
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,620
the most dangerous place

157
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,830
and the easiest place to ignore.

158
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,200
It should be here.

159
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,700
Baili Chuan hasn’t come back.

160
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,830
Where would he be?

161
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,450
Baili Chuan was lucky to escape.

162
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,950
the Imperial Guards will hunt him down.

163
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,290
Come back.

164
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,950
he'll be caught.

165
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,790
Unless

166
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,160
in his house.

167
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,160
But we've searched everywhere.

168
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,250
Wait.

169
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,040
Are you Baili Chuan?

170
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,910
Who are they?

171
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,330
Search carefully.

172
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,200
Yes.

173
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,540
Sir, no.

174
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,000
No.
