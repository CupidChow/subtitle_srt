1
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,250
In the 61st year of Tianqing,

2
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,910
Emperor, Yun Tianqing is in critical condition.

3
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,660
The situation in the court is turbulent.

4
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,910
Some crooks took the chance to rebel.

5
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,370
The Crown Prince secretly ordered his trusted subordinates

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,410
to report to the border barracks.

7
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,450
Your Highness, please

8
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,370
to protect His Majesty.

9
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,370
The King of Prowess is here.

10
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,500
Open the city gate!

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,080
Open the city gate!

12
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:16,789
We're trapped.

13
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:17,410
Your Highness, run!

14
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,250
Prince of Xiao Yao returned to the capital without permission.

15
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,330
and attempted to rebel.

16
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,660
Gao Xuan Si was ordered to arrest him.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,660
Kill them all!

18
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:31,250
Where is the cavalry? Protect His Highness!

19
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,120
Your Highness, go!

20
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,330
Run, Your Highness!

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,000
Go!

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,950
No, Ran Li.

23
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,370
You can’t escape.

24
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,330
I've been a carefree king all my life.

25
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,250
but I ended up being framed for treason.

26
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:20,870
Ridiculous.

27
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,410
Go back and report.

28
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:57,040
Commander.

29
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,540
Mission completed.

30
00:02:58,829 --> 00:02:59,660
King of Carefree

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,870
fell off the cliff and died.

32
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,330
You may leave.

33
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,620
Yes.

34
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,750
Master.

35
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,620
I saw you

36
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,040
you've been working until late at night.

37
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,620
I made a bowl of ginseng soup for you.

38
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,620
Thank you.

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Put it down.

40
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,540
Poor the century-old ginseng.

41
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,580
If you keep it cold,

42
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,620
it'll be a waste.

43
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,500
Si Han.

44
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,250
Give it to me.

45
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,620
If I don't drink it while it's hot,

46
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,250
I guess

47
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,370
you won't make soup for me anymore.

48
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,540
You know me well.

49
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,580
You're good.

50
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,409
Kruchi!

51
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,200
How dare you barge into the Gaoshang Department!

52
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,040
The imperial edict.

53
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,620
Gao Xuan Si disrespected his superior.

54
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,790
and murdered the King of Xiaoyao.

55
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,830
kill him.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,950
You're slandering me!

57
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,250
We're following the order.

58
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,000
Someone is obviously framing us.

59
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,000
You talk too much.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,660
Kill them!

61
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,290
Master!

62
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,410
Master!

63
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:28,910
Go!

64
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,000
Master.

65
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,159
It's an order from above.

66
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,250
Arrest Luo Mingyue alive.

67
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes.

68
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,410
Your Highness.

69
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,790
Luo Mingyue ran away.

70
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,000
Useless!

71
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,870
Your Highness.

72
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,870
Give me another chance.

73
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,330
I will...

74
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:13,700
Get lost!

75
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,040
Your Highness.

76
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,330
I let you down.

77
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,750
In the end,

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,330
Luo Mingyue escaped.

79
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,950
Today,

80
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,500
Thank you.

81
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,080
Come on. Be careful.

82
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,159
You've been sleeping for two days.

83
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,330
You're finally awake.

84
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,750
Thank you for saving my life.

85
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,830
No problem.

86
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,250
I live on saving people.

87
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,370
Don't be so polite.

88
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,200
Take the medicine.
