1
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,870
I won't accept any reward without contributions.

2
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,290
Tell me.

3
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,580
What's the matter?

4
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,620
Senior, we've known each other for a long time.

5
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,790
You promised to teach me how to make drugs.

6
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,700
How can you break your promise?

7
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,910
Yes.

8
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,700
I gave you

9
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,410
to you?

10
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,700
No way.

11
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,250
Tell me, what do you want to learn?

12
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,410
As long as I can,

13
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,289
I'll teach you everything.

14
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,950
You can't go back on your word.

15
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,200
A man must keep his word.

16
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,289
Rong...

17
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,370
Ta-da! Ta-da!

18
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,450
Hey.

19
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:27,370
This won't do.

20
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,039
You were a man just now.

21
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,700
Why did you change so quickly?

22
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,330
It's not that I don't teach you.

23
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,160
My sect has rules that

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,620
we can only pass the disguise to our descendants.

25
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,370
Senior.

26
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,160
please help us

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,620
please help us.

28
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,289
Everything else is fine.

29
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,700
But this...

30
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:47,950
No.

31
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,000
I know that disguising skills are not passed down to outsiders.

32
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:52,660
But you and my master are old.

33
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,750
It would be a pity

34
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,539
it would be a pity.

35
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,039
Indeed.

36
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,580
You two kids.

37
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,450
don't lie to me.

38
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,330
I've heard that Ghost Doctor has always been obedient.

39
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,000
but he helped the people once.

40
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:11,620
Now, Yun is in danger.

41
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,000
Only by saving the Crown Prince...

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,410
can we turn the situation around.

43
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,450
If you pass this disguise

44
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,450
to Prince Xiaoyao,

45
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,410
Saving the Crown Prince

46
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:19,410
is a great merit...

47
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,870
for Yun.

48
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,540
By then, the name of Ghost Doctor

49
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,000
will be remembered forever.

50
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,910
It's useless for him to say anything.

51
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,579
The rules of our sect

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,079
can't be broken.

53
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,750
But

54
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,579
if you learn it secretly,

55
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,250
I have no choice.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,540
Take care, sir.

57
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,700
Sir.

58
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,250
Is there any room available?

59
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,370
What are you doing in the capital?

60
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,080
My husband is suffering from fatigue.

61
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,330
We came to the capital to look for a doctor.

62
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,790
The doctors in the south are very skilled.

63
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,290
You can go to him.

64
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,660
The east room on the second floor.

65
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,290
Waiter.

66
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,910
Take the guest upstairs.

67
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,829
Okay.

68
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,250
Thank you.

69
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,500
This way, please.

70
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,120
Sir, your room is here.

71
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,620
Sir, let me know if you need anything.

72
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,870
Please move the embroidered ball away.

73
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,750
When my wife touches the hydrangea,

74
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,579
her skin will swell and feel uncomfortable.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Are you unhappy?

76
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,790
embroidered ball flower?

77
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,040
No.

78
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,750
My skin will swell

79
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,790
my skin will swell and feel uncomfortable.

80
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,579
Sir, I'll put it in the corridor.

81
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,000
He cares so much about me.

82
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
I'll go check on him.

83
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,290
No.

84
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,370
I'm going with you.

85
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,750
You stay here.

86
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,250
If anything happens,

87
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,450
call me like a cat.

88
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,659
Okay.

89
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,120
Stop!

90
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:51,450
Get tested.

91
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,500
Yes.

92
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,250
It's me.

93
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,660
Does it hurt?

94
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,120
I'm fine.

95
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,290
How are things going over there?

96
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,580
There is still

97
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,080
in the Crown Prince's mansion.

98
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,080
Looks like we need to observe for two more days.

99
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,500
It's getting late.

100
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,950
Go to sleep.

101
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,120
I'm not sleepy.

102
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,450
Go to sleep.

103
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:46,620
It's a special situation today.

104
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,080
Your Highness.

105
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,909
There's no need to be too polite.

106
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:45,200
Your Highness, aren't you cold?

107
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,409
No.

108
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,830
I'm not cold either.

109
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,910
Go to sleep.

110
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,370
Commander Ku.

111
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,910
You’re early today.

112
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,910
I have other work to do.

113
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,080
so I came early today.

114
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,410
How is the Crown Prince?

115
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,330
I only had a bowl of porridge last night.

116
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,910
But every day,

117
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,700
every day.

118
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,040
The elixir.

119
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,450
I'll go in and check on the Crown Prince.

120
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,080
Open the door.

121
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,450
Your Highness.

122
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,700
You haven't seen me for days.

123
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,580
You don't know me anymore.
