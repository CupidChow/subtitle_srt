1
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,660
Luo Mingyue.

2
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,660
I'll give you one last chance.

3
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,120
Do you like me or not?

4
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,540
Tell me you like me.

5
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,250
Tell me.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,500
Do you feel dizzy?

7
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,660
What did you do to me?

8
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,200
Despicable! Shameless!

9
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,120
What are you doing?

10
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,540
The Crown Prince is here.

11
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,700
Let's see who dares to make trouble.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,660
As long as you put down your weapons,

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,750
the Crown Prince won't pursue this matter anymore.

14
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,450
Uncle.

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,830
You've suffered.

16
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,080
Take me to Luo Mingyue.

17
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,910
Take me to Luo Mingyue.

18
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:35,620
Hurry up.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,700
Untie the rope.

20
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,120
Si Han.

21
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,330
Bad news, Prince Regent.

22
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,580
The Crown Prince and his men saved Yun Tianchen.

23
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,580
What?

24
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,790
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:37,950
Why are you so stupid?

27
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,200
I didn't expect

28
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,079
you would save Yun Tianchen.

29
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,200
Shangzhou.

30
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,790
Surrender.

31
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,950
You want to break into the palace with these people?

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,290
Should I praise you for being brave

33
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,620
Or should I say you're too proud?

34
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,830
Since I dare to come today,

35
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,950
I'm ready to die.

36
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,370
Wake up.

37
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,329
Stop making mistakes.

38
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,620
The winner has always been the loser.

39
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,290
At this point,

40
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,579
I should be the one to say right and wrong.

41
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,579
Who are you to lecture me?

42
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,120
Guards!

43
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:28,829
Take him down.

44
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,620
Wait.

45
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,620
What else do you want to say?

46
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,250
Do you think

47
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,870
you can sit on the throne if you kill me?

48
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,870
Before I came,

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,870
I have told the ministers

50
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,370
to the ministers.

51
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,370
you are not my father's son.

52
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,120
If you take the throne,

53
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,700
you'll be a rebel and usurp the throne.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,790
will be despised by the world.

55
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,950
What background?

56
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:58,700
What are you talking about?

57
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,830
Father, you took over Yu State

58
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,620
and took the Crown Princess of Yu as his concubine.

59
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,540
At that time,

60
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,410
was in her belly.

61
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,620
So,

62
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,950
you are not a prince of Yun.

63
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,950
but a prince of Yu.

64
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,660
Don't scare me.

65
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,830
Everyone,

66
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,950
If I'm not a prince,

67
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,910
why would His Majesty

68
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,450
such a valuable Tiger Tally to me?

69
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,909
He colluded with the minister, Prince Xiaoyao,

70
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,580
and slandered me.

71
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,790
Don't listen to his lies.

72
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,540
Take him down.

73
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,250
The real tiger tally is here.

74
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,159
His is fake.

75
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,200
Impossible.

76
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,950
Yours is fake.

77
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,040
General Zhang.

78
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,580
You've been in charge of the 12 Guards for years.

79
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,909
You'll know if the Tiger Tally is real.

80
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,370
Then please tell everyone

81
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,700
who is faking it.

82
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,700
Since the establishment of Yun,

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,040
all the soldiers have listened to the order with the Tiger Tally.

84
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,370
In this way,

85
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,250
As you command, Your Majesty.

86
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:33,950
Yes, Your Highness.

87
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,000
You are rebelling!

88
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,620
Regent.

89
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,409
Your Tiger Tally is fake.

90
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,500
I can't obey the order.

91
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,700
Impossible!

92
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,830
Kruchi!

93
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,659
You...

94
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,409
General Zhang.

95
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,159
The second prince, Yun Shang Zhou, forged the Tiger Tally,

96
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,250
is suspected of usurping the throne.

97
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,080
Take him down.

98
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:02,830
Yes.

99
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,450
Tianchen.

100
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,659
It's okay.

101
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,950
I thought I would never see you again.

102
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,290
I ascended the throne.

103
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,200
to show off to me.

104
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,950
I remember when I was little,

105
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,000
whenever Father punished me,

106
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
you would bring a pot of good wine to comfort me.

107
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,080
Back then, I had different philosophy of governing the country.

108
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:53,080
He always beat and scolded me.

109
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,120
I really envied you back then.

110
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,620
Because father looked at you

111
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,040
in his eyes.

112
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,290
It's just a hypocrite.

113
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,250
What he really cares about

114
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,200
is you.

115
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,450
Even the throne

116
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,450
to you.

117
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,500
You're wrong.

118
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,290
He wants you to pursue freedom,

119
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,160
not because of the royal power.

120
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,250
because of the royal power.

121
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,910
because he promised your mother

122
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,290
Do you think

123
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,620
I'll believe you.

124
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,250
Whatever.

125
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,039
By the way,

126
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,250
before Father passed away,

127
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,200
he told me

128
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,620
to take good care of you.
