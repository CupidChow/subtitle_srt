1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,410
As long as you listen to my master,

2
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,500
I promise you'll have a good life in the future.

3
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,330
Your master is abducting me.

4
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,290
Even the government can't control our master.

5
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,620
What else can you do?

6
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,120
Go! Go!

7
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,200
Come with me.

8
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,540
Let go!

9
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,330
Stop!

10
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,120
Help!

11
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,950
Who are you?

12
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,750
My master is the Minister of Revenue.

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:53,950
Let go of me!

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,830
Let go! Let go! Let go!

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,120
Let go of me!

16
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,290
Let's go.

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,040
Behave yourself.

18
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,750
Let's go.

19
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:18,000
You've been recognized by the regent.

20
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:19,330
Now,

21
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,870
you can enter the first number of Heiyi Pavilion.

22
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:23,950
Thank you, Master Lin.

23
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,250
There's a secret compartment in the north direction of this room.

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,789
Let's find a chance to check it.

25
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,370
Okay.

26
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,660
Lunar.

27
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,000
Si Han's men were all killed.

28
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,700
I thought they were sent back to their hometown.

29
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,040
If Si Han hadn't fallen in love with Yun Shang Zhou,

30
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,079
she wouldn't have lived to this day.

31
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,700
They really found

32
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,910
the same Crown Prince.

33
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,750
In order to eliminate dissidents,

34
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,290
to eliminate dissidents.

35
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,700
My lord.

36
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,200
The goods have been safely delivered to Lushan.

37
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,290
Good.

38
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,620
The seller contacted me a few days ago

39
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,370
to buy some more advanced goods.

40
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,540
By then,

41
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,410
ask the people of the number One to go.

42
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,410
But...

43
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,580
they are still too new.

44
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,500
I'm afraid.

45
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,000
How would I know if I don't try?

46
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,620
This is the delivery address.

47
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:22,620
By the way,

48
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,660
how is Liu Yong's family?

49
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,750
They...

50
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,040
cried every night.

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,790
After Grand Mentor Xie is convicted,

52
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
these people

53
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,040
all of them.

54
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,450
Yes, sir.

55
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,000
Regent.

56
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,000
What is it?

57
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,700
The eastern shore and the east shore have a levee.

58
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,620
flooded 850,000 mu of land.

59
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,370
More than 150,000 injured people

60
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,660
895 of them died.

61
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,290
Why?

62
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,790
Didn’t you transfer 900,000 water supply money?

63
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,910
We only received 20,000 taels of relief in the east.

64
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,700
What?

65
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,250
Where is the Minister of Revenue?

66
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,120
He's not feeling well.

67
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,500
He took a long leave and went back to his hometown.

68
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,790
Cheng Shang.

69
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

70
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,660
Investigate it thoroughly.

71
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

72
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,540
What made the Regent so angry?

73
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,870
It must be Mo Ji.

74
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,370
It must be him.

75
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,120
He was the one who recommended me to be the Minister of Revenue.

76
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,870
Regent.

77
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,000
Regent.

78
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,159
This is bad.

79
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,250
What's the big deal?

80
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,909
Cheng Shang found out that the treasury is deficit.

81
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,409
Now, less than 500,000 taels.

82
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,250
What?

83
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,159
Regent.

84
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,120
Si Han.

85
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,620
will investigate this for you.

86
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,410
You are

87
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,830
the only person I can trust.

88
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,910
Find the evidence.

89
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,660
Rest assured, Your Highness.

90
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,160
I will complete the task.

91
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,330
Okay.

92
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,750
Where did you transfer the treasury?

93
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,700
I'll give you one last chance.

94
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,620
Will you tell me or not?

95
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,410
Please.

96
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,870
Please let my father go.

97
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,830
Please.

98
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,830
Mr. Mo took the money.

99
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,909
What is he doing with this money?

100
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,540
This time,

101
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,040
you will pick up the goods.

102
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes.

103
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,290
How is it?

104
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,409
Beifeng asked me

105
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,659
to escort him.

106
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,080
I’ll talk to North Feng.

107
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,250
with you.

108
00:05:58,909 --> 00:05:59,540
No.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
He'll be suspicious.

110
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,870
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

111
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,700
I can't let you go alone.

112
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,750
Don't worry.

113
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,540
I'll take care of myself.

114
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,410
Don't forget

115
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,200
I'm Luo Mingyue from Gaoshang Department.

116
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,540
Don't act on your own.

117
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,830
I don't want you to get hurt again.

118
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,410
Every time I see a new wound on you,

119
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,830
my heart feels like being slashed.

120
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,790
Okay.

121
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,000
I know.

122
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,500
Don't worry.

123
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,120
I trust you so much.

124
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,659
How dare you steal the treasury from me?

125
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,700
behind my back?

126
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,080
for?

127
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,450
I'll give you a chance to explain.

128
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,540
You're from the Rain State.

129
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,200
Say it again.

130
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,000
My mother is from Yu State.

131
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,830
I'm not.

132
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,120
Have you ever thought about restoring the country for Yu?

133
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,750
Restore the country?

134
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,830
Why should I restore the country for the rain?

135
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,540
I'm already in this position.

136
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,200
What's there to worry about?

137
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,750
So you are...

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,620
Don't think too much, Your Highness.

139
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,410
I did all this

140
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,290
for you.

141
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,700
For me?

142
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,330
you embezzled the treasury.

143
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,750
I couldn't manage the flood well

144
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,080
during the regent.

145
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,450
The people are mourning.

146
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,120
You said it was for me.

147
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,750
You'll understand one day.

148
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,040
Mo Qi.

149
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,950
Since you were my mother's colleague,

150
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,540
you took care of me.

151
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,200
I won't convict you.

152
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,040
Return the money

153
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,909
to the treasury.

154
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,409
Forget about it.

155
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,120
Okay.

156
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,200
From now on,

157
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,660
you are no longer my teacher.

158
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,290
Leave the badge of Heiyi Pavilion.

159
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,500
Leave.

160
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,830
You'll regret it.

161
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,539
Bro.

162
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,200
I'm new here.

163
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,080
Hurry up.

164
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,040
Coming.

165
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,250
Why did they put the goods in Baili Chuan's house?

166
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,870
I must find out

167
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,790
who is making the goods.

168
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,750
Why isn't anyone here?

169
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,540
Leave it.

170
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,160
Just leave it.

171
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:45,870
I'm not a bad person.

172
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,250
I'll take you out.

173
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,160
Let me untie you first.

174
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:00,580
You go first.

175
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,580
I have other arrangements.

176
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,000
Okay, be careful.

177
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,040
Let's go.

178
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,120
Mo Qi.

179
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,500
He's not dead.
