1
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,660
Your Highness.

2
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,000
You haven't seen me for days.

3
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,830
You don't know me anymore.

4
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,120
Little uncle.

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,950
Uncle.

6
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,660
It's really you.

7
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,040
Didn't you die by the hands of Gao Hanji?

8
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,080
How?

9
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,330
It's a long story.

10
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,790
Later,

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,790
later.

12
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,450
Okay.

13
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,410
I heard from the Grand Tutor that...

14
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,620
Yun Shang Zhou lied that you were seriously ill.

15
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,120
and locked you up.

16
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:16,950
That's right.

17
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:19,250
Since

18
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,830
being confined in Yun Shang zhou,

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,830
my body...

20
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,620
is getting worse.

21
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,120
Your Highness.

22
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,700
What is this?

23
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:36,080
This is the medicine for my cold.

24
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,750
This is poison.

25
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,870
What?

26
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't know what poison it is,

27
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,500
but one thing is for sure

28
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,950
this is chronic poison.

29
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,700
Yun Shang Zhou...

30
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,289
is so despicable.

31
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,500
This is Empty Pure Pill.

32
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,950
It can cure all poisons.

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,290
What was it?

34
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,120
Why did you urge me to enter the city?

35
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,620
An urgent report from 800 miles away.

36
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,250
A flood broke out in the east.

37
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,870
The western bandits are rampant.

38
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,579
has caused great trouble to the people's lives.

39
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,829
No matter how much manpower and resources it takes,

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,250
make sure the people are safe.

41
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,040
Your Highness.

42
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,750
I have something

43
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,620
if I should tell you.

44
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,750
Go ahead.

45
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,950
Although the rain in Yun is pouring,

46
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,120
the dam has been reinforced every year.

47
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,250
There has never been a flood in the past years.

48
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,579
Why did the dam suddenly collapse?

49
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,079
Besides, Yun has always been safe.

50
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,329
Why would the bandits suddenly be rampant?

51
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,200
Besides, all this

52
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,540
happened when His Majesty was in critical condition.

53
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:52,700
I always feel

54
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,000
something is wrong.

55
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,040
Your Highness.

56
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,040
What Chief Secretariat said makes sense.

57
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,750
His Majesty ordered you to supervise the state.

58
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,410
But now there are many troubles.

59
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,950
What if someone is using us?

60
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,450
the bandits and flood

61
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,120
Thank you.

62
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,620
It's getting late.

63
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,540
Please rest early.

64
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,250
Your Highness.

65
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,370
Why don’t you invite Prince Xiao Yao back to the capital?

66
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,579
and help you with the situation?

67
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:40,410
Uncle, I promised my father

68
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,870
I promised my father

69
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,329
not to go back to the capital

70
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,790
and stop meddling with court affairs.

71
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,540
But today is different.

72
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,790
The situation is tense now.

73
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,290
Your Highness and Prince Xiao Yao are united.

74
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:51,290
How about

75
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,500
to invite His Majesty back

76
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,870
to ask His Highness to return to the capital.

77
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,040
Let His Highness

78
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,790
for you.

79
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,829
That makes sense.

80
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,620
But it's still inappropriate.

81
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,870
What if others find out?

82
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,160
Don't worry, Your Highness.

83
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,660
I can handle this.

84
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,330
I won't let anyone know.

85
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,450
Besides,

86
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,620
what you said makes sense.

87
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,079
Now the flood bandits

88
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,700
If there's a villain behind this,

89
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,579
if we don't solve it as soon as possible,

90
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,950
there might be future troubles.

91
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,750
The most urgent thing now

92
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,410
is to do so.

93
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,750
Your Highness, please write a letter

94
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,370
and give me

95
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,290
as a token.

96
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,500
I've been out of the city for days.

97
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,580
Since that incident,

98
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,409
Mo Qiao never came back.

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,620
Now that Mo Qiao has disappeared,

100
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,120
and disappeared.

101
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,000
Your Highness.

102
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,870
How long has it been since you came out?

103
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,250
Look, the people

104
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,040
under your supervision,

105
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,159
with your supervision.

106
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,750
and peaceful.

107
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,950
With your mouth,

108
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,250
is the best talker.

109
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

110
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,700
Why did Kruchi

111
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,040
came an hour earlier.

112
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,700
Is the carriage...

113
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,000
Yun Shang Zhou?

114
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,870
My lord.

115
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,620
My lord.

116
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,290
How dare you!

117
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,250
How dare you stop the sedan!

118
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,120
Guards!

119
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,000
Take him away.

120
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:02,950
Wait.

121
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,580
Let her finish.

122
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,620
My lord.

123
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,330
My husband and I went up the mountain to look for herbs.

124
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,870
I didn't expect to meet a thief.

125
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,330
They kidnapped my husband and tried to invade me.

126
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,330
I finally escaped.

127
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,660
My Lord.

128
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,040
You must help me.

129
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,790
Why don't you report it to the government?

130
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:34,950
I met you

131
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,500
I met you.

132
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,290
I thought

133
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:39,540
the one sitting in this sedan must be an official.

134
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,620
Miss, you have good taste.

135
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,750
These eyes

136
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,870
look so similar to the moon.

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,950
Raise your head.

138
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,000
Lunar.

139
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,330
Is that you?

140
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,450
Why did he recognize me

141
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,950
How could he recognize me?

142
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,290
Your Highness.

143
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,080
I think

144
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:07,910
this girl

145
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,700
is not Miss Lunar.

146
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,040
Lunar.

147
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,450
Your Highness.

148
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,040
Slow down.

149
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,750
Lunar.

150
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,450
Si Han.

151
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,580
How dare you lie to me!

152
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,909
Why

153
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,830
Why?

154
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,870
Shut your mouth.

155
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,370
Don't ask anything you shouldn't.

156
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,909
What happened today

157
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,200
is too strange.

158
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,200
Could it be...

159
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Commander.

160
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,200
Commander.

161
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,040
Did you forget something?

162
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,290
I'll get it for you.

163
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,080
What did you say?

164
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,250
I'll get it for you.

165
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,000
The last line.

166
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,700
Did you forget something?

167
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,620
Someone came to the Crown Prince's residence.

168
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,290
Didn't you just leave?

169
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,000
Are you sure it was me?

170
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,039
Yes.

171
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,539
Looks like someone used the disguise spell.

172
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,000
to impersonate me.

173
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,289
From now on,

174
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,409
Only those with this token

175
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,620
can enter.

176
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,370
Master Lin.

177
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,160
The higher-ups said

178
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,000
to meet you at the usual place.
