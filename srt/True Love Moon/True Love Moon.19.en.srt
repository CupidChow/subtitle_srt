1
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,370
Mo Qi!

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,910
He's not dead.

3
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,370
Then just stay here.

4
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,620
I'll ask Liu Yong to pick you up.

5
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,000
Bye.

6
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,160
Wake up.

7
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,200
Wake up!

8
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,450
Wake up!

9
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,160
What's wrong with me?

10
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,330
Find out

11
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,910
who drugged him.

12
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,579
Master Lin.

13
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,500
It's here.

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,620
It's here.

15
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:20,079
Where is Ye Xuan?

16
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,660
She said you had assigned other tasks.

17
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,579
What?

18
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,329
I need to go to the palace to do some work.

19
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,040
Where did you separate?

20
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,329
On the way back from the delivery.

21
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,200
Luo Mingyue.

22
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,410
Long time no see.

23
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,330
Lunar.

24
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,950
You're finally here.

25
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,410
Do you know how hard

26
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,870
waiting for you?

27
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:23,620
In that case,

28
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,790
the Regent,

29
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,950
why don't you appoint Mingyue as the empress?

30
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,079
Tomorrow, I will...

31
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,200
to all the officials tomorrow.

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,829
All the people in the universe...

33
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,700
After conferring you the title of Yun,

34
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,290
I will be exempted from the title of Yun for three years.

35
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,950
and amnesty.

36
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,500
to celebrate with heaven.

37
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,540
Are you serious?

38
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,500
If you lie,

39
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,079
I'm willing to be haunted by thousands of snakes.

40
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,750
The pain of the heart-eating insects.

41
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,040
You hurt me.

42
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,829
Yun Shang Zhou.

43
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,450
Do you know who you are talking to?

44
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,290
Without my order,

45
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,330
Who allowed you to barge in?

46
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,750
I have no right.

47
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,370
That kid must be qualified.

48
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,040
What did you say?

49
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,410
Now,

50
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,040
I'm pregnant.

51
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,200
What do you want to do with me and my child?

52
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,330
Place?

53
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,160
I've done so much for you.

54
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,410
and everything for you.

55
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,700
Have you never thought

56
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,700
give me a status?

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,200
It's your greatest honor

58
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,830
is the greatest honor in your life.

59
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,659
What are you dreaming about?

60
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
Yun Shang zhou.

61
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,870
I didn't expect that...

62
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,620
you would be such a heartless person.

63
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:48,580
I am blind.

64
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:49,500
Regent.

65
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,370
Regent.

66
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,700
Lord Mo sent a message.

67
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,830
that Luo Mingyue is in his hands now.

68
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,659
If you want her to be safe...

69
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,159
What did you say?

70
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,830
That old man kidnapped Lunar.

71
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,830
He said

72
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,500
if you want Luo Mingyue to be safe,

73
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,700
please go to Lushan

74
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,620
to see him in Lushan.

75
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,950
Where are you going?

76
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,790
For Luo Mingyue,

77
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,870
for Luo Mingyue?

78
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,120
My baby.

79
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,120
My baby! My baby!

80
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,870
Yun Shang Zhou.

81
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,159
You betrayed me first.

82
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,330
Now you killed my son.

83
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,330
I'm going to kill you!

84
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:49,500
I'll kill you!

85
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,950
Where did you hide Luo Mingyue?

86
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,370
I told you

87
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,080
If you dare touch Lunar,

88
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,160
I won't let you off.

89
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,870
She came to me herself this time.

90
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,700
I order you

91
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,500
Let her go now.

92
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,200
You let her go so easily?

93
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,660
Why bother to come here?

94
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,540
What are you doing?

95
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,540
Promise me.

96
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,870
I'll let her go

97
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,450
I'll let her go.

98
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,040
Restore the country?

99
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,250
You're smart after all.

100
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,000
How could you say such absurd words?

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,200
I have no choice.

102
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,830
Luo Mingyue's death

103
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,790
for Luo Mingyue's death.

104
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,250
Mo Qi.

105
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,290
If you dare to hurt Mingyue,

106
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,040
I'll kill you first.

107
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,370
The regent wants to kill his teacher.

108
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,790
to kill his teacher.

109
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:50,040
It's as easy as killing an ant.

110
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,700
But what if

111
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,870
your biological father?

112
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,659
Nonsense!

113
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,159
What do you mean?

114
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,370
In the 13th year of the Rain Kingdom,

115
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,790
Yun started a war.

116
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,370
The general of Yu State guarded Yu City for seven days and nights.

117
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,700
In the end, he will be doomed.

118
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,500
The King's relatives! The King's family!

119
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,870
[A hanging hanging]

120
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,830
The prisoner who was captured.

121
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,000
What are you trying to say?

122
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,330
I...

123
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,160
the Crown Prince of Yu.

124
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,950
Yun Tianqing.

125
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,080
saw my beloved consort was beautiful,

126
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,000
I forced her to be his concubine.

127
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,700
And I...

128
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,870
was taken to Yun as a hostage.

129
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,330
Later, my beloved consort...

130
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,370
gave birth to a boy.

131
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:50,950
Impossible.

132
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,370
Impossible.

133
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,330
Yun Tianqing

134
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,620
He didn’t expect

135
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,870
that his Second Prince

136
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,370
is not his biological son.

137
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,160
He had been pregnant for a month

138
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,540
before he seized my wife.

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,950
Stop talking nonsense.

140
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,120
The blood

141
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,080
is the royal bloodline of Yun.

142
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,160
How dare you slander me?

143
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,660
I will kill you.

144
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,330
Kill me.

145
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,039
If killing your father...

146
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,659
be the king of Yun without worries,

147
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,039
I'm willing to die under your sword.

148
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,580
Unfortunately,

149
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,580
I can't make up for

150
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,620
I can't make up for it.

151
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,250
How?

152
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,580
How?

153
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,080
You must have lied to me.

154
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,450
We'll know

155
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,700
if it's true or not.
