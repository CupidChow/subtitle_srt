1
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,000
Here we are.

2
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,500
It's here.

3
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,830
When does

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,870
start?

5
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,620
We have to wait for the arrangement.

6
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,450
Okay.

7
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:46,330
Go in.

8
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,700
Is this a cohabitation between men and women?

9
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,120
There's no difference between men and women in Heiyi Pavilion.

10
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,450
We're brothers from now on.

11
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,370
We'll get used to living together.

12
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,580
You sleep on the side.

13
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,450
I'll sleep in the middle.

14
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:12,200
Let this girl sleep on my side.

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,160
Just kidding.

16
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,620
So pretty.

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,160
The regent is here.

18
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,910
My subordinates

19
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,120
haven't heard from them for a long time.

20
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:40,250
You've left Heiyi Pavilion.

21
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,370
Don't think too much.

22
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,539
But they are brothers

23
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,120
with me.

24
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,370
I'm leaving. I have to give them an explanation.

25
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,539
No need.

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,789
I've arranged everything for you.

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,870
Can I meet them?

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,870
You don't trust me?

29
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,200
That's not what I meant.

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,750
Si Han.

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,620
Don't push your luck just because I like you.

32
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,620
You're already in the palace.

33
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,870
Forget about the past.

34
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,329
It's weird.

35
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,829
I have to look into it.

36
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,160
Sir.

37
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,040
We have summoned all the people.

38
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,870
Now we are waiting for the assignment

39
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,910
to assess them.

40
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,790
Si Han.

41
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,370
Kill him.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,790
Yes.

43
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,870
Someone's here.

44
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,250
Why does he look so familiar?

45
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,160
Where did he go?

46
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,450
I couldn't sleep at night.

47
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,080
I'm going out for a walk.

48
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,290
Liar.

49
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,790
I told you to stay out of the affairs of Heiyi Pavilion.

50
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,950
Why didn't you listen to me?

51
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,409
I founded

52
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,290
was built by me.

53
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,080
I still have feelings.

54
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,080
I can make Heiyi Pavilion exist

55
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,290
and make it disappear.

56
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,830
Just like the Gao Hanichi back then,

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,620
to change my identity.

58
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,370
No, Your Highness.

59
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,830
I don't care.

60
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,910
I swear I won't care anymore.

61
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,700
Remember what you said today.

62
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,580
Where are my men?

63
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,950
Your task is to find a way

64
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,450
to get the evidence of Minister of Revenue.

65
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,500
Yes.

66
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,450
Miss Yun,

67
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,870
Are you willing to perform for me...

68
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,330
to perform for me?

69
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,290
My lord.

70
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,160
Clouds only sell themselves.

71
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,500
but not myself.

72
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,290
If you like it,

73
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,580
come to our tea house often.

74
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,700
I

75
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,580
is going to the next room.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,830
Xiao Liuzi.

77
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,450
What can I do for you?

78
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,080
Check this girl.

79
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,830
Xiangxiang.

80
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,500
My lord.

81
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,200
I found it.

82
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,120
Don't scare my little Xiang Xiang.

83
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,290
Miss Yun is the new wife of a physician in the south of the city.

84
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,080
That'll be more interesting.

85
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,500
You know what to do, right?

86
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,410
Stay still.

87
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,580
It seems that both missing women

88
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,200
are locked up here.

89
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,290
Don't be afraid.

90
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,910
I was locked up too.

91
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,540
What are your names?

92
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,950
My name is Cui Hua.

93
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,950
You sell tofu at the tofu shop.

94
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:39,580
A few days ago,

95
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,159
the minister passed by the tofu shop

96
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,409
and took a liking to me.

97
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,120
so he took me away.

98
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,000
No matter how my father pleads,

99
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,120
it's useless.

100
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,370
Are you a goose?

101
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,040
You know me?

102
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,659
I heard about you at the tea house.

103
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,080
Yes.

104
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,450
I have prepared the money to redeem myself.

105
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,040
to leave the fireworks with Joon.

106
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,450
But unexpectedly,

107
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,910
by Minister of Revenue.

108
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,370
Because of this,

109
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,620
because of this.

110
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,290
Don't be sad.

111
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,790
We'll get out of here.

112
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,160
Are you okay?

113
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,790
I'm fine.

114
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,620
They're both here.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,700
Don't worry.

116
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,290
Take care.

117
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,250
I'm leaving.

118
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,540
You have the ledger.

119
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,660
Don't come over.

120
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,620
Don't come over!

121
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,330
You...

122
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:49,950
Come with me.

123
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,370
What are you doing?

124
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,870
Miss Yun,

125
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,450
As long as you listen to my master,

126
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,540
I promise you'll have a good life in the future.

127
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,290
Your master is abducting me.
