1
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:41,870
Move!

2
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:42,750
Move!

3
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,200
Move!

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,250
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

5
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,540
Your Highness.

6
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,830
Who are you to stop us from meeting the Crown Prince?

7
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,160
I've told all of you

8
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,200
the Crown Prince is seriously ill.

9
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,160
He shouldn't meet you.

10
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,950
We haven't seen the Crown Prince for more than half a month.

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,370
Crown Prince, what is your illness?

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,539
Why hasn't he gotten better?

13
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:14,330
As the saying goes,

14
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:15,950
illness comes like a mountain.

15
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,370
The illness is like a thread.

16
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,200
I think you all know it.

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,000
The imperial physicians

18
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,410
are trying their best to treat her.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,160
Nonsense.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,539
The Crown Prince has always been healthy.

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,789
How could he be seriously ill?

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,500
I think you're the one with evil intentions.

23
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,539
How dare you!

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,080
How dare you disrespect His Highness the second?

25
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,660
Please calm down.

26
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,789
I know you care about the Crown Prince.

27
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,580
When he gets better,

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,330
when Crown Prince gets better.

29
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,330
Your Highness,

30
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,330
don't have any ulterior motives.

31
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,250
If we find out anything,

32
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,620
I will enforce the law impartially.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Your Highness.

34
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,200
Who?

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,160
The Imperial Secretariat and the two officials

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,620
died mysteriously overnight.

37
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,540
Lord Zhang,

38
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,790
Don't you think it's strange?

39
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,120
Everyone is in panic today.

40
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,290
The late emperor passed away,

41
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,500
Gao Hanji murdered Prince Xiaoyao.

42
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,080
Now, the Crown Prince is seriously ill.

43
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,660
The weather is changing in Yun.

44
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,910
Mind your words, Lord Li.

45
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,750
We used to think

46
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,000
the Crown Prince Yun Shangjun

47
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,410
was afraid that you had military power.

48
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,620
So, when the late emperor was seriously ill,

49
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,500
the late emperor

50
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,829
to let Mo Qi bring his own letter

51
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,250
to lure you back to the capital

52
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,620
and send a fake decree.

53
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,910
and then sit in the Gaoshang Department.

54
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,200
Logically,

55
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,660
everything goes smoothly.

56
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,040
Yun Shangjun should ascend the throne.

57
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,790
But nothing has happened.

58
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,790
And Mo Qiao is missing.

59
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,079
And his two trusted aides

60
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,870
Imperial Secretariat and the two adults

61
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,910
were all bizarre.

62
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,540
Even Yun Shangjun

63
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,329
is afraid of being exposed,

64
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,250
I wouldn't have

65
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,290
at this moment.

66
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,829
What's more suspicious is that

67
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:01,200
he hasn't ascended the throne yet.

68
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,450
Besides,

69
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,950
is seriously ill.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,290
And his trusted aides

71
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,160
died one after another.

72
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,160
Could it be

73
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,000
behind this?

74
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,329
No matter

75
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,290
is the mastermind,

76
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,000
In this case,

77
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,540
another trusted aide of Yun Shangjun

78
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,250
might also be in danger.

79
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,950
You mean...

80
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,290
Master,

81
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,330
everything is ready.

82
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,659
When do you plan to set off?

83
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,500
If the Crown Prince ascends the throne,

84
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,750
I would have retired and returned to my hometown

85
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,700
and live a peaceful life.

86
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,290
But the Crown Prince is seriously ill.

87
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,370
The situation in the court is unstable.

88
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,120
How can I leave the Crown Prince

89
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,700
and abandon the Crown Prince?

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,830
So, do you still want to

91
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,330
will you continue?

92
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,830
Once the ancestral house is built,

93
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,700
you and some people

94
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,660
go there first.

95
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,620
It's safer to stay away from this troubled place.

96
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,250
You're so thoughtful.

97
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,620
If Prince of Xiao Yao were still alive,

98
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,580
this wouldn't have happened.

99
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,950
Go back to work.

100
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,290
Why are you back and forth again?

101
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,120
What else do you want?

102
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,000
Prince of Xiao Yao.

103
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,620
Greetings, Your Highness.

104
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,790
Grand Tutor, please get up.

105
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,000
Your Highness.

106
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,500
What's going on?

107
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,410
I didn't expect you to encounter such a strange encounter.

108
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,950
Luckily, His Highness is safe.

109
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,659
I'm very worried.

110
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,450
I've been concerned about your safety.

111
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,540
I heard that

112
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,080
was murdered by the Gaoshang Bureau.

113
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,409
I'm so worried.

114
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,200
I don't believe

115
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,950
that the late emperor would rebel

116
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,950
when the late emperor was seriously ill.

117
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,700
Have you found any evidence?

118
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,700
to prove your innocence.

119
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,409
We've lost many clues.

120
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:51,790
Grand Tutor,

121
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,700
How is the situation in the court?

122
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,540
To be honest,

123
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,250
His Highness the second claimed that the Crown Prince is seriously ill.

124
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,200
He tried to stop us from meeting the Crown Prince.

125
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,700
Yun Shang Zhou?

126
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,250
The Crown Prince asked Mo Qiao

127
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,410
to the border to ask you to return to the capital.

128
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,000
the other ministers and I know nothing about it.

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,370
The Crown Prince has always respected you.

130
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,910
He would never

131
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,660
such an unjust thing.

132
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,080
Master,

133
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,200
Dinner is ready.

134
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:17,750
Uncle Xiang.

135
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,910
Don't tell anyone.

136
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,620
Understand?

137
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,790
Don't worry, Master.

138
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,580
I understand.

139
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,120
Tell everyone in the mansion

140
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,160
that this matter must not be leaked.

141
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,370
Yes.

142
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,000
Your Highness.

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,040
Who is this gentleman?

144
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,620
Greetings, Grand Tutor.

145
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,950
We'll talk later.

146
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,580
Imperial Secretariat and the Superintendent Office encountered accidents one after another.

147
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,450
Just in case,

148
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:43,409
we will disguise our identity

149
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,040
to protect the Grand Tutor.

150
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,540
If the thief dares to attack,

151
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,409
we can follow the clues.

152
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,620
Follow me.

153
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,620
Lunar.

154
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,000
Lunar.

155
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,370
But I don't like...

156
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,160
embroidered ball flowers?

157
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,160
No.

158
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,080
My skin will swell

159
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,160
my skin will swell and feel uncomfortable.

160
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,039
Who is this?

161
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,159
Uncle Xiang.

162
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,250
This is the cake Sun Ji sent to Master.

163
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,620
Go.

164
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,160
Why does this figure

165
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,830
look so much like Si Han?

166
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,410
Master.

167
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Sun's cakes are here.

168
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,910
Bring it here.

169
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,370
Dad, I love Sun's Lotus Pastry.

170
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,040
It's good that Xiao Ran likes it.

171
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,000
Si Han.
