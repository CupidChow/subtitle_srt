1
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,080
Hurry up!

2
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,750
Come on.

3
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,250
Come here.

4
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,289
longevity noodles are here.

5
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:25,250
I didn't expect our doll

6
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:27,539
such a big table of dishes.

7
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:29,330
Brat.

8
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,250
You're lucky.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,910
Of course.

10
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,500
Master.

11
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,789
Today is your 60th birthday.

12
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:40,330
I didn't prepare a gift.

13
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,750
Only this table of dishes

14
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,120
represents my sincerity.

15
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,450
I promise you

16
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,789
After I clear your name,

17
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,000
I will hold you

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,620
a grand birthday for you.

19
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,039
Okay. Here.

20
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,660
Cheers.

21
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,660
Cheers. Cheers.

22
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:56,950
Master.

23
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,410
Here you go.

24
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,080
You just recovered.

25
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,120
Don't drink too much.

26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,950
You're right.

27
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,700
You

28
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,910
don't be so polite to me.

29
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,199
Here.

30
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,789
This

31
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,830
is my secret medicine manual for years.

32
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,950
Take it.

33
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,450
Thank you, master.

34
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,000
I passed the disguise technique

35
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,410
to King of Culture.

36
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,870
You passed the secret book to Lunar.

37
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,290
We are a perfect match.

38
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,450
Senior.

39
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,829
I learned that secretly, didn't I?

40
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,660
Yes.

41
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,000
Learn secretly.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,160
Look, I'm talking nonsense again.

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,000
Come on.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,790
Let's drink.

45
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,040
Come on.

46
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,500
Cheers.

47
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,290
Why are you here?

48
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,579
Your Highness, please save my father.

49
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,250
He was taken away.

50
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,660
Isn’t this King of Cultivation?

51
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,410
Ten miles away from the city, by the Luo River.

52
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,540
Where did you collect the information?

53
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,000
It's none of your business.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,370
Report!

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,410
We found the place where Luo Mingyue and Prince of Prowess are staying.

56
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,410
Why are they in the same place?

57
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,410
When they are together,

58
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,700
everything will be clear.

59
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,079
I'll report to the Regent now.

60
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:36,540
Go after them.

61
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,200
When I came back from the snack,

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,660
he was already arrested.

63
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,290
Looks like Yun Shang Zhou...

64
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:46,790
let Grand Mentor Xie go.

65
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,790
In fact,

66
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,660
a way to deal with him.

67
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,080
King of Culture.

68
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,160
Luo Mingyue.

69
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,200
You can't escape.

70
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,950
They used Xiao Ran

71
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,250
to find our location.

72
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,580
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

73
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,750
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,910
It's all my fault.

75
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,579
Old man.

76
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,079
Kids.

77
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:18,790
Follow me.

78
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,160
Go.

79
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,120
This is the escape route I've prepared for ten years.

80
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,580
I didn't expect

81
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,540
It's finally useful today.

82
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,500
Yeah. Come on.

83
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,290
Tianchen, help me.

84
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,870
Be careful.

85
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,540
If you don't come out,

86
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,290
if you don't come out.

87
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,290
Ready.

88
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,540
Hurry, let's go.

89
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,500
Hurry.

90
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,450
Sir.

91
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,790
Senior.

92
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,659
My good disciple.

93
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,540
Live well.

94
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,620
Live well.

95
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,500
Master.

96
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:04,870
Lunar.

97
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,580
Master.

98
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,000
Lunar.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,580
Master.

100
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,870
If you go up now,

101
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,830
I'll let you down.

102
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,120
Master.

103
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,950
Let's go.

104
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,250
Master!

105
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,370
Granny.

106
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,330
Are you scared?

107
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,410
As long as I can be with you,

108
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,870
There's nothing to be afraid of.

109
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,790
Granny.

110
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,830
We fought all our lives.

111
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,790
In the end,

112
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,000
I'll be with you.

113
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,330
Let's go.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,790
Go.

115
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,160
Kill!

116
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,870
Search carefully.

117
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,950
What should we do now?

118
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,870
I know a place.

119
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,700
It's safe for now.

120
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,250
Come with me.

121
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,040
Xiao Ran is asleep.

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,700
Come on.

123
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,830
This place

124
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,040
is Soju-senpai's place.

125
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,830
Stay here for now.

126
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,409
I've informed Leng Fu.

127
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:38,830
to come to me.

128
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,659
Their revenge...

129
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,330
our revenge.

130
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,000
our revenge.

131
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,540
No matter what happens in the future,

132
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
I will do my best to protect you.

133
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,660
Your Highness.

134
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,160
Thank you.

135
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,370
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

136
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,950
After I got your news,

137
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,120
I came here immediately.

138
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,540
to be at your disposal.

139
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,120
Before Grand Mentor Xie was arrested,

140
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,950
he came to me.

141
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,700
that the Crown Prince's residence is fake.

142
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,000
The Crown Prince's mansion is heavily guarded now.

143
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,830
Do you have any idea

144
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,250
to find out the truth?

145
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,450
Don't worry, Your Highness.

146
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,950
I know what to do.

147
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,080
Go.

148
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:14,790
Yes.
