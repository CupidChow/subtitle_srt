1
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,660
Have a look

2
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,370
Sir, why don't you take a look?

3
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,580
Fresh toys.

4
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,789
I didn't expect you

5
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,370
is not only skilled in martial arts,

6
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,539
but also good at swimming.

7
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,120
How did you know

8
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:58,870
I pretended to be dead and escaped?

9
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,450
That day, when I followed you to the bridge,

10
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,500
I thought you were dead.

11
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,160
Fortunately,

12
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,789
I finally saw you outside the palace.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,660
Are you sure?

14
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,290
the person you saw

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,660
is me.

16
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,790
Mr. Luo won't give up easily

17
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,829
he won't give up easily.

18
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,829
Besides,

19
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,410
you're far better than those men in black.

20
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,290
If you don't have other plans,

21
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,370
they wouldn't have hurt you.

22
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,410
I pretended to die

23
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,500
to lower their guard

24
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,910
so that I can act.

25
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,829
After you distracted the man in black that day,

26
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,950
Baili Chuan told me

27
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,620
before Mo Qi departed to the military camp,

28
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,120
he conspired with a man in the study.

29
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,950
For now, we can be sure that

30
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,750
Mo Qiao must have an accomplice.

31
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,540
and the mastermind behind the whole thing

32
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,950
is now in the palace.

33
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,450
He forged the imperial edict

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,540
to murder His Highness.

35
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,540
and implicated me.

36
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,540
Based on this,

37
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,950
the biggest beneficiary

38
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,330
The biggest beneficiary

39
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,830
is the Crown Prince.

40
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,160
Now only we can cooperate

41
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,370
to investigate the truth

42
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,500
to prove our innocence.

43
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,540
Your Highness.

44
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,620
are you really willing

45
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,040
who has a grudge against you?

46
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,120
You saved me several times before.

47
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,950
And Gao Hanji

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,079
was killed because of this.

49
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,579
Our common enemy

50
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,910
is the mastermind behind all this.

51
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,700
Am I right?

52
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,750
Duan Laosan.

53
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,370
A lecher who gambles a lot.

54
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,250
According to the clues we've gathered,

55
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,830
we can find the shadow through him.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,330
and then find out

57
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,080
from the shadow.

58
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,500
Place your bets.

59
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,790
Step aside.

60
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,790
Where did such a beautiful lady come from?

61
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,870
Do you dare to bet with me?

62
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,330
I won.

63
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,000
These are yours.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,659
If you lose, you're mine.

65
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,870
This must be Master Duan.

66
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,410
You know me?

67
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,580
Everyone in this gambling house knows Master Duan San's name.

68
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,330
I agree.

69
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,370
Okay.

70
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,620
Big.

71
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,450
But

72
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,250
I have one condition.

73
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,750
Not to mention one.

74
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,500
That's right.

75
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,870
I'm willing to do ten.

76
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,620
I'm not afraid that you'll laugh at me.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,160
I'm from the Western Region.

78
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,040
and my brother just arrived in the Central Plain.

79
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:34,250
But when I first came to the capital,

80
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,700
I have no relatives.

81
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,330
All the money

82
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,500
have run out.

83
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,250
So,

84
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,409
I wanted to come here to try my luck.

85
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,750
If...

86
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,620
I can really defeat Master San.

87
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,159
Pretty, what do you want?

88
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,750
I heard

89
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,580
you have a good job.

90
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,580
My brother is good at both literature and martial arts.

91
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:01,160
I just want you to introduce him.

92
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,500
As for whether it works or not,

93
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,200
I will

94
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,700
will be rewarded.

95
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,870
The organization is recruiting people.

96
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,910
If I introduce him to him,

97
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,200
this little beauty will be mine.

98
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,620
I promise you.

99
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,870
Open.

100
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,200
Okay.

101
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,080
Everyone here can be our witness.

102
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,040
We...

103
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,620
admit defeat.

104
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,200
Don't leave in a hurry.

105
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,159
Play with me.

106
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,409
Please behave yourself.

107
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,620
Self-respect? Why are you pretending to be aloof here?

108
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,040
Come, play with me.

109
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,700
Let me go!

110
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,200
Get out of here! Get out of here!

111
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:56,409
Get lost!

112
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,700
Wait and see.

113
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,330
Are you hurt?

114
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,580
Thank you for saving me.

115
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,410
You're welcome.

116
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,120
If you are interested in the pipa,

117
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,250
I'm willing to play a song

118
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,950
to repay you for saving my life.

119
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,000
I wonder

120
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,370
would you like to join us?

121
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,080
I've heard that you're the best pipa.

122
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,750
It's my honor

123
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,200
It's my honor.

124
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,410
Well...

125
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,790
Please come with me.

126
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,250
Now, Duan Laosan

127
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,290
from Duan Laosan.

128
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,540
If we can persuade her to help us,

129
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,409
we can find the shadow.

130
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,040
and follow the shadow

131
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,750
and find the mastermind.

132
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,290
From now on,

133
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,700
we are allies.

134
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,700
This pair of puppets

135
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,790
Consider this as an alliance gift.

136
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,950
Since it's an alliance gift,

137
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,000
then

138
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,200
One for each.

139
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,000
You read it so carefully.

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,909
No wonder you didn't notice when I came.

141
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,790
Don't worry. There's nothing between us.

142
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

143
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,000
Aren't you with him?

144
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,080
I don't know who you are.

145
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,580
What do you want?

146
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,200
As long as you can help me

147
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,540
get out of here,

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,540
I will do my best to help.

149
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,200
As long as you help us,

150
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,790
we will guarantee your safety.

151
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,000
That's good.

152
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,620
I've never seen

153
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,950
a gentleman like him.

154
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,500
I tried to seduce him just now,

155
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,580
he was not moved at all.

156
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,200
It shows that he treats you differently.

157
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,750
How do you know I am...

158
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,830
What are you talking about?

159
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,830
I'll ask him out at midnight tonight.

160
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,830
Heiyi Pavilion?
