1
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,370
Cang Jiu, let go of me!

2
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,160
Let go of me!

3
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,370
Let's go. Let's go.

4
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,290
Be good and soak it.

5
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,370
Learn to make medicine with me from now on.

6
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,500
Cang Jiu, I don't want to be your pharmacist.

7
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,750
Let go of me!

8
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,620
I heard that King of Happy was killed.

9
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,660
Please enjoy.

10
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,450
What did you say?

11
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,790
Do you know why?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,870
I heard it was a rebellion.

13
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,790
How is that possible?

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:04,830
Ten years ago,

15
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,080
Prince of Xiao Yao gave up his throne

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,370
and guard the border.

17
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,539
If you want to rebel,

18
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:09,450
we wouldn't have waited until now.

19
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:10,700
Lower your voice.

20
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,410
Who set us up?

21
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,120
What is the purpose?

22
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,250
It seems we can only find the answer

23
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,870
to know the answer.

24
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,750
Sir, what would you like to eat?

25
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,410
Do you have maltose?

26
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,200
No.

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080
Is it as poor as football?

28
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,500
Please go upstairs.

29
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,620
Mo Qi, the person who sent the order to Fang Shan.

30
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,079
Now that Baixiao Pavilion has paid you back,

31
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:49,750
I won't give you any information anymore.

32
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,620
Doll.

33
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,660
Take the medicine.

34
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,079
Okay.

35
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,330
He ran away.

36
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,580
Come back.

37
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,660
Bad news!

38
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,290
His Majesty has passed away.

39
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,290
He passed away?

40
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,329
His Majesty...

41
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,370
His Majesty is seriously ill.

42
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:53,450
The court is in turmoil.

43
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,829
The situation is very tense.

44
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,250
I will go back to the capital first.

45
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,950
Please leave at once.

46
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,750
I always thought

47
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,160
it was you who set up this trap

48
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,200
to kill me.

49
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,620
I didn't expect...

50
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,040
But why did the Crown Prince do that?

51
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,870
Are you afraid that I might hold the military power?

52
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,660
that after my brother passed away,

53
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,120
after His Majesty passed away.

54
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,540
How's the sales going?

55
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,370
Kid.

56
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,250
Who is the kid?

57
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,040
Are you okay?

58
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,290
I'm fine.

59
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,080
Be careful next time.

60
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,409
She looks like that person.

61
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,870
Why did the Imperial Guards kill the people in Mo Residence?

62
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,750
Could Mo Qi be...

63
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,040
My lord.

64
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,700
The butler Baili Chuan sneaked away from the back door.

65
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,370
You guys stay here to clean up the mess.

66
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,450
You guys come with me. Hurry.

67
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,159
Yes.

68
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,870
What happened in Mo Residence?

69
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,830
Mo Qi is missing.

70
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,620
The butler ran away too.

71
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,790
Why are you here?

72
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,790
You live here?

73
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,040
Let's go.

74
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,290
Thank you for saving me again.

75
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,700
If there is a chance, I will repay you with a spring.

76
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,540
I'll pay you back.

77
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:34,830
Kid,

78
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,750
You're so old-fashioned.

79
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,200
Really?

80
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,659
Why are you there?

81
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:47,000
Because I was hungry.

82
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,790
I thought of a rich family

83
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,909
to steal some food.

84
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:52,659
Don't send me to the government.

85
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,370
What about your parents?

86
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,040
My family had a famine,

87
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,659
I came here with my parents.

88
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,120
Unexpectedly,

89
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,500
I got lost in the end.

90
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,950
All right.

91
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,040
Take it to buy food.

92
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,040
Don't steal anymore.

93
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,540
Okay.

94
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,870
Now everyone in Mo Yan's residence is killed,

95
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,200
and she suddenly appeared.

96
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,660
and the Imperial Guards who are undercover.

97
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,660
What secret

98
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,040
hidden?

99
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,080
Don't look.

100
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,000
You can't escape.

101
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,040
It's really you.

102
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,540
Who are you?
