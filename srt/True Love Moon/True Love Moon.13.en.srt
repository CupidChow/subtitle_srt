1
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,160
How is the search going?

2
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,660
It's all set.

3
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:38,620
Your Highness.

4
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,580
How many days do we have left?

5
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,200
According to our previous dosage,

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,200
Crown Prince, within half a month...

7
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,500
Too long.

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,250
All plans

9
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,290
in advance.

10
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,040
Choose.

11
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,660
It's already started.

12
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,750
You're back.

13
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,370
The Crown Prince's Mansion has sent more men today.

14
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,160
Our priority

15
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,160
we must save the Crown Prince.

16
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,000
Should we contact the ministers to pressure him?

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,120
You can continue to rest now.

18
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,500
Don't worry about

19
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,789
Don't worry.

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,789
I'm here.

21
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:48,870
Okay.

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,160
Now there are many crises.

23
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,040
I made you a safe card.

24
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,160
I hope it can protect you.

25
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,500
Ladies and gentlemen,

26
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,120
The food you want is here.

27
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,450
All of you are sick.

28
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,829
Your Highness.

29
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,160
I have something to report.

30
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,540
Go ahead, Chief Secretariat.

31
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,700
The late emperor's edict

32
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,500
to pass the throne to the Crown Prince.

33
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,200
Now, the Crown Prince is seriously ill.

34
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,790
and hasn't recovered.

35
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,870
We old ministers

36
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,290
hope to see the Crown Prince.

37
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,370
I told you last time

38
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,160
the Crown Prince is seriously ill.

39
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,290
He can't meet anyone.

40
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:29,660
But I heard

41
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,500
the Crown Prince was imprisoned by the Regent.

42
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,000
and drugged him every day.

43
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,079
to prevent Crown Prince from getting better.

44
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,450
How dare you, Chief Secretariat!

45
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,950
How dare you disobey the Regent?

46
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,160
You're just a servant.

47
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,660
How can you speak here?

48
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,620
You...

49
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,620
I wonder

50
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,290
heard about this?

51
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,290
It's all over the palace.

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,079
As an imperial official,

53
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,660
you should know that all charges are based on evidence.

54
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,579
How dare you question me

55
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,040
to question me in court.

56
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,790
in the court?

57
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,290
Regent,

58
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,700
If you want to prove your innocence,

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,660
please allow us to see the Crown Prince.

60
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,160
I can let you meet.

61
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,080
But if the Crown Prince

62
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,200
the Crown Prince is not like what you've heard.

63
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,410
What should we do?

64
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,120
I

65
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,450
will be at your disposal.

66
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,659
What do you think?

67
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,659
The Crown Prince is suffering from the cold evil.

68
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,620
His organs are injured.

69
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,580
I'm afraid...

70
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,370
will die soon.

71
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,159
Is it because of poisoning?

72
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:49,830
No.

73
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,750
No.

74
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,790
Grand Tutor.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,909
You don't trust me.

76
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,250
Since you haven't seen the Crown Prince for a long time,

77
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,830
I'll give you enough time to catch up.

78
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,700
Your Highness.

79
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,790
You must be tired.

80
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,370
Thank you

81
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,580
for your concern.

82
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,750
Please

83
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,160
continue to assist Shangzhou for me.

84
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:23,910
Your Highness.

85
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,040
I wonder

86
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,410
the jujubes I brought you last time.

87
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,200
Do you still want to try it?

88
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,450
Thank you, Grand Tutor.

89
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,659
for still thinking about my preferences.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,750
But

91
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,290
Shangzhou has prepared

92
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,540
Your Highness, you...

93
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,830
Your Highness, rest well.

94
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,250
We'll visit you another day.

95
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,830
Chief Secretariat.

96
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,580
Does what you said

97
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
still count?

98
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,870
I'm a man of my word.

99
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,200
I won't break my promise.

100
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,330
Guards!

101
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:03,750
Yes.

102
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,250
Chief Secretariat, you believed the rumors and slandered me.

103
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,790
and flogged him 50 times.

104
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,410
Take him down.

105
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:10,830
Your Highness.

106
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,290
No.

107
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,120
Chief Secretariat is old.

108
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,660
This 50 strokes will kill him.

109
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,250
I gave you a chance.

110
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,450
This is your choice.

111
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,700
Don't blame me.

112
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,910
Father is still alive.

113
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,080
[but he's still in trouble.]

114
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,080
Take him away.

115
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,450
Father is still alive.

116
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,040
The adversity is not over.

117
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,200
Dayun is in danger.

118
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,250
I beg the Regent

119
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,000
allow me to return to Jiangxia.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,080
What are you going back for?

121
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,120
I'm old.

122
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,409
Please allow me

123
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,580
to allow me to leave the court

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,500
and write about the history of the court until I die.

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,450
Sure.

126
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,409
Approved.

127
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

128
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:58,830
He's eradicating dissidents one by one.

129
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,040
Your Highness.

130
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,620
There's one more thing I think it's strange.

131
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:04,950
Go ahead, Grand Tutor.

132
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,290
When you went to the Crown Prince's mansion last time,

133
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,700
did you find out that the Crown Prince was poisoned?

134
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,200
It's true.

135
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,040
When the imperial physician examined the Crown Prince,

136
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,120
he didn't find any trace.

137
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,540
The imperial physician was bribed.

138
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,660
No.

139
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,540
I know Wang Heng.

140
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,620
He is upright and upright.

141
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,000
Everyone in the palace will be bribed.

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,200
except him.

143
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,580
What do you mean?

144
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,830
I tried the Crown Prince with jujube crispy.

145
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,370
The Crown Prince told me

146
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,450
His Highness the second has prepared

147
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,040
But Crown Prince is allergic to jujubes.

148
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,450
You mean

149
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:53,200
there's something wrong with the Crown Prince.

150
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,580
I will find out the truth as soon as possible.

151
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,540
When will you return to your hometown?

152
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,870
Tomorrow.

153
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,250
From now on,

154
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,200
fight side by side with you anymore.

155
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,450
Please forgive me.

156
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,660
Grand Tutor, please get up.

157
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,250
The court is under Yun Shang Zhou's control.

158
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,040
The longer we stay, the more dangerous it will be.

159
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,290
I will save the Crown Prince as soon as possible.

160
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,450
By then, I'll ask Grand Mentor Xie to come out.

161
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,410
Where's Xiao Ran?

162
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,660
She went out early in the morning.

163
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,450
She said she'd eat Sun Ji's dessert again before she left.

164
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,789
This kid...

165
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,580
Master, look.

166
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,580
What are you doing?

167
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,370
Grand Tutor.

168
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,620
Lord Liu reported that you received 500,000 taels of stolen money.

169
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,790
Do you know the consequences?

170
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,450
Liu Yong is framing me.

171
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,080
This...

172
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,040
You have to defend yourself in front of the Regent.

173
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,620
Take him away.

174
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,290
You...

175
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,080
Let's go.

176
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,700
Master!

177
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,580
Master!

178
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,080
Hurry up!

179
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,000
Hurry up.
