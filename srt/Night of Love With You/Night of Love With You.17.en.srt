(Mu Nanchen & Luo Qing)

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,880
Thank God.

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,880
You're finally here.

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,360
Is this the end?

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,280
I can finally get out of the story.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,960
Look.

26
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,240
I was this close

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,960
to ending the story on my own.

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,720
You were this close

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,280
to being gone forever.

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,520
What?

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,280
I can only stay here for a while.

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,320
Remember this,

33
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,080
because you are in the wrong character,

34
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,080
if you die in the story,

35
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,920
you'll be gone forever.

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
It turns out

37
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,600
this wedding

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,280
is a farewell party for me.

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,640
But I don't want to be Luo Qing.

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,520
I'm here to be Song Ruoyun.

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,720
There was a mistake.

42
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,640
I've asked Comic Book Centre

43
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,360
to terminate the story.

44
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,520
However,

45
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,600
you've been forcing the plot to move,

46
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,840
which leads to
the incoherence of the story

47
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,600
and unreasonable relationships
of the characters.

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,400
The plot

49
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,280
might get more and more out of control.

50
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,000
Before the story officially ends,

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,880
you must be careful.

52
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,920
How long am I going to wait?

53
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,360
Time in the comic book world
is independent.

54
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,680
I don't know when it will stop.

55
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,520
Anyway,

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,240
don't create new problems.

57
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,480
Meaningless things

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,920
are not allowed to exist
in the world of comics.

59
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,320
Can't you just take me out of here?

60
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,120
I'm not

61
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,920
getting married.

62
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,360
Let's get out of here first.

63
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,440
Luo Qing.

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,160
Why?

65
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,360
Because...

66
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
I

67
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,200
got cancer.

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,880
Luo Qing.

69
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,960
Mu's Group has
specialized medical institutions.

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,560
We can cure you.

71
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,480
It's not what's important.

72
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,200
The important thing is

73
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,520
we're

74
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,000
actually

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,840
brother and sister.

76
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,160
We can't be together.

77
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,560
But

78
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,880
my parents couldn't
have any more children

79
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,320
after they had me.

80
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,600
Luo Qing.

81
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,040
What is your reason?

82
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,400
Because...

83
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,920
I...

84
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,240
The person I like is Leng Yehan!

85
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,440
When you like someone,

86
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,480
you will miss her
when she's not around.

87
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,360
You'll get upset
when she's with someone else.

88
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,880
When she is in danger,

89
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,240
you'll save her
without concern for yourself.

90
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,600
The most important thing is

91
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,560
your heart will pound

92
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
at some point.

93
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,640
Help me.

94
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,560
Come here first.

95
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,800
Mu Nanchen.

96
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,240
Marrying you will actually kill me.

97
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,960
Mr. Mu, you heard her.

98
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,840
Luo Qing and I only had a fight.

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,040
Put all your spending today

100
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,600
on Leng's Group's account.

101
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,760
Mr. Mu,

102
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,240
you're welcome.

103
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,920
There is no need to badger her,

104
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,080
otherwise,

105
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,840
it will do us no good.

106
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,680
Ma'am.

107
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,600
Luo Qing refused to marry Mr. Mu.

108
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,680
You should come out and take a look.

109
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,120
Ma'am! Ma'am!

110
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,200
Ma'am!

111
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,000
Mr. Mu.

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,920
Something happened.

113
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,080
She is dead.

114
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,480
Who is dead?

115
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,760
Mrs. Mu is dead.

116
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,200
You were the last person Mrs. Mu met!

117
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,240
It wasn't me.

118
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,880
I haven't seen her at all.

119
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,040
No one

120
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,360
is allowed to leave right now.

121
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,280
Please sit down!

122
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,240
Miss Luo.

123
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,960
Please come with us.

124
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,680
(How does the romantic drama)

125
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,360
(has a crime scene all of a sudden?)

126
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,320
(What's going on?)

127
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,720
Mr. Leng.

128
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,760
Is there anything wrong?

129
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,880
Why haven't I seen Song Ruoyun?

130
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,480
It must be her!

131
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,760
She was the only one who met Mrs. Mu!

132
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,400
I didn't meet Mrs. Mu at all.

133
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,080
Besides,

134
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,400
I have no reason to kill her.

135
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,000
(With the leading male character
being here,)

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,880
(I'm still free to defend myself.)

137
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,440
(Is this not the plot
of the original comic book?)

138
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,960
You've been pushing the plot to move.

139
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,840
The plot might get more and more
out of control.

140
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,560
You have reasons.

141
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,160
Mrs. Mu said

142
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,560
she wouldn't allow Mr. Mu to marry you.

143
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,920
If you insist on getting married,

144
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,680
she would disinherit Mr. Mu.

145
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,800
In order to get our money,

146
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,360
of course you would
have a dispute with Mrs. Mu.

147
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,680
Don't jump to conclusions.

148
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,160
You're only talking about my motive,

149
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,640
but it's not enough.

150
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,040
Look at the ground.

151
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,840
There are obvious traces of dragging.

152
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,640
The blood on the corner of the table

153
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,080
might be the cause of the fatal injury.

154
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,400
But the strange thing is

155
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,640
this person

156
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,440
doesn't seem to want to cover it up.

157
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
No matter what,

158
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,000
it would take some time
to do these things.

159
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,120
There was no one in the room

160
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,240
when I came in,

161
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,640
so I left right away.

162
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,920
If you don't believe me,

163
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,280
you can check the security tape.

164
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,440
Between the time I came in and left,

165
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,760
it's impossible for me to do it.

166
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,600
Go get the surveillance video.

167
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,200
Yes.

168
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,960
Well,

169
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,480
who else would hurt Mrs. Mu?

170
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,040
Ruoyun.

171
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,880
Where is Ruoyun?

172
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,280
Mrs. Mu.

173
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,840
Miss Song.

174
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,320
Where are you going?

175
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
You have to think differently.

176
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,320
It's not about who would hurt Mrs. Mu.

177
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,280
It's about who would set me up.

178
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,800
Song Ruoyun's goal in life

179
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,280
is to marry Mu Nanchen.

180
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,360
She definitely doesn't want me
to become his wife.

181
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,120
You...

182
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,520
You're slinging mud at her!

183
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,160
Mr. Song, don't get ahead of yourself.

184
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,720
I wonder

185
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,200
why Miss Song

186
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,960
was in such a hurry to leave here.

187
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,200
What's going on?

188
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,880
Miss Song always dresses beautifully.

189
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,720
Why do you look a mess all of a sudden

190
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,440
as if you had a fight with someone?

191
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,160
It's Luo Qing.

192
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,720
She pushed Mrs. Mu.

193
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,800
I saw it with my own eyes.

194
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,880
Where is the evidence?

195
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,280
Because Mrs. Mu found something on you

196
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,400
that she shouldn't have.

197
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,480
What is it?

198
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,800
My personal seal.

199
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,200
I went to Aunt

200
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,240
to stop

201
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,520
your wedding.

202
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,400
But I happened to see

203
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,120
Luo Qing and Aunt fight.

204
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,280
They seemed to be snatching something.

205
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,040
I wanted to go in and help,

206
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,080
but Luo Qing pushed her to the ground.

207
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,320
I was too scared.

208
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,480
I was afraid Luo Qing would kill me

209
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,400
if she found me,

210
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,160
so I hid myself.

211
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,960
I didn't come in

212
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,360
until Luo Qing had left,

213
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,760
but Aunt

214
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,800
was not breathing

215
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,000
at that time.

216
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,520
This is just

217
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,240
one side of Miss Song's story.

218
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,280
How would Mr. Mu be convinced?

219
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,960
If what you said is true,

220
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,840
why didn't you call for help

221
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,920
in the yard

222
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,880
instead of running away?

223
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,680
Luo Qing.

224
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,840
It's not the time for you

225
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,360
to question my whereabouts.

226
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,400
You should explain to everyone.

227
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,160
Nanchen always

228
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,640
carries his seal with him.

229
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,560
He will have an allergy
when he gets close to women.

230
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,720
But you've been

231
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,640
staying with Nanchen these days.

232
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,120
Who else could it be but you?

233
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,920
Mr. Mu.

234
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,600
The monitoring data was destroyed
before the wedding.

235
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,520
Luo Qing!

236
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,520
Are you still going to deny it?

237
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,760
You're framing me!

238
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,040
If it's not for the sake of the seal,

239
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,680
why did you propose to marry Nanchen

240
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,160
all of a sudden

241
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,920
and then change your mind?

242
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,680
Do you have a better reason?
