=Episode 22=

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,320
I hesitated that day

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,600
not because I don't believe you.

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,320
It's just there was too much information

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,680
and I didn't know how to react.

24
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,600
It's not your fault.

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,080
You wouldn't have to go through all this

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,960
if I hadn't messed it up.

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,640
Luo Qing.

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,000
I like you.

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,280
Mu Nanchen,

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,960
the one I like

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:37,880
is him.

32
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,360
I know,

33
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,560
but I have to tell you.

34
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,320
Luo Qing.

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
I think

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,800
we met too late.

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,160
Too much has happened

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,280
since I realized I liked you.

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,800
We're still friends.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,840
How can I be friends

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,120
with the girl I like?

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,400
Miss Luo.

43
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,480
I wish you and Leng Yehan all the best.

44
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,360
He's just trying to look cool.

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,240
Let's go home.

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,040
I think

47
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,400
I have something to do.

48
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,760
Yeah?

49
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,680
Never mind.

50
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,880
As I don't remember it,

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,720
it mustn't be important.

52
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,000
Are you officially together?

53
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,760
I'm going to the bathroom.

54
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,360
Sit down!

55
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,440
Shouldn't you thank me

56
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,120
for bringing you two together?

57
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,480
The moment you two got together,

58
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,080
you left me outside in the cold

59
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,640
for three hours?

60
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,920
I still brought you back.

61
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,960
Why are you so mad?

62
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,400
I'm

63
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,240
the only man in the Luo family.

64
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,640
If you want to marry my sister,

65
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,240
you have to pass my test first.

66
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,320
Well,

67
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,200
you were out in the cold for so long.

68
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,920
Why don't we

69
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,040
go to bed early

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,360
and hear your instructions
tomorrow morning?

71
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,440
All right.

72
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,040
Where are you going?

73
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,080
I'll sleep...

74
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,920
You'll sleep in the guest room.

75
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,200
You'll

76
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,360
go to the master bedroom.

77
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,720
Move.

78
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,400
Tonight,

79
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,720
I'm going to sit right here

80
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,920
and keep an eye on you two.

81
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:15,960
Luo Qing.

82
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
What's the matter?

83
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,520
I think my wound is painful.

84
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,680
What should we do?

85
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,480
Should we go to the hospital?

86
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,520
No need.

87
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,520
Well,

88
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,200
I think

89
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,920
I just need

90
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,720
some rest.

91
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,400
Your wound is painful.

92
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,640
I guess the bed is too hard
in that room.

93
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll sleep there.

94
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,120
You're

95
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,440
gonna wake him up.

96
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Is the wound not painful now?

97
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,360
I don't want to let you go
even if it hurts.

98
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,240
Leng Yehan.

99
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,440
Have you always wanted to know

100
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,040
the secret of the world?

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't want to know it now.

102
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,920
It's not important anymore.

103
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,400
If,

104
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,600
I mean if

105
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,920
one day

106
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,320
the world disappears,

107
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,680
I don't remember you

108
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,040
and you don't remember me,

109
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,560
what should we do then?

110
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,920
If that really happens,

111
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,600
my biggest regret will be
not telling you earlier

112
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,800
that I like you.

113
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,200
But I don't want to forget you.

114
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,200
Before we forget each other,

115
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,760
all we can do

116
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,400
is remember each other.

129

They left without me again.

Is it beautiful?

135
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,760
Hello, sir.

136
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,000
I want a diamond ring.

137
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,520
Is it for the young lady over there?

138
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,720
Okay.

139
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,560
What kind of diamond ring do you want?

140
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,160
Big one.

141
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,720
Wrap your biggest diamond ring for me.

142
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,360
Big sister.

143
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,280
Can I have a bite of your ice cream?

144
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,280
Don't you also have one?

145
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,440
But they are different flavors.

146
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,160
I want a bite of yours, too.

147
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,960
No way.

148
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,680
Then you can't eat mine, either.

149
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,040
Stingy.

150
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,200
You're the stingiest person

151
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,680
I've ever met.

152
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,040
No wonder you don't have a boyfriend.

153
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,320
You...

154
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:02,680
Let's go.

155
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,720
I want to go home and drink milk tea.

156
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,320
Who would grab a kid's ice cream?

157
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,840
Did you two

158
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,880
forget about me again?

159
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,040
No.

160
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,280
We left you out

161
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,640
on purpose.

162
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,840
Luo Qing, look at him.

163
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,840
You haven't married him yet.

164
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,760
Now he treats me like this.

165
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,840
You two went shopping?

166
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,240
What are these things?

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,800
Why is there not even one for me?

168
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,920
You hang out without me

169
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,120
and bought nothing for me.

170
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,440
Here.

171
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,840
Is it good?

172
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,480
It's sweet.

173
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,960
You two

174
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,480
went too far!

175
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,720
All right.

176
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,680
Don't be mad.

177
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,480
What's this?

178
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,960
A bicycle.

179
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,120
A bicycle?

180
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,840
Don't tell me it's the bicycle

181
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,000
I've always wanted.

182
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,360
See for yourself and you'll know.

183
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,160
I love you so much, Sister.

184
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,880
A bicycle!

185
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,400
A bicycle!

186
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,920
It's the one I want.

187
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,120
It's Luo Qing.

188
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,400
Hello, Luo Qing.

189
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,480
Luo Cheng.

190
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,720
Get up here now.

191
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,000
Wasn't everything fine just now?

192
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,440
What's going on?

193
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:35,960
Luo Qing.

194
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,400
Did Leng Yehan bully you?

195
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,520
Well,

196
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,080
you can't beat him anyway.

197
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,120
I'll still fight against him
even if I can't beat him!

198
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,520
No.

199
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,680
I called you in to see

200
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,920
which one looks good on me.

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,760
That's it?

202
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,720
Leng Yehan will take me out
for dinner tonight.

203
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,800
I saw him buy a diamond ring.

204
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,200
Is he going to propose to you?

205
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,320
Well, wear this one.

206
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,600
It looks good on you.

207
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,880
It's off the table then.

208
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,720
Good for you.

209
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,720
Luo Qing.

210
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,400
Yes?

211
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,440
You have to let me send you

212
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,600
to the wedding.

213
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,360
Of course.

214
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,880
I'm leaving.

215
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,680
Luo Cheng, don't...

216
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,400
Luo Qing!

217
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,480
Luo Qing!

218
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,280
What's the matter?

219
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,400
Nothing.

220
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Put it on me.

221
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,760
Let me see what goes with this necklace.

222
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,280
Okay.

223
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
Luo Qing!

224
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,320
When you fall in love,

225
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,200
it's doomed that you can't exist
at the same time.

226
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,520
Leng Yehan.

227
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,720
What's wrong?

228
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,920
Something came up.

229
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,680
I need to leave.

230
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,000
Aren't we having dinner tonight?

231
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,120
Get Luo Cheng here
to pick up the pearls for me.

232
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,040
He...

233
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,040
He went bike riding.

234
