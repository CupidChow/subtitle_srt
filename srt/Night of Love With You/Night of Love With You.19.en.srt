I can't explain it.

is Mu Nanchen and I
are on the same trajectory.

This is what we are destined for
in this world.

Mr. Leng, can you elaborate on that?

91
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,440
You stole my life.

92

167
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,480
I grew up with Mr. Leng.

168
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,280
It's not the first time
he's been injured.

169
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,240
He said

170
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,400
he would do whatever it takes
to get back at the Mu family

171
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,960
and take everything from Mu Nanchen.

172
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,280
But I don't know

173
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,320
why he gave it all up today.

174
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,440
Let's not talk about it.

175
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,760
Miss Luo, you should get some rest.

176
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,120
I'll take care of Mr. Leng.

177
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,600
I'll stay here.

178
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,800
Leng Yehan saved me.

179
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,080
I must wait for him to wake up.

180
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,360
Is there any news about Leng Yehan?

181
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,160
He is nowhere to be found.

182
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,280
What about Luo Qing?

183
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,360
There's no news about her, either.

184
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,760
We even looked for
Miss Luo's younger brother,

185
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,320
Luo Cheng,

186
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,400
but he went missing four days ago.

187
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,800
Miss Luo didn't go to his school
to look for him.

188
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,800
Luo Qing.

189
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,880
Are you still going to deny it?

190
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,200
You're framing me!

191
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,920
If it's not for the sake of the seal,

192
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,000
why did you propose to marry Nanchen

193
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,520
all of a sudden

194
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,240
and then change your mind?

195
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,200
Do you have a better reason?

196
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,120
Could there be someone

197
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,840
who has been threatening her?

198
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,520
Remember to suppress the news.

199
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,960
Don't tell anything
to the press or the police.

200
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,520
Yes.

201
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,640
Nanchen.

202
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,360
What are you doing here?

203
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,640
I'm worried about you.

204
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,080
So much has happened today.

205
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,320
I'm here to check you out.

206
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,040
I even made your favorite coffee.

207
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,840
Luo Qing and Leng Yehan

208
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,240
are missing.

209
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,320
Maybe they joined hands

210
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,760
and did all this together.

211
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,080
Luo Qing's brother

212
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,280
is also missing.

213
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,200
I'm sure

214
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,560
she has planned it all out
for Luo Cheng.

215
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,040
Perhaps

216
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,040
they have left Jiangbei by now.

217
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,920
How do you know

218
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
the name of Luo Qing's
brother is Luo Cheng?

219
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,920
Do you have anything to do

220
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,200
with the disappearance
of Luo Qing's brother?

221
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,840
Are you the one
who has been threatening her?

222
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,240
Nanchen.

223
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,080
Why are you

224
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,720
still trying to exonerate Luo Qing?

225
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,680
No matter what,

226
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,560
she killed Mrs. Mu.

227
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,960
There is no proof yet.

228
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,120
Why are you always on her side?

229
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,280
Nothing has happened between you two.

230
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,640
You can't have real feelings for her.

231
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,800
Nanchen.

232
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,200
Do you know

233
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,680
I'm the one you're supposed to like?

234
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,840
We should be a couple.

235
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,440
It's all because of Luo Qing...

236
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,240
Alright.

237
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,600
Stop it.

238
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,080
Song Ruoyun.

239
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,880
I'm telling you for the last time.

240
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,880
Even without Luo Qing,

241
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,200
I still wouldn't like you.

242
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,840
Qiao Xiao.

243
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,040
See her out.

244
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,080
Yes.

245
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
Miss Song.

246
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,680
Please.

247
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,880
Luo Qing.

248
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,320
The story can only get back on track

249
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,120
when you're gone forever.

250
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,880
Leng Yehan.

251
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,480
You're awake.

252
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,800
How are you feeling?

253
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,400
Where am I?

254
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,600
A small hotel.

255
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,080
Leng Yehan.

256
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,120
I didn't expect you to come and save me.

257
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,840
You told me it was just an excuse

258
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,120
when you said you liked me,

259
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,320
but I think I took it seriously.

260
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,280
Do you know

261
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,120
why I came to save you?

262
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,680
I know.

263
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,360
Because you want to apologize.

264
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,000
