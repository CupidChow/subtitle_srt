Luo Qing.

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,080
Mr. Leng.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,080
The car is ready.

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,600
Shall we

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,200
go to Mu's Building after your meal?

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,320
Where is Luo Qing?

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,160
Miss Luo

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,360
left

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,640
three months ago.

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,320
Why do you ask about her
all of a sudden?

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,400
Three months?

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,600
Yes.

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,160
That day,

33
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,040
after we left Jiangbei Hotel,

34
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,200
she went home directly.

35
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:39,960
Oh.

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,640
Mr. Leng,

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,960
for the past three months,

38
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,960
we've been negotiating with Mr. Song

39
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,160
without achieving anything.

40
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,040
But I just got the news that

41
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,520
Mr. Song's car

42
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,480
was heading to Mu's Building.

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,720
Shall we

44
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,040
go there right now?

45
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,720
Three months?

46
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,840
It's been three months already?

47
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:02,840
Mr. Mu,

48
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,720
you just awoke from a coma.

49
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,320
Ma'am asked you to have a good rest.

50
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,240
When Mr. Song comes
to sign the contract today,

51
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,360
ma'am will receive him.

52
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,080
We are not the only choice of Song's.

53
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,520
Our previous cooperation

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,440
has been delayed unexpectedly
for three months.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,160
I must come in person.

56
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,760
By the way,

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,320
in the last three months,

58
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,360
didn't Leng Yehan do anything?

59
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,000
He had an appointment with Mr. Song.

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,360
But they didn't work together.

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,040
As long as we
sign the contract with Song's,

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,840
in ten years' time, Leng's Group

63
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,960
won't get any chance
to bring about an upswing.

64
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,560
Mu Nanchen,

65
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,640
are you awake?

66
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,880
You're another girl who tries to
approach me by faking an accident.

67
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,600
(What's going on?)

68
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,240
(Does the main story begin)

69
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,120
(after Mu Nanchen awakes?)

70
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,760
Take the money and leave.

71
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,840
(Forget it.)

72
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,640
(Take the money first.)

73
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,680
I'm not interested

74
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,920
in women.

75
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,600
Have I met you before?

76
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,120
No.

77
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,360
How come?

78
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,680
Xiaoyun,

79
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,000
you look pretty today.

80
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,360
Thank you, aunty.

81
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,600
Over the last three months,

82
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,400
Xiaoyun often visited Nanchen

83
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,880
and kindly took care of me.

84
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,600
Mr. Song,

85
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,080
you're so lucky

86
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,280
to have such a daughter as Xiaoyun.

87
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,320
I grew up with Nanchen.

88
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,280
Of course

89
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,640
I care about him.

90
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,560
Mr. Song,

91
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,160
I have an idea.

92
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,560
I want to know your opinion on it.

93
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,360
Mrs. Mu,

94
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,120
please go ahead.

95
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,080
As we're going to
sign the contract today,

96
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,480
why don't we

97
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,720
cement our ties by marriage?

98
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
I think Xiaoyun

99
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,760
really likes Nanchen.

100
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,680
As their parents,

101
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,400
why don't we

102
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,480
help them

103
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,440
and let them

104
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,040
get engaged?

105
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,840
Really?

106
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
I can marry Nanchen finally?

107
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,720
I don't think

108
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,920
a girl should say such things like that.

109
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,320
Nevertheless,

110
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,720
if we become relatives by marriage,

111
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,800
it will be more convenient

112
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,560
for us to work together.

113
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,800
Let go.

114
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,640
Mr. Mu is allergic to women.

115
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,320
Mr. Mu,

116
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,120
are you...

117
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,880
You're fine.

118
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:18,960
Mr. Mu,

119
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,480
aren't you allergic to women?

120
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,800
We'll be responsible
for all your medical expenses.

121
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,080
Let's go.

122
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,800
Yes.

123
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,360
Why did the scene shift suddenly?

124
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,640
How did I get here from the hotel?

125
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,760
I wonder how Leng Yehan is now.

126
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,960
Keep an eye on Song's recently.

127
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,840
If you see or hear anything,

128
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,400
keep me posted.

129
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,790
(Luo Qing)
Yes, sir.

130
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,500
(Luo Qing)
Let's see

131
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,070
(Luo Qing)
what

132
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,200
(Luo Qing)
their next move is.

133
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,480
Leng Yehan should be fine.

134
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,720
He is the villain after all.

135
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,760
Forget it.

136
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,200
Why do I worry about him?

137
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,240
Isn't it silly enough?

138
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,000
However,

139
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,360
it seems that since Mu Nanchen awoke,

140
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,480
the main story of the cartoon has begun.

141
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,120
Does that mean as the heroine,

142
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,240
I won't be hunted
by Song Ruoyun again?

143
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,480
Then let me enjoy the moment

144
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,040
of being a heroine.

145
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,080
However,

146
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,560
the heroine's outfit is so ugly

147
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,440
and tasteless.

148
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,880
I'll use the money
to buy some new clothes.

149
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,520
Mu Nanchen,

150
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,400
do you think you can humiliate others
with your money?

151
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,200
Take your stinky money back!

152
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,000
I want a sincere apology!

153
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,880
Why will I give the money back?

154
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,080
I need it to buy new clothes.

155
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,240
I won't.

156
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,720
I...

157
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,320
What happened?

158
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,840
Well,

159
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,000
what happened?

160
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,360
Mr. Song, thank you

161
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,400
for your faith
in the ability of our group.

162
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,160
I've watched you grow up.

163
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,680
Don't regard me as an outsider.

164
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,880
I hope you choose to work with us

165
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,640
because of our ability

166
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,840
instead of your friendship

167
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,520
with my father.

168
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,400
I'm a businessman.

169
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,600
I only cooperate with those
I have faith in.

170
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,360
Furthermore,

171
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,120
we'll be relatives soon.

172
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,200
You surely deserve the privilege.

173
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,280
Relatives?

174
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,080
Today,

175
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,840
we'll not only
sign the contract with Song's,

176
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
you and Xiaoyun

177
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,320
are also getting engaged.

178
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,040
Look at them.

179
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,240
They make a good match.

180
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,360
Nanchen.

181
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,920
I oppose to the marriage.

182
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,360
You...

183
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,720
Nanchen,

184
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,920
stop horsing around!

185
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,800
I wasn't.

186
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,440
Then give me a reason.

187
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,200
Because

188
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,640
I have a girlfriend.

189
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,280
Who?

190
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,720
She.

191
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,640
I don't care who you are.

192
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,360
Cover up for me.

193
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,160
I get it.

194
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,640
It's that kind of plot

195
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
like faking it for real

196
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,560
or a contract girlfriend.

197
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,040
Rest assured.

198
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,200
I've seen a lot.

199
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,200
Yes.

200
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,800
I'm the girlfriend he's in love with

201
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,600
for an absurdly long time.

202
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Luo Qing?

203
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,080
We've been looking for you
for three months.

204
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,560
How come you show up suddenly?

205
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,320
You and Nanchen...

206
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,800
You...

207
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,760
Three months?

208
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,280
What are you talking about?

209
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,720
No way!

210
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,800
You can't be together.

211
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,560
Nanchen,

212
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,640
she was the one who hurt you
three months ago.

213
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,720
I haven't got even with you yet.

214
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,040
You...

215
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,680
No.

216
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,280
I didn't hurt Mr. Mu.

217
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,760
Please believe me.

218
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,320
(Help!)

219
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,360
(Can you come up
with some useful lines?)

220
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,320
(It was Song Ruoyun who deliberately
sent the message)

221
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,480
(and framed me up.)

222
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,440
(It was her conspiracy!)

223
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,360
(Is it so hard to say?)

224
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,920
Qiao Xiao.

225
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,280
Yes.

226
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,000
Show Nanchen the surveillance video.

227
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,840
Yes.

228
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,960
I used to pity her

229
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
because she had to

230
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,640
work part-time
at such a young age

231
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
in order to pay the gambling debts
for her family.

232
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,240
So I let her work at Mu's,

233
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,520
not expecting

234
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,640
she dared to hurt Nanchen.

235
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,720
She must want to

236
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,960
marry into a wealthy family,

237
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,960
at all costs.

238
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,960
Nanchen,

239
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,000
you must have been cheated by her.

240
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,400
I didn't.

241
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,680
I just

242
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,120
come to return your money.

243
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,440
I know nothing about it.

244
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,400
That day,

245
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,600
why did you go to the hotel?

246
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,640
Ma'am,

247
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,840
that day,

248
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,000
someone texted me

249
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,560
and told me to
get Mr. Mu's clothes for him.

250
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,920
I really didn't know anything.

251
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,800
Give me your phone.

252
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,720
My phone?

253
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,880
(It must be Song Ruoyun.)

254
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,960
Phone.

255
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,520
My phone.

256
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,440
You can't find it, can you?

257
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,840
People like you

258
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,680
always play this kind of trick.

259
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,080
You think you can get away with it
by softening people up.

260
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,960
Nanchen won't
pay attention to your little tricks.

261
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,360
But you can't fool aunty and me.

262
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,840
Your family is poor.

263
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,280
A little alms from us

264
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,080
are enough for you to live a life.

265
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
How can you not harbor evil intention?

266
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,600
We may know your appearance,

267
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,440
but not your nature.

268
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,240
Aunty,

269
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,920
let me take care of this.

270
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,880
Don't worry.

271
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,120
All right.

272
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,520
It wasn't me.

273
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,600
It really wasn't me.

274
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,960
Please do believe me.

275
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,680
No more sophistry.

276
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,640
Why not...

277
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,240
What a warm atmosphere.

278
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,320
Though my surname means "cold",

279
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,040
I like warm actually.

280
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,520
Mr. Leng,

281
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,040
This is Mu's Building.

282
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,000
As warm as it is,

283
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,840
you don't belong here.

284
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,920
I'm not here to see you.

285
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,840
I have an account

286
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,920
to settle with Miss Luo.
