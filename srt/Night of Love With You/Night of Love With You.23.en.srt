20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,400
Luo Qing.

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,720
Mu Nanchen?

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,040
What a coincidence.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,520
Are you here for dinner?

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:27,880
No.

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,480
I'm here to see you.

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,920
I thought we made it clear last time.

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,600
Mu Nanchen.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,720
You are very nice,

29
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,680
but I only see you as a friend.

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,440
The person I like is Leng Yehan.

31
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,160
And Leng Yehan also likes me.

32
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,960
Therefore...

33
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,520
You're right.

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,920
There's no need for a third party
in a relationship,

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,000
so just let him quit.

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,080
I didn't get it.

37
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,040
I went to see Leng Yehan.

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,840
I bought Song's Group

39
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,400
and promised him to be the CEO

40
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,560
as long as he leaves you.

41
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,960
He agreed.

42
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,480
Mu Nanchen.

43
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,840
Are you out of your mind

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,720
or suffered too much?

45
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,440
Luo Qing.

46
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
Mu Nanchen

47
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,960
just said he offered you the CEO

48
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,960
in exchange for me.

49
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,720
I think he...

50
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,680
What he said is true.

51
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,720
Wait.

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,480
What's going on with you guys?

53
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,840
When Mu Nanchen

54
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,240
made that offer,

55
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,320
I also thought I wouldn't say yes,

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,840
but I wavered.

57
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,320
I did like you before,

58
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,800
but what I need more
is power and status.

59
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,680
I've been plotting my revenge
for so long,

60
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,600
I'm not gonna give up like that.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,120
Leng Yehan.

62
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,520
What are you talking about?

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,240
Well,

64
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,000
you should go back.

65
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,120
Go back to him.

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,560
I also have my own things to do.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,640
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,960
Leng Yehan!

69
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,120
Leng Yehan!

70
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,400
What do you mean?

71
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,880
I don't believe you would do this.

72
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,080
You were willing to give up
everything you had.

73
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,840
You even...

74
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,240
How could you possibly accept
Mu Nanchen's offer?

75
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,800
What happened?

76
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,280
Tell me and we can

77
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,360
figure it out together.

78
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,880
Did I not make myself clear?

79
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,800
Nothing happened.

80
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,240
It's just that I'm calm now.

81
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,760
I realized I did those things

82
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,840
out of compulsion.

83
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,280
I want to go back to the way it was.

84
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,520
What's wrong with that?

85
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,080
No.

86
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,480
I know you.

87
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,760
You're not like this.

88
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,560
You don't know me that well.

89
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,880
Do you know anything about my past?

90
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,680
Do you know my obsession
with revenge?

91
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,240
You're the one

92
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,560
who sabotaged my plan.

93
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,520
You're the one

94
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,280
who made me give up everything.

95
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,200
You're the one

96
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,160
who took my meaning away from me.

97
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,960
Don't flatter yourself.

98
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,880
Nothing happened.

99
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,800
This is the way I am.

100
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Your arrival

101
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
is like a pebble

102
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
thrown into a pond.

103
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,800
I admit there were some ripples.

104
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,720
But when the last ripple disappears,

105
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,080
the pond is calm as normal.

106
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,240
I have a lot of things to do.

107
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,240
What happened before

108
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,200
is in the past.

109
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,400
No.

110
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,480
I believe you.

111
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,640
You won't do this to me.

112
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,280
Mr. Mu.

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,760
Don't forget what you promised me.

114
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,040
Of course.

115
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,000
We can sign the contract tomorrow.

116
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,480
No.

117
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,240
It's impossible.

118
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,840
Something must have happened.

119
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,320
He is not like this.

120
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,800
Luo Qing.

121
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,160
Stop fooling yourself.

122
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,480
He's gone.

123
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,400
What?

124
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,000
Why would you do that?

125
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,240
Luo Qing likes you so much.

126
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,360
Why would you hurt her?

127
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,560
She can only survive

128
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,200
when she gets back to you.

129
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,560
What do you mean?

130
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,640
You don't need to know.

131
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,880
Just remember

132
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,480
the plan I told you about.

133
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,040
But I don't want to hurt her.

134
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,440
I'm asking you

135
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
as your older brother.

136
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,440
You know what,

137
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,760
no matter how much injustice
I've encountered,

138
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,920
no matter how much
I've suffered in the past,

139
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,640
even if I've been living in the shadows

140
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,080
and living a life full of lies,

141
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,880
I've never envied you,

142
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,080
but I envy you now.

143
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,280
I can never exist for loving her.

144
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,920
It's the same for her.

145
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,600
He doesn't pick up, right?

146
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,920
Why would you lie to me with him?

147
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,360
I'm not lying to you.

148
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,320
It's impossible.

149
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,560
Something must have happened.

150
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,840
He must have a reason to do this,

151
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,880
but I don't have a clue.

152
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,440
Do you

153
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,000
trust him that much?

154
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,640
Luo Qing.

155
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,480
If you trust him that much,

156
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,640
you might as well do what he wants.

157
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,400
Perhaps

158
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,680
it will be good for both of you.

159
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,840
Go to bed early.

160
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,840
I'm a professional villainess.

161
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,000
How could I do what he wants?

162
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,920
Leng Yehan.

163
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,680
I don't like you making decisions alone.

164
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,480
I'll see

165
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,520
who is better, you or me?

166
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,320
Miss Luo.

167
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,880
It's not a good time, Miss Luo.

168
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,760
Please wait for a while, Miss Luo.

169
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,720
Wait...

170
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,200
Please

171
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,120
wait for a while.

172
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,840
There is a guest here.

173
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,360
Mr. Mu.

174
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,840
I failed to stop her.

175
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,560
Nanchen.

176
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,800
You didn't eat this morning.

177
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,440
I made this for you.

178
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,720
Have a taste.

179
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,400
Mr. Leng, you're also here.

180
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,880
Sorry to let you see this.

181
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,440
It's okay.

182
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,880
Nanchen.

183
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,640
This is my love for you.

184
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,440
Have a try.

185
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,200
Looks like Miss Luo's love

186
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
was blown up.

187
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,760
It's between me and Nanchen.

188
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
It has nothing to do with you, Mr. Leng.

189
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,960
Nanchen.

190
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,760
I won't bother you two then.

191
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,080
I have something to do.

192
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,720
I should leave.

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,920
Mr. Leng, you just signed
the contract today.

194
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,520
It's such a happy event.

195
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,280
Well,

196
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,520
aren't you going to celebrate it?

197
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,400
Why don't you

198
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,680
come to our place for a meal?

199
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,640
How's that?

200
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,640
No need.

201
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,040
Well,

202
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,720
are you afraid of something?

203
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,040
Of course not.

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,680
Well,

205
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,120
thank you, Miss Luo.

206
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,760
Mr. Mu!

207
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,400
What's wrong?

208
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,960
I made it according to the recipe.

209
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
You're not poisoned, are you?

210
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,960
Come on.

211
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,520
Let's go to the hospital.

212
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,080
What's going on?

213
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,920
I don't believe

214
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,120
you won't catch me
when you see me falling.

215
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,720
I'll do it.

216
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,120
Mu Nanchen!

217
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,000
You were trying to catch me.

218
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
That was out of habit.

219
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,840
Then I realized

220
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,720
Mr. Mu would take care of you.

221
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,280
I don't need to worry about it.

222
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:31,840
Luo Qing.

223
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,960
Are you okay?

224
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,000
It's raining.

225
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Mr. Leng, why don't you stay here?

226
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,240
No need.

227
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,040
I'm here

228
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,960
to tell Mr. Mu

229
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,160
that I'm going to leave Jiangbei

230
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,680
and never come back.

231
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,760
I have something to do.

232
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,880
I should leave.

233
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,800
Leng Yehan, what did you say?

234
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,480
Luo Qing!

235
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,600
Make it clear!

236
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,760
Luo Qing!

237
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,840
Leng Yehan!

238
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,840
Leng Yehan, open the door!

239
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,960
Why are you leaving?

240
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
Can you tell me

241
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,600
what happened?

242
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,840
Can you please not leave?

243
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,400
Leng Yehan!

244
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,840
Did I not make myself clear?

245
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,120
It's just you refuse to believe it.

246
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,480
Look into my eyes and tell me

247
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,600
you don't like me.

248
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,480
Tell me you were lying to me before.

249
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,080
I don't like you anymore.

250
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,030
Miss Luo.

251
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,880
Forget me.
