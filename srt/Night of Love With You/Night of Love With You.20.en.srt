20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,640
Do you know

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,360
why I came to save you?

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,640
I know.

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,440
Because you want to apologize.

24
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,960
What?

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,760
You were against me

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,280
because Song Ruoyun
threatened you to do it,

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,360
but you didn't want to.

28
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,520
That's the conclusion you have?

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,440
Well, it's kind of my fault.

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,680
If it weren't for my recording,

31
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
Song Ruoyun

32
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,200
wouldn't know about your identity.

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,160
I...

34
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,600
Luo Qing.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,080
I'm starving.

36
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,600
My brother-in-law.

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,880
You're awake.

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,640
Watch your mouth.

39
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,600
He saved my life, do you know it?

40
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,440
Call him Mr. Leng.

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,320
Mr. Leng.

42
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,680
The Group...

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,920
They froze my assets.

44
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,080
They're going to hold a meeting
to expel me

45
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,080
and take back everything I have, right?

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,720
I was prepared for everything

47
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,920
before I revealed myself.

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,800
There is no need to tell Luo Qing.

49
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,960
Let's go get something to eat.

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,120
However,

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,800
we can only grab a bite.

52
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,320
After all,

53
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,680
Mr. Leng is broke now.

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,280
Only I still have some money.

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,040
Who said I'm broke?

56
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,320
Didn't they freeze your money?

57
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,760
Mr. Leng has a spare card

58
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,360
for special occasions.

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,720
This is so like you, Mr. Leng.

60
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,560
We can't let Song Ruoyun

61
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
get away with what she did.

62
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,840
Don't worry about her.

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,080
I don't want to create more problems.

64
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,080
Otherwise, we could
be in bigger trouble.

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,480
Now we only need
to wait for the story to end...

66
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,720
Let's just wait

67
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,360
and it will be all right.

68
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,160
Luo Qing.

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,640
Can you tell me

70
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,160
the secret

71
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,760
about this world now?

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,640
Mr. Mu.

73
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,120
Do you still think
it's not Miss Luo who did it?

74
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,080
But Miss Song doesn't want you

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,880
to marry Miss Luo just as Mrs. Mu did.

76
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,840
How would she hurt Mrs. Mu?

77
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,560
Why is there a cup missing?

78
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,680
Nothing in this room

79
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,480
has been touched.

80
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,360
No.

81
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,480
I remember there were six cups
on this plate.

82
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,840
Why is one suddenly missing?

83
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,280
Go ask all the maids.

84
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,720
Yes.

85
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,880
And also,

86
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,640
don't reveal the cause of her death.

87
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,400
Yes.

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,920
Luo Qing.

89
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,200
I'm waiting for your answer.

90
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,160

91

What's happening now?

99
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,640
Get out of here first.

100
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,240
Let's split up.

101
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,780
(Jiangbei News Latest News Today)

102
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,600
Well, well, Luo Qing.

103
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,520
You are a murderer in this world.

104
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,120
Let me see where you can go.

105
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
Hello.

106
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,880
Did you see anyone suspicious?

107
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,680
No.

108
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,800
Are they gone?

109
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,520
Are you having a heart attack?

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,880
Well,

111
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,040
they have left.

112
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
I'll distract the saleswoman.

113
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,000
You get out when you can.

114

Sir.

115
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,480
When did you come in?

116
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Why didn't I see you?

117
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,920
Wrap this up for me.

118
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:34,920
Okay.

119
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:41,880
Sir.

120
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,120
May I have your phone number?

121
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,440
Why?

122
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,160
I wonder if you have a girlfriend.

123
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,200
I...

124
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,760
Honey.

125
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,080
Why does it take you so long?

126
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's go home now.

127
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,840
This young lady

128
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,960
looks a little familiar.

129
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,520
Let's go.

130

(Mu Nanchen: Mr. Leng,
I need to talk to you in person.)

(Mr. Leng, I need to talk to you.)
What's wrong?

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,200
Mu Nanchen wants to see me.

133
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,800
I'll go with you

134
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,760
and explain it to him.

135
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,960
No need.

136
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,320
You can't show up right now.

137
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,240
I'll go myself.

138
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,560
Mr. Mu.

139
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,920
The place has been cleared out.

140
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,160
You put the word out.

141
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,400
Is Luo Qing doing well?

142
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,600
It's none of your business.

143
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,720
Do you like her?

144
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,680
Luo Qing.

145
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,000
Does Mu Nanchen

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,040
really think you killed Mrs. Mu?

147
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,640
How do I know?

148
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,840
Do you believe I didn't kill Mrs. Mu?

149
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,040
Of course.

150
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,600
Although your personality
changed greatly,

151
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,280
from the previous

152
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,560
gentle

153
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,480
and simple Luo Qing

154
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,680
to

155
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,320
the domineering

156
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,480
and talkative Luo Qing

157
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,480
who beat and scolded me all the time

158
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,520
and abandoned

159
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,720
our family's good habit of thrift.

160
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,160
I'm ready to hear "but".

161
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,280
But,

162
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,560
you're just stubborn.

163
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,680
You might hit someone,

164
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,880
but you would never

165
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,200
kill someone.

166
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,600
Good.

167
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,400
You're not bad as a brother.

168
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,400
But,

169
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,120
Leng Yehan likes you.

170
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,720
What do you think?

171
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,040
How is it possible?

172
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
He doesn't have a love story.

173
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,320
There is no way he would like someone.

174
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,120
If he doesn't like you,

175
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,320
would he put your favorite dish

176
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,960
right in front of you?

177
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
If he doesn't like you,

178
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,120
would he give up everything

179
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,480
to save your life?

180
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
If he doesn't like you,

181
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,120
would he protect you at all costs

182
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,000
when everyone in Jiangbei
calls you a murderer?

183
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,640
Well,

184
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,000
do you like him?

185
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,920
I...

186
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,720
I only know

187
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,240
the person I should like is Mu Nanchen.

188
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,760
It's just there was an accident.

189
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,160
What about the person you truly like?

190
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,320
What does it feel like

191
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,320
when you like someone?

192
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,080
The two of you

193
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,160
are the worst students I've ever taught.

194
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,440
Yes.

195
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,680
I like her.

196
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
What's wrong with that?

197
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,320
What about her?

198
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,480
Does she like you?

199
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,240
All you need to know is

200
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,280
that you've lost the right
to care about her

201
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,880
when you hesitate for a moment.

202
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,560
I suspect

203
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
it's Song Ruoyun.

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,920
How clever.

205
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,640
But I don't have any proof now.

206
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,240
Take your personal seal

207
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,120
and invite her

208
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,920
to Jiangbei Hotel tonight

209
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,360
in the name of getting engaged with her.

210
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,040
Do you have a solution?

211
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,000
Just do it.

212
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,440
Mr. Leng.

213
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,320
Why did you ask him
to prepare those things?

214
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,720
The personal seal is useful.

215
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,080
Well,

216
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,120
why does it have to be
in the name of engagement?

217
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,600
He can also drop the idea

218
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,400
of marrying Luo Qing in this way.

219
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,940
(Jiangbei Hotel)

220
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,520
Nanchen...

221
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
Why are you here?

222
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,760
Miss Song, do you really think

223
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,880
Mu Nanchen will be engaged to you

224
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,760
after you killed Mrs. Mu?

225
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,200
That's what this is about.

226
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,960
Well,

227
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,760
Luo Qing is a murderer now.

228
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,840
Are you worried?

229
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,640
You kept saying

230
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,280
Mrs. Mu caught Luo Qing
stealing the personal seal,

231
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,640
but there are no fingerprints
of Luo Qing

232
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,280
on the seal at all.

233
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,600
How do you explain that?

234
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,200
Well, well, Leng Yehan.

235
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,960
Do you really think

236
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,400
I'm that stupid?

237
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,840
Earlier, you left the recording

238
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,960
(Delete all voice recordings)
so I got something on you.

239
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,480
(Deleting)

240
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,840
But I'm not as stupid as you are.

241
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,480
Luo Qing is a murderer.

242
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,560
No matter what you do,

243
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,720
you can't save her.
