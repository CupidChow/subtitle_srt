20

Miss Luo.

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,640
We meet again.

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,040
We can talk about this.

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,360
You got rid of me on purpose earlier.

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,600
I don't think

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,960
you want to talk with me.

26
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,120
Say it.

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,320
How do you know

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,200
I'm the illegitimate son
of the Mu family?

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,040
Who else

30
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,840
knows about this but you?

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,280
No one else.

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,880
Why?

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,080
Because

34
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,720
you are my cure.

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,720
I have a congenital heart defect.

36
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,920
When I have a heart attack,

37
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,640
the pain can only be relieved

38
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
by kissing someone

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,920
with the Mu family's genes.

40
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,800
I got better

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,720
after I kissed you at the hotel.

42
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,800
That's why

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,920
I speculated that you're
the Mu family's illegitimate son.

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,520
Miss Luo.

45
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Do you think I'm an idiot?

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,360
I'm telling you the truth.

47
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,720
I know you don't believe me.

48
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,520
How else

49
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,120
would I know such a big thing?

50
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,320
When will you have a heart attack?

51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,280
When the plot calls for it.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,280
I know how to prove it.

53
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
This kind of disease

54
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,960
is apparently for the romantic use

55
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,160
of the leading characters,

56
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,040
which means I'll have a heart attack
at a crucial moment

57
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,640
to move the relationship forward.

58
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,560
I've never had a love story,

59
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,720
but,

60
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,040
I've seen

61
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,600
how other people fall in love.

62
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,680
It's nothing but physical contact

63
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,800
and eye contact

64
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,640
in slow motion.

65
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,680
It's not that hard.

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,680
Hurry.

67
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,880
All right.

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,680
Stand right there and don't move.

69
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,980
♪My boy I want to be your round of moon♪

70
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,150
♪My boy
You're gonna take me to your world♪

71
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,200
You should put your arms around me.

72
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,520
Then we will make eye contact.

73
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,480
Falling

74
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,960
can give you palpitations.

75
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,960
Are you sick?

76
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,160
How can you fake an accident brazenly?

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,440
Where are you going?

78
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,280
You have to save me

79
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,040
and give me

80
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,600
mouth to mouth.

81
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,760
That's how they act.

82
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,400
I won't have to kill you

83
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,600
if you get hit by a car and die.

84
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,280
If you don't die,

85
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,760
maybe you will get sick.

86
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,240
Why would I save you?

87
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,720
Can we trust each other a little more?

88
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,080
Are you ready

89
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
to tell me the truth?

90
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:21,880
I...

91
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,240
Are you hungry?

92
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
Hunger

93
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,720
can also give you palpitations.

94
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't have time for this.

95
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,000
You'd better tell me the truth sooner.

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,920
I'm telling you the truth.

97
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,880
Aunt.

98
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,360
You should eat something at least.

99
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,560
(You have to take care of Nanchen now.)

100
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,520
(Mu's Group also needs you.)

101
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,520
Looks like

102
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,800
you do get under Song Ruoyun's skin.

103
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,640
Hush.

104
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,320
Don't talk.

105
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,040
I've never seen you so scared.

106
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,760
The difference between you two

107
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,880
is one wants me to die right now

108
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,360
and the other wants me to die later.

109
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,680
You're a good girl.

110
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,560
Mr. Leng?

111
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,720
(Aunt.)

112
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,120
(That's Mr. Leng from Leng's Group.)

113
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,840
(I'll say hi to him)

114
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,720
and come back to you later.

115
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,760
Mr. Leng.

116
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
We meet again.

117
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,360
Sorry that I offended you
earlier at the hotel.

118
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,800
I wonder

119
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,040
if you have seen

120
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,880
this person.

121
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,920
So what

122
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,360
if I have?

123
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,120
So what

124
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,360
if I haven't?

125
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,360
Feel free to let me know

126
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,680
if you have any leads.

127
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,880
I heard that your previous
partnership expired.

128
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,040
Were you going

129
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,840
to sign a contract with Mu's Group
at the hotel?

130
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,560
Well...

131
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,080
I'm not engaged

132
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,200
in the business.

133
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,920
If Song's Group works with Mu's Group,

134
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,680
you will no longer be my friend.

135
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,360
Mr. Leng, are you

136
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,240
threatening me?

137
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,400
This is called cooperation.

138
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you really have news about her?

139
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,880
Miss Song.

140
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,680
Is there anything else?

141
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,880
I...

142
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,840
You...

143
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Ruoyun!

144
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,560
Aunt Mu!

145
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,880
Aunt.

146
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,960
Are you okay?

147
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,640
I sprained my ankle.

148
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,720
Let me help you.

149
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
Mr. Leng?

150
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
Let's go, Aunt.

151
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,400
Let me help you.

152
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,360
I have reasonable doubt

153
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,120
that you're taking advantage of me.

154
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,920
I'm just taking my medicine.

155
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,320
Thank you for that.

156
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,240
You're reliable.

157
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,880
Do you really think I was helping you?

158
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,720
I just couldn't let Song Ruoyun see

159
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,000
I was in touch with you.

160
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,560
Otherwise,

161
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,760
I won't be able
to work with Song's Group.

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,080
Reasonable.

163
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,960
So,

164
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,280
is it really
because of your heart condition?

165
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,360
Do you believe me now?

166
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,200
Which means

167
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,240
as long as you can't talk,

168
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,080
no one else will know about me.

169
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,600
You...

170
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,800
What do you mean?

171
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,000
Only the dead

172
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,760
can keep a secret.

173
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,080
You...

174
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,720
You're not going to...

175
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,360
You're not...

176
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,600
(How do you know)

177
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,640
(I'm the illegitimate son
of the Mu family?)

178
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,520
I don't think you want to talk with me.

179
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,880
Say it.

180
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,440
How do you know

181
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,920
I'm the illegitimate son
of the Mu family?

182
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,360
Do you really think I'm a dumb girl?

183
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,840
I need to verify on my phone

184
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,000
every half an hour.

185
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,720
If I miss the verification,

186
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,680
this recording

187
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,000
will be automatically sent
to all media in Jiangbei.

188
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,960
Do you think they'll like it?

189
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,880
You're threatening me.

190
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,560
No.

191
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,400
This is called cooperation.

192
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,440
Miss Luo.

193
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,640
You are interesting indeed.

194
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,400
You'll provide me with food, clothes,
a place to live and means of traveling,

195
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,640
I'll

196
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,760
deal with

197
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,040
the verification message

198
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,000
on my phone

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,160
every half an hour.

200
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,320
I promise

201
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,920
no one else in the world
will know about it.

202
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,480
Isn't it a good deal?

203
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,640
Mr. Leng.

204
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,760
Do you want me
to take Miss Luo home or...

205
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,520
No need.

206
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,440
I'll stay at Mr. Leng's place today.

207
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,760
Right?

208
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,640
Mr. Leng.

209
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,720
Yes.

210
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,320
