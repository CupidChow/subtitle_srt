Miss Luo,

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,360
the wedding will start momentarily.

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,400
Please check if anything

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,680
needs to be modified.

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,040
It will?

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,760
Fine, then.

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,280
Hope the wedding will end quickly.

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,960
End?

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,080
Everyone wants

29
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,600
to marry Mr. Mu.

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,600
Why do you want it to end?

31
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,160
You must be Luo Qing.

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,080
I'm Nanchen's aunt.

33
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,320
I'm Nanchen's aunt, too.

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,480
I don't know

35
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,720
what makes Nanchen like her.

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,160
You must be the guys

37
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,680
who pick a quarrel before the wedding.

38
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,920
Come on.

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,160
Show me what you can do.

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,640
Mr. Leng, where are you going?

41
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,120
I'm waiting to watch the wedding

42
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,400
end up as a funeral.

43
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,440
How can you leave before it happens?

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,760
I will not kill her.

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,200
Can you give up your revenge?

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,160
If you don't care about your plan,

47
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,920
you can leave immediately.

48
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,400
I'm awaiting your good news.

49
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,120
Look. Look.

50
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,440
What a poor quality!

51
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,120
Is it...?

52
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,880
Is it really wearable?

53
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,360
(When Mu Nanchen is away,)

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,840
(it's just your bad luck.)

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,200
You haven't seen
this kind of material before?

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,280
Don't worry.

57
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,720
As long as you work hard,

58
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,000
you will afford the same dress.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,440
You...

60
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,280
What's wrong with you?

61
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
You must be Luo Qing
Nanchen talked about.

62
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,200
I thought you were so beautiful

63
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,400
that Nanchen fell in love with you.

64
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,400
But you turn out to be
such an ordinary girl.

65
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,160
I feel the same way.

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,920
You aren't as ugly

67
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,120
as Nanchen says you are.

68
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,320
All right.

69
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,760
I'm done talking with you.

70
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,760
(Transfer check of People's Bank of Jiangbei)
You aren't good enough for Nanchen.

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,200
You just want money, huh?

72
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,520
Fill in a number as you wish.

73
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,160
Seriously?

74
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,980
(Transfer check of People's Bank of Jiangbei)

75
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,200
(Transfer check of People's Bank of Jiangbei)
0.999 billion?

76
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,040
Luo Qing,

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,400
you're blackmailing us.

78
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,320
What?

79
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,280
You can't afford it?

80
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,640
All girls in Jiangbei

81
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,160
like Nanchen

82
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,800
and want to marry him.

83
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,440
You're neither rich

84
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,000
nor beautiful

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,040
at all.

86
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,360
But Nanchen is

87
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,520
the best CEO in Jiangbei.

88
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,920
The fortune of Mu's Group is

89
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,240
second to none.

90
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,040
What makes you a match for him?

91
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,160
You're right.

92
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,320
I have nothing.

93
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,240
But think about it.

94
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,600
Nanchen is rich.

95
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,560
But he's sick, too.

96
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,520
He can't touch women.

97
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,080
It's a world-class problem.

98
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,960
It takes a lot of trouble
to look after a patient.

99
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,080
It takes 10 points off him.

100
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,120
Besides,

101
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,800
Nanchen is from a rich family.

102
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,920
However,

103
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,840
he has a lot of
annoying relatives like you.

104
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,360
When dating, it's not a problem.

105
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,720
But in marriage,

106
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,760
the family background
must be considered.

107
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,400
It also takes

108
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,200
20 points off him.

109
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,560
After the calculation,

110
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,960
Nanchen is just qualified.

111
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,080
He barely deserves a good wife like me.

112
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,040
What are you talking about?

113
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,560
You know what?

114
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Don't dream to marry Nanchen...

115
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,720
What are you doing?

116
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,400
Nanchen,

117
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,600
why are you seduced by such a woman

118
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,040
instead of marrying Miss Song?

119
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,040
Say no more.

120
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,200
If you're here for my wedding,

121
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,160
you're welcome.

122
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,440
But if you're not,

123
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,400
please leave.

124
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,040
Your mother will not allow Luo Qing

125
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,320
to marry you.

126
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,840
It's my family stuff.

127
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,520
You don't need to bother.

128
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,000
Nanchen,

129
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,120
don't blame me.

130
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,720
I'm just too keen on marrying you.

131
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,080
So today,

132
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,080
you mustn't appear at the wedding.

133
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,720
So,

134
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,480
I have so few points?

135
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,720
You...

136
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,000
You heard me?

137
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,200
Luo Qing,

138
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,840
why

139
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,560
do I feel

140
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,160
that you're different
from what you were?

141
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,120
Well,

142
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,920
you must be overthinking.

143
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,320
Why do you insist on drinking espresso

144
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,680
even if it tastes so bitter?

145
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,400
I...

146
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,280
I don't know, actually.

147
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,960
Perhaps,

148
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,840
it can make me

149
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,240
stay awake and reasonable.

150
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,840
It's just your persona.

151
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,960
A CEO who only drinks espresso

152
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,920
will certainly look better

153
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,040
than one who only drinks milk tea.

154
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,280
What are you talking about?

155
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,840
After the wedding is over,

156
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,680
we will not remember each other.

157
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
Let me

158
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,520
kindly help you try something new.

159
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,720
Here.

160
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,840
Try some.

161
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,360
I don't need the sugar.

162
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,440
Trying some will not hurt you.

163
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,880
Maybe

164
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,680
you just don't know you like it.

165
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,080
How is it?

166
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,120
Coffee with sugar tastes good, huh?

167
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,240
Just so-so.

168
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,480
Mr. Mu,

169
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,960
the wedding is about to start.

170
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,080
All right.

171
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,400
It's time

172
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,480
to end everything.

173
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,360
It's a start, actually.

174
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,000
Mr. Leng,

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,080
what's wrong?

176
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Take the dagger away from me.

177
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,240
If you don't do
what Song Ruoyun asked you to,

178
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,680
she will make public your secret.

179
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,120
All our plans will be ruined.

180
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,360
Xiaoyun?

181
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,400
What are you doing here?

182
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,440
Mrs. Mu, I...

183
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,640
I know

184
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,360
you don't want Nanchen
to marry Luo Qing.

185
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,200
I don't want it, either.

186
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,720
Rest assured.

187
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,680
I've got a plan.

188
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,440
What plan?

189
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,960
It's Nanchen's seal

190
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,600
I stole from him

191
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,120
last night.

192
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,840
Later,

193
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,080
I'll ask Luo Qing here

194
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,640
and accuse her

195
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,880
of stealing the private seal

196
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,160
from Mu's Group.

197
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,360
I will stop

198
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,280
today's wedding,

199
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
at whatever cost.

200
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,600
Mrs. Mu...

201
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,800
Why do I suddenly feel dizzy?

202
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,360
Mrs. Mu.

203
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,400
Mrs. Mu, are you all right?

204
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,520
Mrs. Mu?

205
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,880
Mr. Mu,

206
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,210
Ma'am asked to see Miss Luo.

207
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,240
She isn't going.

208
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,640
The wedding is about to start.

209
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,080
Ma'am will not attend the wedding.

210
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,720
If you insist on marrying Miss Luo,

211
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,480
she'll break with you

212
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,920
and stop Miss Luo

213
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,440
from inheriting anything
from Mu's Group.

214
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,840
Fine, fine.

215
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,840
I'll just go.

216
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,760
Hurry.

217
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,520
You can't go.

218
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,640
If you go, she'll embarrass you.

219
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,040
Let me go with you.

220
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,960
No, no.

221
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,240
Let's not do anything unnecessary.

222
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,560
I'll end it quickly.

223
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,480
Mrs. Mu?

224
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,000
Mrs. Mu?

225
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,960
Where's she?

226
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,880
Everybody, thank you

227
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,680
for sparing your time

228
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,040
to attend Mr. Mu's wedding.

229
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,720
The wedding

230
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,040
officially starts.

231
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,620
(Mu Nanchen & Luo Qing)

232
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,640
No matter what Mu Nanchen values,

233
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,440
I will not let him have it!

234
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,220
