=Episode 10=

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,760
I have an account

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,720
to settle with Miss Luo.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,240
(What?)

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,040
(We're on the same side.)

24
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,760
(Don't say anything.)

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,380
I...

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,680
Aunty,

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,920
there's something I didn't tell you.

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,080
Mr. Leng and Luo Qing
have known each other before.

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,280
Leng Yehan was behind the plot

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,400
that was aimed at Nanchen.

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,080
Miss Song,

32
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,560
you're the guilty party
who files a suit.

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,280
Miss Luo,

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,120
do you have anything to say?

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,040
(Why can't I say a word?)

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,440
(Is it because I'm controlled)

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,440
(by the original plot of the cartoon)

38
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,320
(and I must do everything
according to the scene?)

39
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,520
I didn't.

40
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,120
It wasn't me.

41
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,920
Please believe me.

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,480
You're sharp-tongued usually.

43
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,440
Why do you lose your tongue
at this moment?

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,920
Cut the crap.

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
Take Luo Qing away.

46
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,520
You said Luo Qing knew Leng Yehan.

47
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,960
Do you have any evidence?

48
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,600
You philandered with me
and then tossed me off.

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,080
Don't think you can do

50
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,480
whatever you want with me
just because you're a president.

51
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,310
Let go.

52
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,840
I know her.

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,120
They have an inappropriate relationship.

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,920
(I'm doomed.)

55
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,440
(I have to blame myself.)

56
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,320
Mr. Song, you have a good memory.

57
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,360
That's exactly what I'm going to say.

58
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,040
We were having a good talk that day

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,560
when Luo Qing suddenly broke in and
interfered with us.

60
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,400
Wasn't that

61
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,040
plotted by Miss Song?

62
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,280
(That's a new idea.)

63
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,560
What are you talking about?

64
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,360
Everyone knows

65
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,960
you grew up with Mr. Mu.

66
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,200
While Mr. Mu was in the hospital,

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,160
you helped him in the dark,

68
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,480
and tried to sabotage our cooperation

69
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,400
with Song's Group.

70
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,760
It's a downright dirty calumniation!

71
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,160
Mr. Song,

72
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,560
this is the text message

73
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,860
(Mr. Song: Mr. Leng, Jiangbei Hotel, 2406)
I received it three months ago.

74
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,320
Someone used your phone
to ask me out.

75
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,440
Only when I got there,

76
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,520
I saw Miss Song

77
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,120
instead.

78
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,480
Xiaoyun,

79
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,040
did you touch my phone?

80
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,880
Dad,

81
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,840
I found

82
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,760
Leng Yehan and Luo Qing knew each other,

83
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,360
so I wanted to make it clear
by asking him.

84
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,880
But I really didn't see him that day.

85
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,040
Dad, you must believe me.

86
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,200
So that means

87
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,160
you've never

88
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,680
gone to the hotel.

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,040
Then why did I

90
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,800
feel giddy and light-headed after I
drank the wine

91
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,120
you poured for me?

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,840
The doctor told me

93
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,160
there was a fair amount of Sildenafil
inside my body.

94
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,240
Actually,

95
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,040
we've detected

96
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,900
a small amount of Sildenafil
in Mr. Mu's body.

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,400
Xiaoyun,

98
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,520
what

99
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,040
happened exactly?

100
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,160
Leng Yehan,

101
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,640
where is your evidence?

102
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,760
Everything you said

103
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,960
was pure speculation.

104
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,200
You and Luo Qing
went to the hotel together.

105
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,800
It had nothing to do with me.

106
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,120
So you won't admit

107
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,160
you went into my room and drugged me?

108
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,200
I didn't do it.

109
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,720
Miss Song,

110
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,600
does it look familiar?

111
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,320
Today, I'm

112
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,520
coming to

113
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,800
talk business with you, Mr. Leng.

114
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,960
This is the glass
you handed me that day.

115
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,520
If, as you said,

116
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,200
we didn't meet,

117
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,120
why are there your fingerprints

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,280
on the glass?

119
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,480
Why are there

120
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,560
drug residuals in the glass?

121
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,480
That can't be true.

122
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
That can't be true.

123
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,720
I wore gloves that day.

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,080
I...

125
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,120
Yes.

126
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,880
You remember clearly.

127
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,400
You wore gloves.

128
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,000
Actually, I didn't detect anything.

129
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,960
The glass

130
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,400
isn't from the hotel either.

131
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,200
Miss Song,

132
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,520
you yielded easily.

133
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,040
You...

134
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,880
(Leng Yehan did quite a good job.)

135
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,560
Mr. Song,

136
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,560
your daughter tried every means
to entrap me.

137
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,280
It seems that

138
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,640
I should have a good talk
with the press.

139
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,640
Dad.

140
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,760
Dad.

141
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,720
It wasn't me.

142
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,840
It really wasn't me.

143
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,320
You must believe me.

144
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:09,880
Dad.

145
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,320
Mr. Leng,

146
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,760
can I

147
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,280
have a private talk with you?

148
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,480
As for Miss Luo,

149
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,400
after I was drugged,

150
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,760
she was sent in.

151
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,600
I think

152
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,000
it was Miss Song's usual tricks,

153
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,760
to drug a man

154
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,680
and send a woman into his room.

155
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,520
Did you

156
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,000
harm Nanchen too?

157
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:30,920
No.

158
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,800
Aunty.

159
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,400
Aunty, you must believe me!

160
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,240
Nanchen,

161
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,080
I've liked you since I was a child.

162
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,400
(It seems to be over soon.)

163
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,360
I won't do anything that may hurt you.

164
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,520
You drank the drugged water
by mistake.

165
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
So he was dizzy,

166
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,920
poisoned and paralyzed.

167
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
To prevent me from telling the truth,

168
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,040
you tried every means to kill me.

169
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,640
(Finally!)

170
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,480
Xiaoyun,

171
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,440
I'm really disappointed in you.

172
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,160
It seems that

173
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,360
I misunderstood you.

174
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,680
You were our servant.

175
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,760
That's why you know me.

176
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,080
I thought

177
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,280
you were one of those women
who tried to approach me.

178
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,520
(It was an accident, okay?)

179
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,600
(Who would)

180
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,240
(seek a relationship
at the expense of her life?)

181
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,880
Why are you here?

182
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,280
I come to

183
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,680
return your money.

184
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,440
(My money.)

185
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,320
It's for your medical expense.

186
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,960
What I need are dignity

187
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,280
and an apology

188
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,720
instead of your stinky money!

189
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,320
You rich people think

190
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,240
you can buy everything with money.

191
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,000
Tell you what,

192
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,880
it isn't true!

193
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,520
(Help!)

194
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,280
(Can I pay the author
to stop updating?)

195
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,640
You

196
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,200
are more special
than anyone I've ever met.

197
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,150
(Special impaired brain?)

198
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,120
In that case,

199
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,360
I won't force you.

200
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,240
But

201
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,520
what's your relationship
with Leng Yehan?

202
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,120
I have nothing to do with him.

203
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,840
Leng's Group

204
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,200
rose rapidly in three years.

205
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,560
They aim at Mu's in all respects.

206
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,720
They're definitely hatching something.

207
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,040
You'd better stay away from him.

208
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,200
I get it.

209
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,720
Xiaoyun has been spoiled by me
since childhood.

210
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,960
- She...
- Mr. Song,

211
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
I can let go

212
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,640
what Miss Song did to me.

213
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,840
But business

214
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,080
depends on give-and-take.

215
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,000
I want your contract,

216
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,920
and I want her
not to hurt Luo Qing again.

217
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,080
Mr. Leng,

218
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,360
you're really frank.

219
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,160
I know what you're thinking about.

220
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,960
But

221
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,440
if I reveal the whole thing,

222
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,560
I don't know

223
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,480
what would happen to Miss Song,

224
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,080
but the stock price of Song's Group

225
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,800
is bound to fluctuate violently.

226
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,200
OK.

227
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,800
Deal.

228
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,140
(Elevator)

229
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,440
What do you want?

230
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,080
Go home with me.

231
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,640
I have a lot of questions to ask you.

232
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,440
I

233
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,320
won't go back.

234
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,840
So in the last three months,

235
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,400
you've not only got involved
with Mu Nanchen,

236
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,520
but also got a quieter personality.

237
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,640
Leng Yehan,

238
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,160
thank you for helping me today.

239
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,400
But

240
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,680
I have my own apartment.

241
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
I won't go back with you.

242
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,360
You saved me and I helped you.

243
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,840
Let's call it even.

244
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,560
Miss Luo, are you going to
distance yourself from me?

245
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,680
No.

246
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,320
Anyway,

247
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,280
we both have our own missions.

248
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,560
I can't make it clear to you.

249
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,080
Do you think I'll allow you

250
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,440
to stay with Mu Nanchen

251
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,440
with my secrets?

252
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,920
Oh, that.

253
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,160
Rest assured.

254
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,080
I'll never tell anybody.

255
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,760
I don't trust anyone in this world.

256
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,040
If you choose to leave today,

257
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,840
you're choosing to be my enemy.

258
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,680
I don't know how to explain this.

259
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,240
The story has officially begun.

260
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
You and Mu Nanchen are enemies.

261
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,680
Mu Nanchen and I,

262
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,760
we...

263
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,400
How do I put it?

264
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,560
We're destined for each other.

265
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,520
You and I...

266
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,880
I can't make it clear.

267
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,880
You mean,

268
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
from now on,

269
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,920
we're even,

270
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,240
and you

271
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,800
choose to be with Mu Nanchen?

272
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,120
Goodbye.

273
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,320
Leng Yehan.

274
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,160
Luo Qing.

275
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,520
Leng Yehan,

276
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,560
bye.

277
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,680
Mr. Leng,

278
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,840
I got the contract.

279
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,120
Implement it immediately.

280
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,480
Don't leave Mu Nanchen any chance.

281
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,040
Yes.

282
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,760
Congratulations, Mr. Leng.

283
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,480
The contract

284
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,680
is destined to be ours.

285
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,080
Nothing is destined.

286
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,080
I gained it by advancing gradually.

287
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,240
I never believe
there's a destined thing.

288
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,160
Mu Nanchen and I,

289
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,000
we...

290
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,280
How do I put it?

291
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,040
We're destined for each other.

292
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,480
Let's see,

293
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,320
with me standing in your way,

294
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,000
can you still
be destined for each other?

295
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,520
What's happening again?

296
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,200
Little snail.

297
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,280
Be careful of the rain.

298
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,840
(What?)

299
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,080
(I don't have an umbrella myself.)

300
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,040
(Who cares about a snail?)

301
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,040
Luo Qing,

302
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,960
