21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,240
The monitoring data was destroyed
before the wedding.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,360
Luo Qing!

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,360
Are you still going to deny it?

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,680
You're framing me!

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,920
If it's not for the sake of the seal,

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,520
why did you propose to marry Nanchen

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,000
all of a sudden

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,720
and then change your mind?

29
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,600
Do you have a better reason?

30
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,080
You wanted to steal the seal
of Mu's Group.

31
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,880
Aunt Mu

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,440
discovered your plan by chance,

33
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,320
so you killed her to keep her quiet!

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,840
Nanchen.

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,920
Don't be fooled by him.

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,520
Otherwise,

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,280
the board of Mu's Group

38
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,680
won't let it go easily.

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,640
You're a jinx!

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,160
Why do you freeze up at this time?

41
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,440
Let me take a look.

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,080
You don't believe me?

43
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,920
No one here believes you.

44
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,960
I do.

45
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,880
No matter how big Mu's business is,

46
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,120
you can't convict someone
without evidence.

47
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,560
Mr. Leng, you meddle in

48
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,040
the affairs of Mu's Group at this time,

49
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,800
does Leng's Group have anything

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,240
to do with the theft
of the personal seal?

51
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,080
Mr. Leng.

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,920
Do you want to be friends

53
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
with a murderer who killed Mrs. Mu?

54
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,440
There's no hard evidence yet.

55
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,800
Miss Song,

56
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,880
it's too early to say that.

57
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,400
Leng Yehan.

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,000
Are you sure you want to help her?

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
You don't have to threaten me now.

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,200
Your hands aren't clean

61
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,280
in the theft of the personal seal.

62
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,640
If it's said out loud,

63
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,920
it will do no one good.

64
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,960
Fire! Fire!

65
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,760
Go! Go!

66
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,720
Mr. Mu.

67
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,720
What should we do?

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,760
Catch Luo Qing first.

69
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,280
Yes.

70
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,960
I dare you!

71
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,400
Get out of the way.

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,160
You can't take her away!

73
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,400
Mr. Mu, in what position

74
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,880
are you talking to me?

75
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,160
She's my fiancée.

76
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,640
Mr. Mu, as the president of Mu's Group,

77
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,640
how could you not know

78
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,040
the definition of fiancée?

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,520

How are you feeling now?

82
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
I don't know what happened to me.

83
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,880
It's Song Ruoyun.

84
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,120
The doctor will be here soon.

85
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,200
Your associative ability
is still as good as ever.

86
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,440
Did you mean what you said

87
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
at the wedding?

88
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,160
What?

89
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,960
You mean

90
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,920
I said I like you.

91
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,000
I just made up an excuse.

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,720
That would be the best.

93
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,840
Well,

94
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,040
don't be mad.

95

It was emergent.

96
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,120
I did need your help.

97
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Why should I be mad?

98
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,680

99
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,720

do you have any other symptoms?

101

No.

102
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,520
We need to run specific tests

103
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,200
to know the details.

104
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,440
Where is Doctor Liu?

105
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,760
Doctor Liu is on a business trip.

Please come with me
to run the tests first.

I'll wait for you outside.

114

You left it in the car earlier.

00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,680
(Song Ruoyun is up to?)

120
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,000
Doctor, it looked like
you were eating in a hurry.

121
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,000

124

I feel there's something wrong.

126

Did you get the doctor here?

00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,880
No.

130
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,440
I ran into him in the hallway.

131
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,920
Before I said anything,

132
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,800
he said he would come soon
after he got ready.

133
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,600
How did he know Luo Qing's name then?

What's in it for you?

173
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,160
The benefit is

174
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,520
you'll be trapped here.

175
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Leng Yehan.

176
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,400
Once you sign the contract,

177
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,320
your secret will be buried forever,

178
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,360
and you can

179
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,000
take revenge soon.

180
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,560
Luo Qing.

181
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,120
Luo Qing will die for sure.

182
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,720
Here is a piece of friendly advice.

183
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,800
Stick to the schedule

184
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,400
and go along with it.

185
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,560
This is your fate.

186
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,920
Stay out of Luo Qing's business.

187
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,480
Otherwise,

188
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,080
you will die for sure.

189
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
What's wrong, Mr. Leng?

190
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,840
Are you not feeling well?

191
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
You killed Mrs. Mu

192
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,280
and blamed it on me.

193
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,000
Yes.

194
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,520
So what?

195
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,160
Song Ruoyun.

196
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,560
Are you out of your mind?

197
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,560
You actually killed people

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,320
just to get Mu Nanchen?

199
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,200
Wrong.

200
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,000
I killed her

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,120
not for Nanchen.

202
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,640
I killed her

203
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,280
because I wanted you dead.

204
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,280
It's a pity

205
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,760
that Leng Yehan saved you.

206
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
Well,

207
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,520
you can drop the idea

208
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,160
that Leng Yehan
will come to your rescue.

209
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,680
What happened to him?

210
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,920
He?

211
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,720
He's doing well.

212
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,800
Thanks to your recording,

213
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,200
I've been able to threaten him

214
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,520
to work for me.

215
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,640
It's always been you.

216
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,040
I was such a fool

217
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,080
trying to turn you against Nanchen.

218
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,680
What good would that do?

219
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,400
I should just kill you

220
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,440
and everything will be over.

221
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,640
In your dream!

222
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,400
Go ahead.

223
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,000
If you don't kill me,

224
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
I'm going to kill you.

225
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,720
Don't think I dare not!

226
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,720
Can the leading role

227
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,400
kill people?

228
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What did you say?

229
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,600
I think

230
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,960
only supporting roles can kill people.

231
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,320
You took my life away from me.

232
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,080
Now you should give it back to me,

233
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,640
