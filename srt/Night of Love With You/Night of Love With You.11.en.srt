Luo Qing,

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,680
what are you doing here?

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,840
I find these snails

23
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
very pathetic.

24
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,120
They're crawling so hard.

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,480
I want to keep them out of the rain.

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,320
I didn't know

27
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,040
you were such a kind girl.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,440
(Does this make me kind already?)

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,480
(Is this guy)

30
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,240
(out of his mind?)

31
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,520
(Snails can only come out)

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,280
(on rainy days, right?)

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,200
(Anyway, I haven't eaten snails
for a while.)

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,840
(When can this story be over?)

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,200
(If I'm still the supporting role,
I won't be in love.)

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,800
(But I'll at least live a good life)

37
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,280
(and have good taste in clothing.)

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,680
Do you want to eat this?

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,920
Yes.

40
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,720
No, no, no.

41
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,680
I mean...

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,080
How could we eat snails?

43
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,240
I criticize this behavior

44
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,560
in sharp words.

45
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,640
You turn out to be so cruel.

46
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:23,720
I...

47
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:34,840
Hurry.

48
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,680
For Table No. 12.

49
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,400
The poor leading role

50
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,400
indeed takes part-time jobs everywhere.

51
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,640
Why was I tripped on flat ground?

52
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,480
Do you know how much this bag is worth?

53
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,280
A girl like you

54
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,560
can never afford this bag.

55
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,680
You!

56
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,760
Sorry, sorry.

57
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,800
I'll compensate you.

58
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,560
(How I miss the days
when I could stump the leading role!)

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,280
Compensate me?

60
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,040
Can you?

61
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,640
Even your life isn't as expensive as it.

62
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,120
How about this?

63
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,640
Kneel

64
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,960
and clean this bag.

65
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,760
And for the rest...

66
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,600
We'll see later.

67
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:11,960
I...

68
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,120
(Darn it!)

69
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,680
(Isn't she way out of line?)

70
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,080
Okay.

71
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,200
(Crying?)

72
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,440
(Crying won't help with anything.)

73
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
(Fight back!)

74
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,600
Wait.

75
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,760
(It's the first time
I find Mu Nanchen so useful.)

76
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,640
This pen is

77
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,200
a global limited edition.

78
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,120
It's ten times

79
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
more expensive than your bag.

80
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,160
Are you

81
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,120
Mr. Mu of Mu's Group?

82
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:47,880
I...

83
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,120
It's OK.

84
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,160
You didn't mean that.

85
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,880
I don't blame you.

86
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,520
(She didn't mean that?)

87
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,280
(How phony)

88
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,520
(this leading role is!)

89
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,960
I didn't expect you to be so tolerant.

90
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,680
I won't let Mu Nanchen miss the fun.

91
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,160
What are you doing?

92
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,560
My bag!

93
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,880
This pen is worth ten of your bags.

94
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,600
You still owe me nine.

95
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,520
Take this

96
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,360
as the interest.

97
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,280
You...

98
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,840
Use the rest of the money

99
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,320
to buy more bags

100
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,960
as compensation for your empty brain.

101
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,800
And I...

102
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,200
I'm the bigger person

103
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,400
and won't ask for your compensation.

104
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,040
After all,

105
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,680
in your brain,

106
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,240
there's nothing, but rubbish.

107
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,000
Bravo!

108
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,840
Thanks. Thanks.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,880
Mu Nanchen?

110
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,040
I didn't know you just pretended
to be tolerant.

111
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,040
Mu Nanchen!

112
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,680
Mu Nanchen!

113
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Let me explain.

114
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,720
It's you again.

115
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,080
Leng Yehan,

116
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,000
did you not understand
what I said last time?

117
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,320
Why do you always mess with me?

118
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,440
What's in it for you?

119
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,240
Right.

120
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,080
We cooperated once.

121
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,600
But that is all over.

122
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,400
You know my secret.

123
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,480
The closer you get to Mu Nanchen,

124
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,120
the riskier it is for me.

125
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,400
How can I remain indifferent?

126
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,360
I've made my point.

127
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,400
I don't want to repeat it.

128
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,080
Why do you have two faces?

129
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,880
What are you talking about?

130
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,160
I don't understand.

131
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,160
Why do you look

132
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,800
aggrieved and pitiful?

133
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,240
You're supposed to do anything possible

134
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,720
just to protect yourself.

135
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,880
What?

136
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,640
We haven't met for three months.

137
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,560
And you've changed so much?

138
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
And why must you
get close to Mu Nanchen?

139
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,760
What on earth are you up to?

140
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,920
I've got too much confusion about you.

141
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,080
Before you explain to me,

142
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,520
I will not let you

143
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,880
get close to Mu Nanchen.

144
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,920
I can't explain.

145
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,000
You just need to know

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,040
that Mu Nanchen and I are
on the same track.

147
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,120
It's destined in this world.

148
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,400
No one can change it.

149
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,880
You like him?

150
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,760
It's my destiny to like him.

151
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,480
There's no such thing
as destiny in this world.

152
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,880
You just don't know it.

153
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,200
Every one of us comes to this world

154
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,560
to complete his mission.

155
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,880
You're here to take revenge,
for example.

156
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,920
And I...

157
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,120
I have to be with Mu Nanchen.

158
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,160
No one can resist destiny.

159
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,800
I'm asking you the last time.

160
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,560
You will be against me,

161
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,160
right?

162
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,600
The story has begun.

163
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
It won't stop.

164
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,680
It won't change, either.

165
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,520
You know

166
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
what I will do.

167
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,080
Mr. Leng,

168
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,000
Miss Luo...

169
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,080
Don't bring her up.

170
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,560
Whoever wants to help Mu Nanchen

171
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,680
will be doomed!

172
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,400
Why do I feel so weird?

173
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,920
Do I

174
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,520
really take him as my friend?

175
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,840
It isn't right.

176
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,760
He's the villain

177
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,840
and I'm the leading role.

178
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,240
He wants to take revenge

179
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,560
and I'll have sweet love.

180
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,760
He'll even kill me in the end.

181
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,680
He's the villain

182
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,560
who never has any feelings.

183
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,080
What am I thinking?

184
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,840
He and I just cooperated

185
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,160
because we had to.

186
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,000
That's right.

187
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,600
I must distance myself from him.

188
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,620
(Handmade steamed buns
Delicious and cheap)

189
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,120
Who are you?

190
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,160
Why do you steal things

191
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,080
at such a young age?

192
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,520
Give me money.

193
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,360
I don't have money.

194
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,200
Let go of me.

195
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,840
Wait.

196
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,160
(Oh, I see.)

197
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,960
(It must be another plot
to show my kindness.)

198
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,280
(I will pay the bill for the boy.)

199
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,920
(When Mu Nanchen happens to see it,)

200
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,120
(he'll be touched.)

201
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,960
(I'm indeed adapted
to being the leading role.)

202
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:28,960
You...

203
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,680
How could you bully such a boy?

204
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,000
(What?)

205
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,160
He stole your steamed bun.

206
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,520
But he's just a hungry boy.

207
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,920
Why are you so cruel to him?

208
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,320
Can't you see
that he had nothing to eat?

209
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,640
Then pay the bill for him.

210
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,280
I...

211
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't have money.

212
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Then do you want me
to give it to him for free?

213
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,480
Why can't you show any sympathy?

214
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,360
He's just a boy.

215
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,880
(Help.)

216
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,480
(What a stupid girl!)

217
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,560
(The boy stole something.)

218
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,920
(Why am I persuading the owner
to show some sympathy?)

219
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,280
A boy mustn't steal anything.

220
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
I'll give you a lesson.

221
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,840
Go, go, go.

222
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,800
Stop!

223
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,680
You two, stop!

224
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,360
Stop!

225
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,920
- Mind your own business!
- Stop.

226
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,120
My steamed bun dropped.

227
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,880
How dare you be angry with me?

228
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,840
Don't you think you can get your way

229
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,160
just because you're a little boy.

230
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,880
Poverty isn't the excuse
to steal things.

231
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,320
Stealing

232
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,880
with no regrets?

233
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,480
I...

234
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,120
What's wrong with me?

235
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,960
(So, it's the hero-saves-beauty plot.)

236
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,840
Mu Nanchen,

237
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,520
help me.
