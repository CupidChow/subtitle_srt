=Episode 21=

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,520
Well, well, Leng Yehan.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,160
Do you really think

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,920
I'm that stupid?

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,200
Earlier, you left the recording

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,140
(Delete all voice recordings)
so I got something on you.

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,980
(Deleting)

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,600
But I'm not as stupid as you are.

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,360
Luo Qing is the murderer.

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,360
No matter what you do,

29
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,560
you can't save her.

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,800
Roofie was found in Mrs. Mu's body.

31
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,880
You said Mrs. Mu

32
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,320
caught Luo Qing
stealing the personal steal,

33
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
and then she pushed Mrs. Mu by accident.

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,000
That means

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
it was essentially

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,760
an accident.

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,440
Then why would Luo Qing

38
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,520
drug Mrs. Mu in advance?

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,600
You should

40
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,240
ask the killer this question.

41
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,400
Leng Yehan.

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,440
I advise you
not to waste your time with me.

43
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,080
You should spend more time

44
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,000
talking to Luo Qing.

45
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,680
After all,

46
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,040
she doesn't have much time left.

47
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,520
Leng Yehan.

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,120
You're ruthless and cold.

49
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,640
Do you really like Luo Qing that much?

50
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,800
It's none of your business.

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,840
You all like Luo Qing.

52
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,720
It's a pity

53
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,320
you only like her

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,000
because she's the leading role.

55
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,160
You don't really like her.

56
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,040
Luo Qing.

57
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,000
What are they talking about?

58
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,000
Shh.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
Be quiet.

60
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,880
You can't even explain

61
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,920
why you like her.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,120
I don't know why I like her.

63
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,040
All I know is

64
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,360
I will miss her

65
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,440
when she is not around.

66
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,360
I will get upset

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,520
when I see her with someone else.

68
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,160
I was willing to give up the plan
I'd prepared for 17 years

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,160
when I learned she was in danger.

70
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,360
I said that to him.

71
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,200
Shh.

72
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,680
One day you will laugh at yourself

73
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,360
for saying that.

74
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,720
You are smart.

75
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,720
You deleted the monitoring data.

76
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,240
Unfortunately, you were

77
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,280
too pressed for time to check it.

78
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,160
Here is

79
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,960
the repaired data.

80
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,360
What do you think

81
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,080
Mu Nanchen will do

82
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,600
when he sees it?

83
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,360
It's impossible.

84
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,960
The data can't be repaired.

85
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,160
Do you dare to make a bet?

86
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,520
Do you dare to risk

87
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,160
being found out by Mu Nanchen?

88
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,520
Don't try to fool me.

89
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,400
You care so much about Luo Qing.

90
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,960
If you have any proof,

91
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,600
you will give it
to the police right away.

92
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,440
If I give it to the police directly,

93
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,280
how would I appreciate

94
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,640
the angry look on your face?

95
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,920
Mu Nanchen is on his way here.

96
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,800
You

97
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,440
don't have much time left.

98
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,360
Give it to me!

99
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,000
Well,

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,880
aren't you too impatient?

101
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,240
I warned you.

102
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,840
If you leave that place,

103
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
the only result for you is death.

104
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,920
I'd like to see

105
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,360
who will die first,

106
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,760
me or you.

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,280
It must be you!

108
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,040
Nanchen.

109
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,400
Let your sweetheart, Nanchen,

110
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,920
have a good look

111
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,400
at what lunatic looks like.

112
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,760
Nanchen.

113
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,880
It's Leng Yehan!

114
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,440
He was trying to hurt me.

115
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,920
He's bent on bringing down Mu's Group.

116
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,600
You mustn't believe what he said.

117
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,160
By the way,

118
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
there's nothing in here.

119
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,840
You were right.

120
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,040
The date can't be repaired.

121
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,040
The recorder

122
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,600
was meant for you to find out

123
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,000
to let your guard down,

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,640
so we could go to your house

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,480
and get the key piece of evidence.

126
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,520
Miss Song.

127
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,640
We extracted Mrs. Mu's DNA

128
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,240
and your fingerprints

129
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,200
from a cup at your place.

130
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,480
The hitman you hired has been arrested.

131
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,520
You're also suspected of directing others
to kidnap and murder.

132
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,680
Please come with us.

133
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,840
Nanchen.

134
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,320
Do you know

135
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,200
we're supposed to be together?

136
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
It's Luo Qing
who took everything from me!

137
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,840
Song Ruoyun!

138
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,000
I hope this is the last time we meet.

139
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,520
Song Ruoyun.

140
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,920
Just stay in jail

141
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,200
till the story ends.

142
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,520
Do you start to have feelings
for Leng Yehan?

143
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,960
It's none of your business.

144
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,440
Do you think

145
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,440
you can live to the end of the story?

146
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,760
What do you mean?

147
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,920
Do you remember

148
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,000
what the guy
from Comic Book Centre said?

149
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,040
In a word, don't create new plots.

150
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,680
Meaningless things

151
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
are not allowed to exist
in the world of comics.

152
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,880
When someone

153
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,080
loses the meaning
of his existence in the story,

154
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,080
he will be gone forever.

155
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,760
Let's vote by a show of hands.

156
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,320
I warned him.

157
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,240
Once he forces himself
to leave that scene,

158
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,480
he will die.

159
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:52,800
Okay.

160
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,640
The vote is unanimous.

161
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,800
Leng Yehan is removed
from the presidency.

162
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,440
(Leng's Group)
(The only way to free himself)

163
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,920
from the control of the scene
is to give up his revenge,

164
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,920
but he exists for revenge.

165
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,240
That means he

166
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,600
gave up the meaning of his existence
in the story.

167
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,680
Do you know Leng Yehan
and Mu Nanchen are brothers?

168
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,160
Who is Leng Yehan?

169
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,880
I don't know.

170
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,400
Kevin.

171
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,640
I think something
is going on over there.

172
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,720
Let's take a look over there.

173
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,840
Everything about him

174
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,480
will be completely forgotten.

175
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,440
What am I going to do?

176
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,560
Leng Yehan

177
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,720
can only exist by hurting you.

178
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,000
Once he starts to love you,

179
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,120
he is destined to vanish.

180
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,280
No.

181
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,000
It won't be like this.

182
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,960
(Comic book)

183
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,760
(world.)

184
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,320
There will be a new meaning
for his existence.

185
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,000
Right.

186
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,760
I'm the leading female character.

187
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,160
If the leading female character
likes him,

188
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,240
his existence will be meaningful.

189
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,760
Yes.

190
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,000
That's true.

191
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,680
But do you know what it feels like

192
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,840
when you like someone?

193
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,360
Luo Qing.

194
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,440
When you start to fall in love,

195
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,160
it's doomed that you can't exist
at the same time.

196
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,280
What do you mean?

197
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,760
What do you mean by that?

198
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,640
Take your time

199
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,960
to figure it out.

200
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,480

201
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,000

Luo Qing.

204
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,520
Are you okay?

205
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,000
Hurry.

206
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Go find Leng Yehan.

207
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,440
You and Kevin split up to find him.

208
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,640
Kevin?

209
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Who is Kevin?

210
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,040
Do you still remember Leng Yehan?

211
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,360

213
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,320
It does sound familiar.

214
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,360
Who is he?

215
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,800
He is still here.

216
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
He must be here.
