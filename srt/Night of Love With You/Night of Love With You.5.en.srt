20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,440
Leng Yehan!

21
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,400
Leng Yehan, you womanizer!

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,760
What are you doing here?

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,000
I can't believe you abandoned me.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,320
Just because you're a president,

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,760
it doesn't mean you can do
whatever you want to me.

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,400
Let go!

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,000
It looks like

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,040
Mr. Leng has quite a private life.

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,240
The entertainment reporters in Jiangbei
must like you a lot.

30
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,040
Mr. Song.

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,000
It's a misunderstanding.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,680
Mr. Leng, you should
explain to the reporters later.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,760
Mr. Song!

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,680
Do you think the Gu family
is all about integrity?

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,120
(Don't come here again.)

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,640
(You don't belong here.)

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,000
Mr. Mu is an upright man.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,640
I watched Nanchen grow up.

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,520
He has been an excellent child
from an early age.

40
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,840
Mr. Leng, you should care more about

41
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,920
your own life.

42
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,360
You...

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,320
How can you be so cruel?

44
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,440
You pushed me.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,280
Do you know

46
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,040
I'm carrying

47
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,440
your baby?

48
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,320
How disgraceful.

49
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,080
Don't contact me again.

50
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,840
Do you want to die?

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,920
How do you know that?

52
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,440
Come on.

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,080
Please.

54
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,320
Do you think I dare not do this?

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,120
How come?

56
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,240
Could it be

57
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,000
you're afraid of me?

58
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,560
Why don't you kill me?

59
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,960
You even threatened me earlier

60
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,160
to stay alive.

61
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,240
Now you want me to kill you suddenly.

62
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,360
Why?

63
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,440
I...

64
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,880
It's not like that.

65
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,840
Do you think I'm stupid?

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,040
No.

67
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,960
Why should I trust you?

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,600
You think I'll keep you alive

69
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,320
or kill you as you wish.

70
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,600
Miss Luo.

71
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,360
If you want to die now,

72
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,880
I'll just keep you alive.

73
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,560
No.

74
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,280
Mr. Leng!

75
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,920
Let's talk about it.

76
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,680
Dad.

77
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,440
How is it?

78
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,360
Well, well, Leng Yehan.

79
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,720
What's wrong?

80
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,920
Mr. Leng is begging to work with us.

81
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,240
There is no reason he would
upset you on purpose.

82
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,280
I'm not gonna

83
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,240
work with him.

84
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,240
Let's go to the hospital.

85
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,200
I told Aunt Mu

86
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,280
that you will

87
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,400
go to see Nanchen today.

88
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,660
Okay.

89
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,080
How come Luo Qing
and Leng Yehan are together?

90
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,200
What?

91
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,320
Nothing.

92
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,280
Let's talk about it.

93
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,560
If you hold your temper like this,

94
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,000
you will get sick.

95
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,920
I'm fine.

96
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,720
Miss Luo.

97
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,720
Be my guest.

98
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,560
Mr. Leng.

99
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
Let's talk about it.

100
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,160
Hello.

101
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,660
(Jiangbei)

102
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,880
I'm trying to save you now.

103
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,240
None of this will happen

104
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,560
if the story starts over.

105
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,700
(Block the calling number)

106
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,800
(Sorry.)

107
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,400
(The subscriber you dialed is busy.)

108
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,480
(Please redial later.)

109
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,080
I think

110
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,120
she blocked me.

111
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,200
How is that possible?

112
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,880
Is she your biological sister?

113
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,840
I also have doubts now.

114
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,440
We're kidnappers.

115
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,880
I'm confused now.

116
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,040
Hello.

117
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,520
Boss.

118
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:25,920
Okay.

119
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,640
I see.

120
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,600
We will complete the task.

121
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,440
Mr. Leng.

122
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,280
I washed your clothes.

123
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,360
But,

124
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,560
I think

125
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
it must cost you a lot.

126
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,440
It's okay.

127
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,680
It's Kevin's.

128
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Is the important information

129
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,040
all destroyed?

130
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,440
Mr. Leng, you must be very angry now.

131
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,000
It's okay.

132
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,720
I have

133
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,720
plenty of computers.

134
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,520
Luo Qing!

135
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,760
I think I accidentally

136
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,280
touched the pipe.

137
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,160
Are you furious right now?

138
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,240
Do you want to kill me badly?

139
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,840
Don't worry.

140
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,160
Any problem in this house can be solved.

141
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,800
You didn't do it on purpose.

142
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,000
How could I blame you?

143
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,080
How did I miss

144
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,360
that you are such a good-natured man?

145
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,080
Well?

146
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,240
Do you want to stay

147
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,880
and watch me take a bath?

148
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,160
Who wants to watch you take a bath?

149
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,160
Really?

150
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,200
Why don't you stay

151
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,000
and have a look?

152
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,520
What are you doing?

153
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,640
I reconsidered.

154
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,760
I've never seen such a scene before.

155
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,960
I don't want to waste this chance.

156
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,040
Usually,

157
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,520
only the leading female role

158
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,800
has such scenes about catching a man
taking a bath by accident.

159
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,640
I've never

160
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,000
seen this before.

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,680
That's why

162
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,720
I decided to stay and enjoy this

163
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
in case I won't have another chance.

164
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,120
Stingy.

165
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,360
Leng Yehan

166
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,200
is a callous

167
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,840
and decisive character.

168
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,120
Why is it so hard for him to kill me?

169
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,900
(Send to media)

170
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,080
I'm not going
to finish the verification.

171
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,720
Your secret is about to go public.

172
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,720
Miss Luo.

173
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,880
Feel free to do it.

174
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,360
I mean it.
I won't finish the verification.

175
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,040
Isn't that secret
what you care about the most?

176
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,360
Because what you want

177
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,000
is not exposing my secrets.

178
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,540
(Send to media)

179
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,000
Miss Luo.

180
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,600
Good night.

181
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,960
You changed the lock.

182
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,920
Of course.

183
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,840
It's because you sneaked into
my room last night.

184
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,880
You sleep on the floor.

185
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,080
Why should I sleep on the floor?

186
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,120
You broke the lock.

187
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,680
You should take the consequences.

188
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,960
Unless,

189
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,560
you want to sleep with me.

190
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,440
Well,

191
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,120
do you expect me to be shy and angry

192
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,720
and to sleep on the floor?

193
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,320
I won't.

194
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,200
Good night.

195
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,720
Mr. Leng.

196
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,560
I've never seen
such a shameless woman like you.

197
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,160
Now you've seen it.

198
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,320
You're welcome.

199
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,400
Why?

200
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,480
Because I'm trying to sleep

201
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,320
Why do you want me to kill you?

202
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,280
I don't.

203
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,440
If you want to die,

204
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,880
you can go to Song Ruoyun.

205
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,480
I'm sure she would be happy

206
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,440
to fulfill your wish,

207
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,120
but you didn't do that.

208
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,640
You don't just want to die.

209
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,160
You want me to kill you in person.

210
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,480
Why?

211
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,920
I also want to ask you.

212
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,080
I can cancel the verification.

213
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,880
After you kill me,

214
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,680
you'll still have plenty of time
to crack my code.

215
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,080
Why don't you do it?

216
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,760
I don't do things without answers.

217
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,440
As long as you tell me the real reason,

218
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,400
I'd be happy to do you this favor.

219
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,400
You wouldn't believe me
even if I tell you.

220
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,320
How do you know

221
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,000
without giving it a try?

222
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,720
Because

223
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,560
everything can start over in this way.
