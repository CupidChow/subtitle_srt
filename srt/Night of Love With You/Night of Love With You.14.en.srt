20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,480
Miss Song, I don't think you come

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,280
to bring me any good news.

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,640
Not at all, Mr. Leng.

23
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,160
I want to see Nanchen tonight.

24
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,880
But lately,

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,480
he's annoyed for losing the contract
with Song's Group

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,520
and doesn't want to see me.

27
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,880
I wonder

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,160
if you can do something about it.

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,320
Miss Song, do you think

30
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,920
I have to solve your boring love problem

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,160
simply because you know my secret?

32
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,520
Mr. Leng, you exaggerated it.

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,960
Don't be too nervous.

34
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,360
How about

35
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
I share the contract of Song's Group

36
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,320
with Mu's Group?

37
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,160
If Mr. Mu asks about the reason,

38
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
I'll tell him

39
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,280
that you tried many times
to persuade me.

40
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,120
Mr. Mu

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,840
will be grateful to you, then.

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,640
Are you serious?

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,240
However,

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,400
you always want to defeat Mu's Group.

45
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,360
Why would you share the contract?

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,000
Before I take revenge,

47
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,160
I should keep myself safe first.

48
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,040
You have something on me, anyway.

49
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,160
I don't dare to neglect your request.

50
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,080
Then I'll be waiting

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,800
for you to take Nanchen to me.

52
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,520
Mr. Leng, your guess is correct.

53
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,280
Song Ruoyun came by herself.

54
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Song Ruoyun is crazy about Mu Nanchen.

55
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,960
She won't be satisfied

56
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,040
just by sowing dissension

57
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,200
between Mu Nanchen and Luo Qing.

58
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,240
Mu's Group is in big trouble.

59
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,760
When we offer to share the contract

60
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,720
with Mu Nanchen,

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,040
he'll accept it.

62
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,840
When it's time for delivery,

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,120
the products of Mu's Group

64
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,480
will have a serious quality problem.

65
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,880
We will

66
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,520
save the critical situation

67
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,360
and acquire Song's Group directly.

68
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,240
Mu's Group

69
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,920
will be finished for good.

70
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,840
Song Ruoyun knew my secret by accident.

71
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,720
I'll just make the best of the mistake

72
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,520
and achieve two things at the same time.

73
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,240
(Seriously?)

74
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,800
(So,)

75
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,200
(I just can't fall
when I'm near the leading role.)

76
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,600
What on earth do you want?

77
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,840
I want you to marry me.

78
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,720
Are you out of your mind?

79
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,320
You're destined to be with me.

80
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,720
Mr. Mu, quite interesting, huh?

81
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,120
Mr. Leng,

82
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,920
it's your second time visiting me.

83
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,240
Why do I owe this pleasure?

84
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,800
I came

85
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,400
for business, of course.

86
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,880
Give us some room.

87
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,320
I don't know

88
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,440
what business we can do.

89
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,160
I plan to cooperate with you

90
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,800
on the overseas order of Song's Group.

91
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,320
(Can Leng Yehan be this kind?)

92
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,120
(Oh, I see.)

93
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,200
(It must be a plot for his revenge.)

94
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,120
(Later,)

95
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
(there must be a lot of boring plots)

96
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,400
(so that I can't jump to the ending.)

97
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,800
(Come on.)

98
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,400
(In a sweet comic,)

99
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,960
(only he's following
the plot seriously.)

100
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
Umm...

101
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,240
Luo Qing,

102
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,840
why are you still here?

103
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,560
I realize that Secretary Qiao is

104
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,960
nowhere to be seen again.

105
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,720
So,

106
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,160
I should stay here

107
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,480
and serve you the drink.

108
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,120
Go on with your conversation.

109
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,960
Ignore me.

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,480
What do you think, Mr. Mu?

111
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,440
Mr. Leng,

112
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,440
it took you a lot of trouble
to get such a big order.

113
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,960
Why do you suddenly
want to cooperate with us?

114
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,560
Mr. Mu, don't reject it so quickly.

115
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
In business,

116
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,560
there's no...

117
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,280
Mr. Mu,

118
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,080
why can't I find any sugar?

119
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,640
I never drink coffee with sugar.

120
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,760
In business, there's no eternal enemy.

121
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,160
To be honest,

122
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,760
the date of delivery is approaching.

123
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,440
I'm not...

124
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,880
What would you like,
Mr. Leng, tea or coffee?

125
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,440
Neither.

126
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,400
Stop asking questions, Miss Luo.

127
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,280
Fine.

128
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,080
I'm not confident enough

129
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,720
to guarantee such large shipments.

130
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,320
Besides...

131
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,960
Oh, how stupid I am!

132
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,080
Mr. Leng,

133
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,760
shall I take you to the hospital?

134
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,200
It doesn't hurt at all.

135
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,680
Besides,

136
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
Miss Song kept visiting me.

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,200
She sounded like

138
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,920
she cared so much about you.

139
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,240
Then I plan

140
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,120
to cooperate with you,

141
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,480
and satisfy the three parties.

142
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,840
Mr. Mu, don't worry

143
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,440
about whether I'm up to anything else.

144
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,760
Here.

145
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,560
It's my sincerity.

146
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,400
Luo Qing!

147
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,560
I... I didn't mean that.

148
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,120
Mr. Leng,

149
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,640
the contract thing

150
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,840
doesn't need to be done hurriedly.

151
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,760
I won't see you out.

152
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,880
Miss Luo,

153
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,000
didn't you offer
to take me to the hospital?

154
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,720
I can't drive.

155
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,880
Mr. Leng,

156
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,840
why don't you go by yourself?

157
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,880
This isn't how you treat a visitor!

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,840
Miss Luo, instead of thinking about

159
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,160
how to steal the seal,

160
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,360
you kept disturbing me, huh?

161
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,480
I...

162
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

163
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,560
You're a cunning girl.

164
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,120
You were obviously upsetting my plan.

165
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,080
What?

166
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,800
Trying so much to protect Mu Nanchen?

167
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,000
Why must I protect him?

168
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
Because you want to marry him.

169
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,240
Right.

170
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:44,960
Why?

171
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,120
Here we are.

172
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,640
We should...

173
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,920
Can you answer my question now?

174
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,120
What...

175
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,000
What does it have to do with you?

176
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,640
Like I said,

177
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,360
in three days,

178
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,400
I'll give you an adequate answer.

179
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,840
Today is just the first day,

180
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,560
isn't it?

181
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,240
Last time, you asked me to kill you.

182
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,360
Now you want to marry Mu Nanchen.

183
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,800
Why do you always solve problems,

184
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,120
devoid of logic?

185
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,080
Why do you seem to know a lot of things?

186
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,840
Why do you keep talking about destiny?

187
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,160
Who decides destiny?

188
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,280
Why must you be my enemy?

189
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,080
What must you

190
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,440
marry Mu Nanchen?

191
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,160
It's a long story.

192
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,280
Anyway,

193
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,200
I don't blame you
for kidnapping Luo Cheng.

194
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,400
You have your things to do

195
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,480
and I have mine.

196
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,440
If...

197
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,840
If I'm in your way,

198
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,040
I can't change it.

199
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,040
Anyway,

200
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,600
everything will be over soon.

201
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,920
This isn't the answer!

202
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,000
I want to marry Mu Nanchen

203
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,840
because...

204
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,360
Because I like him.

205
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,440
Why

206
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,080
do I feel a little bit sad?

207
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,800
Mr. Leng, you have no reason

208
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,880
to take away my girl from my company.

209
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,640
You're right, Mr. Mu.

210
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,760
I will not take away

211
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,400
your girl.

212
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,240
I heard you just now.

213
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,960
What?

214
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,120
It turns out you like me.

215
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,320
I was

216
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,920
just kidding.

217
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,120
Fine.

218
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,480
Now that you sound so sincere

219
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,760
and I don't want to exchange my marriage

220
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,120
for benefits from Song's Group,

221
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,160
I agree

222
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,560
to marry you.

223
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,800
Seriously?

224
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:00,640
Good.

225
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,920
Let's hold the wedding tomorrow.

226
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,600
Tomorrow?

227
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,640
What's the hurry for?

228
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,240
Because...

229
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,720
You're way too handsome

230
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,000
and I can't wait.

231
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,000
You made sense.

232
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,520
Where's Nanchen?

233
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,160
Why hasn't he come?

234
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,120
He has no reason
to reject this cooperation.

235
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,440
He didn't reject it.

236
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,520
That's great.

237
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,680
But I'm afraid

238
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,360
your wish

239
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,280
could hardly come true.

240
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,640
Nanchen.

241
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,160
Luo Qing?

242
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,360
Why are you pestering Nanchen again?

243
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,520
Don't be so rude to her.

244
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,480
Why?

245
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,760
We decided to get married in a hurry.

246
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,520
But I should propose to you.

247
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,560
It's considerate of you.
