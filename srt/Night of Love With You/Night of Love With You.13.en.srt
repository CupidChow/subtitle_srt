20

What's all this about?

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,360
Luo Cheng?

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,240
Luo Cheng. Luo Cheng.

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,400
Miss Luo.

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,400
Leng Yehan?

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,800
I need you to do me a favor.

26
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,760
Well,

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,000
you can say no.

28
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,360
However,

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,040
your brother

30
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,400
will suffer more next time.

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,280
Are you...?

32
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,120
Mu Nanchen

33
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,440
always carries a private seal.

34
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,920
Steal it from him

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,960
and exchange it for your brother's life.

36
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,880
What?

37
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Listen carefully.

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,320
You have only three days.

39
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,440
Looks like

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,840
your plot has finally begun.

41
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,880
In three days,

42
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,160
if you fail to steal it

43
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,080
or

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,200
if you spill the beans,

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,880
your brother will die.

46
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,520
Even you

47
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,000
will die, too.

48
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,120
This is what I told you.

49
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,600
Once the story begins, it never stops.

50
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
I can do it for you.

51
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,000
But,

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,960
I want a word with Luo Cheng alone.

53
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,960
Luo Cheng.

54
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,840
Luo Cheng.

55
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Sister?

56
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,440
Leng Yehan...

57
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,240
Don't bother to say anything.

58
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,200
I know what happened.

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,920
I'll ask him

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,200
to take care of you
in the following three days.

61
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,040
Don't be afraid.

62
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,960
In three days,

63
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,600
everything will be over.

64
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,080
What three days?

65
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,320
What did he ask you to do?

66
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,120
Don't bother.

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,680
I know what to do.

68
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,920
Sister,

69
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,760
I'm sorry.

70
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,360
You're always threatened because of me.

71
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,320
I seem to be your burden.

72
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,960
You're my brother.

73
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,390
But why are you far uglier than me?

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,800
All right.

75
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,120
Don't overthink.

76
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,520
It's not your problem.

77
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,320
(You just exist)

78
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
(to offer me reasonable motives.)

79
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,240
All right.

80
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,800
I should go.

81
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,120
Sister,

82
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,360
watch out for Leng Yehan.

83
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,040
I thought he would marry you.

84
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,360
But he turned out to be a villain.

85
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,080
Marry me?

86
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,920
Stop the nonsense.

87
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,480
I'm telling the truth.

88
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,240
He used to have feelings for you.

89
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,160
Why did he suddenly want to hurt us?

90
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,320
You're just a boy.

91
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Do you know what love is?

92
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,000
You do?

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,160
Of course.

94
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,080
Body touch.

95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,000
Eye contact.

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,920
Slow motion.

97
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,640
What are you talking about?

98
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,000
Love is...

99
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,800
Why are you like Leng Yehan?

100
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,720
In your world,

101
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,920
don't you have
the right explanation for love?

102
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,240
He doesn't have it, of course.

103
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,080
Anyway, stay away from him, huh?

104
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,600
I'm leaving.

105
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,880
Sister,

106
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,440
I no longer want to be your burden.

107
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
Are you done?

108
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,480
See?

109
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,400
Like I said,

110
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,560
we're destined to be enemies.

111
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,040
After Luo Qing steals the seal

112
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,320
and her crime is disclosed,

113
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,920
Nanchen will believe

114
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,760
that she is a commercial spy

115
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,360
and they'll never be together.

116
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,480
Mr. Leng,

117
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,960
this way you can get his private seal.

118
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,360
Isn't it great?

119
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,160
Why wearing a long face?

120
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,320
Forget it.

121
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,040
Hope there's good news

122
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,320
when we meet again.

123
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,400
Nanchen,

124
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,120
your marriage with Xiaoyun...

125
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,600
Mom,

126
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,680
haven't I told you already?

127
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,320
I've got a girlfriend.

128
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,800
Cooperating with the Song family
through marriage

129
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,080
is our best choice.

130
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,280
Luo Qing

131
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,160
can bring you no benefits.

132
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,240
Do you think you can defend our company

133
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,280
just by your personal preferences?

134
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,040
When is marriage linked

135
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,800
to benefits?

136
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,280
Just like this cup of espresso.

137
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,600
It tastes bitter.

138
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,840
But it makes you

139
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,480
know clearly

140
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,360
that you're the CEO of Mu's Group.

141
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,720
It's how it benefits you.

142
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,920
Think it over.

143
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,480
Mr. Leng,

144
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,400
you're finally awake.

145
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,520
Mr. Leng,

146
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,800
you've got no traumas.

147
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,840
Nothing is wrong

148
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,880
with your body, either.

149
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,480
What happened last night?

150
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,000
Why did you faint without a reason?

151
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,280
I don't know.

152
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,760
Seems like

153
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,520
when I don't want to do something,

154
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,680
some kind of power

155
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,600
faintly forces me to do it.

156
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,160
Mr. Leng,

157
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,000
don't joke with the doctor.

158
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,520
Doctor,

159
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
is this a kind of disease?

160
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,320
I've never heard about it.

161
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,360
Maybe you're under too much stress.

162
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,560
Just take a good rest.

163
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,680
Mr. Leng,

164
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,120
we just signed the contract
with Song's Group

165
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,240
and you can take your revenge

166
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,640
very soon.

167
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,000
So, you must be

168
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
under too much stress.

169
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,200
Taking revenge?

170
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,320
Is it the only meaning of my life?

171
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,040
Mr. Leng,

172
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,440
since you were nine,

173
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,920
you've only cared about taking revenge.

174
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,880
You said

175
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,040
that you would see Mu's Group
fall from power

176
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,760
and make Mu Nanchen lose everything,

177
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,600
at whatever cost.

178
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,920
Nothing could stop you.

179
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,600
Right.

180
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,120
Nothing could stop me.

181
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,560
I believe I can make a change.

182
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,800
If I steal the seal,

183
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,880
Mu Nanchen will misunderstand me.

184
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,800
When I refuse to explain,

185
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,320
we'll misunderstand each other.

186
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,560
I'll be aggrieved

187
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,160
and he'll feel sorry.

188
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,480
How annoying!

189
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,480
The villain wants me

190
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,000
to follow the original plot.

191
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,280
No way.

192
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,840
I'm gonna be done with this.

193
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,320
You want me to steal the seal
in three days.

194
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,960
I'll then marry Mu Nanchen
in three days,

195
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,680
put an end to the story,

196
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,760
and complete my mission.

197
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,120
To seduce the leading role, huh?

198
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,920
I'm good at that.

199
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,200
But look at my dresses.

200
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,120
Aren't they way too plain?

201
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,760
Mr. Mu.

202
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,160
Luo Qing?

203
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,760
What brings you here?

204
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,840
Today,

205
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,880
I came to thank you

206
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,160
for helping me out in the cafe that day.

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,520
Did you just rent

208
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,760
your arms or legs?

209
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,760
Don't you think

210
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,880
my dress is

211
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,040
of...?

212
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,360
Of poor quality?

213
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,520
The clothes are for you.

214
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,840
Stop wearing

215
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,360
those poor-quality dresses.

216
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,720
It's not right.

217
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,720
Why isn't he seduced at all?

218
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,680
How can I have a happy ending with him?

219
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,200
Oh, right.

220
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,400
In the comic world,

221
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,280
the leading roles always kiss
after they fall.

222
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,800
Then they'll get married.

223
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,040
Mr. Mu,

224
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,960
wait for me.

225
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,560
Are you all right?

226
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,560
What?

227
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,240
What the heck!

228
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,940
(Team of Teams)

229
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
This time,

230
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,480
I'll succeed.

231
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,160
Seriously?

232
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,080
So,

233
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,480
I just can't fall
when I'm near the leading role.

234
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,720
What on earth do you want?

235
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,400
I...

236
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,440
I want you to marry me.

237
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Are you out of your mind?

238
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,040
You're destined to be with me.

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,880
Mr. Mu,

240
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,640
quite interesting, huh?
