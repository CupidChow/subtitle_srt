20

You wouldn't believe me
even if I told you that.

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,960
We won't find out

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,560
unless we try.

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,120
Because

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,840
it'll all start over again.

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,840
Who do you think is the fool here?

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,640
You or me?

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,240
I told you that you wouldn't believe me.

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:29,920
Time to sleep.

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,480
Your parents died of a car accident,

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,800
leaving you in a one-million debt.

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,480
In order to keep your brother in school,

32
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,320
you dropped out of school,

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,400
had several jobs
so you could pay off the debt.

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,400
Everybody says you're pure
and have a good heart.

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,440
You said all those

36
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,600
just to let me know

37
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,400
that you know everything about me.

38
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,680
And then what?

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,680
But as far as I know, you're cunning.

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,480
You'd trade your reputation.

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,720
You'd make threats.
You'd perform coercion.

42
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,920
You'd do anything

43
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,480
to achieve your goal.

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,400
Yet,

45
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,600
what exactly is your goal?

46
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,680
You're exaggerating it.

47
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,440
I

48
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,680
am but an ordinary pretty girl.

49
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,440
Is your purpose

50
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,200
of saying these to

51
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,240
get close to me?

52
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,480
Have you

53
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,840
fallen in love with me?

54
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,720
You think I'd stop asking questions

55
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,240
after you say this?

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,840
Or are you telling me

57
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,440
that all of your strange behaviors

58
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,960
are your way of approaching me?

59
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,360
Have you, Miss Luo,

60
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,880
fallen in love with me?

61
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

62
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,680
I need to sleep.

63
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,480
I have nothing but time

64
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,080
to wait for your answers.

65
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,160
You forgot your key...

66
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,240
You look

67
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,200
very much like a bad guy.

68
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,000
A good guess.

69
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,600
So we need to push our project forward

70
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,480
now that Mu Nanchen isn't around.

71
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,560
But Song's Group won't budge.

72
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,040
Once Song's Group and Mu's Group
sign the contract,

73
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,800
they won't be surpassed in ten years.

74
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,440
Mr. Leng.

75
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,640
This is Mrs. Mu's latest offer.

76
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,560
First-hand info.

77
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,200
Did Luo Qing do anything today?

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,480
Relax, Mr. Leng.

79
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,840
It was my mistake

80
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
that she undermined Mr. Song's lunch.

81
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,720
I promise it won't happen again.

82
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,840
I've informed the security guards
to forbid her from entering the building.

83
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,040
Who allowed you to do that?

84
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,200
I'd like to see

85
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,080
how she'll make me take action.

86
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,760
Mr. Song declined our invitation

87
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,200
using his illness as an excuse.

88
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
It looks like

89
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,160
he's determined to wait
for Mu Nanchen to be back.

90
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,880
Mr. Leng?

91
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,240
The building is open to anybody, right?

92
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,040
Yes.

93
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,440
I've given the order.

94
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,160
How come it's been so quiet up till now?

95
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,240
What?

96
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,440
Mr. Leng,

97
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,600
it looks like someone
kidnapped Miss Luo.

98
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,520
But it's a good thing.

99
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,600
For what it's worth,

100
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,080
she's gotten rid of.

101
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,120
Mr. Leng. Mr. Leng.

102
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:51,920
Sister.

103
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:52,960
Sister.

104
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,280
Sister.

105
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,800
Sister.

106
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,240
You're awake at last.

107
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,560
Are you okay?

108
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,640
Right.

109
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,560
You can't speak, either.

110
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,680
I thought…

111
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,560
She still managed to find me.

112
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,080
You're automatically untied?

113
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,560
To make it look good,

114
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,440
the female lead

115
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,640
cannot be tied tightly.

116
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,560
As for you,

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,960
I think these are all impossible knots.

118
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,240
Sister.

119
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,600
I thought you had abandoned me.

120
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,920
You came to my rescue at last.

121
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
I…

122
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,920
I am here to rescue you.

123
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,000
They have been really mean
to me these days.

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,200
How do we get out of here?

125
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,440
Sister,

126
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,360
I opened it.

127
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,720
Let's go.

128
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,640
You…

129
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,520
You leave first.

130
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,200
No.

131
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,120
I am a man.

132
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,560
How can I leave before my sister does?

133
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,240
You go first.

134
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,480
Just go.

135
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,320
You need to check
if there's a mud pool down there.

136
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,440
If there is,

137
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,240
I may as well stay in the warehouse.

138
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,000
Sister,

139
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,280
you seem different.

140
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,640
Stop talking.

141
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,160
Hurry up.

142
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,720
We need to get out of here.

143
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,360
OK.

144
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:16,840
Sister,

145
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,800
nothing down here.

146
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,280
Come on.

147
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:18,960
OK.

148
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,880
I can't move.

149
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,800
Come here, Sister.

150
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,680
I'll get you out.

151
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,360
Is it because I, the heroin,

152
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,400
have to be rescued by the hero?

153
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,960
The scene has kept me here.

154
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
What are you talking about?

155
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,600
Hurry up.

156
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,080
Hurry.

157
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,600
But my protagonist

158
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,720
is now a vegetable.

159
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,840
Who would come to my rescue?

160
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,080
Oh, no.

161
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,920
They escaped.

162
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,360
Luo Cheng.

163
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:51,920
You!

164
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,560
Go down there.

165
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,850
Luo Cheng.

166
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,480
Luo Qing.

167
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,360
You won't get out of here alive.

168
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,560
I'm only allowed to move
in this direction?

169
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,440
Whatever.

170
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,240
Luo Qing.

171
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,040
(No way.)

172
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,920
(Again?)

173
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,000
