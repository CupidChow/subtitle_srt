00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,980
=Episode 8=

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,120
I do know where Luo Qing is,

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,000
and I can let you have her.

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,760
But can you

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,360
make decisions
on behalf of Song's Group?

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,080
I'm not in charge
of company business,

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,040
but Daddy always loves me.

26
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,800
It's just one contract.

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,280
It won't be difficult.

28
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,160
Before, Song's Group
basically monopolized Jiangbei,

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,240
but Mu's Group caught up

30
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,640
in only a few years.

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,240
Now that Mu Nanchen is in charge,

32
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,200
Song's Group has lost
most of the market.

33
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,040
It looks like

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,600
Song's Group

35
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,440
will lose the entire Jiangbei as well.

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,360
Are you suggesting

37
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,520
that I can't keep my promise?

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,200
Mr. Song is a discreet businessman.

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,480
The stock price of Song's Group
is volatile at the moment.

40
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,520
I don't believe

41
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,560
Mr. Song would choose
a business partner

42
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,520
based on your personal preference.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,480
I'm afraid

44
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,960
you have overrated yourself,

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,840
and underestimated me.

46
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,640
So he doesn't agree

47
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,880
because he isn't happy with the term.

48
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,840
Good for you, Leng Yehan.

49
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,240
No matter who Song's Group
signs the contract with,

50
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,480
we wouldn't like

51
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,680
to make enemy with anyone
in the business circle.

52
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,920
Mr. Leng,

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,040
we are in the same class.

54
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,440
Are you sure about

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,120
having a conflict with me

56
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,800
for Luo Qing, a part-timer
who works in Mu's Group?

57
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,080
Please tell me, Miss Song,

58
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,200
why would you trade
your family business

59
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,280
for this part-timer?

60
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,680
It's because she tried
to commit murder for money.

61
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,000
She may look pure and fragile
on the surface,

62
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,760
but deep down,

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,440
she's a climber.

64
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,120
Song Ruoyun

65
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,760
is a pure villain.

66
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,040
She doesn't look pure and fragile to me.

67
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,760
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

68
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,920
This man.

69
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,680
What's with his sneer?

70
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,560
(Mr. Leng,)

71
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,240
(so you refuse to work with me?)

72
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,520
Yes.

73
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,720
He cannot

74
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,200
be this good.

75
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,320
You've returned, Miss Song.

76
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,680
I didn't expect you to be so upright.

77
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,880
What are you doing here?

78
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,680
I was worried that Song Ruoyun

79
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,760
would lose her mind and kill you.

80
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,760
You were worried about me?

81
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Of course, I was.

82
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,960
After all, you saved my life.

83
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,320
I'm not a woman

84
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,400
of much conscience,

85
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,480
but I'm not entirely heartless.

86
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,240
She isn't capable of harming me.

87
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,760
Don't underestimate her.

88
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,800
She's right, actually.

89
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,560
Mr. Leng,
you really should listen to her.

90
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,320
Did you leave something behind,
Miss Song?

91
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,760
Must be your ignorance,

92
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,120
arrogance

93
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
and foolishness.

94
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,040
Luo Qing,

95
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,400
you think you're safe

96
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,840
under Leng Yehan's wing?

97
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,120
Mr. Leng,

98
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,920
you really think you're capable

99
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,320
of acting against Song's Group?

100
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,200
Song Ruoyun,

101
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,520
don't you think I don't know

102
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,000
it was you who drugged the food

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,160
that Mu Nanchen accidentally ate.

104
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,000
There's no reason for me to harm him.

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,040
You think people will believe

106
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,280
whatever you say?

107
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,560
Soon, it'll be swarmed with paparazzi.

108
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,480
They will take pictures

109
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,040
of you two having an affair.

110
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,320
It'll be reported in news

111
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,200
that you and Leng Yehan
knew each other long ago.

112
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,000
Leng's Group

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,240
has always been
Mu's Group's competitor,

114
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,080
so Leng Yehan

115
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,680
implanted his follower

116
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,520
to work as a janitor in Mu's Group

117
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
in order to harm

118
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,480
their president when the time comes.

119
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,600
How do you

120
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,760
like this motive?

121
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,760
You're a wonderful script-writer

122
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,840
yet no one plays any role for you.

123
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,320
Let's go.

124
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,840
Leng Yehan,

125
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,520
what's the matter with you?

126
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,760
Leng Yehan.

127
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,760
You drugged the alcohol.

128
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,680
You honestly thought

129
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,560
I asked you here to talk business?

130
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,280
I planned it all out.

131
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,360
You

132
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,800
are the runaway perpetrator

133
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,240
while you're the culprit

134
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,840
behind the whole thing.

135
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,160
Mu's Group will make you pay.

136
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,560
So will

137
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,840
Song's Group.

138
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,760
Mr. Leng,

139
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,000
by then, Leng's Group
will be finished overnight.

140
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,920
How do you contend with me anymore?

141
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,600
Since you persistently act against me,

142
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,240
then I shall

143
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,920
end you both.

144
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,920
Song Ruoyun.

145
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,520
Luo Qing,

146
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,960
you saw

147
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,920
how powerful the drug was,
didn't you?

148
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,040
Song Ruoyun,

149
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,000
you're crazy!

150
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,040
Enjoy the pleasure.

151
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,720
This is my last gift for you

152
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,800
before darkness befalls your life.

153
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,040
You're welcome.

154
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,680
Song Ruoyun.

155
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,270
Song Ruoyun.

156
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,360
Song Ruoyun!

157
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,480
How do you feel?

158
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,400
Leng Yehan.

159
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,280
Leng Yehan,

160
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,000
what's the matter with you?

161
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,440
Leng Yehan.

162
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,400
Leng Yehan.

163
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,600
Leng Yehan.

164
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,160
If Song Ruoyun manages
to get the pictures of us doing this,

165
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,120
your career will be over.

166
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,520
So will my life.

167
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,520
Leng Yehan.

168
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,520
Leng Yehan.

169
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,200
It's me!

170
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,720
Leng Yehan.

171
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,800
How do you feel?

172
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,560
What happened?

173
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,200
The paparazzi
that Song Ruoyun arranged

174
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,560
will soon be here.

175
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,520
No matter what we will be doing,

176
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,560
once they have the pictures of us,

177
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,440
we're over.

178
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,120
Mu Nanchen is in a coma right now,

179
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,480
no one will stop her.

180
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,880
She'll take my life,

181
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,400
and your company will be over.

182
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,000
Your revenge

183
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,080
won't be fulfilled.

184
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,040
Do you understand?

185
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,160
You hide in the bathroom.

186
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,880
I'll take care of the rest.

187
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,520
It's useless.

188
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,880
She won't give us any chance.

189
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,480
We only have one way.

190
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,760
Speak.

191
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,360
Do you remember

192
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,320
that I mentioned starting over?

193
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Just kill me,

194
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,360
and everything

195
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,600
will start all over again.

196
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,480
I won't.

197
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,320
Luo Qing,

198
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,200
this time,

199
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,120
you cannot

200
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,440
escape again.

201
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,680
Leng Yehan,

202
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,640
quickly.

203
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,480
I'm not lying to you.

204
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,720
You've lied to me more than enough.

205
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,760
No, I'm not.

206
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,800
It'll be like

207
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,360
nothing ever happened.

208
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,360
Will I forget you?

209
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,000
You've still got

210
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,040
good imagination.

211
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,880
