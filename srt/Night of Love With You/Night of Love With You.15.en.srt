=Episode 15=

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,680
We decided to get married in a hurry.

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,320
But I should propose to you.

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,800
It's considerate of you.

23
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,160
(It must be
the original proposal scene.)

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,120
(I indeed passed the boring process)

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,160
(and jumped to the happy wedding.)

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,280
(I'm a genius.)

27
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,880
Nanchen. Nanchen.

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,800
You know I've been loving you.

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,480
Why are you doing this to me?

30
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,520
You're only my sister in my heart.

31
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,080
Nanchen!

32
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,800
Why can she get your love?

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,840
I'm the one who grew up with you.

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,120
- Why do you never care about me?
- (Why do you never care about me?)

35
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,720
(Why do supporting roles talk
in the same way?)

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,660
Nanchen, look at me.

37
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,400
Only we make the perfect couple.

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,620
Will you not get up

39
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,610
- until Mu Nanchen pulls you up?
- You aren't supposed to like that woman.

40
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,080
(So what?)

41
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,360
Why do you keep quiet?

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,560
It's not like you.

43
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,280
What are you up to again?

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,840
(Why can he say so much?)

45
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,560
(Is he not supposed
to be in this scene?)

46
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,200
(So, he can talk freely?)

47
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,840
Getting dumb?

48
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,160
It hurts?

49
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
(Oh, no.)

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,200
(If I cry,)

51
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,360
(Leng Yehan will laugh at me.)

52
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,080
(What a humiliation!)

53
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,800
Apply some ointment

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,840
and it won't hurt.

55
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,840
(Is Leng Yehan supposed to say this?)

56
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,600
I have only one goal in my life.

57
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,160
To become your wife!

58
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,880
I don't allow anyone

59
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,760
to take everything away from me!

60
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,600
No.

61
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,920
She doesn't deserve it!

62
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,920
Are you out of your mind?

63
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,560
I've got only one wish
since I was little,

64
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,760
just to marry you.

65
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,960
Miss Song,

66
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,520
stop it

67
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,560
in case you make a fool of yourself.

68
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,800
Miss Luo,

69
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,240
let me take you in there
for some ointment.

70
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,000
Mr. Leng,

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,720
do you need...?

72
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,400
No.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,040
It's, Miss Luo.

74
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,360
Get lost!

75
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,320
Luo Qing,

76
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,720
I warned you

77
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,720
to stay away from Nanchen.

78
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,720
How can a weak girl like you

79
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,520
compete with me?

80
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,440
You make me sick.

81
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,880
I don't allow you to steal Nanchen!

82
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,200
I can move now?

83
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,320
So, when Nanchen is away,

84
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,120
I can move freely.

85
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,080
What are you talking about?

86
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,160
Let go of me!

87
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,840
Song Ruoyun,

88
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,280
I put up with you a lot.

89
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,480
I have far more experience
in being a villainess.

90
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,760
Let me teach you something for free.

91
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,000
It hurts more to slap
with the back of the hand.

92
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,280
How dare you slap me!

93
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,120
I was just slapping you back.

94
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,560
Now, I'll slap you for myself.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,800
Song Ruoyun,

96
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,760
don't go too far.

97
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,920
Even if you're designed to be stubborn,

98
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,840
please use your brain, OK?

99
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,880
Why are you getting crazy

100
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,040
for a mere man?

101
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,880
No more pretending?

102
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,400
You loved to play pathetic and innocent,

103
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,840
didn't you?

104
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,760
I played pathetic?

105
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,320
I just failed to control myself.

106
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,960
But if you bullied me at that time,

107
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,200
I would keep it in my mind.

108
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,280
After I could move,

109
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,200
I would get even with you.

110
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,760
Nanchen.

111
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,680
Nanchen.

112
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,800
What happened?

113
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,960
Nanchen,

114
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,320
Luo Qing was just pretending.

115
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Look at her.

116
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,280
Miss Song,

117
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,720
I really didn't mean that.

118
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,360
Song Ruoyun,

119
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,280
I've made my point.

120
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,560
If you keep asking Luo Qing for trouble,

121
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll give you a problem.

122
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,840
Luo Qing,

123
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,440
I won't let you off!

124
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,200
Are you all right?

125
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,800
Leng Yehan has left.

126
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,720
Well,

127
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,640
I'll see you tomorrow.

128
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,440
Okay.

129
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,120
Qiao Xiao,

130
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,560
what's the noise out there?

131
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,400
Mr. Mu is out there.

132
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,480
What's he doing?

133
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,960
Something good,

134
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,300
I'm afraid.

135
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,660
(Mu Nanchen & Luo Qing)

136
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
Mu Nanchen!

137
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,300
(Mu Nanchen & Luo Qing)

138
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,360
How can you marry Luo Qing?

139
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,600
It's my own business.

140
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,080
Since you're my son,

141
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,600
nothing can be your own business.

142
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,440
As long as I live,

143
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,920
Luo Qing mustn't be your wife!

144
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,640
I've made my decision.

145
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,520
Mr. Mu,

146
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,920
are you all right?

147
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,120
It's bitter.

148
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,520
Leng Yehan was slightly cut.

149
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,040
He's all right, I guess.

150
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,720
A CEO like him

151
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,320
has professional private doctors.

152
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,560
Does he need my ointment?

153
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,240
But he helped me, anyway.

154
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,080
I should be grateful,

155
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,640
shouldn't I?

156
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,880
Tomorrow, the wedding will
end the whole story.

157
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,040
No one will remember each other.

158
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,720
Why bother?

159
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,520
I can just go and say goodbye to him.

160
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,840
Even if we make use of each other,

161
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,440
we can barely be friends.

162
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,680
Fine, then.

163
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,960
I'll deliver the ointment to him.

164
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,080
Since I became the leading role,

165
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,160
I've been kinder and kinder.

166
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,520
(I want to marry Mu Nanchen)

167
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,760
(because...)

168
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,840
(Because I like him.)

169
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,000
Miss Song?

170
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,600
I have nothing to talk about with you.

171
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,840
You'd better leave.

172
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
They'll hold the wedding tomorrow.

173
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,560
It's their business.

174
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,000
No.

175
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,960
I want you to do the last thing for me.

176
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,840
I want you

177
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
to kill Luo Qing.

178
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,600
You've lost your mind.

179
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,080
To you,

180
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,040
Mu Nanchen is living the happiest life.

181
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
This is what you fail to get.

182
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,360
Will you just watch and do nothing?

183
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,040
If you don't kill her,

184
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,520
I'll make the recording public.

185
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,760
By then,

186
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,240
you'll lose the cooperation
with Song's Group,

187
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,040
your title as the CEO of Leng's Group,

188
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,400
and all the meanings of your life
over all these years.
