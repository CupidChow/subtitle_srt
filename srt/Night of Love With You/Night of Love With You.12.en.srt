I...

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,360
I was just passing by.

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,040
The kiss...

30
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,560
Thank you.

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,960
I've got something else to attend to.

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,920
I should go.

33
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,160
Me, too.

34
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,320
It doesn't feel right.

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,920
- Something must be wrong.
- Something must be wrong.

36
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,880
Oh, I see.

37
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,800
He must have been worried
that Mu Nanchen may realize

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,400
that his kiss could relieve
my palpitation

39
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,840
and then got closer to me.

40
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,120
By then,

41
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,240
I will expose his secret.

42
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,600
Right.

43
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,320
I bet it does.

44
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,320
Once Mu Nanchen knows who I really am,

45
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,880
my revenge plan will be disrupted.

46
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,880
But...

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,080
He could have refused to save me

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,000
and stopped Mu Nanchen
so that I would have a heart attack.

49
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,280
In this way,

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,640
I would have died with his secret.

51
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,880
Or...

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,240
Or I should have just killed her.

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,760
Why did I show up to help her?

54
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,320
- Too weird.
- Too weird.

55
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,480
Mrs. Mu,

56
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,640
I was too obsessed.

57
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,480
My only intention was
to punish Luo Qing.

58
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,400
I didn't know

59
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,240
Nanchen would drink it by mistake.

60
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,320
Please trust me.

61
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,040
Mrs. Mu,

62
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,720
I'm so ashamed.

63
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,240
I used to

64
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,520
spoil my daughter.

65
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,040
Forget about it.

66
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,600
My son is

67
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,840
all right now.

68
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,320
I watched you grow up.

69
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,560
I know your nature.

70
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,040
Thank you, Mrs. Mu.

71
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,560
What...?

72
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,240
What about my engagement with Nanchen?

73
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,640
I don't like Luo Qing.

74
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,160
But last time Nanchen...

75
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
Nanchen...

76
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,960
He must have picked Luo Qing casually

77
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,760
because he couldn't
accept our engagement.

78
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,840
She isn't good enough
for Nanchen at all.

79
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,960
Xiaoyun,

80
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,920
you'd better not
do anything stupid again.

81
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,520
If I hadn't signed the contract
with him,

82
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,400
Leng Yehan wouldn't let you get away.

83
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,080
I'm not sure
about Luo Qing's relationship

84
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,680
with Leng Yehan.

85
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,600
If you keep making trouble,

86
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,840
Leng Yehan will not let you off anymore!

87
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,320
I...

88
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,880
Leng Yehan

89
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,600
can't be underestimated.

90
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,280
It took him only three years

91
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,720
to make his company
among the top three in Jiangbei.

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,640
Mrs. Mu,

93
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,920
the Leng family is gunning for ours.

94
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm afraid

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,600
if we let him develop like this,

96
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,880
you and I will both have a tough time.

97
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,520
Our cooperation

98
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,640
will be the safest solution.

99
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,160
You make sense.

100
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,640
However,

101
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,000
I have to consider Nanchen's health.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,200
He's allergic

103
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,160
to all the other women.

104
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,960
Only Luo Qing

105
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,240
can touch him.

106
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,240
Be patient.

107
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Let me think about it.

108
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,820
(March 14, Monday)

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,320
Luo Qing,

110
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,200
I won't let you go.

111
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,280
Mr. Leng,

112
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,160
I hope we will work well together.

113
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,440
We will.

114
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,720
Mr. Leng,

115
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,880
what a coincidence!

116
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,680
It's been three months
since we last met, right?

117
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,880
I always wanted to thank you

118
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,920
for taking me in last time.

119
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,440
Is the car out there yours?

120
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,040
May I drive it?

121
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,840
No.

122
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,320
You're a petty man.

123
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,360
I thought

124
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,840
you could be my brother-in-law.

125
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,480
Can you drive?

126
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,160
I have a driving license.

127
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,880
But...

128
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,000
Are you and my sister
not on speaking terms?

129
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,040
Why didn't you contact each other
in the past three months?

130
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't know.

131
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,960
Have you not professed your love yet?

132
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,520
What do you mean?

133
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,520
Come on,

134
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,520
why do you only appear to be smart?

135
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,560
Now that you adore my sister,
you have to let her know.

136
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,800
What do you mean

137
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
by "adore"?

138
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
It means

139
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,160
when she's away, you miss her.

140
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,800
When she's with someone else,
you feel upset.

141
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,760
When she's in danger,

142
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,920
you'll save her,
regardless of your own safety.

143
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,760
Most importantly,

144
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,520
your heart

145
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,720
will thump

146
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,680
at a moment.

147
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,600
I...

148
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,520
I'm not sure.

149
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,360
Well, you're in the middle of it.

150
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,600
No time like the present.

151
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,760
How about

152
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,800
I ask my sister out for you today?

153
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,560
What do you think?

154
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,360
Sister,

155
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,640
come over.

156
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,400
Why?

157
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,560
Just wait.

158
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,720
It's indeed the comic world.

159
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,400
However poor I am,

160
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,640
my home still looks nice.

161
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,080
Come on.

162
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,120
What are you doing?

163
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
You've got an important date today.

164
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,120
You should be dressed beautifully.

165
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,320
Not interested.

166
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,400
Mr. Leng

167
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,480
had the best restaurant arranged.

168
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,000
Leng Yehan?

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,480
Yeah.

170
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,000
He said

171
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,720
he had something important to tell you.

172
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,560
He...

173
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,280
He and I

174
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,120
have nothing to talk about, I'm afraid.

175
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,600
Two idiots.

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,080
Hurry.

177
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,440
It doesn't look good.

178
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,800
Mr. Leng,

179
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,600
you've tried on

180
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,280
all the ties

181
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,800
of different brands,

182
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,880
materials, and patterns.

183
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,040
Go buy some more.

184
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,240
All right.

185
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,680
Mr. Leng,

186
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,080
long time no see.

187
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,080
Mr. Leng,

188
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,880
you have quite good taste.

189
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,480
Everything in your home

190
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,320
is quite expensive.

191
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,680
Miss Song, I don't remember

192
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,200
we have any history.

193
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,440
I'm not here for business.

194
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Today,

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,200
I'm here to give you a mission.

196
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,960
I really hate Luo Qing.

197
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,680
But she's protected by Nanchen

198
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,120
and also taken care of by you.

199
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,600
I find it hard to get rid of her.

200
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,240
So, I need you to do something for me.

201
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,960
After that,

202
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,440
Nanchen will misunderstand Luo Qing.

203
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,600
And I

204
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,680
will naturally

205
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,640
be in a relationship with him.

206
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,880
Miss Song,

207
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,280
what makes you mistakenly believe

208
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,920
that I'm good-tempered?

209
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,280
Don't get angry, Mr. Leng.

210
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,800
Why don't you

211
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,280
hear this out first?

212
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,280
(How do you know)

213
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,340
(I'm the illegitimate child
of the Leng family?)

214
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,470
(Who else knows it?)

215
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,800
I planned to unlock her phone and check

216
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,520
whether Luo Qing started
to seduce Nanchen

217
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,760
a long time ago.

218
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,040
Unexpectedly,

219
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,160
I got a surprise.

220
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,120
Leng's Group appeared three years ago

221
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,680
and has been against Mu's Group.

222
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,040
It not only competes with Mu's Group,

223
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,240
but also wants to cooperate
with my father's company.

224
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,800
So, you're doing everything

225
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,920
just to take revenge.

226
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,480
Mr. Leng,

227
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,160
you can reject me,

228
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,200
but you can't reject
the chance of taking revenge.

229
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,960
Right?

230
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
If you threaten me,

231
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,880
you won't end up well.

232
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,160
I don't care about business.

233
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,240
I don't care about who you are, either.

234
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,680
I just want Nanchen to love me.

235
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,480
And you...

236
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,840
As long as you help me,

237
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,120
you can continue your revenge plan.

238
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,920
I won't interfere.

239
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,120
Mr. Leng,

240
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
what do you think?

241
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,280
No...

242
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,000
Wish us nice cooperation.

243
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,800
It doesn't feel right.

244
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,680
Why am I a little bit nervous?

245
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,520
What makes me nervous?

246
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,240
Miss Luo, someone left this for you.

247
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,840
What's this?

248
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,380
(Underground garage)

249
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,520
What's all this about?

250
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,680
Luo Cheng?

251
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,720
Luo Cheng.

252
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,880
Luo Cheng.

253
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,160
Leng Yehan?

254
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,760
Miss Luo.
