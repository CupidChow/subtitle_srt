The heart attack is for real.

Women like you

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,400
think you can get my attention
in this way.

23
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,200
Button up your clothes

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,000
and get out of here.

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,040
(He doesn't have a love story.)

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,720
(He wants nothing but revenge.)

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,640
I guess,

28
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,200
you and the other men here

29
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,800
must have gotten your arrogance
from some wholesale market.

30
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,040
Miss Song.

31
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,720
I've investigated it.

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,000
It's the president of Leng's Group,

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,680
Leng Yehan.

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,440
Mr. Leng?

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,560
Leng's Group and Mu's Group
are competitors.

36
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,880
Will he help Luo Qing?

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,400
Anyway,

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,640
Luo Qing doesn't disappear
for no reason.

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,000
Miss Song.

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,680
May I help you?

41
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,000
(Have you seen)

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,360
(a woman in a shirt?)

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,720
Help me.

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,480
Why?

45
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,960
Because I know who you really are.

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,640
Everyone in Jiangbei

47
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,920
knows Leng's Group.

48
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,960
You are an illegitimate son
of the Mu family.

49
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,560
You can't afford

50
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,280
to talk nonsense.

51
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,600
You're perfectly clear

52
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,360
if I'm talking nonsense.

53
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,600
How do you find this?

54
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,520
Open the door.

55
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,520
I have something to say.

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,040
Help me

57
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,120
and I'll tell you everything.

58
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,200
Mr. Leng.

59
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,120
I couldn't stop them.

60
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,160
Aren't you Mr. Leng
from the Leng family?

61
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,600
I'm Song Ruoyun from the Song family.

62
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,120
I just lost

63
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,120
a million-yuan necklace.

64
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,960
Someone said

65
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,480
the thief disappeared around here.

66
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,840
I wonder if you

67
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,960
have seen the thief.

68
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,600
No.

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,000
It's my family's heirloom.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,600
We don't want there

71
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,760
to be any misunderstanding,

72
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,720
right?

73
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,720
Do you think

74
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,440
I have time to cover for a thief?

75
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,200
I...

76
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,800
That's not what I meant.

77
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,520
Who is this?

78
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,520
Miss Song.

79
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,680
I'm busy now.

80
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,960
I don't have time for this.

81
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,360
Mr. Leng.

82
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,240
Miss Song.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,320
Are you interested in watching us here
and learning something?

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,080
Notify the hotel

85
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,280
that I'll check

86
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,600
everyone who is going to leave.

87
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,560
- Yes.
- Yes.

88
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,440
Miss Song

89
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,280
is...

90
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,360
Mr. Leng.

91
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,560
You...

92
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,000
Do you like women?

93
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,920
Um?

94
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,360
No.

95
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,160
I'm not saying you don't like women.

96
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,840
It's just I've never seen

97
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,320
any woman around you.

98
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,160
There hasn't been any man, of course.

99
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,480
You can tell me now.

100
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,480
What I said is

101
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,840
helping me to get rid of Song Ruoyun.

102
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,480
That means

103
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,920
you have to take me out of the hotel.

104
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
I think Miss Song has people
blocking the gate of the hotel.

105
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Do you need me

106
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,960
to get you waitress' clothes?

107
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,440
No.

108
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,880
Get me a dress.

109
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,440
Shouldn't you sneak out?

110
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,440
The more high-profile,

111
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,160
the easier it is to leave.

112
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,480
Hello.

113
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,000
There is a thief at the hotel.

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,280
May I ask

115
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,080
the number of your room?

116
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,160
Top floor, 2406.

117
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,040
Miss Song.

118
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,920
That's the woman in Mr. Leng's room.

119
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,480
Could it be her?

120
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,800
Luo Qing wears like a countryside girl.

121
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,200
How could she have such a good taste?

122
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,800
Mr. Leng.

123
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,160
It's noisy here.

124
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,800
Let's hurry home.

125
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,200
We shall go separate ways.

126
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,720
I'll meet you at the intersection ahead.

127
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,360
Why hasn't Miss Luo come yet?

128
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,080
It's hard to get lost here.

129
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,440
She won't come.

130
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,080
Didn't she say she would meet us
at the intersection?

131
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,360
That's interesting.

132
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,160
Kevin.

133
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's go.

134
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
I know you too well.

135
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,400
A villain like you

136
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,720
will kill me after knowing

137
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,960
where I got my information.

138
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,080
Kill who?

139
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,240
Who are you?

140
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,720
I'm your younger brother, Luo Cheng.

141
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,280
Do you have a fever?

142
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,720
Do I also have a younger brother?

143
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,920
My parents died.

144
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,800
I owe millions of yuan.

145
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,160
I was forced to drop out of school.

146
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,400
I have heart disease,

147
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,280
and I have to support
my younger brother's schooling.

148
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,520
That's my life?

149
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
It sucks being the heroine.

150
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,760
By the way,

151
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,400
why were you there?

152
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,840
Didn't you get a text today

153
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,040
which asked you to go to the hotel?

154
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,600
I was worried you would be in trouble.

155
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,960
That's why I was waiting for you
at the door.

156
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,240
Why are you

157
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
acting so strange today?

158
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,840
You're even in a fancy dress.

159
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,040
(There is a bug in the comic book world)

160
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,480
(and I'm playing the wrong role.)

161
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,960
(I also have a consciousness.)

162
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,840
(I'd better find Mu Nanchen)

163
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,600
(and start the main plot.)

164
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,360
Here is the thing.

165
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,060
What's going on here?

166
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,140
(Jiangbei Hospital)

167
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Dr. Liu.

168
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,600
How is Nanchen?

169
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,840
He's in a vegetative state.

170
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,760
What?

171
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,120
It's Luo Qing.

172
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
It must be her!

173
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,240
Ma'am.

174
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,920
Luo Qing did flee from the hotel.

175
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,440
Luo Qing?

176
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,560
This is...

177
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,640
How is this possible?

178
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,800
Actually,

179
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,080
we also found

180
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,440
traces of sildenafil in Mr. Mu's body.

181
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,520
What's that?

182
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,840
It's commonly known

183
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,640
as an aphrodisiac.

184
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,360
Mr. Mu's head injury is not serious,

185
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,400
but combined with
the effect of the drug,

186
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
that's why he fell into a coma.

187
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,960
Luo Qing

188
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,360
is insane!

189
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,520
How dare she use the drug on Nanchen!

190
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,960
Nanchen

191
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,560
is allergic to women.

192
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
What she did

193
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,800
can take Nanchen's life.

194
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,760
Hurry!

195
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,640
Call the police to arrest her!

196
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,200
Aunty.

197
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,880
I think

198
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,200
we should solve this on our own.

199
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,800
If we call the police,

200
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,000
it could have an effect
on the Mu family.

201
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,120
Rest assured.

202
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,120
I'll make her pay.

203
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,600
You must be in shock.

204
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
Please go and have some rest.

205
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,160
Ma'am.

206
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,840
Please come with me.

207
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,640
No way.

208
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,440
The leading male character is in a coma?

209
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,240
Doesn't it mean I'm going to die?

210
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,000
Didn't you ask for the drug?

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,080
How did Mr. Mu have it?

212
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,240
Nanchen went into the wrong room
and drank it by mistake.

213
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,120
We must find Luo Qing
as soon as possible

214
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,720
and silence her.

215
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,920
As someone the Song family
and the Mu family are looking for,

216
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,480
she can't be helped.

217
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,400
(Oh, no.)

218
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,440
(I'd better stay away from the villain.)

219
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Miss Luo.

220
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,360
We meet again.
