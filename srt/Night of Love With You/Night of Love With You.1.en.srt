to be loved by Su?

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,040
I'm the one

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,720
who grew up with him.

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,680
Why does he only have eyes for you?

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,160
I hate you!

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,760
You're the one
who has been trying to hurt me.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,520
But you're my best friend.

28

(The End of This Chapter)

30
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,120
The villainess talks too much
before she dies.

31
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,000
Just stab her and it will be over.

(Qiqi Supporting Role)
(A supporting role in comic books, right?)

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,760
(That's right.)

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,800
(I'm a comic book character.)

37
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,520
(However,)

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,640
(I have rich working experience.)

39

(I played a beloved concubine before.)

40
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,440
She is only pregnant.

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,480

42
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,400
(I also played a campus belle)

43

(and an A-list celebrity.)

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,840
The highlight of the red carpet show

45
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,360
will be you making a fool of yourself.

46

(I'm not just a supporting role,)

47
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,760
(I'm an evil supporting role
most of the time.)

(This is your next job.)

Night of Love With You?

50
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,320
(This is a cheesy comic book
about a domineering boss.)

51
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,280
(How cheesy is it?)

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,160
(The leading male character
is Mu Nanchen,)

53

(He is president of Mu's Group,)

56

(The leading female character,
Luo Qing,)

61

(She has congenital heart disease.)

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,160
(Only kissing someone
with the Mu family's genes)

64
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,920
(can relieve the heart pain.)

65
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,440
(She falls in love
with Mu Nanchen eventually.)

66
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,480
(That's ridiculous.)

67
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,120
(She will die if she doesn't kiss him.)

68
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,000
(But she ends up
being killed by Leng Yehan)

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,640
(at the wedding.)

70
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,240
(Luo Qing)
(A bad ending, really?)

71
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,920
(The villain, Leng Yehan,)

72
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,560
(is president of Leng's Group.)

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,040
(He is an illegitimate child
of the Mu family.)

74
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,440
(He doesn't have a love story.)

75
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,040
(He wants nothing but revenge.)

76

(To kill Mu Nanchen)

77
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,080
(Leng Yehan)
(and hurt all he loves.)

(Song Ruoyun,)

80
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,280
(has had a crush on Mu Nanchen
since childhood.)

81

(At the beginning of the story,)

82
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,440
(she tries to poison Luo Qing.)

83
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,480
(Luo Qing is framed
for seducing Mu Nanchen)

84
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,400
(and insulted by Song Ruoyun,)

85
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,200
(which unexpectedly moves the plot
of Mu Nanchen and Luo Qing.)

86
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,880
There is not much of a difference
in the plot.

87
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,120
I'm well aware.

88
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,400
Besides,

89
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,880
the plot is fully automatic.

90
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,720
I don't have a consciousness.

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,670
(Night of Love With You)
It's no use knowing that much.

92
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,440
(Is there anything else you need?)

93
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,120
Yes.

94
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,280
Did the Comic Book Centre
start hiring children?

95
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,400
I'm your boss.

96
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,120
Who are you?

97
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,400
Who are you?

98
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,600
Women like you

99
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
do everything to approach me

100
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,520
so that you can sleep with me, right?

101
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,840
I'll give you what you want today.

102
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,560
Are you nuts?

103
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,520
(Luo Qing.)

104
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,400
(I know you're in there.)

105
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,080
(Open the door now.)

106
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,120
(You know my temper.)

107
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,040
Song Ruoyun?

108
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,760
(Song Ruoyun.)
(You don't want to mess with me.)

109

Luo Qing?

110
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,520
Catch her

111
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,320
after the door opens.

112
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,240
Yes!

113
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,840
Miss Song.

114
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,120
Mr. Mu is missing.

115
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,960
Nanchen.

116
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,080
Am I Luo Qing?

117
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,760
Don't tell me he is Mu Nanchen.

118
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,800
Aren't I supposed
to be a supporting role?

119
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,560
Why do I have a consciousness?

120
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,600
Luo Qing!

121
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,280
Open the door!

122
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,240
You must be

123
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,480
doing something disgraceful in there!

124
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,560
(Luo Qing is framed
for seducing Mu Nanchen)

125
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,600
(and insulted by Song Ruoyun.)

126
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,280
I have to do something.

127
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,400
(So what if I mess with you?)

128
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,520
(I have sulfuric acid.)

129
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,320
It's water!

130
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,560
Chase her!

131
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,000
Mr. Mu!

132
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,280
Nanchen!

133
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,120
- Nanchen!
- Hello.

134
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,640
Send an ambulance here.

135
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,960
Luo Qing.

136
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,160
You are dead meat.

137
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,160
Don't run! Don't run!

138
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,320
Stop!

139
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,360
Catch her!

140
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,000
What are you doing here?

141
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,640
Stop!

142
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,040
Don't run!

143
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,520
Don't run!

144
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,000
- Stop running!
- Chase her!

145
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,240
Why is it so noisy outside?

146
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Mr. Leng.

147
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,880
Mu Nanchen seems to be missing.

148
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,560
Looks like he won't be able to sign
the contract with the Song family

149
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,720
before I make a move.

150
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
- Don't run!
- Don't run!

151
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,400
Stop!

152
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,480
Don't run!

153
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,760
Don't run!

154
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,520
Chase her!

155
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,920
- Don't run!
- Don't run!

156
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,160
I'll check the elevator!

157
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,080
- You go that way!
- Okay!

158

(She has congenital heart disease.)

161

Mr. Leng.

162
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,840
This woman...

(Only kissing someone
with the Mu family's genes)

164

(can relieve the heart pain.)
