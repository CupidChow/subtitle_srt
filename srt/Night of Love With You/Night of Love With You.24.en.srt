You got wet in the rain.

22
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,240
Don't catch a cold,

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,400
or you'll have a fever.

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,200
Are you feeling better now?

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,120
At least I'm not crying now.

26
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,080
Have one.

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,320
This is the candy

28
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,840
you put in my coffee earlier.

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,440
Since that day,

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,160
I've been collecting

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,920
all the flavors of this candy.

32
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,520
I see.

33
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,360
Your coffee won't taste bitter anymore.

34
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,040
You are the only sweet thing

35
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,240
in my life.

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,920
I thought

37
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,600
the wedding was just the beginning.

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,560
I didn't expect

39
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,840
it to be the end.

40
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,280
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,320
I thought

42
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,240
we would never meet again.

43
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,640
I never expected

44
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,800
to have another chance
to be next to you.

45
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,360
You don't need to say sorry,

46
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,560
and you don't need
to give me anything in return.

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,200
I just want you to know

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,280
whether you are happy
or sad in the future,

49
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,640
I'll always be there for you.

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,760
Thank you,

51
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,120
Mu Nanchen.

52
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,840
I'm not gonna ask you not to feel sad.

53
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,280
I just want to tell you

54
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,680
no matter how long you are sad,

55
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,480
I'll always stay by your side.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,920
But you have to accept the fact

57
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,840
that Leng Yehan

58
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,320
will be gone forever.

59
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,120
I used to

60
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
be scared.

61
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,560
I was scared that I would forget

62
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,760
how much I like him,

63
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,740
but now I'm glad

64
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,720
I will forget him.

65
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,760
It will pass.

66
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,960
It's gonna be fine.

67
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,800
By the way,

68
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,800
Luo Cheng is still at his place.

69
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,880
Can you bring him back for me?

70
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,160
Who is Luo Cheng?

71
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,040
My younger brother.

72
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,680
I don't think you've met him.

73
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,800
Why do you have a brother
all of a sudden?

74
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,560
I read your information

75
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,600
when you were working part-time.

76
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,760
You never had a brother.

77
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,840
It's impossible.

78
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,400
He is studying at Jiangbei University.

79
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,720
Hello.

80
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,560
This is Jiangbei University
Student Affairs Office.

81
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,560
I'm looking for a student

82
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,360
named Luo Cheng.

83
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,560
I'm his sister.

84
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,400
Hold on a second.

85
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,520
Sorry.

86
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,240
We don't have

87
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,560
a student named Luo Cheng.

88
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,680
Something came up.

89
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,320
I need to leave.

90
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,560
Aren't we having dinner tonight?

91
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,680
Get Luo Cheng here
to pick up the pearls for me.

92
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,680
He...

93
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,640
He went bike riding.

94
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,720
What?

95
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,240
Luo Qing.

96
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,840
Luo Cheng

97
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,040
disappeared.

98
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,080
When you fall in love,

99
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,920
it's doomed that you can't exist
at the same time.

100
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,970
What she said is true.

101
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,440
Luo Qing.

102
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,160
What's wrong with you?

103
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,920
What happened?

104
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,440
It turns out

105
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,160
I will lose the meaning of my existence

106
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,120
when I like him,

107
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
and he will lose
the value of his existence

108
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,120
when he falls in love with me.

109
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,200
We can't exist at the same time

110
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,960
for loving each other.

111
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,000
Luo Qing.

112
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,840
What happened to you two?

113
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,120
Leng Yehan.

114
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,440
I'm running out of time!

115
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,040
Luo Qing.

116
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,440
I don't know what happened to you,

117
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,920
but he is willing

118
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,280
to sacrifice himself for you.

119
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,080
Why would you do this now?

120
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,400
That was the last thing
he could do for you.

121
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,400
That's his decision.

122
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,080
I know.

123
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,320
Although he lost his revenge story,

124
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,680
there is one scene

125
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,520
he has to be there.

126
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,400
Mu Nanchen.

127
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,200
Please help me.

128
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,760
Okay.

129
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,680
Whatever it is,

130
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,440
I'll help you.

131
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,200
Luo Qing.

132
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,160
Goodbye.

133
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,560
Luo Qing.

134
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,200
Are you really going to do this?

135
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,360
What are you going to do?

136
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,440
Okay.

137
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,080
This is the last thing I can do for you.

138
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,080
Thank you.

139
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,320
Mu Nanchen.

140
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,440
Mu Nanchen, stop her!

141
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,640
Don't let her come here!

142
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,360
Don't come over!

143
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,040
You exist to kill me.

144
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,040
If we finish the story,

145
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,880
you can stay alive.

146
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,440
No.

147
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,520
Thank you for letting me know
what it feels like when you like someone.

148
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,720
I want you alive.

149
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,940
Even if I'll be gone forever,

150
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,480
I'd be content.

151
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,040
From now on,

152
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,880
you can't make decisions on your own,

153
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,400
because I'm domineering

154
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,000
and unreasonable.

155
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,640
Therefore,

156
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,200
the decision can only be made by me.

157
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Don't come over.

My biggest regret is

165
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,000
I can't exist for loving you.

166
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,080
I can only disappear

167
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,630
