Leng Yehan.

33
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,800
Since you have chosen to act against me,

34
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,080
I won't be civil anymore.

35
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,680
The man who took you away,

36
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,320
he works for Song Ruoyun, right?

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,960
What happened between you two

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,920
that makes her want you dead?

39
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,640
She has to be jealous of me.

40
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,440
Women, huh?

41
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,760
She's the beloved daughter

42
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,320
of a rich family.

43
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,840
You are in

44
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,000
a huge debt.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,560
No way

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,600
you can compete

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,000
with Song Ruoyun.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,240
Well, there's no need
for you to be so specific.

49
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,800
I'm hungry.

50
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,320
Me, too, actually.

51
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,760
- You go make some food.
- You go make some food.

52
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,920
- I don't know how.
- I don't know how.

53
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
You've been taking care
of your little brother, haven't you?

54
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,480
How come

55
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,560
you don't know how to cook food?

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,000
You weren't born with a silver spoon.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,040
How come you can't cook, either?

58
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,080
Who is it?

59
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,680
Luo Feng?

60
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
Sister,

61
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,840
are you in there?

62
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,960
Sister.

63
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,280
Sister,

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,440
I've found you at last.

65
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,800
You know?

66
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,120
After I jumped out of the window,

67
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,200
I passed out.

68
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,800
I woke up and wanted to go back
to rescue you,

69
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,280
but your car left.

70
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,160
I ran after you all the way,

71
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,680
Um…

72
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,320
There, there.

73
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,240
Sister,

74
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,600
I'm so glad that you're okay.

75
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,560
You know what?

76
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,720
They were so mean to me.

77
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,480
They didn't give me food

78
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,520
or drink.

79
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,560
They also abused me.

80
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,240
I went through hell.

81
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,440
So…

82
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,160
Can you cook?

83
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,320
Yes.

84
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,400
It's late.

85
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,360
Time for you to leave.

86
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,600
You…

87
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,480
I-It's…

88
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,120
Sister.

89
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,200
Let's go.

90
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,280
She won't leave.

91
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,840
I see.

92
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,960
So you're my brother-in-law?

93
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,480
Mind your language.

94
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,200
I'm his…

95
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,360
Maidservant.

96
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,000
This is the perfect explanation, right?

97
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,040
Yes.

98
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,680
Master.

99
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,520
I need to deal with some e-mails.

100
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,000
You

101
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,760
will go make my bed.

102
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,400
As for you.

103
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,720
Bye.

104
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,080
What the heck is going on?

105
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,520
Sister,

106
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
please say yes.

107
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,440
He asked you to leave.

108
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,520
There's nothing I can do.

109
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,960
But our house was destroyed.

110
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,240
And I'm not sure

111
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,880
if anybody is there expecting me.

112
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,200
Sister,

113
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,240
who did you mess with?

114
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,640
You little boy,

115
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,880
stop asking me questions.

116
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,480
I was only born

117
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,400
6 minutes 24 seconds later than you.

118
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,360
A lot could happen in 6 minutes.

119
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,600
Sister,

120
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,960
I know that you dropped out
of school and found jobs

121
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,880
to keep me in school.

122
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,560
But you're in real danger right now.

123
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,680
How can I let you face it on your own?

124
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,960
I thought

125
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,360
you were a leech brother.

126
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,320
It turns out

127
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,800
that your conscience remains.

128
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,400
Sister.

129
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,760
(Leng Yehan)
He's the president of Leng's Group.

130
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,560
If you two are married,

131
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,600
will he buy me a bicycle?

132
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,160
I always want a bicycle

133
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,480
of my own.

134
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,800
He wishes.

135
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,320
You wish as well.

136
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,520
Pack up and go.

137
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,760
What are you still doing here?

138
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,160
You have three seconds
to leave this room.

139
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,600
You,

140
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,800
two seconds.

141
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,560
Three.

142
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,320
Two.

143
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,760
(Mr. Leng,)

144
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
(this is maintenance day.)

145
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,960
(There will be a night of outage
in your community.)

146
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Is that so?

147
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,960
Thank you for your timely notification.

148
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,480
Mr. Leng,

149
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,040
calm down, please.

150
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,640
During the outage,

151
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,240
the electronic lock won't open.

152
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:40,840
Sister,

153
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,080
how about

154
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,280
we sleep on the floor?

155
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,600
Um…

156
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:46,920
This…

157
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,160
This is but an accident.

158
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,760
You see, the bed is big enough

159
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,480
for all three of us.

160
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,280
Mr. Leng,

161
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,240
you won't mind, right?

162
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,960
You see,

163
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,360
we only need this little space.

164
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,120
This part

165
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,080
is for you.

166
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,040
I'll sleep in the middle.

167
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:13,960
That's fine.

168
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,240
Can't sleep?

169
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,000
I fell asleep several times,

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,760
but Luo Cheng always woke me up.

171
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,240
Change the lock tomorrow.

172
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,880
T-That's what I think, too.

173
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,600
The thing
between Song Ruoyun and you,

174
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,560
Mu Nanchen must be involved, right?

175
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,320
The first time we met,

176
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,520
Song Ruoyun was looking for you.

177
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,960
It was the contract-signing ceremony

178
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,200
of Song's Group and Mu's Group
on that day,

179
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,080
but Mu Nanchen wasn't there.

180
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,120
Later, we received the message
of his hospitalization.

181
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,880
Anyway,

182
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,440
she did something bad, and she didn't
want to get caught.

183
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,520
She set up a trap,

184
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,560
but it accidentally harmed Mu Nanchen.

185
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,800
You managed to escape

186
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,560
and found out her plan.

187
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,440
So she

188
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,160
wants you dead.

189
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,320
You've got very good

190
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,600
imagination.

191
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,680
If this is what Song Ruoyun

192
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,320
wants to achieve,

193
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,120
then she could be the end

194
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,480
of Song's Group.

195
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,520
Now you believe that she set me up?

196
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,600
Why wouldn't I?

197
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,400
But

198
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,760
as far as you know,

199
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,960
I'm a cunning woman.

200
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,320
You've got good memory.

201
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,440
Yes, you're cunning,

202
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,960
but you won't really harm anyone.

203
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,880
Plus,

204
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,680
it means you're smart.

205
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
It's better than being dumb.

206
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,840
If anyone says this about me,

207
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,840
I'll say,

208
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,040

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,160
Sister,

225
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,200
I remember

226
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,800
you enjoyed cooking before.

227
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,280
How come you don't cook anymore?

228
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,920
Such a great opportunity

229
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,160
should be given to young people.

230
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,960
But

231
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,080
I slept well last night.

232
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,680
What about you?

233
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,480
Me, too.

234
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,600
Mr. Leng.

235
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,080
Mr. Leng.

236
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,320
Mr. Leng?

237
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,360
You didn't sleep well, did you?

238
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,640
But that's strange.

239
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,080
So something happened

240
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,040
during the outage?

241
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,160
Aren't you talkative?

242
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,960
Hand-copy

243
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,640

244
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,660
(Mr. Song: Mr. Leng, Room 2406,

245
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,380
(Mr. Song: Mr. Leng, Room 2406,
Jiangbei Hotel. Business meeting.)

246
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,200
Didn't Mr. Song reject him sternly?

247
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,240
A disgrace!

248
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,640
Don't ever call me again.

249
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,640
Oh, no.

250
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,200
Give me your cellphone.

251
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,320
I dropped it when they kidnapped me.

252
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,280
Where are you going?

253
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,200
Something bad will happen to Leng Yehan.

254
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,160
Come on.

255
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,080
He's a president.
What can possibly happen to him?

256
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,720
Miss Song.

257
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,200
Kevin.

258
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,680
Miss Luo,

259
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,760
how did you find this place?

260
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,680
I went to the company
and they told me about it.

261
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,560
Where's Leng Yehan?

262
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,800
Please, no.

263
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,000
I won't fall for your trick again.

264
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,240
Please don't disturb Mr. Leng.

265
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,120
You don't understand.

266
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,280
It wasn't Mr. Song
who wanted to see him.

267
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,120
He's in danger.

268
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,680
Where is he?

269
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
Room 2406.

270
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,760
I'll drive the car.

271
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,400
It seems you don't have a cellphone,

272
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,760
Miss Song.

273
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,920
I was only worried

274
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,800
that you wouldn't come

275
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,280
if it wasn't Daddy who contacted you.

276
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,160
Well,

277
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,320
I'm here

278
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,640
to talk business, of course.

279
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,080
It's a proposal that

280
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,640
you'll definitely benefit from.

281
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,800
Tell me about it.

282
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,200
Song's Group

283
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,800
will cooperate with Leng's Group.

284
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,080

285
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,760
on one condition.

286
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,400
Just let me have Luo Qing.

287
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,920
That's quite easy,

288
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,680
isn't it?

289
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,040
I do know where Luo Qing is,

290
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,200
