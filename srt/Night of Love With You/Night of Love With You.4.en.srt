I'll stay at Mr. Leng's place today.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,320
Right,

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,160
Mr. Leng?

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,680
Yes.

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,360
Miss Luo.

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,320
Mr. Leng.

26
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll come late tomorrow morning

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,520
so as not to disturb your rest.

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,800
Nice place.

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,040
Your family is rich indeed.

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
It's not bad.

31
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,800
I'm gonna sleep here today.

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,480
This is my room.

33
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,560
You'll sleep in the guest room.

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,840
I'm too tired today.

35
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,320
If I don't rest well,

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,440
I can't guarantee

37
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,000
that I'll finish
the verification in time.

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,400
Miss Luo.

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,440
You are the first one

40
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,040
who has the nerve to make terms with me.

41
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,360
Really?

42
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,160
It's my honor.

43
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,080
Humm.

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,280
Wanna mess with me?

45
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,640
I've been a villainess a lot more times
than you did.

46
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,520
I'll sleep.

53
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,600
Luo Qing.

54
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,520
Luo Qing!

55
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,360
Is she having a heart attack?

56
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,880
Are you insane?

57
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,120
You're insane.

(Send to media)

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,960
What are you doing in my room
in the middle of the night?

60
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
This is my house.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,120
I can go

62
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,200
wherever I want.

63
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,920
Pervert.

64
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,520
I'll change the lock.

65
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,480
Lou Qing is such a miserable character.

66
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,000
It's better to be a villain.

67
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,200
I'll sleep.

68
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,000
Is everything ready?

69
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,400
Mr. Song agreed to have dinner with you.

70
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,440
Good.

71
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,480
How is Mu Nanchen doing?

72
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,360
Mu's Group blocked all the news.

73
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,560
We don't know
why he has been hospitalized.

74
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,160
Why are you wearing Mr. Leng's clothes?

75
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,920
What a rich breakfast.

76
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,960
I want to eat that.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,440
This is the fish soup sent here

78
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,000
from seaside by air every morning.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,280
It's only for one person.

80
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,520
It's Mr. Feng's favorite dish
for breakfast.

81
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,000
That's even better.

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,520
I'm sure Mr. Leng won't mind.

83
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,240
Right?

84
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,480
Of course.

85
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,000
What's more,

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,920
I can't wear Mr. Leng's clothes.

87
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,440
Girls

88
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,760
like pretty dresses.

89
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,640
Right?

90
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,440
Go and buy some.

91
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,840
Miss Luo,

92
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,520
do you have any requirements
in terms of style?

93
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,480
As long as it's expensive.

94
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,040
I'm not picky.

95
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,240
I'll get it arranged.

96
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,400
It must be very expensive.

97
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,680
Of course.

98
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,320
This collection is worth $600,000.

99
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,000
You...

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,840
You're doomed!

101
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,720
I didn't do it on purpose.

102
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,920
This vase is limited edition.

103
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,560
It's worth $400,000.

104
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,160
Where are you going?

105
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,200
I don't have to
watch these things break.

106
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,600
Mr. Leng! Mr. Leng!

107
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,200
This is what you got
when you went rogue.

108
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,560
Luo Qing is missing.

109
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,600
She is not

110
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,080
at her workplace

111
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,840
or home.

112
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,480
I can't let Mrs. Mu find Luo Qing first.

113
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,160
Does she have any relatives?

114
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,880
She has a younger brother.

115
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,160
This is the latest electronic lock.

116
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,480
I'll see if you pervert

117
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,400
can get into my room again.

118
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,220
(Mu Nanchen is still in a coma.
Is it true?)

119
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,590
(Mu's Group announced that Mu Nanchen is
on leave. Mrs. Mu took over the duty!)

120
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,220
(What happened to Mu Nanchen?
Is Mu's Group in crisis?)

121
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,680
If Mu Nanchen doesn't wake up,

122
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,640
the main plot won't be able to start.

123
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,320
A love scene
without the leading male character,

124
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,600
doesn't it mean
I'll be hunted by Song Ruoyun

125
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,320
and stuck in this story forever?

126
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,820
(Jiangbei)

127
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,400
Sister.

128
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,240
Who are you?

129
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,800
You have the wrong number.

130
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,280
Bro.

131
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,400
Did we kidnap the wrong guy?

132
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,920
No way.

133
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,760
Did you

134
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,400
give me a fake number on purpose?

135
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,560
I didn't.

136
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,760
Are you enough?

137
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,360
Sister.

138
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,520
I'm Luo Cheng!

139
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,920
It seems I do have a younger brother.

140
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,640
Sister.

141
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,520
I'm...

142
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,200
I have your brother now.

143
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,720
You come here in person

144
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,200
to trade for him,

145
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,720
or we'll kill him.

146
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,080
(You must work for Song Ruoyun.)

147
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,880
I didn't say anything.

148
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,080
If I go there,

149
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,640
you will follow
Song Ruoyun's instructions

150
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,720
and kill me.

151
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,760
To avoid a leak,

152
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,600
you're not gonna
let Lou Cheng go, either.

153
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,760
Am I guessing it right?

154
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,120
Don't waste your effort.

155
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,560
If you don't come,

156
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,520
your brother will die for sure.

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,640
If you come,

158
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,120
your brother will still have a chance.

159
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,320
You know it well.

160
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,680
I've sent you the address.

161
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,360
If you don't want your brother dead,

162
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,520
then stop making useless efforts.

163
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,320
My customer

164
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,440
is determined to kill you.

165
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,680
An early death will relieve you
from this.

166
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,240
Right?

167
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,680
An early death will relieve me
from this.

168
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,240
That's right.

169
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,080
An early death will relieve me
from this.

170
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,320
Thank you, bro.

171
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,200
She...

172
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,760
She thanked me.

173
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,640
Sister.

174
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,520
You weren't like this before.

175
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,680
An early death will relieve me
from this.

176
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,160
If I get to the end early,

177
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,480
the story will be over.

178
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,960
Doesn't it mean

179
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,360
I can meet the staff
at the Comic Book Centre

180
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,040
and report the character bug to them?

181
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,280
Leng Yehan.

182
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,600
Looks like I don't need
to work with you.

183
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,720
I need you

184
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,000
to kill me.

185
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,920
As far as I know,

186
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,800
your delivery time

187
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,440
is imminent.

188
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,800
Right now, only the Leng's Group
has the technical ability,

189
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,520
right?

190
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,880
To be honest,

191
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,840
we've decided

192
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,240
to work with Mu's Group.

193
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,960
It's just Mr. Mu has been...

194
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,680
Mr. Song.

195
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,160
You haven't answered my question.

196
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:55,920
Yes.

197
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,600
We are a little tight on delivery time.

198
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,200
Doing business

199
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,320
is all about efficiency.

200
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,480
Mu's Group can't sign a contract now,

201
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,120
Mr. Song, why don't you consider

202
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,160
my offer?

203
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,200
I'm sure we can
satisfy your requirements.

204
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,640
Miss Luo.

205
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,320
What are you doing here?

206
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,640
Is Leng Yehan in there?

207
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,280
I need to see him.

208
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,040
Mr. Leng is having

209
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,600
an important meeting.

210
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,040
No one is allowed to go in there.

211
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,440
Important?

212
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,280
That's better.

213
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,160
I really need to see him.

214
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,360
Let me in now.

215
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,560
I can't.

216
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,640
Why don't you tell me first?

217
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,840
Then I'll tell him.

218
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,280
It's something

219
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,160
indescribable

220
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,040
and inappropriate for kids.

221
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,680
You don't need to know.

222
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,960
Song's Group

223
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,040
just got listed.

224
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
Cost is not the biggest concern now.

225
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,120
We can't

226
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,080
let anything

227
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,600
affect our stock price.

228
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,240
Mu's Group

229
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,760
has been run by two generations.

230
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,640
Mr. Mu and I are old acquaintances.

231
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,880
It's natural that I trust them better.

232
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,560
Leng's Group is a rising star
for the last three years.

233
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
But,

234
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,200
I don't know you well.

235
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,840
How can you guarantee

236
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,760
that you won't have any bad news

237
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,080
that will affect me?

238
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,000
Mr. Song.

239
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't worry about that.

240
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,520
Leng Yehan!

241
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,160
