1
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,320
This is not the same.

2
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,440
Perfect. This is a good choice.

3
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:30,920
Awesome.

4
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,600
Good job.

5
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,920
I’m impressed.

6
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,200
Your inner self is so good.

7
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,080
You did it.

8
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,200
Hello.

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,400
Kris,Can you come to my home urgently?

10
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,720
What, I'm working now!

11
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,640
Natty is going to die!

12
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,960
Seriously? Almost dying?

13
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,560
Alright, I'll go.

14
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,000
Coach.

15
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,920
Can I go home early today?

16
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,480
I have an urgent matter.

17
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,320
Okay. It's almost end of rehearsal time anyway.

18
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,840
Thank you.

19
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,840
That’s fine.

20
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,280
What happened?

21
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,440
Nat is in trouble, I’m not sure what happened.

22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,440
I’ve to go now.

23
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,440
Can I go with you?

24
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,480
You don't need to go. Stay here.

25
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,160
But..

26
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,120
I will be back late tonight.

27
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,480
See you at home.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh Nat..

29
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,200
why is she in this state?

30
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,200
Look at her.

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,400
Last night she was drunk,

32
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,720
crying and complaining about wanting to die or something.

33
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,000
I’m here.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,800
I don’t want to be in love anymore.

35
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,400
Take it easy, calm down and speak slowly.

36
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,280
I thought if I invested more in love,

37
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,800
I'd only meet good people.

38
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,560
But this time, when I got serious,

39
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
he freaking left me.

40
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,840
I will probably never be loved again.

41
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,240
Oh Nat, it's me! I love you so much!

42
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,480
Even though you annoy me sometimes,

43
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,480
I still love you!

44
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,320
I... Well, you already know.

45
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,320
You guys are my friends, You can't fuck me.

46
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,240
Nat, do you want to fuck us?

47
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,480
Ever since you got a girlfriend, you've become more perverted.

48
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,200
She said it.

49
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,360
I miss when I was with Joe.

50
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,800
Even though we fought,

51
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,680
I saw a future.

52
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,520
When I was with him,

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I was really happy.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,200
But I don't know when we stopped loving each other.

55
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,440
We're side by side, but it feels like strangers now.

56
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,280
Karn!

57
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,840
He hasn't been happy since he saw me.

58
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,040
I’m tired, I want to quit.

59
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,760
You will always be precious for us.

60
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,840
Natt.

61
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,240
My friend isn't the type to cry easily over things like this, right?

62
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,280
You look terrible, you know that?

63
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,920
Let's take a break then.

64
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,600
Thank you so much for helping me today.

65
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,560
No, You’re always good.

66
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,760
If you are available today,

67
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,320
would you like to have dinner together?

68
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Today?

69
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,160
Umm.

70
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,000
Or do you have a date with Kris?

71
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,400
Kris will be back late tonight.

72
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,680
So let’s go to have dinner.

73
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Okay deal.

74
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,120
What's wrong?

75
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I noticed this a while ago.

76
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,680
You've been out of it lately, but you still have time to observe me.

77
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,920
Who is? This is Khun Meen .

78
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,680
Yes, Khun Meen.

79
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,680
So, what's going on with you?

80
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,160
Haven't you talked with Karn yet?

81
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,560
We didn't fight,

82
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,520
but it's like...

83
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,600
I feel jealous over something silly.

84
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,880
But She never understands me at all.

85
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,880
Are you going back to how you were when you first met?

86
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,760
No.

87
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,120
I'm not like that anymore. I've learned.

88
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,960
Yes

89
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,120
I'm trying to be a good girlfriend to her.

90
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,720
Hey,

91
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,560
even good couples can argue.

92
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,240
How are you getting home?

93
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,520
Should I take you home?

94
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,760
May I disturb you?

95
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,760
Sure, I will.
