1
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,160
But my dream is...

2
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,320
to see my girlfriend follow her dreams up close instead.

3
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,320
I’m only allowing this once,

4
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,680
If you act with anyone else, you'll definitely see me!

5
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,560
Not scared at all.

6
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,520
Aren't you even scared?

7
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,240
Catch me if you can.

8
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,600
Karn.

9
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,360
What.
I get it now.

10
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,480
You have to imagine that K’Tiwa was me.

11
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,440
Exactly.

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,440
Thank you.

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,600
My good girl.

14
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,840
Let's eat together after this is done, okay?

15
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,640
Why can't you get up by yourself?

16
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,360
Do you want me to carry you?

17
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,720
I’m ready.

18
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay.

19
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
if you’re ready. start!

20
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,800
Why? Are you doing this to cover up your shyness?

21
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,720
Not at all.

22
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,760
The person who  is shy

23
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,160
is you.

24
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,640
Why do I have to shy?

25
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,960
You're blushing!

26
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,520
What are you thinking?

27
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,520
Stop it.

28
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,960
That's perfect.

29
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,880
keep being like this everyday. I love it.

30
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,720
You guys are so romantic.

31
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,840
Is that delicious?

32
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,240
Did you taste it? This one is delicious.

33
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,200
Not yet.

34
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,400
How about today.

35
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
Are you tired?

36
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,360
Not much, your girlfriend is always good.

37
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,840
Look, you’re show off now.

38
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,720
I really like this one.	

39
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,280
When we first met.

40
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,920
You’re just blushing on me and kept drinking water.

41
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,680
It’s been a long time ago,

42
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,920
why are you still remembered?

43
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Sure.

44
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,840
I can remember everything about you.

45
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,000
Are you full, why didn’t you eat?

46
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,840
Um, I just want to go back home to hug you.

47
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,680
Don’t challenge me!

48
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,520
I will do, why?

49
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,080
I will pay for this meal.

50
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,800
Excuse me.

51
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,600
Kris.

52
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,080
Huh.

53
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
About the restaurant today,

54
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,560
you don’t have to take me to a luxury restaurant.

55
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,720
just being together like this is enough.

56
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,280
Don’t worry, I understand.

57
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,000
I’m sorry, I’m not good enough.

58
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,080
Don't say that to yourself.

59
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,600
Just give me your smile now.

60
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,160
I'm glad.

61
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,040
After this, we will be together every day.

62
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
I will charge a fee.

63
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,840
I don't have any work today, let's spend the whole day together.

64
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
I just want to travel.

65
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,360
Where do you want to go?

66
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,800
Norway! I'd love to go chasing the Aurora borealis.

67
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,320
What mood are you in, Khun Aonthakan?
