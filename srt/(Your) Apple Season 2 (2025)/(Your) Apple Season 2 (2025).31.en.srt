1
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,480
Because the most important thing is I want to make Karn happy.

2
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,560
Oh, Kris!

3
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Annoying!

4
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,880
Stop!

5
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,200
Hey Kris I have some good news for you!

6
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,200
What news?

7
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,560
Someone wants to hire you for a big brand!

8
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,000
A big company, really?

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,560
Yeah, a famous brand.

10
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,720
If you do well, you can go international!

11
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,640
International, really?

12
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,720
Yeah, congratulations!

13
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:33,880
Yay!

14
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,920
It's your time,

15
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,760
ultimate!

16
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,200
Let's do this!

17
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,520
You would be rich and successful!

18
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,920
Amen.

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,240
Karn.

20
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,160
Yes.

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,400
What’s up?

22
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm so excited!

23
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,880
I got a job with a world-renowned brand,

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,400
and Tae said if I get this job,

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,320
I might even go international!

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,720
Really?

27
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
My Kris is the best!

28
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,000
When that happens, I'll take you everywhere.

29
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,200
We'll fly first class to go out for dinner and shopping in Paris.

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,840
and then go see the Northern Lights, just like you've always wanted.

31
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,520
It doesn't have to be that luxury.

32
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,040
I'm just incredibly happy having Chris.

33
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,240
Karn,

34
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,800
do you know I want to do everything with you.

35
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,360
Of course.

36
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,880
Because I want to do everything with you too.

37
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,240
When you say "everything"

38
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,040
does that include this?

39
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,240
We've been together this long, and you still have to ask?

40
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,680
I have to go now, but the meal is on the table.

41
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,520
Have a great day at work today.

42
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,160
I know my Kris is super capable.
