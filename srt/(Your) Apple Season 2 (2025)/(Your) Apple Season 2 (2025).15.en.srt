13
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,160
Is that Kris?

14
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,920
No.

15
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,640
Yes, I’m. Hello.

16
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,520

17
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,240
See you tomorrow.

18
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,720
Alright, my time is over.

19
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,360
What are you doing?

20
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,720
You keep talking with her.

21
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,040
Are you mad at me?

22
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,240
I’m not mad.

23
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,240
How can I be mad at you?

24
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,400
I’m jealous.

25
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,760
You look soooo happy.

26
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,200
With Tiwa?

27
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Don't you trust me that much?

28
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
It's not like that.

29
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,560
I apologize. It's my fault.

30
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,640
Please don't be mad at me.

31
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,840
I do love you so much.

32
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,360
Don't ever think like that again.

33
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,040
Me too.

34
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't be mad at me.

35
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,960
You’re too cute, so how can I be mad at you.

36
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,320
What do you want from me?

37
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,000
Didn’t you really know?

38
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,880
Then.. eat later.

39
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,480
What are you doing?

40
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,520
Why are you dressed like that?

41
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,440
Oh You're back darling,

42
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,680
Are you tired?

43
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,880
Should I give you a massage?

44
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,560
Sure.

45
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,680
Won't you really open your eyes?

46
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,640
What’s wrong with me?
