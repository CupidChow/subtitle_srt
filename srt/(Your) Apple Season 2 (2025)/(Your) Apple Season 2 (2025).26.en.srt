1
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,600
What is it?

2
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,560
Meen.

3
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,880
Say something!

4
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Beautiful.

5
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,520
You’re just talking aimlessly.

6
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,240
You’re really beautiful.

7
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,040
Yes! That's exactly it!

8
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,440
Awesome, hair is so waver…

9
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,480
Slay.

10
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,600
Exactly.

11
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,920
Sol.

12
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,160
Huh?

13
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,320
I've got a plan.

14
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,600
What?

15
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,600
You sure that's a good idea?

16
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,400
I really want to curse you out right now,

17
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,240
but then I remembered you're the most experienced one in the group.

18
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,160
It's a sure thing.

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,320
Meen will definitely be in the palm of your hand

20
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,840
On hand.

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,000
That’s right.

22
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,240
Little Buffalo!

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,120
Yeah, she's gotta be in the palm of your hands.

24
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,680
Um that's right.

25
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,680
Just like that.

26
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,400
Get her under your thumb, my dear Sol.

27
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,720
Thank you.

28
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,000
You want some wine or...?

29
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
I want to drink wine.

30
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,120
Drink some wine first.

31
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,720
Okay, cheers!

32
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,240
Sol, you drink wine?

33
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,800
Yes, I do.

34
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,160
Hey.

35
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,480
Hey.

36
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,680
you're supposed to sip it!

37
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,080
It's all over!

38
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,960
your beautiful dress is all stained!

39
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,160
My throat's burning,

40
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,280
this isn't going as planned at all!

41
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,280
Not sexy anymore.

42
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,200
You're the cutest.

43
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,720
How cute?

44
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,120
I don't want to be cute,

45
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,040
I want to be sexy.

46
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,640
There's nothing wrong with being you.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,280
You don't need to change at all.

48
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,480
Tricky.

49
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,800
You're already cute!

50
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,200
But I wanna be sexy!

51
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,400
You don't even need to be sexy.

52
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,480
You're literally the best in the world just being yourself.

53
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,160
You don't have to try so hard,

54
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,800
you've done enough trying.

55
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,880
Let me try now.	

56
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,040
What are you doing?

57
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,760
Come take some shots.

58
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,800
What to shoot?

59
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,440
Just take it!

60
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,400
We can use it for our wedding.
