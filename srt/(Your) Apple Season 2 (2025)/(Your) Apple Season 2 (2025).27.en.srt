1
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,200
What am I even doing here?

2
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,240
If you keep hitting my head, I'm gonna get stupid.

3
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,760
You're already stupid!

4
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,120
Now hurry up and finish this, I still have to set up the room.

5
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,480
Earn won't be surprised

6
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,880
I'm doing!

7
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,400
The scissors aren't sharp at all.

8
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,120
Drink some water, Kris.

9
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,120
Thanks.

10
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,920
Oh, Hello Karn.

11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,680
Hello.

12
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,240
Hey guys.

13
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,240
I’m thristy.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,680
I'm sorry to have to ask you to help with something like this.

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,240
No problem, I wanted to see everyone anyway.

16
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,040
Right? I wanted to see you too.

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,680
Hey!

18
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,840
Be careful!

19
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,920
Look at my sister's face when you're messing around.

20
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,000
You're gonna die.

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,800
This scissors in my hand, it feels a little slippery.

22
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,560
I'm just kidding!

23
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,200
and about our groom, have you thought about it yet?

24
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,080
What about.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,640
Awwww

26
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,680
The moves!

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,480
This time it's official,

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,040
so it has to be more intense than at the office!

29
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,760
Damn it!

30
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,720
I'm totally remembering that day.

31
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:38,320
Honey! We should really tell everyone... that we're in a relationship!

32
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,920
Honey?

33
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
Don't even bring it up, I want to forget it.

34
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,040
Umm.

35
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,600
What?

36
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,000
You think just sitting there will save you?

37
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,160
Hey, I have scissors! P'Put!

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,880
Hurry!

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,320
P'Put  P'Put!

40
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,160
Hurry!

41
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,320
Yes, catch her!

42
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,560
Let’s catch her.

43
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,440
Don't move!

44
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,440
Oh, you two came together?

45
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,200
Yes.

46
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,400
Yeah.

47
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,880
Did you pick Kris up early this morning?

48
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,680
Pick up where? Kris didn't come back home last night.

49
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,360
I told you.

50
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,560
I didn't say anything!

51
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,320
That outfit looks familiar though.

52
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,120
Oh,

53
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,360
then Karn  isn't quitting anymore?

54
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
No, not anymore.

55
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,520
This means our app Talk is saved, then!

56
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:30,800
Hey!

57
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,520
Oops!!

58
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,800
Karn, are you awake?

59
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,840
Yes,  since you woke up.

60
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,040
So you were secretly following me, huh?

61
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,680
What were you thinking about that you didn't even notice I was walking behind you?

62
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,120
Just thinking about you on our first day.

63
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,480
What are you doing?

64
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,200
Come take some shots.

65
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,240
What to shoot?

66
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,880
Just take it!

67
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,840
We can use it for our wedding.

68
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,640
Hurry.

69
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,240
Ready?

70
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,320
Action

71
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,560
Hi Kris, I’m Aonthakan.

72
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,440
That was the first sentence I ever said to my girlfriend	

73
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,800
and do you know how she answers?

74
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,880
She reached out and touched me, but it was like she was disgusted.

75
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,040
Then she just walked away.

76
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,640
Karn, don't tease me like that!

77
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,720
I was such a mess that day.

78
00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:01,240
It's because she was falling in love with me so she didn't know what to do, right?

79
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,520
So, what do you like about Kris then?

80
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,840
Are you getting revenge on me?

81
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, you didn't answer me then.

82
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
	I like that she's getting drunk and making a mess.

83
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
She doesn't like to make up his bed after sleeping,

84
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,880
and she always assumes things, which leads to us fighting all the time.

85
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,240
Oh, and I also like that she speaks without thinking.

86
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,160
Are you sure about this?

87
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,240
I love the way she looks at me.

88
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,440
I love the way she says my name.

89
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,720
I love every part of her.

90
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,760
	what do you think?

91
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,040
Perfect for opening in our wedding,right?

92
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,640
Surprise!

93
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,120
Will you marry me?
