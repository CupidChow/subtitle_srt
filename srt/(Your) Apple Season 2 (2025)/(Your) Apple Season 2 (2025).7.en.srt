1
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
It finally happened.

2
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,000
Did you apologize to her?

3
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes I did,

4
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,400
I don’t know that she’s sick.

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,560
Why does she have to be so angry?

6
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,240
It’s just starting..

7
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,080
Hey.. Natt

8
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,620
Natt

9
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,640
What's wrong with you?

10
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,840
My couple is the same.

11
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,400
Little fights at the beginning, and then..

12
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,560
boom!

13
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,240
Don’t listen to her. She’s crazy!

14
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,320
Hey.. I'm serious.

15
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,240
If you continue to be like this, you guys will break up.

16
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,400
Break up?

17
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,280
Do you mean break up?

18
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,400
I don’t want to break up with her.

19
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,640
I don’t want to.

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,880
I don’t want to break up with her.

21
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,400
What are you saying?

22
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,640
Are you telling me...

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,360
to break up with Kris?

24
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,280
opportunities like this don't come often.

25
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,920
Especially if everyone knows you have a girlfriend,

26
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,080
they might reject us.

27
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,040
Are you okay to accept?

28
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,880
I’d prefer not to.

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,520
Why not?

30
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,240
It's not easy for a streaming platform at that level to offer us a role.

31
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,080
I know,

32
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,240
but spread the news out like that

33
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,480
wouldn't be too disrespectful to my girlfriend, would it?

34
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,880
but this is just spreading fake news. it’s not real.

35
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,880
If the condition is my personal matter,

36
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,080
I might not be a good choice for them.

37
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,680
But they specifically chose you,

38
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,880
and opportunities like this don't come around easily.

39
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,160
I understand,

40
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,480
But I also want to make my girlfriend feel comfortable.

41
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,600
And the opportunity to act  with a famous star like Tiwa,

42
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,000
will come again?

43
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,000
Thank you for the opportunity

44
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,040
but it would be better if you offered it to another.

45
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,480
P’toon, I have something to talk with you.

46
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,280
Yes, what’s up Tiwa?

47
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,040
Come on.

48
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,040
Why didn’t you pour me? you’re host.

49
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,120
Do it.

50
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,720
Hey..

51
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,320
why are you drinking too much,

52
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,320
you will be tight.

53
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,200
Eh, would you try my way?

54
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,680
What about your way?

55
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,400
Cause you’re planning to apologize to her,

56
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:56,080
I once read a novel where they said if you would like to apologize with a partner you have to seduce her.

57
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,920
Seduce!?

58
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:05,240
It's like… if you can't solve problems by peace then just get naked.

59
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,640
Hey.. Are you telling me to strip naked and dance seductively?

60
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,400
Oh... you truly are like a little buffalo.

61
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,240
Eh! If you're so great,

62
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,440
then come and apologize to me! I'm really sulky!

63
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,840
No.

64
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,440
Why not?

65
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,160
I think this way is well.

66
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,120
because some words don't work,

67
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,120
but I think using body is better.

68
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,800
Since you turn dark ,

69
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,400
you're so obscene.

70
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,800
Karn, Am I look tasty?

71
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,960
Stop it!!

72
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,520
You guys are hopeless,

73
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,400
It has to be like this.

74
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,960
Karn, Are you tired?

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,960
Let me give you a massage.

76
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,080
That's so creepy.

77
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,840
Why, I’m helping you.

78
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
Thank you, no more next time.

79
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,480
Hey Kris,

80
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,600
I have some good ways.

81
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,000
listen to me.

82
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,000
Get out!

83
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,840
okay, I will note.

84
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,040
It’s….

85
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,360
Hello Madam,

86
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,160
you’re just come back home,  would you drink wine or tea?

87
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,080
The wine has spilled then what can I drink?

88
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
Please have a seat, Madam.

89
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,120
I will be back.

90
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,480
Is there no service for madam anymore?

91
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,960
Karn, it will be dirty.

92
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,320
I’m not Karn,

93
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,840
I’m Madam.

94
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,560
Then Has Madam stopped being angry?

95
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,040
Not yet..

96
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,520
let me see how you treat me.

97
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
So can you kiss me again?

98
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,960
I just rejected some projects today.

99
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,160
It's a huge project.

100
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,320
Why did you reject it?
