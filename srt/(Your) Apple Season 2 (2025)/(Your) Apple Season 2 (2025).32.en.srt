1
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,680
Let me see

2
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,760
Throughout the past year,

3
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,240
How far has Kris developed?

4
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,000
Just don't tell me to stop.

5
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,000
Our schedule has been so busy since that day.

6
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,280
I love you.

7
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,160
Let's stay together for a long time.

8
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,040
Cut!

9
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,280
Excellent!

10
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,600
I knew I made the right choice with you.

11
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,080
We barely even talked.

12
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,240
When I got home, Karn was already asleep.

13
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,560
I have to go now, but the meal is on the table.

14
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,400
Have a great day at work today.

15
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,040
I know my Kris is super capable.

16
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,840
And for my beloved friends,

17
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,320
Meen and Sol have been sweeter than ever since they broke down their walls –

18
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,280
it's almost sickening!

19
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,520
And Natty, She's off on another journey of self-discovery.

20
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,280
But I'm trying?

21
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,920
And what's wrong with it? This is good.

22
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,680
The married couple fights all the time.

23
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,760
I don't know why,

24
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,600
we were so sweet to each other at first,

25
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,160
But after getting married, it's nothing like I thought it would be.

26
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,320
And the role of advisor always falls to me, the excellent younger sister.

27
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,680
That's married life.

28
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,360
So, are you going to break up?

29
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,000
No way, I'm not quitting! Are you crazy?

30
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,400
See?

31
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,360
What's the point?

32
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,360
As for me,

33
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,560
after P'Tae invited me to work for that famous brand,

34
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,640
I got more opportunities.

35
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,760
More people hired me.

36
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,160
Now I can confidently say I can support myself and Karn with this career.

37
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,960
Wow, you've really become a pro!

38
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Well, I learned a lot from you.

39
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,480
You praise me this much!

40
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,000
Anyway, are you free this evening?

41
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,880
Sure.

42
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,720
I have a client who wants to talk to you about an ad.

43
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,040
Can you accept it next month?

44
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,360
Next month?

45
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,520
Yes, I'm free. I'll accept it!

46
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,280
Okay, I'll let them know then.

47
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,800
Oh, it really is a big job!

48
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,080
Congratulations!

49
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,400
Thanks, I'm happy too!

50
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,560
Meanwhile,

51
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:46,120
Karn's series with Tiwa has become a huge success, exploding in popularity both in Thailand and internationally.

52
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,280
She's constantly at events

53
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,800
and flying for fan meetings, so she's incredibly busy.

54
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,360
It's rare for us to have time together like this.

55
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,040
You're so lovely, anyone would fall for you.

56
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,720
Kris, don't tease me!

57
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,720
Actually, You seem so much more confident now.

58
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,040
You've got a real star aura!

59
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,000
Kris...

60
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,760
Seriously!

61
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,360
I love the look in your eyes when you get to do something you really enjoy like that.

62
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,920
Thank you for always supporting me.

63
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
I should be thanking you too, Karn.

64
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,880
So beautiful, Whose girlfriend?

65
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,160
Don't knowwww.

66
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,360
Whose girlfriend?

67
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,920
I don't know.

68
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,560
Tell me now!

69
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,360
I don't know.

70
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,600
I'm mad now.

71
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,880
Your girlfriend.

72
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,480
What did you do wrong this time?
