1
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,400
I'm going to propose to Karn.

2
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,800
Seriously.

3
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,480
Are you being ridiculous?

4
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,120
It's a wedding,

5
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,840
not something you just say you'll do and then it happens.

6
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,520
Meen, back me up!

7
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,360
Are you sure you're not just into it because of Pud's wedding?

8
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,000
No, and I didn't say I will get married right now in this second either.

9
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,520
So what do you want to do then?

10
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,640
I want to get engaged first.

11
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,520
Oh, so basically you're just afraid Karn will meet someone sensible,

12
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,400
prettier, and bustier than you, right?

13
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:40,960
Sol!

14
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,560
Kris is messing with me again!

15
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,280
It's okay.

16
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,840
Oh, wow! just one time and you're acting cool.

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,720
I think I'm going to get engaged and then get married right away.

18
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,600
But what should I start with?

19
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,360
A ring,

20
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,760
it has to start with a ring.

21
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,760
Oh you’re here,

22
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,920
Come sit with me.

23
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,880
Would you like to read?

24
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,920
No,It's okay. you can read.

25
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,640
Okay.

26
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,320
Umm.

27
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,840
I want to be with you equally on both sides.

28
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,640
What are you doing?

29
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,600
Your hands look a bit dry.

30
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,000
I'll get you some hand cream.

31
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,880
What role are you playing these days?

32
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,120
Huh? Don't you know?

33
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,760
You're my heroine.

34
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,560
Are you hot?

35
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,000
You're all sweaty.

36
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,080
Oh,

37
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,520
it's really hot.

38
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,760
Let's eat.

39
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,800
Kris.

40
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,720
Kris!

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,760
Yes?

42
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,800
Eat up quickly, I want to know if you'll like it.

43
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,000
I like everything you make.

44
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,480
Come here, I'll feed you.

45
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,240
Have this first.

46
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,200
Is it not delicious?

47
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,880
Drink some water.

48
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:20,240
You've worked so much your brain is totally worn out.

49
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,040
Let's just keep eating. Come on.

51
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,480
My dearest Karn.

52
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,960
Yes?

53
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,200
I love you so much!

54
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,880
What mood are you in?

55
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,040
I love you too.

56
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Am I cool?

57
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,120
Yeah, you’re cool!

58
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,360
So what are you gonna do next?

59
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,280
I've been waiting for this for a long time.

60
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,720
My heart hasn't been my own for a long time.

61
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,200
I think we have some good ideas.

62
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,840
Hey, hey! Oh my god, someone fainted!

63
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,400
What are you laughing at, P'Pud?  What's so funny?

64
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,840
Let me go!
