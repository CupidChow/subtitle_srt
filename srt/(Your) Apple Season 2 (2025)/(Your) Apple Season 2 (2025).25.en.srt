1
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,640
	Hey... What should I do?

2
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,600
What's up?

3
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,680
I'm going to ask Earn to marry me!

4
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,560
Hey.

5
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,520
Hey.

6
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,040
Ask Earn to marry you?

7
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,960
Are you going to have a wife?

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,800
You're going to ask Earn to marry you!

9
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm so happy for you! So happy!

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,160
Oh, not yet!

11
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,120
Why do you have to be the first to know?

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,080
Huh? What's wrong with it being me?

13
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,880
So, where and how?

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,760
Ugh, I don't know!

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,280
I've never proposed to anyone before!

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,200
I have an idea!

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,320
How about this?

18
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,600
We go out to sea, big bro! Rent a huge yacht,

19
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,600
then light up fireworks in the shape of a ring, a heart, "Will you marry me?"

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,400
Oh, just thinking about it, it's so romantic!

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,480
Can I count on you?

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,800
Bro, just do it!

23
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,880
Are you crazy? Isn't that too much?

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,520
What's wrong with it?

25
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,760
Excuse me,

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,200
I think she would probably prefer a surprise that's not too flashy,

27
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,920
but also not too plain.

28
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,760
the moment like they’re being together by themselves.

29
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,200
Khun Karn.

30
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,120
Huh?

31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,080
Are you free today?

32
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,840
I need a consultation about something.

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,520
Yes.

34
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,560
Look at this person who can help me...

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,120
Oh what!

36
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,480
So how am I unreliable?

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,840
Oh wow, sure you can!

38
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,960
With all the yacht trips and everything.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,200
It's romantic, super romantic!

40
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,760
It's too much.

41
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,320
Look, Khun Karn is more believable, more realistic.

42
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,240
This is Earn's boyfriend.

43
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,960
Finally he go.

44
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,880
Puth is the same

45
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,480
Is he still a crazy dog?

46
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,960
That’s your brother.

47
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,760
It's exciting that he is getting married.

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,760
I’m a bit sad.

49
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,120
We've been together since we were kids, and now he's going to have his own family.

50
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,000
Are you possessive of him?

51
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,240
Possessive of what?

52
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,320
I'm worried about Earn! If she ends up with him,

53
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,840
she's going to have a headache every day.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,880
I didn't even say anything yet,

55
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,760
Why are you so sensitive?

56
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,480
they will know you're stuck with your brother.

57
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,120
I wish I could get married too.

58
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,800
What wrong?

59
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,120
You just said you wanted to get married, right?

60
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,880
Oh, I was just saying it casually, as a joke.

61
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,720
You get startled so easily.

62
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,560
Babe, you're back?

63
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,000
Sol!

64
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,120
Shit!

65
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,680
What the heck?

66
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,840
Let me take a picture first!

67
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,040
Wait, wait!

68
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,600
Catch her, I'm gonna take a picture.

69
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,800
I didn't even invite you guys here!

70
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,760
How'd you come up?

71
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,520
Just visiting!

72
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,040
I want to take a picture.

73
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,120
No, no!

74
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,920
I love this!

75
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,520
No way.

76
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,320
Look at her, look at her mouth!

77
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,520
Don't tease her anymore, she's about to cry.

78
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,840
Am I not pretty?

79
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,240
You are, you're pretty.

80
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,800
Are my eyes not pretty?

81
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,000
You usually look good when you put on make-up.

82
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,320
Why do you look so weird today?

83
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,240
I put a lot of effort into this.

84
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,120
I saw this new trend and they look amazing, so I wanted to try it.

85
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,040
I even bought a new lipstick for my lips.

86
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
I think we should give you a renovate.

87
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,000
Renovate?

88
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,080
My face?!

89
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,720
Is it that bad?

90
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,520
I beg you.

91
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,360
That’s scary.

92
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,560
I'm begging you, just for today.

93
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,080
Do you have wet wipes?

94
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,760
Do I really have to take it all off?

95
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,840
The star is definitely coming.

96
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,680
I'll help you.

97
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,960
We're friends so I have to help you.

98
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,880
Who sent this?

99
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,000
Are you ready to open your gift?

100
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,240
Come on, Miss Meen.

101
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,920
	What the hell are you guys doing?

102
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,040
Oh, that's not very polite.

103
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,840
What’s that?

104
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,680
Time for the big moment!

105
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,760
Hey, why are you coming so close to me?!

106
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,320
	Come in.

107
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,560
Hey, what the hell?

108
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,680
The door's open.

109
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,440
I've done this much for you.

110
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:55,480
If you still can't get it, then you're incompetent, Okay?

111
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,720
It’s time! I've served it up to you.

112
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,800
Yesssss

113
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,080
What is it?

114
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,360
Sol.

115
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,600
Huh?

116
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,760
I've got a plan.

117
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,360
What?

118
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,000
You sure that's a good idea?

119
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,680
Meen will definitely be in the palm of your hand

120
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,160
On hand.

121
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,960
That’s right.

122
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,960
Yeah, she's gotta be in the palm of your hands.

123
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,600
You want some wine or...?
