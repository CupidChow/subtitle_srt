1
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,400
Pud,

2
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,680
I think your sister was possessed by a ghost.

3
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,680
But I think it's normal,

4
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,560
she looks more like the ghost left.

5
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,800
I'm being sarcastic.

6
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,680
Pud, this is your duty.

7
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,720
I guess there's only one thing that could make your sister be like this.

8
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,240
What is that?

9
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,360
Heart

10
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
What are you guys doing with my ears!?

11
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,320
look at your sister.

12
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,720
Toh..

13
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,120
What?

14
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,000
What?

15
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,080
Get out!

16
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh!! why.

17
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,000
There's a crowded seating area

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,120
and you are as big as a buffalo,you still came to snatch the seat from me!!

19
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,120
Hey..

20
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,120
this is my office,

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,000
this is my chair,

22
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,000
why can’t I sit here??

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,640
Oh,

24
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,560
what are you playing at this age?

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,160
and what happened to you?

26
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,040
Do you think I made the correct decision?

27
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,880
What about?

28
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,840
Job.

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,360
You look happy with your job.

30
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,400
I’m happy

31
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,120
but…

32
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,840
Kris...

33
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
I don't have enough money.

34
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,240
I think when it comes to work,

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,840
it's worth trying to give it your absolute all first.

36
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,080
And if it's still not good,

37
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,840
then I think you can change jobs.

38
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,480
But the experience you've gained won't disappear.

39
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,120
Do you really think I can keep going?

40
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,320
Sure.

41
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,720
- Let’s do it!
-  Don’t touch my hair, it's messy.

42
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,880
I will be your guide.

43
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,240
Thank you.

44
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
Hello.

45
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,760
Kris.

46
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,400
Kris help me please.

47
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,840
What wrong with you.

48
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,480
Um…

49
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,360
Um I… Um

50
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,920
Just say it out!

51
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,160
When you're make love with Karn, how do you do?

52
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,960
What are you talking about!?

53
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,920
Well, I get shy when I have to do it with Meen.

54
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,120
Wait a moment.

55
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,400
This, Get more!

56
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,560
What the hell

57
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,320
If you want it, just get it!

58
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,000
I like you.

59
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,720
I don’t even know how it started..

60
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,160
When...

61
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,880
ouch…

62
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,880
But I’m tired,

63
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,800
so I want to take a rest.

64
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,800
I’m tired too.

65
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,200
But it’s okay,

66
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,440
we can try together.

67
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,240
I want to improve

68
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,440
and be a professional quickly,

69
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,600
so I can take a photo of a famous actress like you.

70
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,760
If I stop doing it.

71
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,840
Will I destroy her dream?

72
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,320
Hello.

73
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,240
Hello.

74
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,800
Hello Karn, Are you free?

75
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,800
I want to practice our script.

76
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,240
Ah.

77
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,480
Okay.

78
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,400
I’m reading a script too.

79
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,760
Ah.. which scene?

80
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,360
Got it. let's go together next time.

81
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,000
I like omelette. It’s easy.

82
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,720
Is that Kris?

83
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,560
Yes, I’m. Hello.

84
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,480
Are you mad at me?

85
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,760
Oh You're back darling,

86
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,120
Should I give you a massage?
