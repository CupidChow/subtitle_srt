1
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,400
I will charge a viewing fee.

2
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,880
How much is this one?

3
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,440
and for this?

4
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,360
Enough! I'm tickled.

5
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,640
You have bad breath.

6
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,520
I've already brushed my tongue.

7
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,480
Even if it bad smell, I still love you

8
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,840
So romantic.

9
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
I don't have any work today,

10
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,440
let's spend the whole day together.

11
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,120
I can't do it today.

12
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,240
This afternoon I have to bring something to P'Pud,

13
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,960
but when I be back we can be together.

14
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,760
I just wanna kiss, to be sure that you love me too.

15
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Please kiss me so my heart knows how much I love you.

16
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,000
There might be times we argue.

17
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,280
And don't quite understand each other.

18
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,000
Please don't get tired of me yet.

19
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,200
There might be times we don't quite click,

20
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,240
Do everything wrong, I'm sorry.

21
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,400
You and I have our differences,

22
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,160
But I like everything about you.

23
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,080
Can you stay with me for a long time?

24
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,840
I want you right now!

25
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,520
Oh my shawty, do you know?

26
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,760
I'm happy every time I know that you are here.

27
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,120
It's okay, no matter how long it takes, I still love you.

28
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,880
Please kiss me and make this heart of mine swell up, full inside.

29
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:41,640
Could you do it just once? Let my heart be filled with joy through your lips.

30
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,640
I just wanna kiss, to be sure that you love me too.

31
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,080
Please kiss me so my heart knows how much I love you.

32
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,920
Kris.

33
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,320
When will you be free again?

34
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,400
Not sure, because if there is urgent work I have to go immediately.

35
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
Why?

36
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,920
Nothing.

37
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,920
I just want to travel.

38
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,560
Where do you want to go?

39
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,920
Norway! I'd love to go chasing the Aurora borealis.

40
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,960
What mood are you in, Khun Aonthakan?

41
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,160
Pleaseeeee.

42
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,080
Can we go there?

43
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,680
Pleaseeeee.

44
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,600
Why are you closing your eyes?

45
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,200
I'm afraid that if I make eye contact, I’ll give in.

46
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,200
Then can we go?

47
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,680
Is next year okay?

48
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,160
I think I can’t do it this time.

49
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,080
Next year?

50
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,120
And how about in Thailand,

51
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,960
North Thailand is still okay.

52
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,280
I really don't think I can do it right now.

53
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,120
I'm sorry.

54
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,080
It’s okay, I can wait.

55
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,480
Since you’re filming a series during this period,

56
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,440
you can focus on your work.

57
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,520
But I’m tired

58
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,600
so I want to take a rest.

59
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,200
I’m tired too.

60
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,800
But it’s okay,

61
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,000
we can try together.

62
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,720
I want to improve

63
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,960
and be a professional quickly,

64
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,240
so I can take a photo of a famous actress like you.

65
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,480
Um,

66
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,120
Kris.

67
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,480
and If one day you no longer enjoy taking photos,

68
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,240
what would you do?

69
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,240
I don’t know,

70
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,360
but I can do everything for your dream.

71
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Thank you.

72
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,840
Then I continue eating.

73
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,200
Pud,

74
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,920
I think your sister was possessed by a ghost.

75
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,680
Do you think I made the correct decision?

76
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
You look happy with your job.

77
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,360
I’m happy

78
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
I don't have enough money.

79
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,160
Kris help me please.

80
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,840
What wrong with you.

81
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,920
What the hell

82
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,600
If you want it, just get it!
