1
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,440
I’m tickled.

2
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,680
What you do,

3
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,120
Are you fun?

4
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Am I cool?

5
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,720
Yeah, you’re cool!

6
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,920
So what are you gonna do next?

7
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,600
I'm thinking of buying a ring right away.

8
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,400
Isn't that too fast?

9
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,800
No, it's not fast,

10
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,720
I've been waiting for this for a long time.

11
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,160
My heart hasn't been my own for a long time.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,640
Like, I've been dreaming of our wedding.

13
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,360
Oh she sing a song.

14
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,640
I think if we let her find, it'll be a disaster.

15
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Yeah, it'll definitely be a disaster.

16
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,760
I think we have some good ideas.

17
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,640
Yes yes

18
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,400
Plan 1 A book of love.

19
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,520
Karn,

20
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,760
could you read this book to me?

21
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,760
Of course.

22
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,040
I didn't realize you read this kind of genre.

23
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,120
Well, I want to learn new things lately.

24
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,040
Yes.

25
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,920
The reader wants to read good books.

26
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,640
He got rich from Thai literature,

27
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,680
though he has no idea what literature even is.

28
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,440
All he does is talk to pressure people into selling him stories cheaply.

29
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,840
Regarding answering letters from readers,

30
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,960
the author is worried it'll take up too much space in the book,

31
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,800
so the best they can do is include letters from commissioning institutions

32
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,720
in each issue when appropriate.

33
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,600
For me, mining isn't an academic,

34
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,560
it's not an industry,

35
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,560
and it's not a business.

36
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,600
For me, mining is a human city.

37
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,080
I think angels and Yama have gone into partnership.

38
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,400
Intelligence brings a person fame,

39
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,320
but an ordinary person like me lives a life that isn't a straight line.

40
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,360
With little education, you have to rely a lot on kindness.

41
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,720
Kris,

42
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,320
it hasn't even been 10 minutes yet.

43
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:30,680
Plan 1 Failed.

44
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:41,520
Plan 2 Announce to the world that love.

45
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,840
Hey, hey! Oh my god, someone fainted!

46
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:34,280
Plan 2 Failed because Kris is stupid.

47
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,280
And then my vision just cut out.

48
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,680
What are you laughing at, P'Pud?  What's so funny?

49
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,280
Let me go!

50
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,240
Come here. I'd be stupid to let you go now.

51
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,640
Let me go, you're hurting me! I'll tell Mom!

52
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,400
Stop! P’Phut!

53
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,360
But she started it.

54
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,760
But I think Karn might not want a big surprise proposal anyway.

55
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,600
Right?

56
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,120
Yes, my love.

57
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,120
Why is my darling so smart?

58
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,840
I don't know,

59
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,720
but ultimately I'll have to wait until Karn is ready.

60
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,560
Because the most important thing is I want to make Karn happy.

61
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,640
Oh, Kris!

62
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Annoying!

63
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,960
Stop!

64
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,760
A big company, really?

65
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,120
Yeah, a famous brand.

66
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,160
If you do well, you can go international!

67
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,440
International, really?

68
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,480
Yeah, congratulations!

69
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,120
My Kris is the best!

70
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:43,080
do you know I want to do everything with you.

71
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,000
I want to do everything with you too.

72
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,680
you still have to ask?
