00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,840

3
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640

4
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,560
The wine has spilled then what can I drink?

5
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Please have a seat, Madam.

6
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,600
I will follow you soon.

7
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,960
Is there no service for madam anymore?

8
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,440
Karn, it will be dirty.

9
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,800
I’m not Karn,

10
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,320
I’m Madam.

11
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,040
Then Has Madam stopped being angry?

12
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,520
Not yet..

13
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,000
let me see how you treat me.

14
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,680
Kris

15
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,680
Hm.

16
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,680
I apologize for being grumpy to you today.

17
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,720
I should understand.

18
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,920
That’s alright,

19
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,720
I apologize too.

20
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,520
So can you kiss me again?

21
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,520
I just rejected some projects today.

22
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,840
It's a huge project.

23
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,880
Why did you reject it?

24
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,520
It’s a friendship series

25
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,800
but they would like to pairing partners also.

26
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,480
So I..

27
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,480
Did you reject the project because of me?

28
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,520
No, I have decided.

29
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,720
It's a shame,

30
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,960
Don't you regret it?

31
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,080
Don’t worry about me.

32
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,000
You can decide it all,

33
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,480
that's your dream.

34
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,280
No matter what, We still love each other.

35
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,400
Kris.

36
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,440
Hm.

37
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,800
Nothing.

38
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,160
Thank you.

39
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,160
Hello P’toon,

40
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,160
I have good news.

41
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,840
What do you do when you make love with Karn??

42
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,160
Keep your voice down!
