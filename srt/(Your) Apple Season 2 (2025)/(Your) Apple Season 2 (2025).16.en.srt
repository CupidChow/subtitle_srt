1
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,320
What are you doing?

2
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,360
Why are you dressed like that?

3
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,280
Oh You're back darling,

4
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,520
Are you tired?

5
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,720
Should I give you a massage?

6
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,400
Sure.

7
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,520
Won't you really open your eyes?

8
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,760
Thanks for trying.

9
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,800
Um.

10
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,560
Who the hell is that!?

11
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,200
Nat!!

12
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,560
He broke up with me.

13
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,200
What’s wrong with me?

14
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,000
Kris.

15
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,360
Are you finished yet? It will be late.

16
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,840
Okay, shall we go now?

17
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,600
I will wait in the car.

18
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,560
Okay.

19
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,360
Good girlfriend.. be a good girlfriend.

20
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,560
If the relationship between us is not the same, will you…

21
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,560
Then what isn't the same?

22
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,760
If you want to talk, just say it.

23
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,120
Karn, What’s wrong with you!

24
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,640
just a little more.

25
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,160
I’m sorry.

26
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,760
But I think she did it right in this scene.

27
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,440
The character's emotions haven't reached the point of a kiss.

28
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,800
Even if she feels good, she wouldn't dare enough.

29
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,560
Really?

30
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,800
If you think this is a good choice, just try this choice.

31
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,360
Yes.

32
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,920
Okay, try again.

33
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,200
Thank you.

34
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,800
It’s my pleasure.

35
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,120
You just have to imagine that I was Kris.

36
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,840
Kris?

37
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,760
I will try to.

38
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,440
This is not the same.

39
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,560
Perfect. This is a good choice.

40
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,000
Awesome.

41
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,720
Good job.

42
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,040
I’m impressed.

43
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,320
Your inner self is so good.

44
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,200
You did it.

45
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,320
Hello.

46
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,520
Kris,Can you come to my home urgently?

47
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,840
What, I'm working now!

48
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,760
Natty is going to die!

49
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,080
Seriously? Almost dying?

50
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,680
Alright, I'll go.

51
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,120
Coach.

52
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,040
Can I go home early today?

53
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,600
I have an urgent matter.

54
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,440
Okay. It's almost end of rehearsal time anyway.

55
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:12,920
Thank you.

56
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
That’s fine.

57
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,400
What happened?

58
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,560
Nat is in trouble, I’m not sure what happened.

59
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,560
I’ve to go now.

60
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,560
Can I go with you?

61
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,600
You don't need to go. Stay here.

62
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,280
But..

63
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,240
I will be back late tonight.

64
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,600
See you at home.

65
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,400
I don’t want to be in love anymore.

66
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,080
Take it easy, calm down and speak slowly.

67
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,880
We're side by side, but it feels like strangers now.
