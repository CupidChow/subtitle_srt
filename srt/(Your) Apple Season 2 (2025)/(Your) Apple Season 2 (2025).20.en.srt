1
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,880
Are you alright?

2
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,040
It's my fault.

3
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,760
It's all my fault.

4
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,520
Calm down.

5
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,400
Just calm down.

6
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,920
Here's some warm water.

7
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,400
Are you okay now?

8
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,640
Tell me what happened.

9
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,360
Kris and I had argued.

10
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,960
I felt so uncomfortable then  I accidentally said something bad to her.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,400
Even though she didn't do anything wrong at all.

12
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,000
She didn't even know about my work issues.

13
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,960
But I get tired when she admires me.

14
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,880
And have you told her about work yet?

15
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,440
She doesn't listen to anything I say..

16
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,240
Kris just keeps accusing me of being happy with someone else.

17
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,240
She never trusts me.

18
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,480
Did you two argue because of me? Don’t tell me that.

19
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,040
The starting point might have been,

20
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,040
but mainly it's because of us.

21
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,120
Karn, I'm really sorry.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,400
You don't need to apologize.

23
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,160
You didn't do anything wrong at all.

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,160
I was partly involved too.

25
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,640
I'll help you to reconcile with her.

26
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,000
She doesn't even want to look at my face.

27
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,840
Don't you love her anymore?

28
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
I do,

29
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,200
I do love her.

30
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,240
I still love her very much.

31
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,800
That's good.

32
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,840
I believe that she loves you very much too.

33
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,600
Now you two just need time.

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,240
Meanwhile, I'll be by your side.

35
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,240
Thank you.

36
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,840
It’s okay.

37
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,040
Oh, what's up?

38
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,040
I haven't seen you around lately.

39
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,240
you’re so stuck with your girlfriend.

40
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,720
Hello? How’s it going?

41
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,800
Is that Dejavu?

42
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,600
I think so.

43
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,160
What’s wrong with his sister?

44
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,440
Do you want to know?

45
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,760
Yeah, I really want to know.

46
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,640
Let ask her.

47
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,040
Yeah, You should ask her.

48
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,640
It’s you .

49
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,480
It's you,dude!

50
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,200
You should!

51
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,000
Toh!

52
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,120
Let’s go!

53
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,760
I will walk by myself.

54
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Hurry up.

55
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,800
Where will you take me?

56
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Come here, come here.

57
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,280
It's their family matter.

58
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,360
Hey Toh,

59
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,600
We’re Thai people!

60
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,800
That's right.

61
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,840
Here, eat this.

62
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,760
What

63
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
I treated you to this meal.

64
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,360
Oh,

65
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,560
treating me like this?

66
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,960
Shouldn't I just go back home and eat mom's cooking?

67
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,320
Probably can't do it.

68
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,680
Oh why?

69
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Mom and dad are arguing now.

70
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,800
Mom got upset and escaped to Hua Hin,

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,520
and dad followed her to try and make up with her, that's why.

72
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Again?

73
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,840
Don't they ever get tired of it?

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,320
What about you?

75
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,600
Did you and Karn argue?

76
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,240
Bro,

77
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,720
Am I really wrong?

78
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,240
Since I've become her girlfriend,

79
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,280
I always tried to be a good partner.

80
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,680
No matter if she is angry or mad,

81
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,720
I always try to make up first and always apologize to her.

82
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,520
But when I’m jealous or mad,

83
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,720
why does she have to get so angry?

84
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,320
So what’s next?

85
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,760
And about work,

86
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,760
I tried to understand her work,

87
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,840
and I understood everything.

88
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,800
But when it is about my work,

89
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,280
She never understands my work,

90
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,360
only asks for time and time.

91
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,400
Then I came back home and was tired.  I couldn't take it anymore.

92
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,200
It feels like only me loves her.

93
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,000
It feels like it's only my fault.

94
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,640
If you're trying to find out who's at fault in the relationship,

95
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,040
then both of you are wrong.

96
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,160
Did you find it yet?

97
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,320
Yes
