1
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,920
Okay, let's start! It's time.

2
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,120
Are the cameras ready?

3
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,840
Ready.

4
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,720
And the actress?

5
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,160
Are you ready? Come on.

6
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,020
Yes, I’m ready.

7
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,000
Perfect! and you?

8
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,640
I will go out to concentrate for a while.

9
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,120
Are you okay?

10
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,640
I’m sorry.

11
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,320
That’s fine.

12
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Okay, let's get started!

13
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,160
Now we're going to rehearse, it's scene 30.

14
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,880
Is scence 30?

15
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,600
Yes! Come on, look here.

16
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,240
Get into position when you're ready.

17
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,160
Don't worry,

18
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,680
I will definitely help you with this scenes.

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,600
Um.

20
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Take a deep breath.

21
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,080
What's wrong with you?

22
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,280
I have no one left.

23
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,320
No one loves me anymore.

24
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,920
It would be better to just die.

25
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,800
What about me?

26
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,560
I'm here.

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't you ever see me here?

28
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,520
I've been by your side all along.

29
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,280
Why didn't you ever tell me anything?

30
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,720
you just planned to leave and die like that?

31
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,160
That's selfish.

32
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,560
No,

33
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
it's not that.

34
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,960
I was just worried about you.

35
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,480
I love you so much,

36
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,680
how can you say I'm selfish?

37
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,400
You don't love me,

38
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,840
you're just afraid I won't love you.

39
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,880
At last, you only love yourself.

40
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,680
Look at me.

41
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,280
Stop thinking for me and look at me right here.

42
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,400
Cut!  Very good,

43
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,440
Perfect! Both of you were amazing!

44
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,520
Thank you so much.

45
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,240
Yes, I'm so impressed.

46
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,240
Thank you Karn.

47
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,080
Does anyone have a tissue?  I could cry.

48
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
Karn

49
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,760
Ah..

50
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,640
Ah..?

51
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Hello bro.

52
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,040
Kris, where are you?

53
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,480
I will go to work first.

54
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,160
Kris,  you're late, Hurry up!

55
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,560
Yes.. I know.

56
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,240
Are you alright today?

57
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,640
So tired.

58
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,640
I can't take it anymore.

59
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,240
Then would you take a break first?

60
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,320
Fine, not okay but can work.

61
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,600
That's exactly what "not okay" means. Take a break today.

62
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,040
Hey I’m Kris, okay? I can do it.

63
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,840
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,380
I'm so sorry.

65
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,960
I will talk to my friend for just a second.

66
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,960
What? What's going on? Where are you going?

67
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,600
Just a second.

68
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,560
Why?

69
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,440
Why didn't you tell me?

70
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,600
Let me walk on my own.

71
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,680
Walk carefully.

72
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,360
What is this? Is this your plan?

73
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,200
You have to fight! Say it like you say to me.

74
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,920
What to say?

75
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,480
Don't give up!

76
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
Don't be weak, even if... Hey!!

77
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,240
Go!

78
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,520
What do I have to fight with?

79
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,880
Follow your heart, call for it, go!!

80
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,680
Ugh, what is this?

81
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,080
Are they still mad at each other?

82
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,320
Ugh... I don't even know your intention anymore.

83
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,840
They haven't even talked yet.

84
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,720
Huh?

85
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Why are these two so difficult?

86
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,120
I think we need to do something.

87
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,360
Do what?

88
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,200
Hello, P'Pud. This is Meen.

89
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,520
Sure.

90
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,800
Actually, I was lesbian.

91
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Actually, I never told anyone,

92
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,920
but I haven't hidden it either.
