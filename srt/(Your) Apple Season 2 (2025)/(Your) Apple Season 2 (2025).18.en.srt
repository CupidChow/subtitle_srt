1
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,720
I'm trying to be a good girlfriend to her.

2
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,320
Hey,

3
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,160
even good couples can argue.

4
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,320
What kind of friend are you?

5
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,880
You're encouraging me to fight with my girlfriend.

6
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,560
I mean arguing to understand each other better.

7
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,080
If you're always afraid of getting angry or upset during an argument,

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,560
when will you ever understand each other?

9
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,960
But right now, I don't understand you.

10
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,480
What do you mean?

11
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,920
Little buffalo.

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,520
I really don’t understand.

13
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,560
Wow.

14
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,000
Such a good treat.

15
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,800
Of course, it has to be good. because it’s you!

16
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,240
Is that so?

17
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,280
The steak here is really delicious.

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,200
Um Thank you.

19
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,320
Why are you saying thank you too much today?

20
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,800
You're making me feel like I can fly.

21
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,680
Thank you for inviting me.

22
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,040
I do nothing.

23
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,480
No, You helped me a lot.

24
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,200
Usually, I don't have many friends

25
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,920
so I don't know who to tell my problems to.

26
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,000
Especially with people in the entertainment industry,

27
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,920
I'm even more hesitant.

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,240
But you’re my friend.

29
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,520
Thank you for coming with me.

30
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,200
Actually, I'm really afraid of the entertainment industry.

31
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Even I want to give up.

32
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,560
But it's because of you that I enjoy acting.

33
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,600
No, I really like what you are.

34
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,720
Do you know that who you are has helped me and so many other people?

35
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,280
What do you mean?

36
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,320
It's a secret. I'm not telling.

37
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,760
What is it?

38
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,200
And have you told Kris about this yet?

39
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
Kris maybe can help you.

40
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,520
I'm afraid she will be disappointed.

41
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,600
She has done so much for me.

42
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,440
Don't think like that.

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,400
If you do that, Kris will feel even worse.

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,000
Just try to think..

45
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,000
If I didn't like your acting and didn't tell you

46
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,600
but talk about it with other people until you found out later...

47
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,760
Such a comparison.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,880
That’s it.

49
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's talk directly with Kris.

50
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,760
So she would understand.

51
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,400
Um, I will try.

52
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,720
Let’s eat.

53
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,080
So full.

54
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,280
Thank you for treating me,famous star.

55
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,520
Go for it! I'm rich.

56
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,600
You’re too much.

57
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,960
How are you getting home?

58
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,240
Should I drive you home?

59
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,760
May I disturb you?

60
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,760
Sure, I will.

61
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,120
I saw Tiwa on a date with her girlfriend.

62
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,000
I guess the rumors are true.

63
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,000
So she really is a lesbian, huh?

64
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,600
But doesn't her girlfriend look familiar?

65
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,440
Thank you for having dinner together today.

66
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,480
Thanks for the ride.

67
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,160
Would you want to come in for a drink first?

68
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,840
I better not bother you.

69
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,840
See you tomorrow.

70
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,160
Um.

71
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,120
So I will go back now.

72
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,600
Okay, bye.

73
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,560
Bye.

74
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,960
You said you'd be back late.

75
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,920
Why, Did I come back earlier than you thought?

76
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,480
Why did you say that to me?

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,240
So I will not say anymore.

78
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,080
Hey..

79
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,080
What’s wrong?

80
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
Kris, wait!

81
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,880
What’s wrong with you?

82
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,560
If you’re angry, just say it out.

83
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,960
What should I say.

84
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
You're the one who isn't saying anything.

85
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,120
you're with me, saying that you love me,

86
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,560
but then you laugh and be happy with someone else.

87
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,360
It's not like that. Tiwa is my friend.

88
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,280
And what's this then?

89
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,800
When I didn't tell you where I was going, you got angry and mad at me.

90
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,600
But now you think you can do whatever you want?

91
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,920
It's not that,  I don't think it's necessary.

92
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,640
You have always been like this.

93
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
your own things are the most important.

94
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,200
If you’re sulking, I always have to be the one to apologize.

95
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
I’m always the one who has to adjust.

96
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,440
I’m tired too, you know?

97
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,680
It's because you're selfish.

98
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,120
Yes.

99
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,560
I’m selfish.

100
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
And do you think you're great?

101
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,320
What did I do?

102
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,840
Do you think I am not being patient?

103
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,760
You’re just only working.

104
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,560
Have you ever listened to my problems?

105
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,560
I’m tired too.

106
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,680
Everywhere I go, they are pointing fingers

107
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,200
and calling me a freak but still dare to be here,

108
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,240
I’m scared of cameras,

109
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,160
scared of everything.

110
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,720
Do you ever understand?

111
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,200
If you don't say. How can I understand?

112
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,200
How can I say?

113
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,040
You tied your dreams on me

114
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,680
then you used me as an excuse.

115
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,040
Did you always think this way about me?

116
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,240
I’m going to sleep somewhere else.

117
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,840
I just want her to make up with me.

118
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,680
Hey, If you really want her to make up with you,

119
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,480
wouldn't it be better for her to go with someone else?

120
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,320
I'm your friend! why are you saying this?

121
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
Hello Tiwa

122
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,160
Karn, are you alright?

123
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,160
Can you come to me?
