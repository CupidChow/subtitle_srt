00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,240
Karn, go up to bed and sleep well.

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,920
I’m going to take a shower now.

6
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,560
\hKarn, I will take action then you come out of this aperture.

7
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,840

\hShe didn't wake up.

12
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,680
\hYou're a woman, go to see her.

13
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,800
\hKarn!

14
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,440

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,240
Go with me!

16
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,640
You're a man so you can’t help.

17
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,640
Karn! Karn!

18
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,720
You look bad.

19
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,960
\h\hI’m here.

20
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,000
You're just coming?

21
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,520
We're going to eat now.

22
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,840
\hDidn’t wait for me. move there.\h\h

23
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,840
You’re late and now just grab my seat.

24
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,720
\hSit together.

25
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,240
\hI can sit here.

26
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,880
What’s up? why you come so late.

27
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,840
I’m tired.

28
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,080
What’s wrong.

29
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,840
\hTired.. of work , money or….\h

30
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,800
Love.

31
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,320
Work and money, it's always tiring,\h

32
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:05,560
but me and karn have been weird lately.

33
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,520
Why?

34
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,360
I thought you two were in love.

35
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,640
Yes,

36
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
I do love her so much

37
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,520
but I'm just tired of trying to please her.

38
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,200
I'm feeling hurt.

39
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,200
Did you ever talk about this?

40
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,600
\hHaven’t talked yet.

41
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,240
I don’t want to argue with her.

42
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,480
I just want her to understand how tired and busy my work is.

43
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,400
Kris,this is hard.

44
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,000
You really need to talk.

45
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,840
This is serious.

46
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,840
Okay girls, no more!

47
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,320
Time to boost energy and let’s start our party!\h

48
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,440
It's okay,

49
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,280
I believe everything will get better.

50
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,040
You and Karn love each other very much, right?

51
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,120
I will not talk about it but now you have to smile.

52
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,240
Smile more.

53
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,000
Get drunk and forget!

54
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:46,080

55
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,520
Do it!

56
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,720

58
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Karn,Are you sure it's okay?

59
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,840
I think you should get admitted first.

60
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,440
It’s okay.

61
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,600
Just stressed and dehydrated.

62
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,880
That director, me and Toon will handle him.

63
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,040
Don't worry.

64
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Then I will take some rest.

65
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,360
Yes, you don’t have any work tomorrow.

66
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,120

67
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,760

68
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,600
ewww… I can’t feel on this.

69
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,560
She seems to be dating women to get herself talked about.

70
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,480
Today I will be back late, don’t have to wait for me.

71
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,240
I’m partying with friends.

72
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,360
Hey Kris, didn’t you come back home?

73
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,880
\hI already told her that I’m with you all.

74
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
I will be back late.

75
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,800
Karn, why don’t you clean your hair.

76
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,800
I always clean for you.
