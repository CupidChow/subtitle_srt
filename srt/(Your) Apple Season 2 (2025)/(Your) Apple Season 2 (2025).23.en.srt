1
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,440
What do I have to fight with?

2
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,800
Follow your heart,  go!!

3
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,600
Ugh, what is this?

4
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,720
Khun Tiwa, what are you doing?

5
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,000
Hello, Khun Meen.

6
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,160
Yes, They haven't talked yet.

7
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,200
Okay, Khun Thiwa.

8
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,760
I'll take care of it, Goodbye.

9
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,960
Hey, how did you get to know her?

10
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,520
Oh, who's this?

11
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,240
Your girlfriend is a professional producer!

12
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,920
This connection is fine.

13
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,720
So good.

14
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,960
Are they still mad at each other?

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,360
Ugh... I don't even know your intention anymore.

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,160
You're so biased.

17
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
I'm being serious!

18
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,080
That's our friend,

19
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,880
They haven't even talked yet.

20
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,760
Huh?

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,760
Why are these two so difficult?

22
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,160
I think we need to do something.

23
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,400
Do what?

24
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,200
This would be awesome!

25
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,320
Absolutely, leave it to me.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
My girlfriend is also amazing.

27
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,120
Hello, P'Pud. This is Meen.

28
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,000
Sure.

29
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,680
Fight on it!

30
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
Why do you have to go this far?

31
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,720
Can't you see?

32
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,680
I don't really like Karn.

33
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh?

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,720
Actually, I watched an interview clip of you with Karn last year.

35
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,200
What you both said about your love really helped me a lot.

36
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,200
Actually, I was lesbian.

37
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,160
I knew a little bit.

38
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,280
That's it.

39
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,680
At first, I could never accept myself.

40
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,360
I was so scared and want to leave the industry.

41
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,960
But after watching your clip,

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,320
I want to try to fight again one more time.

43
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Actually, I never told anyone,

44
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,320
but I haven't hidden it either.

45
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,120
Sorry if I made you misunderstand.

46
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,160
I'm just addicted to skinship.

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,280
It's alright.

48
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,960
I'm sorry for misunderstanding too.

49
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,080
But after learning to tie, you must also learn to untie.

50
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,280
Come on, Karn is waiting.

51
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,080
I want you to read this.

52
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,360
Dear my beloved.

53
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,280
I'm sorry for making you sad.

54
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,680
There are so many things I haven't told you.

55
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,680
I don't know if you still want to hear it.

56
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,800
I'm sorry for not having much time for you.

57
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:03,440
Sorry for being so stupid and clueless that I didn't notice what you were going through.

58
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,200
But even so,

59
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,720
please love this version of me too.

60
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,720
I will try to be a better person for you.

61
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:59,000
After this, we might argue, make up, and get angry at each other many more times.

62
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,080
But I always want to come back and reconcile every time,

63
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,960
if that person is you.

64
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,400
I love you the most.

65
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,240
I'm sorry,

66
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960
really sorry.

67
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
You don't have to apologize anymore.

68
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,800
From now on, let's talk about everything.

69
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,400
Really?

70
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,680
I can accept everything.

71
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,960
I’m so tired.

72
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,600
There are haters who curse at me every day.

73
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,080
I want to tell you about it,

74
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,880
but I’m afraid that you will be disappointed.

75
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,520
I don't want you to be more tired.

76
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,720
I want to support you in every way, and I want to support you in everything.

77
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,120
But in the end, it's me who has expected too much from Kris.

78
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,880
I’m selfish, only thinking about myself,

79
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,240
and completely overlooking your feelings.

80
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,440
I'm sorry.

81
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,160
I also apologize to you.

82
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,640
I thought that I only needed to do my part

83
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,720
and support you as a girlfriend part, without paying attention to your feelings.

84
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
I’m sorry too.

85
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,680
It's so funny.

86
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's just a small thing.

87
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,440
We could have just talked it out, right?

88
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,720
I love you.

89
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,760
I love you the most too.

90
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,560
It's okay, no matter how long it takes, I still love you.

91
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,200
Please kiss me and make this heart of mine swell up, full inside.

92
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:24,960
Could you do it just once? Let my heart be filled with joy through your lips.

93
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,040
I just wanna kiss, to be sure that you love me too.

94
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,680
Please kiss me so my heart knows how much I love you.

95
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,320
Can you please hug me? It's another way for me to understand

96
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,240
that you love me with all your heart, my boo.

97
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,240
I’m sorry. We won't argue anymore, okay?

98
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,720
Promise me first.
