1
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,800
Kris.

2
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,200
Did you come?

3
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,240
What's wrong? You seem out of focus.

4
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,640
Where has your heart wandered off to?

5
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,800
Have you fallen in love with me?

6
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,720
Absolutely.

7
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,840
What did you say?

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,760
Nothing.

9
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
What should we eat?

10
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,600
I'll go take a look.

11
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,040
No, it's alright.

12
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,320
I'll go choose myself.

13
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,280
Is that Aonthakan?

14
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,920
There's news that she is dating Tiwa, but then she's dating her girlfriend like this.

15
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,280
Isn't she filming a drama with Tiwa?

16
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Would dating her girlfriend right now be good?

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,760
Friend or girlfriend, it's all the same.

18
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,120
Women with women.

19
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,560
This kind of kiss isn't just between friends anymore, right?

20
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,920
Since that day, we've tried adjusting a lot of things.

21
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,000
We dare to argue and dare to speak directly with each other more.

22
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,200
But we won't let the problem drag on.

23
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,240
Sorry.

24
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,320
I'm sorry.

25
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,120
I’m sorry. We won't argue anymore, okay?

26
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,200
Promise me first.

27
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,560
Thank you for being by my side.

28
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,560
Um.

29
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,320
Yay! Both of you are very good.

30
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,080
Bravo, amazing! I'm impressed.

31
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,280
Thank you.

32
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,880
Thank you.

33
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,800
Well then, I'll leave first.

34
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,520
I have a dinner appointment.

35
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,200
See you, enjoy!

36
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
you are very great!

37
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,120
Thank you too, Tiwa

38
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,280
We should thank Karn more.

39
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,960
Ahammm.

40
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,320
May I have Karn back now?

41
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,760
We're going to have a meal with my brother.

42
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,120
Kris, haven't you stopped being jealous yet?

43
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,840
I'm not jealous at all.

44
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,840
You don't need to be jealous.

45
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,600
I'm a fan, and just making my bias fight already gives me a heart break.

46
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,560
Are you really being our fan?

47
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,000
How many years have you two been together?

48
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,640
Um... 2 years.

49
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,520
And what do you like about each other?

50
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,800
Beautiful eyes, cute, and good at teasing.

51
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,840
Kris, what are you saying?

52
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,160
And you, Karn? What do you like about Kris?

53
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,520
Tiwa, stop it!

54
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
Tell her!

55
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,160
What’s up karn?

56
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,040
Answer her.

57
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,120
Are you messing with me too?

58
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,000
Aw... just answer.

59
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,240
Stop messing with Karn now, Khun Kris.

60
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,000
Tiwa, don’t need to call 'Khun'

61
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,120
Huh?

62
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,960
Karn's friend is like my friend.

63
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,840
Oh, wow... That's a complete fan moment! Being friends with bias!

64
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,520
What?

65
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,520
Aren't you gonna snatch another one?

66
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay , I won't snatch it then.

67
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,040
What's wrong with you?

68
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,720
What?

69
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,920
I’m gonna get this for Karn, and you just snatched it like a dog!

70
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,840
Oops. Sorry Karn.

71
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,720
It's okay.

72
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,800
Kris, you just called Put a dog,

73
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,800
which means I'm a dog too.

74
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,080
I only said that about P'Put, not you.

75
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,200
Hello darling.

76
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,440
Darling,

77
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,040
Oh, Kris and Khun Karn just invited me to dinner at their home.

78
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,320
Okay

79
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,560
Okay

80
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,120
See you.

81
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,840
love you.

82
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,680
See you.

83
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,120
What should I do?

84
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,080
What's up?

85
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,160
I'm going to ask Earn to marry me!

86
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,040
Hey.

87
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,000
Hey.

88
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,520
Ask Earn to marry you?

89
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,440
Are you going to have a wife?

90
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,280
You're going to ask Earn to marry you!

91
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,480
I'm so happy for you! So happy!

92
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,640
Oh, not yet!

93
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,600
Why do you have to be the first to know?

94
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
Huh? What's wrong with it being me?

95
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,360
So, where and how?

96
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,240
Ugh, I don't know!

97
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,760
I've never proposed to anyone before!

98
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,680
I have an idea!

99
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,400
I wish I could get married too.

100
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,800
Babe, you're back?
