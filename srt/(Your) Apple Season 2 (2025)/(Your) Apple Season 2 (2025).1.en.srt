00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:45,920
Kris.

2
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,560
What would happen if we break up?

3
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,560
Listen to me,

4
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,960

5
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,280
I promise that my love for you will never change.\h

6
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,840
It's morning already.

7
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,880
I know you pretended to be asleep.

8
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,280
I haven't woken up yet.

9
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,880
Give me a morning kiss.

10
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,040
Wait a moment.

11
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,600
Yes.

12
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,600
Has it changed to this morning?

13
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,080
Okay, in half an hour.

14
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,560
Okay.

15
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,280
You said you have to work in the afternoon.

16
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
The schedule has changed.

17
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,520
I will take a shower.

18
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,880
Don’t forget to make up your bed.\h

19
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
Karn,

20
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,480
why don’t you clean your hair?

21
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,960
It's going to clog the drain.

22
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,960
Sorry.

23
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,200
One Bread with Jam,right?

24
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,760
Yes.

25
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,960
Are you sulking?

26
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,320
Nothing.

27
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,520
I apologized.

28
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
If you stay mad for too long, you will be late.

29
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,160
I have been move in with Aonthakan for one years.

30
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,000
Karn, I’m almost finished.

31
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,840
Here I am.

32
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,680
It’s on time.

33
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,840
Today fried eggs are heart-shaped.

34
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,720

35
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,880
You picked it.

36
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,680
Am I adorable?

37
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,360
I made you heart-shaped fried eggs today.\h

38
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,360
Adorable.

39
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,880
Oh, the drinks.

40
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,320
Here's some orange juice.

41
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,480
Let's drink now, before you're late.

42
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,080
Okay.

43
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,000
Is it delicious?

44
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,640
Now she is not an unnamed reporter anymore.

45
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,520

48
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,480
Okay, let’s do it.

49
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,240
After revealing our relationship,

50
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,280
Karn became famous as an equality influencer.

51
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,120
I’m full but want you to try.

52
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,880
Is it more delicious?

53
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,000
Sure, because of you.

54
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,360
Did she come?

55
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,960
Are you full?

56
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,640
I’m full.

57
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,640
Are you still shy?

58
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,720
I don’t want to go to work.

59
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,240
I’m tired now.

60
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,480
Oh... it's because you're famous,so you must be tired.

61
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,520
Cheer up!

62
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,520
Okay, I have to go.

63
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,840
Bye.

64
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,680
It's been a year since we are dating,

65
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,160
but our love remains the same.

66
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,560
Hello Tae,

67
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,600
Really?

68
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,960
Did you get the new job?

69
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,960
I will go now.

70
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,320
Why did you just come back?

71
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,480
I never said anything when you came home late.

72
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,160
Are you angry?

73
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,640
He told me he loved me,

74
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,720
he left me.

75
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,520
I don't want to live anymore.
