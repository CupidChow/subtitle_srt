1
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,960
Warm tea here.

2
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Thank you.

3
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,640
Is that Peter Pan?

4
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,920
Yes, I'm just thinking about it.

5
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,440
Could I read it for you?

6
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,680
Do it.

7
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,920
This chapter.

8
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,720
Yes.

9
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,040
Okay.

10
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,240
Every child grows up,

11
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,240
except for one.

12
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:12,720
They soon realize they will grow up after they turn two years old,

13
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,280
because the number two is the beginning of the end.

14
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,160
Are you okay?

15
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,400
Kris..

16
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,080
wait a moment.

17
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
Hello P’toon,

18
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,360
I have good news.

19
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,200
You don't need to release news about breaking up with your girlfriend anymore.

20
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,680
Really?

21
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,680
Sure,

22
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,960
But  just want you to reduce posting photos on social media

23
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,960
so that fans won't get hung up on it.

24
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,440
Let's do it,

25
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,320
this is a good opportunity for you.

26
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,320
Okay,

27
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,880
I accept this project.

28
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,160
Okay

29
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,600
Thank you.

30
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,760
Come on my girl.

31
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,400
Thank you for understanding.

32
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,600
I can do everything for your dream.

33
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,400
I'm so happy for you, My girl.

34
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,560
Thank you so much.

35
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,160
for talking to investors.

36
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,760
That's fine.

37
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,440
I would like to work with Karn too.

38
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,000
That's a great opportunity for her.

39
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,640
I never thought that you would follow her.

40
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
I’m her fan.

41
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,520
Oppa don’t smile like this,

42
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,360
I’m melted.

43
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,120
Support me please.

44
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,600
What are you watching?

45
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
What's wrong?

46
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,320
Why do that face?

47
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,680
you sit for hours and just stir your coffee, but don't drink any.

48
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,680
Damn Sol ..

49
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,760
What about Sol?

50
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,920
What happened with you two?

51
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,040
What Do you do when you make love with Karn??

52
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,120
Keep your voice down!

53
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,200
I am trying to..

54
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,280
but not success.

55
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Ah, Coach...

56
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
you're so good at other people's problems,

57
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,440
but when it comes to your own, you can't handle it.

58
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,720
I’m trying but what should I do?

59
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,120
I’m so stressed.

60
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,000
I think it may not be good timing…

61
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,320
also you’re her first girlfriend so it may be hard.

62
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,840
But Karn is your first girlfriend too!

63
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,160
Ahh.. No no, you have Toy.

64
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,880
Yah!

65
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,200
Ouch.. it hurts.

66
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,720
Don’t ever said it again.

67
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,440
Hmm.

68
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,000
Hello.

69
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,920
Ah yes.

70
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,520
Urgent?

71
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,960
Okay.

72
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
What happen.

73
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,920
Urgent work.

74
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,880
Let me tell Karn.

75
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,160
Today I will be back late.

76
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,600
Don't wait for me.

77
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,600
I have to go now.

78
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,000
Safe drive.

79
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,640
Eh.. why don’t you pay.

80
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,480
Pay for me.

81
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,320
Please feel free to train her, Don't worry.

82
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,800
Thank you so much.

83
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,720
Got it.

84
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,560
Hi I’m Karn,

85
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,080
I have followed K’Tiwa for a long time.

86
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,160
Are you stressed?

87
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,040
I’m sorry.

88
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,480
You just have to trust yourself that you can do it.
