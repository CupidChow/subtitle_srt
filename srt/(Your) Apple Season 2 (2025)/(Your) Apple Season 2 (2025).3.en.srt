1
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,080
if I will be back late

2
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,960
I will tell you.

3
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,680
Yes.

4
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,840
Kris,

5
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,480
what are you doing?

6
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,120
\hI’m getting back to you in the morning.

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,600
Wash your hair.

8
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,280
Is that good?

9
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,240
Um.

10
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,560
Can I have a second round?

11
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,400
Stop it.

12
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,400
I have to work tomorrow.

13
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,440
Okay,

14
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,520
We haven't been like this in a long time.

15
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,280
\hI think so,

16
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,760
Kris.

17
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,360
What would happen if we break up?

18
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,000
\h\hWhy are you saying that?

19
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,680
I will never stop loving you.

20
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,720
Don’t be too shocked.

21
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,440
I’m just kidding.

22
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,760
\h\hListen to me,

23
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,320
I will never stop loving you.

24
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,560
\hReally?

25
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,760
\hYes, sure.

26
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
\hPromise?

27
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,000
\hI’m promised.

28
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,720
\hAre you tired?

29
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,240
\h\h\hAbout work?

30
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,240
It's tiring but also fun.\h

31
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,000
Um.

32
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,920
Oh that’s good.

33
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,040
\hPlease wait for me and I will follow you.

34
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,840
My dream is to be your photographer.

35
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,200
Let’s go to sleep,\h

36
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,000
So you will not look tired and not good on camera.

37
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Good night.

38
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,040
Good night.

39
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,120
Can she really perform this?

40
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,320
You bring homosexual person here.

41
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,680
How can she comprehend? She can't act.
