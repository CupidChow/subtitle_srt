1
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,600
I'm not even sure if I actually like acting or not.

2
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,520
Seriously, I really don't know either.

3
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,680
But you acted in many series.

4
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,600
It's like, whatever role I get..

5
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,600
I will end up thinking about it over and over.

6
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,920
That's just how life is. No need to overthink.

7
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,440
The more you think, the harder it is to find answers.

8
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,120
It's better to give it your all and then make a decision after you've done everything you can.

9
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,200
Thanks.

10
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,480
It’s my pleasure.

11
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
trust yourself.

12
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,120
you can do it.

13
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,760
Um.

14
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,520
Okay, Thank you.

15
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,800
Come on Kris.

16
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,080
Come on Kris!

17
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,000
Why.

18
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,480
I have some matters to talk about.

19
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,560
What about?

20
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,920
The big opportunities are here.

21
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,760
Big boss wants you to shooting  behind the scenes.

22
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,800
What about Behind the scenes?

23
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,880
It’s a big movie project,

24
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,720
they want you to shooting behind the scenes.

25
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,280
Then?

26
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,040
Would you accept?

27
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,880
Yes, but who is cast?

28
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,680
I forgot to ask, I was just being glad for you.

29
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,440
Really accept,right?

30
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,000
Absolutely.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,520
Okay.

32
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,520
Thanks a lot.

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,520
That’s fine.

34
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,520
By the way, tomorrow I will send more details and location to you.

35
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,760
Congrat to you.

36
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,040
Thank you.

37
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,400
Ah.. I don’t even know that you will be the photographer for today,

38
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
I’m so sorry.

39
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,680
It’s okay.

40
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,640
I already know.

41
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,920
If she said that,

42
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,080
shouldn't we start practicing now, Khun Kob?

43
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,440
Well. Let’s start.

44
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,600
So I will leave for now.

45
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay, so let's get at marking and practice now, do it!

46
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,360
Why? Are you doing this to cover up your shyness?

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,240
Cut!

48
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,480
Don't avoid eye contact Karn, this scene you have to fight! Fight her.

49
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,040
Sorry. I will try again.

50
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,960
Okay, try again.

51
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,240
Start!

52
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,080
Why? Are you doing this to cover up your shyness?

53
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,680
Ah..

54
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,400
Ah.. Ah..

55
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,720
Ah again.

56
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,720
Cut! try again.

57
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,440
Take it easy Karn. You can do it.

58
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,760
Yes.

59
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,000
Keep calm.

60
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,960
Start!

61
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,840
Why? Are you doing this to cover up your shyness?

62
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,760
I’m not shy.

63
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,920
The person who shy is is..

64
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,760
Is is..

65
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,600
Cut!

66
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,360
Today you don't focus at all.

67
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Calm down. The new actress is like this.

68
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,480
It would be wasting time,

69
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,000
but if you asked,

70
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,000
then you can rest first. Calm down

71
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,000
and then come back later.

72
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,320
Thank you.

73
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,240
Yes.

74
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,960
Boo!!

75
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,720
What are you doing!?

76
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
I see that you’re stressed.

77
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,480
Anyway, how did you take this job?

78
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,360
It was a coincidence.

79
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,960
They told me to shooting a famous actress.

80
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,520
but it turned out that famous actress was my own girlfriend.

81
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
It’s not me.

82
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,080
That's K’Tiwa.

83
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,480
No matter what, My girlfriend is the cutest and the most talented!

84
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,360
You’re too much!

85
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,600
then when you know, you still took this job.

86
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,520
Is it really okay to see me act with other people?

87
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,280
I’m a little bit jealous

88
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,240
but this is your dream.

89
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,560
To see me romance with another person?

90
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,440
Who would want to see their girlfriend being together with another one?

91
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,200
But my dream is...

92
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,360
to see my girlfriend follow her dreams up close instead.

93
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,720
Karn.

94
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,760
I get it now.

95
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,400
You have to imagine that K’Tiwa was me.
