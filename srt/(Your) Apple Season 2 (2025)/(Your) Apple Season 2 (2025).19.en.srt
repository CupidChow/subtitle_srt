1
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,240
How long are you guys going to sit here like zombies? Huh?!

2
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,240
What should I do?

3
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,760
Why? What happened?

4
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,920
just tell us.

5
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,320
It's hard to explain.

6
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,120
I've really tried so hard lately,

7
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,760
I've supported Karn in everything.

8
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,480
I've adjusted everything for her,

9
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,960
but she still says that I don't understand her.

10
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,960
What did I do wrong?

11
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,960
Do you want an answer that pleases you or the real answer?

12
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,880
Anything, just tell me.

13
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,600
You’re wrong.

14
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,320
Why aren't you taking my side?

15
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,400
Well, You are the one who acted silly towards her first, aren't you?

16
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,680
Right?

17
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,480
I agree.

18
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,000
It's my fault.

19
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,240
No Natty, you're good enough.

20
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,200
It's not your fault.

21
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,720
Don't cry Natty.

22
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,680
How good?

23
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,920
If I were really good, he wouldn't have left me.

24
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,840
Don't cry.

25
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,040
Don't cry.

26
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,680
My friend is the best.

27
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,760
If I were really good, he wouldn't have left me.

28
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,640
Kris, Where are you?

29
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,760
You are good. Oh... don't cry.

30
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,760
Hello Karn,

31
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,760
How's the script rehearsal going? Is it okay?

32
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,040
Hello, Tiwa.

33
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,400
Karn, are you alright?

34
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,640
Tiwa, are you free?

35
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,080
Can you come see me?

36
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,080
What about Kris?

37
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,240
Kris is…

38
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,920
Calm down, I'll go to see you.

39
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,040
What's wrong with you?

40
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,680
Isn't you that not answer to her?

41
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,000
I just want her to make up with me.

42
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Hey, If you really want her to make up with you,

43
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,600
wouldn't it be better for her to go with someone else?

44
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,280
I'm your friend!

45
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,320
Why are you saying this?
Stop!

46
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,200
But I agree with her.

47
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,400
Will you be single with me?

48
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,760
No, I'd rather not.

49
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,360
I don't want to be single yet.

50
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,720
Why is that?

51
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,720
And if you don't tell her, how will she know what you're thinking?

52
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,920
You're right.

53
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,160
For love,

54
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,360
you have to give in to each other sometimes.
if two hard sticks come together,

55
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,960
they'll just break.

56
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,840
I do give in,

57
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,720
but the one who's always giving in is me.

58
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,160
Well, if you think like that,

59
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,440
then you have to wait and calm down first then just talk.

60
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,120
You guys keep being sarcastic like this, will anything get better?

61
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,880
When I broke up with my ex-husband, it was exactly like this.

62
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,080
Don't talk about it.

63
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,680
You left it with me when you moved in with Khun Karn.

64
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,840
Then I want it back.

65
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,560
Take it. It's yours anyway.

66
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,960
Kris, don't be soft.

67
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,520
Don't give up.

68
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,960
Hey, where are you going?

69
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,640
Are you going to apologize to her?

70
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,520
No

71
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,720
Oh

72
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,440
It's my fault.

73
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,760
Did you two argue because of me?

74
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,160
What about you?

75
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,440
Did you and Karn argue?

76
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,720
She never understands my work,

77
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,800
only asks for time and time.

78
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,640
I couldn't take it anymore. It feels like only me loves her.
