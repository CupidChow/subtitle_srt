1
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,240
Surprise!

2
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,640
Will you marry me?

3
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,920
Save!

4
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,000
Well done, my sister!

5
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,480
Earn,

6
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,560
from now on, I'm entrusting my clueless brother to you.

7
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,720
Even though he's like this, when he loves someone, he gives his all.

8
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,680
But if he misbehaves, you can tell me.

9
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,160
I'll punch him for you!

10
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,880
I'll handle him perfectly, P'Kris

11
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,440
P' Phut,

12
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,400
you're definitely going to be so happy from now on.

13
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,160
Congratulations!

14
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,160
Yeah, thanks

15
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,560
Marry me.

16
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,920
It's okay, no matter how long it takes, I still love you.

17
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,680
Please kiss me and make this heart of mine swell up, full inside.

18
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:23,320
Could you do it just once? Let my heart be filled with joy through your lips.

19
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,520
Hey, our friend's finally settling down!

20
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,400
Please be good, seriously.

21
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,760
I can't believe that he's gonna get married.

22
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,800
I've seen him since he was poking dog poop with a stick. Now he's grown up!

23
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,920
You're crazy.

24
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,480
I love you.

25
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,040
I love you too.

26
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,040
Me too.

27
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,640
I'm trying not to think about it, but...

28
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,520
It's okay, just think about it.

29
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,160
But you absolutely can’t think you're worthless.

30
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,040
Like I said, you need to love yourself.

31
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,280
But it's hard to do.

32
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,120
So we'll just love you first, you know?

33
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,760
We love the way you are.

34
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,320
Even if you're dumb , whiny and think positively or negatively –

35
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,480
we still love you, you know?

36
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,400
No matter what, you'll always have us.

37
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,080
I really appreciate you guys, seriously.

38
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,680
I have read that if we all praise something, we'll actually start to believe it.

39
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
What do you mean?

40
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,000
Like, Nat is so beautiful!

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,400
Nat is so beautiful!

42
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,120
Nat is so beautiful!

43
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,680
Nat is so amazing!

44
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,080
Nat is so beautiful!

45
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,520
What’s up!

46
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,480
I just wanna kiss, to be sure that you love me too.

47
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,520
Please kiss me so my heart knows how much I love you.

48
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,800
There might be times we argue.

49
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,120
And don't quite understand each other.

50
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,880
Please don't get tired of me yet.

51
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,960
There might be times we don't quite click,

52
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,760
Do everything wrong, I'm sorry.

53
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,240
You and I have our differences,

54
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,960
But I like everything about you.

55
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,760
Can you stay with me for a long time?

56
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,760
I want you right now!

57
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,320
Oh my shawty, do you know?

58
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,440
I'm happy every time I know that you are here.

59
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,000
It's okay, no matter how long it takes, I still love you.

60
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,680
Please kiss me and make this heart of mine swell up, full inside.

61
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:22,520
Could you do it just once? Let my heart be filled with joy through your lips.

62
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,480
I just wanna kiss, to be sure that you love me too.

63
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,040
Please kiss me so my heart knows how much I love you.

64
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,480
Can you please hug me?

65
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:40,400
It's another way for me to understand
that you love me with all your heart,

66
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,680
My boo.

67
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,880
I miss you right now.

68
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,240
I miss you right now, Do you feel the same way too?

69
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,760
that tonight the air is cold

70
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,760
Can I come and hold you?

71
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,560
Are you wake up darling?

72
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,880
I want to see this everyday.

73
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,120
What you say?

74
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,720
Nothing,

75
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,520
don’t tell me that last night we…

76
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,120
Forget again?

77
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,040
How about recalling our memories?

78
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,240
I'm going to propose to Karn.

79
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,640
Seriously.

80
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,560
I think I'm going to get engaged and then get married right away.

81
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,680
But what should I start with?
