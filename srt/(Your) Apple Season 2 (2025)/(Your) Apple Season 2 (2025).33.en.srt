1
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,040
Is something wrong?

2
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,400
What did you do wrong this time?

3
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,480
Try reading this first.

4
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,880
Every time you do something wrong, you always write a letter.

5
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,440
At first, I was going to write it because I'm not good at speaking.

6
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,560
But for this, I'd rather say it myself.

7
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,960
I love to hug you every night,

8
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,480
and wake up with you every morning.

9
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,160
Being together, taking care of you like this...

10
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,760
and I even like it when you complain about making the bed,

11
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,400
even if you're truly angry.

12
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,320
I'm really happy.

13
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,640
You are my eyes,

14
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,000
my heart,

15
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,960
and all the love in my entire life. .

16
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,600
From the first day until now,

17
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,200
and forever

18
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,160
Can you let me have all the love in your life forever?

19
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,760
Thank you Karn.

20
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,840
You're still making jokes at a time like this?

21
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,880
Well, I'm just excited!

22
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,040
What are you doing?

23
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,320
I'm just claiming my kiss first.

24
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,560
Will you marry me?

25
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,760
Hey...

26
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,840
Why you do this

27
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,360
that's not fair, Karn!

28
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,520
I've been preparing for so long!

29
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,600
That's because I'm good at this.

30
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,280
We should practice first.

31
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,920
when it's the real ceremony,

32
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,240
you'll be too nervous to know what to do.

33
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,720
Practice what?

34
00:06:50,600 --> 00:07:03,960
I, Anthakan, accept Karisa to be my love forever.

35
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:14,240
I, Karisa, accept Anthakan to be my love forever.

36
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,680
I just wanna kiss, to be sure that you love me too.

37
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,920
Please kiss me so my heart knows how much I love you.

38
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,840
There might be times we argue.

39
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,160
And don't quite understand each other.

40
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Please don't get tired of me yet.

41
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,360
There might be times we don't quite click,

42
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,200
Do everything wrong, I'm sorry.

43
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,320
You and I have our differences,

44
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,120
But I like everything about you.

45
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,920
Can you stay with me for a long time?

46
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,920
I want you right now!

47
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,480
Oh my shawty, do you know?

48
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:14,600
I'm happy every time I know that you are here.

49
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,040
It's okay, no matter how long it takes, I still love you.

50
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,720
Please kiss me and make this heart of mine swell up, full inside.

51
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:33,560
Could you do it just once? Let my heart be filled with joy through your lips.

52
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,520
I just wanna kiss, to be sure that you love me too.

53
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,080
Please kiss me so my heart knows how much I love you.

54
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,520
Can you please hug me?

55
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,480
It's another way for me to understand
that you love me with all your heart,

56
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,680
My boo.

57
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
I miss you right now.

58
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,680
I miss you right now, Do you feel the same way too?

59
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,240
that tonight the air is cold

60
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,240
Can I come and hold you?

61
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,440
I want to have you here to share my stories

62
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,600
Make me know that this world isn't empty

63
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,880
I might act foolish at times.

64
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,200
Make you a headache. I'm sorry.

65
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,120
It's okay, no matter how long it takes, I still love you.

66
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,720
Please kiss me and make this heart of mine swell up, full inside.

67
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:33,320
Could you do it just once? Let my heart be filled with joy through your lips.

68
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,560
I just wanna kiss, to be sure that you love me too.

69
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,160
Please kiss me so my heart knows how much I love you.

70
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,480
Can you please hug me?

71
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,440
It's another way for me to understand that you love me with all your heart,

72
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,120
My boo

73
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,720
There's no way to know when love will fade

74
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,080
I want you to hold my hand

75
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:10,640
I won't go anywhere, I'll take good care of our love.

76
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,360
