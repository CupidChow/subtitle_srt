1
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,120
Is that good?

2
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,080
Um.

3
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,400
Can I have a second round?

4
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,240
Stop it.

5
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,240
I have to work tomorrow.

6
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,280
Okay,

7
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
We haven't been like this in a long time.

8
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,120
\hI think so,

9
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,600
Kris.

10
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,200
What would happen if we break up?

11
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,840
\h\hWhy are you saying that?

12
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,520
I will never stop loving you.

13
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,560
Don’t be too shocked.

14
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,280
I’m just kidding.

15
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,600
\h\hListen to me,

16
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,160
I will never stop loving you.

17
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,400
\hReally?

18
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,600
\hYes, sure.

19
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
\hPromise?

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,840
\hI’m promised.

21
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,560
\hAre you tired?

22
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,080
\h\h\hAbout work?

23
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,080
It's tiring but also fun.\h

24
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,840
Um.

25
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,760
that’s good.

26
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,880
\hPlease wait for me and I will follow you.

27
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,680
My dream is to be your photographer.

28
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,040
Let’s go to sleep,\h

29
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,840
So you will not look tired and not good on camera.

30
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Good night.

31
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,880
Good night.

32
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
When did we stop loving each other?

33
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,400
I still...

34
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,280
Wait.

35
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,720
\hHuh.

36
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,840
I think this sentence could be more sad than this.\h

37
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,920
\hLet me try again.

38
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,480
You should go and calm down first then come back when you're fine.

39
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,840
Yes, I will try again.

40
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,240
Shit..

41
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,280
Can she really perform this?

42
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,960
\hShe came from casting then she can perform and suit this role.\h

43
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,920
You bring homosexual person here.

44
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,800
How can she comprehend? She can't act.

45
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,760
Wow... do people still talk like this nowadays?

46
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,720
Tiwa.

47
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,800
I have to reconsider my next project with this company.

48
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,760
If you say something like that,I'm uncomfortable.\h

49
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,640
Tiwa, Please listen to me.

50
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,280
Kris

51
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,840
I’m so tired.

52
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
Oh, You're improving a lot.

53
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,760
I'm a good learner.

54
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,160
Well.

55
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,680
Are you free this evening?

56
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,160
I have a lot of work to talk to you.

57
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
Yes.

58
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,880
Kris,Let's have dinner with me today.

59
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,120
I’m lonely.

60
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,240
I’m sorry.

61
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,000
Today I have a meeting.

62
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,240
Let's eat together tomorrow.

63
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
\h\hHurry up! Will you go?

64
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,840
Yes, I’m packing the stuff.

65
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,560
so rushed.

66
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,560
\hDo you ever understand me?

67
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,480
Today I will be back late, don’t have to wait for me.

68
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,720
I’m partying with friends.

69
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,720
