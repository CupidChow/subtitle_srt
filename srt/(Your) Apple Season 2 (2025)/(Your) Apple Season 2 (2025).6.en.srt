00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Are you going to work?

18
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,160
I will go take a shower.

19
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,600
Karn.

20
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,960
Karn, why don’t you clean your hair.

21
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,960
I always clean for you.

22
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,360
Who asked you to do it?

23
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,960
Why did you say that?

24
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,320
Are you mad that I didn't come back home?

25
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,240
I already told you.

26
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,360
I’m just tired from work and you're already sulking.

27
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,080
What am I dealing with?

28
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,720
Why can't you understand me?

29
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,880
Don’t understand?

30
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,800
The person who never understands is you.

31
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,600
\hKarn.

32
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,880
What are you saying?

33
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,320
Are you telling me to break up with Kris?

34
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,400
Opportunities like this don't come often.

35
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,920
Especially if everyone knows you have a girlfriend,

36
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,280
they might reject us.

37
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,880
Are you okay to accept?

38
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,240
If you continue to be like this, you guys will break up.

39
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,600
Break up?

40
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,120
Do you mean break up? I don’t want to break up with her.
