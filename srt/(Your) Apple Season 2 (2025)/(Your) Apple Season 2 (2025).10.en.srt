1
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,880
Why do that face?

2
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,240
you sit for hours and just stir your coffee, but don't drink any.

3
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,240
Damn Sol ..

4
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,320
What about Sol?

5
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,480
What happened with you two?

6
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,600
What Do you do when you make love with Karn??

7
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,680
Keep your voice down!

8
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,760
I am trying to..

9
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,840
but not success.

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Ah, Coach...

11
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,400
you're so good at other people's problems,

12
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,000
but when it comes to your own, you can't handle it.

13
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,280
I’m trying but what should I do?

14
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,680
I’m so stressed.

15
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,560
I think it may not be good timing…

16
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,880
also you’re her first girlfriend so it may be hard.

17
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,400
But Karn is your first girlfriend too!

18
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,720
Ahh.. No no, you have Toy.

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,440
Yah!

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,760
Ouch.. it hurts.

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,280
Don’t ever said it again.

22
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,000
Hmm.

23
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,560
Hello.

24
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,480
Ah yes.

25
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,080
Urgent?

26
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,520
Okay.

27
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
What happen.

28
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,480
Urgent work.

29
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,440
Let me tell Karn.

30
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,720
Today I will be back late.

31
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,160
Don't wait for me.

32
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,160
I have to go now.

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,560
Safe drive.

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,200
Eh.. why don’t you pay.

35
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,040
Pay for me.

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,880
Please feel free to train her, Don't worry.

37
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,360
Thank you so much.

38
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,280
Got it.

39
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,160
Hi I’m Karn,

40
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,520
I have followed K’Tiwa for a long time.

41
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,520
Hi, Thank you for followed my work.

42
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,280
But can I request something?

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,440
Yes?

44
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,160
Can you just call me “Tiwa”?

45
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,160
Call Khun feels so distant.

46
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,120
Sure Tiwa.

47
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,320
then just call me Karn.

48
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,480
I’m so glad to work with you.

49
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,880
Okay, You guys already know each other then let’s start.

50
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,720
Okay, let's start with the first scene – the first meeting.

51
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,960
If you're ready, put your bags down.

52
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,000
We can begin now.

53
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,080
Well, I’m glad that everyone is ready.

54
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,960
Nim, Where are you going last night?

55
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,480
It’s my business.

56
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,080
Where I went, then it will… will…

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,360
I will… will…

58
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,280
Karn, What’s wrong?

59
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,960
You didn’t focus at all today.

60
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,560
You’re freaking out.

61
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,800
Would you take a break?

62
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,520
I’m sorry.

63
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,360
Can I try again?

64
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,800
Okay, let's try again.

65
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,680
This time, no need to walk and do it as a dialogue.

66
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Everyone ready? 5, 4, 3, go!

67
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,920
Nim, Where are you going last night?

68
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,960
It’s my business.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,360
Where I went, then it will…

70
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,680
Oh, you made a mistake again,

71
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,040
you should take a break for today.

72
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,160
It seems like everything is going wrong.

73
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,520
So, How about she taking a break for today?

74
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
I think she might be too stressed.

75
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,600
Yes.

76
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,520
Just take a break Karn.

77
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,040
I’m so sorry.

78
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
Yes.

79
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,240
So I will take some rest.

80
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,080
Okay.

81
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,040
Are you stressed?

82
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,880
I’m sorry.

83
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,200
I didn’t blame you at all.

84
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,920
Why do I have to blame?

85
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,040
When I performed my first series, it was even worse than you.

86
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,600
But this is not my first time.

87
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,000
Even, you've done it many times, that doesn't mean you're always right.

88
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,360
In my opinion.

89
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,240
You aren’t bad, but rather lacks confidence.

90
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,880
Not confidence.

91
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,560
Yes, captains that are not confident in their own defenses can die on the battlefield.

92
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,240
That’s so true.

93
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,480
You just have to trust yourself that you can do it.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,480
But honestly,

95
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,920
I'm not even sure if I actually like acting or not.

96
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,840
Seriously, I really don't know either.

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But you acted in many series.

98
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,920
It's like, whatever role I get..

99
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,920
I will end up thinking about it over and over.

100
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,240
That's just how life is. No need to overthink.

101
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,760
The more you think, the harder it is to find answers.

102
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,440
It's better to give it your all and then make a decision after you've done everything you can.

103
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,520
Thanks.

104
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,800
It’s my pleasure.

105
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,520
trust yourself.

106
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,440
you can do it.

107
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,080
Um.

108
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,440
What about Behind the scenes?

109
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,520
It’s a big movie project,

110
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,320
they want you to shooting behind the scenes.

111
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,160
Would you accept?

112
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,040
Yes, but who is cast?

113
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,840
I forgot to ask, I was just being glad for you.

114
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,400
Anyway, how did you take this job?
