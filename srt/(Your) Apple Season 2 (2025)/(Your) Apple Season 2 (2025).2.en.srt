00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,080
Hello Tae,

2
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,120
Really?

3
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,480
Did you get the new job?

4
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,480
I will go now.

5
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,160
And How about others..\h

6
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,080
Awww Namjoon Oppa,

7
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,480
handsome guy!

8
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,960
What a handsome guy!

9
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,360
What are you doing?

10
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,800
You’re only attending your oppa so your girlfriend is hurt now.\h\h\h\h

11
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,240
I’m here.

12
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,040
Not enough.

13
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,640
Meen and Sol have made their relationship official.

14
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,360
Stop it.

15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,080
Why?

16
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,280
I’m shy.

17
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,120
Sol is too shy so Meen never do more than kiss.

18
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,160
Just close your eyes so you will not be shy.

19
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,760
Ouch, Natty!

20
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,480
Natt!

21
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,440
How dirty.

22
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,240
Are you crazy?

23
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,680
Go to hell.

24
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,200
Stop!

25
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,000
And for Natty..

26
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
Natt!

27
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,480
Natt!

28
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,040
Natt!

29
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,800
Natt!

30
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,720
Hey Natt!

31
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,040
You.

32
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,000
He told me he loved me,

33
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,240
but when he wanted to have kids and I couldn't give him that,

34
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,320
he left me.

35
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,360
I don't want to live anymore.

36
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,520
It's okay.

37
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,080
I have nothing good at all.

38
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,720
Her dreams of a loving relationship were completely destroyed.

39
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,040
What are you doing?

40
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,200
I'm going to have a husband and wife, anything better than all of you.

41
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,280
I'm going to be promiscuous.

42
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,440
A New beginning has emerged, a change for Natty

43
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,760
with a new goal.

44
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,200
What's wrong with you?

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,240
Apptalk is not a small company anymore,

46
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,800
it has expanded their team and now has their own office.

47
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,600
Here is the office, What do you do?

48
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,280
My girlfriend is too cute to be bare.

49
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,560
How can I stay still?

50
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,760
Here’s office\h

51
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,480
Pud, Stop it.

52
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,360
Hey!

53
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,960
That's too much. when Kris and Karn are not here.\h

54
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,400
Wait and see, when our turn comes.

55
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,960
Ouch,

56
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,520
what's about dog and buffalo noise?.

57
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,200
Hey!

58
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,680
Are you making fun of us?

59
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,080
Are you annoying us?

60
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,440
See them,darling.

61
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,600
Getting to know Karn made me find a new dream.

62
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,480
I don't think this shot is working.

63
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,880
Could you pull back a bit?

64
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Come here and try shooting from this angle.

65
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,760
I'd like to see what the wide angle looks like.

66
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,640
Okay.

67
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,720
Let’s try.

68
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,800
Let’s try with a wide angle.

69
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,760
Okay, wide angle.

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,560
Even though it's just starting,

71
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,240
if I try, it will definitely go well.

72
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,040
I will go now.

73
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,240
Don’t you watch it? 	

74
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,800
Do your work.

75
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,480
Hey..

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,120
your work is well,

77
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,400
I would like to book you for next time.

78
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,600
Sure,

79
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,240
how about earnings for this time?

80
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,560
It may be late.

81
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,240
they are not paid yet.

82
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,360
It will probably be next month.

83
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,040
That’s alright.

84
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,120
Don't do that face.

85
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,520
Everything will be okay when you grow up.

86
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,160
This industry is like this.

87
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,200
Keep fighting, okay?

88
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,120
I have to go now.

89
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,720
Hello.

90
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,400
Um.

91
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,600
Oh Shit!

92
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,000
Aren't you asleep yet?

93
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,760
Why did you just come back?

94
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,160
I have chicken fries,

95
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,360
do you want to eat together?

96
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,080
At 2 am.?

97
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,160
I’m sorry.

98
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,240
Today I’m so tired of working all day.

99
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,640
So I didn’t catch my phone yet.

100
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,480
I knew, but can you tell me first?

101
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,080
I’m worried about you.

102
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,360
I never said anything when you came home late.

103
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,000
Are you angry?

104
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,720
No I didn’t.\h

105
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,000
\h\hKarn,

106
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,560
you knew how much I tried hard for this work.

107
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,800
Please understand me.

108
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,960
Please.

109
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,200
Sorry for being mad at you.

110
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,480
I’m sorry too.

111
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,480

112
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,360
I will tell you.

113
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,080
Yes.

114
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,240
Kris,

115
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,880
what are you doing?

116
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,520
\hI’m getting back to you in the morning.

117
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,520
what are you doing?
