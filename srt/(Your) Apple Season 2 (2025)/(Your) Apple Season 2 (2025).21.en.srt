1
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,520
Here, eat this.

2
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,440
What

3
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,920
I treated you to this meal.

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,040
Oh,

5
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,240
treating me like this?

6
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,640
Shouldn't I just go back home and eat mom's cooking?

7
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,000
Probably can't do it.

8
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,360
Oh why?

9
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,840
Mom and dad are arguing now.

10
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,480
Mom got upset and escaped to Hua Hin,

11
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,200
and dad followed her to try and make up with her, that's why.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Again?

13
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,520
Don't they ever get tired of it?

14
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,000
What about you?

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,280
Did you and Karn argue?

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,920
Bro,

17
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,400
Am I really wrong?

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,920
Since I've become her girlfriend,

19
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,960
I always tried to be a good partner.

20
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,360
No matter if she is angry or mad,

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,400
I always try to make up first and always apologize to her.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,200
But when I’m jealous or mad,

23
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,400
why does she have to get so angry?

24
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,000
So what’s next?

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,440
And about work,

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,440
I tried to understand her work,

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,520
and I understood everything.

28
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,480
But when it is about my work,

29
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,960
She never understands my work,

30
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,040
only asks for time and time.

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,080
Then I came back home and was tired, I couldn't take it anymore.

32
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,880
It feels like only me loves her.

33
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,760
Have you ever told her this?

34
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,320
If you don't tell her, how can she understand?

35
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,480
It feels like it's only my fault.

36
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,600
If you're trying to find out who's at fault in the relationship,

37
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,960
then both of you are wrong.

38
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:46,480
Kris, Love means loving each other through both happiness and suffering.

39
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,440
You tried to adapt to her, and she also tried to understand you.

40
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:03,040
You probably forgot that the person you should understand the most is yourself.

41
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,000
At last, to stay together for a long time,

42
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,760
you have to accept each other's strengths and weaknesses.

43
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,760
If there's something wrong, just talk to.

44
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,600
When you argue, just come back and talk it out nicely.

45
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,440
And... What if it doesn't go back to being good?

46
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,160
Look at our parents.

47
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,840
They argue every day,

48
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,360
but they never think about breaking up.

49
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,080
You know why?

50
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,880
Love gradually fades with time,

51
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,360
but about bond,

52
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,800
the trust,

53
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,360
the stability

54
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,360
that turns lovers into family.

55
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,120
Wow,

56
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,320
you can actually think like this, huh?

57
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,360
What do you mean?

58
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,040
Nothing.

59
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,400
Just eat it, don’t be sentimental.

60
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,200
It's going to get soggy. Eat!

61
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,120
I don’t eat.

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,360
You’re so young and already crying like a child.

63
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,720
Which scene?

64
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,600
Is scene eight okay?

65
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,400
Okay, scece eight.

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,600
Did you find it yet?

67
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,600
Yes

68
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,080
Hello Karn.

69
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,120
Karn isn't angry, just feels guilty.

70
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,920
try to see her often, and she'll probably talk.

71
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,200
Yes

72
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,720
Okay, let's start! It's time.

73
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,920
Are the cameras ready?

74
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,640
Ready.

75
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,520
And the actress?

76
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,960
Are you ready? Come on.

77
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,820
Yes, I’m ready.

78
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,800
Perfect! and you?

79
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,440
I will go out to concentrate for a while.

80
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,720
I have no one left.

81
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,760
No one loves me anymore.

82
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,360
It would be better to just die.

83
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
I was just worried about you.

84
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,520
I didn't want you to be tired.

85
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,240
I love you so much,

86
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,440
how can you say I'm selfish?

87
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,640
Are you okay?

88
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,440
I’m sorry.

89
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,120
That’s fine.
