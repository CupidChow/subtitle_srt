1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,580
Gotta take off a few more pieces
to be American style.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,360
What do you mean?

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,670
Are you crazy?

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,800
Ha-ha-ha.

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:10,980
Oh...

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,060
The only thing that didn't change

7
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,480
is your appearance.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,610
Your original personality
was not like this.

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,660
You are the opposite.

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,510
I think you look
a bit more aggressive now,

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,760
but you are still soft inside.

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,510
Hey!

13
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,690
How can you say that I'm soft?
I'm just tender.

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,720
Well,

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,390
I don't know the difference.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,830
Ah, you came back from another country.

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,990
These words are too complicated

18
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,380
to explain.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,470
You can try.

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,270
I... Why should I?

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,940
Didn't you say

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,400
you'd return
all what you got from me?

23
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,230
Well,

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,200
you said in American style.

25
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,030
Is this the American style?

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,180
Isn't it?

27
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,340
This is tender.

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,760
This is soft.

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,740
That's a bit too American.

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,000
Tender means gentle,

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,660
while soft

32
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,320
means sexy, right?

33
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,020
I don't think that's right.

34
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,430
Yeah?

35
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,070
It's indeed complicated.

Enjoy the food.

48
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,520
How did everyone feel
about the first day?

49
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,630
Well, thanks to you, sir,

50
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,100
we felt pretty good.

51
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,990
I might have to learn

52
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,410
how to address everyone here.

Group Leader Song Hyun-jae.

54
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,310
I don't have any clue
about the new project yet.

55
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,660
Oh...

56
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,270
Of course I'm not saying
I won't work hard.

57
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,440
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

58
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,470
Today is just the first day,

59
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,780
you don't have to
push yourself too hard.

60
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,610
Nobody would make any achievement
on the first day.

61
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,450
That is impossible.

62
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,490
Although most people can't do it,

63
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,910
it is still possible.

64
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,090
Has anyone ever done that?

65
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,560
Oh, of course.

66
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,670
He went out to answer the phone.

67
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,600
This is it.

68
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,080
The General Manager?

69
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,660
Somebody else told me back then.

70
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,520
No kidding.

71
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,310
On his first day,

72
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,470
just during the lunch break,

73
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,360
he mastered all the content
of the induction training,

74
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,180
and was praised by the instructor.

75
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,360
He became very famous because of that.

76
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,440
Since then,

77
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,790
the promotional materials
were all written by him.

78
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,310
Yes, that's right.

79
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,400
(Phasewise growth, value increase)
And,

80
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,720
(Market Recognition Market Share)
after the speech of the ad team leader,

81
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,390
he came up with a better plan.

82
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,640
And he changed
the whole structure of the project.

83
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,500
And don't forget,

84
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,170
he did all that on his first day.

85
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,660
The second day was even more incredible.

86
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,040
He did a lot of big things.

87
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,030
Hey, he was just a rookie.

88
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,330
How is that possible?

89
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,640
You must be kidding.

90
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,830
That was true?

91
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,480
It's all true.

92
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,390
Our department

93
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,930
can't meet his standard now,

94
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,940
but even when we're tired,

95
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,240
we are still working hard.

96
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,230
Hey, let's just make this project work.

97
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,640
Group Leader Song, come on.

98
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,560
OK.

99
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,360
Oh, sir.

100
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,470
Oh, Lee Jun and

101
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,060
the General Manager
have the same given name.

102
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,040
We might mistaken them.

103
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,100
Hey.

104
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,390
They have the same name
but different personalities.

105
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,210
Our general manager

106
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,680
is a business elite from head to toe,

107
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,260
but Lee Jun is...

108
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,640
from a free show years ago.

109
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,390
Hey, sir.

110
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,500
I admire you so much. What can I say?

111
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,430
Oh, really.

112
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,130
What are you saying? It's your turn.

113
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,720
Oh, really?

114
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,200
We have done a good job, so...

115
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,650
I've finished mine.

116
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,830
Not bad.

117
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,620
I'll drink until I'm drunk.

118
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,490
Really? Have one more cup then.

119
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,460
Hey,

120
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,860
you shouldn't drink so quickly.

121
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,620
Yes, she is right.

122
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,130
General Manager,

123
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,140
you are totally different from him.

124
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,590
How?

125
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,720
The General Manager

126
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,220
is pretty tough,

127
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,800
while Lee Jun is...

128
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,370
soft.

129
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,030
It is true.

130
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,710
Soft.

131
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,780
Actually I'm also a bit tough.

132
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,670
Yes, you are right.

133
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,670
Starting all over is not
something everyone can do.

134
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,200
Ah, starting all over.

135
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,910
You are talking about
his remarriage, right?

136
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,270
Oh, no.

137
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,610
Ah, it turns out

138
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,730
you also started all over, right?

139
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,070
Let's drink to that.

140
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,440
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

141
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,340
Fighting.

142
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,560
- That's OK.
- Fighting.

143
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,400
Thank you.

144
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,430
Are you all right?

145
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,000
You are not
very uncomfortable, are you?

146
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,160
I'm fine.

147
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,950
I'll drink some chocolate milk later.

148
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,210
Here, chocolate milk.

149
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,250
It'll make me feel better.

150
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,690
Just leave the table,

151
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,010
and come back after finishing it.

152
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,360
Thank you.

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,840
Just go.

154
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,860
Cheers.

155
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,530
Wow.

156
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,770
Good one. Very good.

157
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,400
- Thank you.
- Good one.

158
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,500
- Would you like another one?
- OK, of course.

159
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,160
- Sir.
- Yeah.

160
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,550
- Thank you.
- I should thank you.

161
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,640
You know what?

162
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,710
You can do it.

163
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,770
Doesn't matter. You can do it.

164
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,040
Really?

165
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,380
Let's drink to it.

166
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,150
It's the first time
I've seen you drink soju.

167
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,140
This is rare.

168
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,240
This rare soju

169
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,990
is soft.

170
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,600
General Manager.

171
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,510
Hey, are you OK?

172
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,160
Yes.

173
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,030
I need a designated driver.

174
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,890
Oh, I feel cold.

175
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,660
Where are you going?

176
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,640
Where else can I go?

177
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,870
Have fun at another place?

178
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,160
Home.

179
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,480
Are you taking a taxi?

180
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,270
No, I'll take the bus.

181
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,370
Alright, goodbye, General Manager.

182
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,120
Be careful on the road.

183
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,950
You are not leaving?

184
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,220
I am.

185
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,420
Take care, Lee Jun.

186
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,880
Ah...

187
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,680
Didn't you just say you would be free?

188
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,220
Ah, my first day of work is finally over.

189
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,990
Ah... Oh...

190
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,170
(Mom)
Son, you must be busy on your first day,

191
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,650
so I'm just sending you a message.

192
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,840
I sent you your favorite Ganjang Gejang.

193
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,880
Remember to eat it.

194
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,740
You'll break my heart
if you work hungrily.

195
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,580
Ha!

196
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,150
You think I'm a little boy?

197
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,490
Ah, the smell of alcohol.

198
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,240
What happened to him?

199
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,270
He's totally grown up.

200
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,820
Today was like as long as a month.

201
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,570
Ah! This is not my shirt.

202
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:56,850
Oh...

203
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,700
It stinks with the smell of alcohol.

204
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,770
I should put it in water.

205
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,560
Isn't this good?

206
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,570
You need someone
to take care of you,

207
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,530
and I can do that.

208
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,000
And you'll have my smell on you.

209
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,550
It smells really good.

210
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,890
There's no smell of alcohol at all.

211
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,060
I should give it back to him like this.

212
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,930
No, I can't.

213
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,020
A tooth for a tooth,
and an eye for an eye.

214
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,510
So I should repay kindness
with kindness.

215
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,500
Wow, it's been such a long time.

216
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,040
It reminds me of the old days.

217
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,070
I did this a lot
when I was a trainee idol.

218
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,080
Hm?

219
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,430
Who would come here so late?

220
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,770
Ah!

221
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Maybe it's the Ganjang Gejang!

222
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,020
Ganjang Gejang! Ganjang Gejang!

223
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,030
Huh? Choi Jun?

224
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,180
Why did you open the door
without asking who it is?

225
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,080
That is not safe.

226
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,440
My agent said the same thing.

227
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,390
Your agent?

228
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,400
No, I mean...

229
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,180
You shouldn't have come
without asking me.

230
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,700
Hey.

231
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,240
Hey, how do you know I live here?

232
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,540
This time, I don't want to lose...

233
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,450
I don't want to miss it,
so I've been watching,

234
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,620
and watching.

235
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,980
What?

236
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,280
Seoul City...

237
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,090
Ah... Oh...

238
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,150
You shouldn't have drunk so much.

239
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,280
It's a secret I was born with.

240
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,800
You know my secret anyway.

241
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,920
Do you want me

242
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,080
to tell you another secret?

243
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,870
No need.

244
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,680
Hey! Hey! Hey!

245
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,350

246
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,760
I'm very drunk now.

247
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,900

- Ha-ha-ha...

248
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,200

249
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,780
Is that a secret?

have a physical reaction,

I am Lee Jun from Zeus.

343
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,240
Here comes the first question.

344
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,960
Why do you want to be an idol?

345
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,380
Now that I have become an idol,

346
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,350
I want someone to see me now.

347
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,230
Can you tell us who that person is?

348
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,590
It's a secret.

349
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,900

is from Mr. Candy Melon.

Yes.

358

It must be a person
who can make me warm.

359

When I'm with this person,

360
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,320
I will feel so warm inside.

361
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,610

00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,200
For your information,
the General Manager

377
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,320
will also come today.

378
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,910
Maybe it's
the General Manager's preference.

379
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,550
I'd rather work in the marketing team.

380
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,440
He said you would see

381
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,190
that disgusting Chim On out there.

382
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,690
That's right.

383
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,710
Maybe our little Jun
is smarter than imagined.

384
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,540
Does it smell good?

385
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,020
Don't!
