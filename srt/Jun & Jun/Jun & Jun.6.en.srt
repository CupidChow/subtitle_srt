1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,350
To be honest,

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,760
due to the lack of readability,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,800
the content was not eye-catching at all.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,220
But it became a lot more interesting

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,360
after we listened to
Mr. General Manager's suggestion

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,800
and tried to read just a part of it.

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,230
I found it amazing.

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,220
To highlight the neutrality,

9
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,310
maybe we can use the phrase

10
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,340
Nice Gentlemen.

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,080
Check to see if this plan is doable.

12
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,630
This task is on you.

13
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,470
OK.

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,410
Oh, this must be fake.

15
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,250
Let's go.

16
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,150
OK.

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,780
This way, please.

18
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,080
OK.

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,910
- Bye.
- Bye.

20
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,510
Honey.

21
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,390
Chim On?

22
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,040
Chim... Chim On?

23
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,180
Hello.

24
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,200
Sunbae.

25
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,300
It's only 10:12 in the morning.

26
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,470
Oh, really?

27
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,920
My watch is malfunctioning.

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,640
It shows twelve o'clock.

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,700
Ah, I haven't bought my salad yet.

30
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,240
So I bought it for you.

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,390
Let's go upstairs.

32
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,230
Come on.

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,160
Did you see that?

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,210
Huh? What?

35
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,840
That fool, sorry, that guy

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,260
called him honey.

37
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,260
What is their relationship?

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,040
Well,

39
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,310
as you know, they are ex-colleagues.

40
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,650
Ex-colleagues?

41
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,050
Yeah.

42
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,450
Why are you looking at me like that?

43
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,680
Nothing, it's just that
you are eating the salad

44
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,100
like a professional.

45
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,340
I'm not like those people in Shining.

46
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,180
I have no talent.

47
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,280
If I can't even
do such a small thing well,

48
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,950
I will fall behind.

49
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,140
Yeah, that's right.

50
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,680
You are indeed different from others.

51
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,520
If you want to

52
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,820
tell me I'm not talented too,

53
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,060
I won't listen

54
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,630
because I've heard it too many times.

55
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,150
It's not right to say you are not talented.

56
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,170
You are just not sharp-eyed.

57
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,870
What?

58
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,640
I said you are not sharp-eyed.

59
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,180
Are you teaching me a lesson?

60
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,350
No.

61
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,150
I'm praising you.

62
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,420
See? You are really not sharp-eyed.

63
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,330
You thought I was gonna say
you were not talented?

64
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,320
Oh...

65
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,740
Maybe I'll never say that in my life.

66
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,420
Why?
You don't want to hurt my feelings?

67
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,260
No.

68
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,010
I don't want to hurt mine.

69
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,460
Oh, look, that's what I said.

70
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,970
You should say, "I'm sorry.

71
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,100
I will never do this again.

72
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,440
So let's date."

73
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,510
That's what you should say.

74
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,830
How can I say that

75
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,540
so easily?

76
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,520
Oh,

77
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,100
you are actually talking back.

78
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,910
That's new.

79
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,230
I'm excited now.

80
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,120
I'm telling the truth.

81
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,240
You are sensitive about this topic.

82
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,780
Did someone confess his love to you?

83
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,620
What?

84
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,780
No!

85
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,360
That's a yes.

86
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,510
We are not having lunch but breakfast.

87
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,570
So this time

88
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,430
doesn't count, right?

89
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,000
You want to see me again, right?

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,670
Sunbae, aren't you very busy?

91
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,780
I am, but I came anyway,

92
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,550
so that you could use me.

(Song Hyun-jae
Let's meet before you leave.)

102
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,260
Sunbae,

103
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,620
I didn't mean it at first,

104
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,140
but thank you for coming.

105
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,260
How could I miss the opportunity

106
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,780
to enjoy seeing

107
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,720
your beautiful face?

108
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,530
I want to approach you

109
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,920
for both business and private affairs.

110
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,850
I just didn't have the chance.

111
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,080
Because I sound like an idol?

112
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,460
Sound like?

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,490
Who taught you to talk like that?

114
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,360
Sorry.

115
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,560
What are you sorry for?

116
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,600
The one who taught you that
should be sorry.

117
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,420
But I can finally

118
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,150
work with you again.

119
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,010
I am happy about that.

120
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,060
I haven't told you about the project yet.

121
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,140
You already accepted it?

122
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,940
It won't make me sing, will it?

123
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,110
Maybe.

124
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:21,890
You can try.

125
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,840
I will do whatever

126
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,290
you ask me to do.

127
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,070
Take a look at this.

128
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,090
This fragrance is relatively strong,

129
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,090
and it will last a long time.

130
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,140
Compared to normal perfume for men,

131
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,220
it's more feminine and elegant.

132
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,500
You are still so good-looking.

133
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,020
What?

134
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,040
Oh, nothing.

135
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,240
Is the scent long-lasting?

136
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,270
Sunbae, please listen to me.

137
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,110
Please.

138
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,520
Oh, Mr. Professional is talking.

139
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,520
Sunbae.

140
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,300
Come on.

141
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,160
Why do you want to meet me?

142
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm busy.

143
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,780
How have you been?

144
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,010
Oh, your fake smile

145
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,790
won't work on me, you know?

146
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,830
Is that so?

147
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,760
What's the matter?

148
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,410
I'm busy and I have to go for a shoot.

149
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,370
Can't you just come and go quietly?

150
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh, my existence

151
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,820
doesn't allow me to be quiet.

152
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,900
Because of you,

153
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,450
Lee Jun's reputation is not very good.

154
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,020
What?

155
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,630
Who spoke ill of him?

156
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,710
It's because of me?

157
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,630
It's not possible.

158
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,720
Yes,

159
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,200
it is.

160
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,640
You have always been

161
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,910
too ostentatious.

162
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,000
What are you talking about?

163
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,070
You are making me angry.

164
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,110
I'm glad you are doing well.

165
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,380
Didn't you say you were very busy?

166
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,430
You should leave now.

167
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,430
What?

168
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,160
You are always like this.

169
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,630
You leave right after
finishing your words.

170
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,970
And you ignored my calls.

171
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,810
We are just business partners.

172
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,380
What? Business partners?

173
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,540
Since when did we become

174
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,670
business partners?

175
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,700
All the time.

176
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,700
It's always been like this.

177
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,520
You know what?

178
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,130
I knew you earlier than Lee Jun.

179
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,830
I've been working with you for 5 years.

180
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,970
And now,

181
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,820
business partners?

182
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,860
That hurts, you know?

183
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,640
I hurt you?

184
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,490
Of course.

185
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,240
We still have time to fight.

186
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,470
Time?

187
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,120
What's the big deal about that?

188
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,950
You are such a heartless person.

189
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,510
I must let everyone know this.

190
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,180
I am leaving.

191
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,180
Don't ask me to do this or that

192
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,210
and don't contact me again.

193
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,050
Got it?

194
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,590
OK, goodbye.

195
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,450
Oh, you are so stubborn.

196
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,290
Unbelievable.

197
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,800
I'm really leaving.

198
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,840
OK.

199
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,000
Do not contact me!

200
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,320
I won't pick up your call.

201
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,240
I will never do that!

202
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,740
He is still a child.

203
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,560
Come in.

204
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,240
Why do you look so happy?

205
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,630
The model we wanted to work with

206
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,540
said yes.

207
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,140
They just sent the contract.

208
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,740
The model is...

209
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,720
Chim On.

210
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,260
Lee Jun fulfilled this hard task.

211
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,160
This model

212
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,790
is among the most popular ones.

213
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,820
Our new product

214
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,020
will become a bestseller, sir.

215
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,840
I'm glad everything is going smoothly.

216
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,250
Please tell me

217
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,560
when the schedule is set.

218
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,480
Lee Jun did a good job.

219
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,600
Please pass your experience
to other interns too.

220
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,120
OK, of course.

221
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,440
(They are so close that)

222
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,500
(he agreed to work with us immediately.)

223
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,480
Hyun-jae.

224
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,670
Oh.

225
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,580
Lee Jun.

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,040
I said I would

227
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,270
give you a gift when I get my salary.

228
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,290
Although it's a long time ago,

229
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,230
thank you.

230
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,300
What is this?

231
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,710
I saw you were still using

232
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,940
the handkerchief I gave you last time.

233
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,710
I thought I should do something.

234
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,820
Oh.

235
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,930
I just got used to it, and it's from you.

236
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,850
Thank you.

237
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,840
I feel happy

238
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,420
to see you use it a lot.

239
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,330
So I bought you a new one.

240
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,000
Wow, it's so beautiful.

241
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,570
Hm?

242
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,440
There's a fragrance.

243
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,100
You smelled it? I think it suits you well.

244
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,440
The style,

245
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,610
and the feeling.

246
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,040
I once received an invitation

247
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,620
with perfume on it,

248
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,660
so I thought it was

249
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,310
a nice way to give gifts.

250
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,100
Anyway, I hope you can use it longer.

251
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,150
Wait,

252
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,460
you'll use it for years that way, right?

253
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,900
I have to buy new ones for you
every now and then.

254
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,240
Thank you, I will cherish it.

255
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,710
Oh, let me drink this.

256
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,300
Wait, I just used this mug.

257
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,060
So what?

258
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,740
We've done worse before.

259
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,560
He never drinks coffee.

260
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,200
He must be very tired.

261
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,300
It suits you very well.

262
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,740
So outdated.

263
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,310
Did you have a fight?

264
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,540
Me?

265
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,360
Against whom?

266
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,800
Not at all.

267
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,510
Sister.

268
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,460
What are you doing here?

269
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,060
Kim Yeong, why are you here?

270
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,690
Someone asked me to come.

271
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,080
Sister, even I heard the news that

272
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,880
you and Choi Jun had a fight.

273
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,870
So I just came to meet you.

274
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,620
I haven't contacted you, have I?

275
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,040
Not at all.

276
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,950
Why didn't you contact me at all?

277
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,280
I don't even have your number.

278
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,180
How can I contact you?

279
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,660
Why didn't you ask me for it?

280
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,200
You are so indifferent.

281
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,270
It's already

282
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,780
the second time today.

283
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,140
Huh?

284
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,050
Oh, nothing.

285
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,360
The work is too tiring, right?

286
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,440
I knew it.

287
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,410
I told Choi Jun that it wouldn't work.

288
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,860
He always thought that
others would help him.

289
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,790
He's a pain, right?

290
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,000
No, he's not that bad.

291
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,040
Listen, you did nothing wrong, sister.

292
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,530
It's Choi Jun who made a mistake.

293
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,690
Although he has always been excellent,

294
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,640
sometimes he has deficiencies.

295
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,080
Is it proper for you
to say that about your fiance?

296
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,580
You know

297
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,490
we are engaged?

298
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,890
Yes. Choi Jun...

299
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,060
I'm sorry.
Mr. General Manager told me that.

300
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,290
Anyway, it's amazing.

301
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,700
Engagement sounds so unreal to me.

302
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,030
That is nothing at all.

303
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,530
It's an agreement between our families.

304
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,960
Oh, so you mean

305
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,340
you are really from a plutocrat family.

306
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,530
I don't mean anything bad.

307
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,530
Anyway,

308
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,580
what are you doing here today?

309
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,820
To meet your fiance?

310
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,960
No, I'm here for you.

311
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,630
Maybe you two are having a problem

312
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,780
due to Choi Jun's overhastiness.

313
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,700
He's always like this.

314
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,710
Whenever he is obsessed with something,

315
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,120
he would ignore everything else.

316
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,660
What can we do? We must understand.

317
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,800
Ah, you must have a headache too.

318
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,060
Headache?

319
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,680
That's right.

320
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm having a headache because of

321
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,740
those troubles around me.

322
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,820
You must be depressed.

323
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,840
Listen,

324
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,180
why do people want to live like before?

325
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,110
People are always changing,

326
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,230
and because of that,

327
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,620
we should build new relationships.

328
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:43,810
Aren't I right?

329
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,070
What do you think?

330
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,640
Yes, maybe.

331
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,430
When the opportunity comes, grab it.

332
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,520
We don't want to miss any opportunity.

333
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,240
Am I right?

334
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,430
Am I right?

335
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,270
Yes.

336
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,680
OK.

337
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,140
I will always

338
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,900
be on your side, understand?

339
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,010
OK. Thank you.

340
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,510
Did you see what happened

341
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,680
when the president came?

342
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,860
I did.

343
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,070
She left with Mr. Choi immediately.

344
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,040
On the way back just now,

345
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,780
I saw a beautiful girl

346
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,910
walking arm in arm with Mr. Choi.

347
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,150
People say she is his fiancee.

348
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,890
Maybe that's the thing she talked about?

349
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,730
Ah...

350
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,270
I heard that he suddenly came to Korea

351
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,630
from the US branch

352
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,880
due to the low sales

353
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,860
of our products.

354
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,780
That means he will go back to America

355
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,800
as long as the problem is solved.

356
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,660
Yeah?

357
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,340
Then he will be leaving soon.

358
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,400
He didn't even want to

359
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,920
stay here for long.

360
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,040
But he got more things to deal with,

361
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,500
so he had to stay longer.

362
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,060
But these are all rumors,

363
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,720
maybe some of them are fake.

364
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,720
What are the things he got to deal with?

365
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,830
A marriage, maybe?

366
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,630
That makes sense.

367
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,440
Maybe he is going to get married soon.

368
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,280
He has been engaged for a long time.

369
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,240
That's possible.

370
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,520
Nobody would have anything to say

371
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,830
if she was just his fiancee, right?

372
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,280
Ha-ha-ha.

373
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,260
The interns of our company

374
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,680
are quite well-informed,

375
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,520
huh?

376
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

377
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,300
I need to go to the bathroom.

378
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,160
That means he will go back to America

379
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,060
as long as the problem is solved.

380
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,900
Yeah?

381
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,740
Then he will be leaving soon.

382
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,650
Are you leaving?

383
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,660
You are engaged.

384
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,640
It's an agreement between our families.

385
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:20,890
Lee Jun.

386
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,700
Fall in love with me.

387
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,080
What an evil guy.

388
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,470
Oh...

389
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,430
It's a long day, huh?

390
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,580
Chim On came early in the morning.

391
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,220
It's not just because of Chim On.

392
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,360
You look tired.

393
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,460
I am.

394
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,380
I'm a little depressed today.

395
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,100
I was going to invite you to a drink

396
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,400
to thank you for your gift,

397
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,510
but I think you need some rest.

398
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,330
No, let's go have a drink.

399
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,630
I feel like drinking today.

400
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,090
(Now even the master of love is confused.)

401
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,520
(What should I do?)

402
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,780
(I told you that)

403
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,050
(you can't let him misunderstand.)

404
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,360
(Don't just escape.)

405
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,880
(Oh, what can I do about it?)

406
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,390
Oh...

407
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,300
I didn't escape.

408
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,800
He doesn't know anything.

409
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,730
Ah, it's killing me.

410
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,100
Ah!

411
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,040
Oh, you did it again.

412
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,880
Ha-ha.

413
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,720
I just spilled a little. It's OK.

414
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,340
OK.

415
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,740
(Did Lee Jun buy that handkerchief?)

416
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,770
Looks like you are used
to physical contacts.

417
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,060
I have been taking care of him

418
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,580
since I was his agent.

419
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,130
Anyway,

420
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,240
Jun is a friend I should take care of.

421
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,770
Ha.

422
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,120
You're not his agent now.

423
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,830
Do you have to do this?

424
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,890
Lee Jun is not a child.

425
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,920
Mr. General Manager,

426
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,840
could you please talk properly?

427
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,260
Do you want to try this dish?

428
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,240
Noodle soup.

429
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,300
That sounds nice.

430
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,710
Can you help me with it?

431
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,280
You are holding the spoon anyway.

432
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,180
Do you have a broken hand
or broken fingers?

433
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,150
Since I've got the spoon,

434
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,320
I'll help you with it.

435
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,960
But we Koreans believe in Confucianism,

436
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,820
so in order of age,

437
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,660
the first bowl goes to Hyun-jae.

438
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,210
Thank you, Jun.

439
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,890
I didn't expect

440
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,760
I would say something like that.

441
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,040
You shouldn't have said that,
but it's OK.

442
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,960
Anyway, he is the general manager.

443
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,660
How is your drinking capacity?

444
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,310
You can hold your alcohol, sir.

445
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,810
I am the general manager for a reason.

446
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,870
Since when did you start to like him?

447
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,910
Four or five years ago.

448
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,380
I don't know the exact time.

449
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,760
I just fell in love with him.

450
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,730
My time is three times longer than yours.

451
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,600
No,

452
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,180
four times.

453
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,460
You think that means you win?

454
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,830
Yeah, I want to beat you at that.

455
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,540
I was lucky to be by his side

456
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,770
when he was at his most difficult time.

457
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,330
You are pretty hateful.

458
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,380
Ha, the same as you.

459
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,540
The same as me?

460
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,400
Lee Jun.

461
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,160
Hee-hee.

462
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,000
What are you doing now?

463
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,370
Well...

464
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,920
What are you doing?

465
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,360
Can't you talk properly?

466
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,250
This is not America.

467
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,720
Are you OK?

468
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,780
Yeah.

469
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,650
What are you looking at?
Go pay the bill.

470
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,660
Pay the bill.

471
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,650
Are you OK?

472
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,820
Yeah.

473
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,780
Are you sure
you can go home by yourself?

474
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,040
I'm fine, Jun.

475
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,500
Mr. Driver will send me home.

476
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Well, take care.

477
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,660
It's you who should take care.

478
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,300
I'm fine.

479
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,660
You know I'm as bright as the sun.

480
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,220
Goodbye then.

481
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,210
Thank you, sir.

482
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,080
Goodbye.

483
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,940
Yeah, goodbye.

484
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,570
How are you gonna go home?

485
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,900
You left your car at the company.

486
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,160
So you are worried about me too.

487
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,430
I'm happy about that.

488
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,240
Does Kim Yeong know you are like this?

489
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,350
Well, why should she know?

490
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,430
Of course she should.

491
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,780
She is going to marry you.

492
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,250
You drink and make people
worry about you.

493
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,090
Even if you are married...

494
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,980
Enough.

495
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,190
Did I tell you I was getting married?

496
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,550
You are engaged,
of course you'll get married.

497
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,760
Otherwise, why did you get engaged?

498
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,840
It's just an engagement.

499
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,510
What are you talking about?

500
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,590
I'll leave after you leave.

501
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,240
I'll walk home.

502
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,800
I'll take a walk too.

503
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,500
I can sober up that way.

504
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,160
Whatever.

505
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,730
You should leave.

506
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,600
I seem to have a lot to explain to you.

507
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,560
But firstly, I won't marry Yeong.

508
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,920
It's just an agreement between the elders.

509
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,280
We both didn't want it,

510
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,840
so we agreed that

511
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,060
we would pretend to accept it.

512
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:48,880
We agreed that we'd call it off

513
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,880
if we started dating another person.

514
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,240
What are you saying?

515
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,530
It's a deal between me and Yeong.

516
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,220
So what?

517
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,790
What?

518
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,650
So what?

519
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,510
Wait,

520
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,180
I think you misunderstood something.

521
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,900
I don't think so.

522
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,100
You are engaged but won't get married.

523
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,800
Why did you explain it to me?

524
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,770
I could not care less.

525
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,660
What did you say?

526
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,980
You don't care?

527
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,390
I do not care about you.

528
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,940
Hey.

529
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,780
I really don't know why I am like this.

530
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,640
What if you did?

531
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,090
Would that make a difference?

532
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,720
I am working hard to change.

533
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,920
This is the hard work
you are talking about?

534
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,660
Will the world be better
if you work hard?

535
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,980
Is that how this world works?

536
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,600
Hey, Lee Jun.

537
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,360
Oh, come on.

538
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,370
Hey.

539
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,910
What do you want from me now?

540
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,300
What?

541
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,090
I should be asking you that question.

542
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,900
You refuse to
give me a chance to explain,

543
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,740
and you don't want to listen.

544
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,920
Aren't you the one who's escaping?

545
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,290
Do you enjoy

546
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,130

Since you have to leave,
why do you have to do this?

You're going back to America anyway.

I understand.

I've always been alone.
