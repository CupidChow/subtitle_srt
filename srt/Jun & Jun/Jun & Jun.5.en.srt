1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,050
Oh! Photographer!

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,210
We are counting on you today.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,670
I'm also counting on you.

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,510
There you are.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,050
Say hello.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,200
Hello, sunbae.

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,510
One, two, three.

8
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,380
We are shining star.

9
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,220
We are shining J-teens.

10
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,960
Thank you for having us.

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,370
No problem. Please keep it down.

12
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,920
You are pretty loud.

13
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,240
OK, sunbae.

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,080
We will work hard today.

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,210
And we won't bring any trouble.

16
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,700
OK.

17
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,490
I hate long shooting periods.

18
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,350
So let's make it quick.

19
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,190
OK.

20
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,620
You don't have to answer together.

21
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,460
OK.

22
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,640
You can get changed upstairs.

23
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,690
Please come up with me.

24
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,840
Follow me, please.

25
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,580
OK. Thank you.

26
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,430
Is it going well?

27
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,080
Yeah.

28
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,930
But...

29
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,020
I didn't know we had such talents.

30
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,490
Oh...

31
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,220
They have been working for a while.

32
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,710
This is their first time.

33
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,740
Please help them if you can.

34
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,490
OK?

35
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,280
I will be very grateful to you.

36
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,120
That's it?

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,640
I'll have to work really hard to help them.

38
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,330
Is there anything you want?

39
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,440
I can buy it for you.

40
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,640
Ah...

41
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,360
You can't afford what I want
with your salary.

42
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,750
Then I'll buy it later.

43
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,970
OK. Chim On is good.

44
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,940
Ah...

45
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,100
Relax your face.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,390
Feel free.

47
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,480
Hey!

48
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,990
What are you doing?

49
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,890
Me?

50
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,060
Yeah! You!

51
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,770
Don't just stand there like a fool!

52
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,160
None of the pictures are good!

53
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,240
None!

54
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,810
I'm sorry. Sorry.

55
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,160
Just watch how I do it.

56
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:26,800
I'll help you

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,410
no matter how hard it is.

58
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,120
Don't push yourself
and don't look depressed.

59
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,420
Copy my expression too.

60
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,360
Let's start over.

61
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,130
Huh?

62
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,120
Don't look like a fool.

63
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,440
It's a feeling of relaxation.

64
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,640
OK, thanks.

65
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,530
Stop talking and look at the camera.

66
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,710
OK.

67
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,150
OK. Very good.

68
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,250
- Ah, that's the right way.
- Very good.

69
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,770
Wow. That's good.

70
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,150
OK. Good.

71
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,500
That's the right feeling.

72
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,810
OK.

73
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,730
Chim On, you are awesome.

74
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,780
OK.

75
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,500
Oh...

76
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,610
Thank you for your hard work.

77
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,940
Thank you too.

78
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,570
We got a lot of good pictures
thanks to you.

79
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,380
Thank you and see you next time.

80
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,650
- Thank you, Chim On.
- Thank you.

81
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,730
- Drive safely.
- OK.

82
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,810
Are you all right?

83
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,230
I'm fine.

84
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,730
I'll go back to the dormitory,
take a pill and sleep.

85
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,020
And then I will be fine.

86
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,830
They may worry about me
when they see me.

87
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,080
Maybe I should leave now.

88
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,360
I'll go to the pharmacy later.

89
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,050
You just said you would give him a ride.

90
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,660
My place is nearby.
I'll take the bus or subway.

91
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,710
And I will take my medicine.

92
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,040
Thank you.

93
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,670
All right.

94
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,640
Ahem. Well...

95
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh?

96
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,930
I'll meet somebody later. I have to go.

97
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,770
Don't follow me again.

98
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,860
Ah, is that OK
if I don't give you a ride?

99
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,000
You think I'm a little boy?

100
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,230
You can do what you need to do.

101
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,620
I have to go.

102
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,980
Thank you for your hard work.

103
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,490
Thank you, sunbae.

104
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,970
I was able to finish the shoot
thanks to you.

105
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,290
OK. But you don't need to force a smile.

106
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,020
Adjust your state while working.

107
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,790
People here can tell
when you are not yourself.

108
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,820
OK. Thank you.

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,390
Goodbye, everyone.

110
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,650
Thank you, sunbae.

111
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,880
Jun,

112
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,850
Chim On seems very satisfied with you.

113
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,430
Is that so?

114
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,890
I just felt like he taught me a lesson.

115
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,880
No, I think

116
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,960
he is very satisfied with you.

117
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,900
What?

118
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,100
You didn't take your eyes off Chim On
at all today.

119
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,860
He's very handsome.

120
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,320
Oh, really?

121
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,970
- Are you upset?
- No.

122
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,620
I'm not upset. Why should I be jealous?

123
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,880
I didn't say you were jealous.

124
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,220
I said no.

125
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,580
That's right, you're jealous.

126
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,370
I said no!

127
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,240
You are the most handsome.

128
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,480
You want to get away with it again.

129
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,540

137
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,360
Anyway, thanks to Lee Jun,

138
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,020
we'll become regulars, right?

139
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,240
Ah...

140
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,490
Lee Jun wasn't so dull before.

141
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,940
And Chim On

142
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,360
hasn't signed the contract yet.

143
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,280
Oh, I should have become an idol too.

144
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,140
I didn't know it would help

145
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,070
so much.

146
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,620
Oh, isn't Chim On
a very difficult person?

147
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,030
But

148
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,680
he hates dull people.

149
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,360
However,

150
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,750
Lee Jun and Chim On got along very well.

151
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,890
Maybe Lee Jun is quite

152
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,360
resourceful.

153
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,670
Lee Jun may look soft on the outside,

154
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,730
but he behaves like Chim On's fan.

155
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,880
I think that's the real him.

156
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,110
That's true.

157
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,900
I've actually been feeling
a little awkward recently.

158
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,960
How should I put it?

159
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,820
I always feel like
someone's watching me from behind.

160
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,070
It's obvious that Lee Jun
knew the group leader before,

161
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,090
but it feels like
he also knew the general manager.

162
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,240
Ah...

163
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,680
Come to think of it,

164
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,640
they came to work together
on the first day.

165
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,010
Ahem.

166
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,480
But our general manager

167
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,970
is known for taking good care of people.

168
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,050
That's why he takes good care of us.

169
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,960
Right?

170
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,140
He's the general manager.

171
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,330
Hee-hee.

172
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,030
Ahem.

173
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,330
Um...

174
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,020
The design book
of the competing products.

175
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,670
Wow. This is really important, right?

176
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,770
This is good.

177
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,760
Hee-hee-hee.

178
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,120
Mi-yeong, have you finished yours?

179
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,010
I just made deletions in the cloud disk.

180
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,180
Ah, I should have done the same.

181
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,150
Me too!

182
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,690
Ha-ha.

183
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,430
Well, sunbae,

184
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,410
you are not busy today?

185
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,870
What? Are you finally going to
go on a date with me?

186
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,460
Why did you say "finally"?

187
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,570
You sound like I was
avoiding you on purpose.

188
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,160
It's best if you weren't.

189
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,940
Ah... What can I do about it?

190
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,480
I did fantasize about it today.

191
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,240
Perhaps

192
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,920
I can meet Lee Jun today.

193
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,090
So,

194
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,700
can I see you again some time later?

195
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,520
Whenever you have time, sunbae.

196
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,770
Ah... Hard to say.

197
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,960
But you know what?

198
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,830
That sentence just now,

199
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,010
I have said it to you every day.

200
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,150
Have you?

201
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,200
Anyway, the one
who is tempted first loses.

202
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,570
I will text you the itinerary.

203
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,670
Don't forget to text back.

204
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,060
Don't do that again, OK?

205
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,950
OK, sunbae.

206
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,170
Oh...

207
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,400
Don't smile so charismatically.

208
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,740
Huh?

209
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,620
Then I'll meet you again

210
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,780
when I have time.

211
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,380
Lee Jun.

212
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,810
He's not the friend you knew anymore.

213
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,440
What?

214
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,580
He's now our benefactor!

215
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,680
So you are so close to the savior!

216
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,700
Ah, Senior Chim On... Sorry.

217
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,300
Chim On asked me
to bring him some papers.

218
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,960
We still need to
discuss the requirements.

219
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,380
Like you said,
it's up for discussion, right?

220
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,220
But that almost failed, right?

221
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,800
That's what made him the savior.

222
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,800
Thank you. Thanks.

223
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,440
General Manager.

224
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,600
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you.

225
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,310
Lee Jun.

226
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,410
Yes.

227
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,660
What else do you want to say?

228
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:31,860
Nothing.

229
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,280
OK then.

230
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,480
What was that?

231
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,560
- Lee Jun.
- Yeah.

232
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,510
Ah, OK.

233
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,350
Thank you.

234
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,500
- See you tomorrow.
- OK.

235
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,890
To write some material,

236
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,840
I just need to know how to type,

237
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,430
is that right?

238
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,620
Lee Jun.

239
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,970
Come to my office.

240
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,940
Ah. Sure.

241
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,810
You can't go home today.

242
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,160
You have to stay with me tonight.

243
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,430
Look at that paper.

244
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,820
Oh.

245
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,970
Do you understand netclub?

246
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,450
Um... Netclub...

247
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,800
Let's start,

248
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,530
if you don't want
to stay up all night with me here.

249
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,370
Hm?

250
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,120
So what if we are in the same company?

251
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,070
We can't even talk properly.

252
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,800
Goodbye then.

253
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,040
Oh...

254
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,500
When I was absent,

255
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,770
why was he liked by everyone?

256
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,090
Hello, General Manager.

257
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:11,160
Mr. Kim, please come to my office.

258
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,460
Ah, this is quite simple,

259
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,520
but it's time-consuming.

260
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,200
And I'll be away from the office today.

261
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,610
Is that so?

262
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,150
What a hassle.

263
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,060
This has to be sorted out today.

264
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,770
Since it's simple,

265
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,500
why don't you have an intern do it?

266
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,490
Ah, I'm very happy to do that.

267
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,240
You are so smart, sir.

268
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,000
(He looks cool in glasses too.)

269
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,510
(Is it because he is handsome?)

270
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,760
It will cause many problems

271
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,850
to sort out such a situation.

272
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,840
It will be difficult for you.

273
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,500
Thanks for your hard work.

274
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,760
You should have done it right
from the start.

275
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,900
You are so strange to me

276
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,970
when you talk like that.

277
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,780
Why are you laughing?

278
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,400
You seem to like to mention the past.

279
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,420
You don't even know me well.

280
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,290
Do you think you know me well?

281
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,940
You know about my past.

282
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:48,930
Yeah?

283
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,260
So,

284
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,980
what is your relationship with Chim On?

285
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,270
What about you?

286
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,860
How did you become
a general manager at your age?

287
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,740
That's very strange.

288
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,170
I asked you first.

289
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,450
Ah...

290
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,530
Are you really the president's son?

291
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,520
Yeah.

292
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,140
Ah, really?

293
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,770
That's perfect.

294
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,260
Now it's my turn.

295
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,440
What is your relationship with Chim On?

296
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,940
He is a senior from my former company.

297
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,440
Your former company?

298
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,790
Ah, I used to be an idol singer.

299
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,080
You?

300
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,360
Hey, what does that mean?

301
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,100
That hurts.

302
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,960
I'm a really good dancer.

303
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,590
Oh, no, I was just...

304
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,340
I was just...

305
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,910
It seems you are
not interested in me at all.

306
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,600
You are wrong.

307
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:02,480
You are special to me.

308
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,960
Are you joking
or do you always talk like that?

309
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,180
That's pretty tempting.

310
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,080
Are you tempted?

311
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,000
What? You are?

312
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,810
Yeah.

313
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,030
Huh?

314
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,570
- Now...
- To this?

315
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,320
Surprise!

316
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,500
Yeong.

317
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,180
Ta-da! Are you
looking forward to snacks?

318
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,160
Why should we?

319
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,790
We could go out to eat.

320
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,410
(Chim On: You hid yourself after all.)

321
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,400
(You are more childish than I thought.)

322
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,360
What am I doing now?

323
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,700
Hey, how did you get in?

324
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,330
I thought you could at most
send the fried chicken.

325
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,840
I don't think you have an employee ID.

326
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,660
Yeong's father
is a council member of our company.

327
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,760
Her mother is not very famous.

328
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,170
You are a second-generation rich?

329
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,690
Oh, those people
can't even support themselves.

330
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,520
That tag is totally useless.

331
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,850
Yeong.

332
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,960
What's wrong?

333
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,580
Did I make a mistake again?

334
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,850
Yeah. It's a little rude.

335
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,320
No.

336
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,920
I don't know why
but you really look like one.

337
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,920
Ha-ha-ha. He is so funny.

338
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,910
Yeah, come to think of it,

339
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,080
when we first met,

340
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,830
I thought you were like a pigeon,
that's kind of funny.

341
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,550
When I first met Choi Jun,

342
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,920
I thought he was like a bear.

343
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,960
Bear?

344
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,410
Yeah.

345
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,410
This bear would meet

346
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,560
any requirement of anybody.

347
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,460
He was a little silly.

348
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,660
It must be nice that you have

349
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,070
so many memories in common.

350
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,710
Is he angry?

351
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,700
Then why don't you take a step back?

352
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,510
Do you think I'm a little baby?

353
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,100
I'm not angry.

354
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,660
He is so cute.

355
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,560
Why didn't you take him down
when you had chance?

356
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,460
Heh...

357
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:29,360
Talk to him like you're in love with him.

358
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,320
Maybe I will.

359
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,160
(He does that to everybody.)

360
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,340
(I'm glad I didn't ask)

361
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,940
(if he was serious.)

362
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,310
Ah, I don't need to stay up all night.

363
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,620
It's basically done.

364
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,960
Do you think it's because of your help?

365
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,600
Well... I think so.

366
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,550
I'm done.

367
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,860
What?

368
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,750
You can leave first since you are done.

369
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,830
I still have a lot to do.

370
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,290
After finishing this,

371
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,800
I still need to conceive a case planning
for the new product.

372
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,680
I'll wait for you.

373
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,750
What will you do during this time?

374
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,700
Q&A.

375
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,160
Is that so?

376
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,660
Yeah.

377
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,850
When did you come back to Korea?

378
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,650
Two years ago.

379
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,490
Two years ago?

380
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,830
You became a general manager in 2 years?

381
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,530
I first worked in the US branch,

382
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,480
and was sent to work in Korea
2 years ago.

383
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,270
Oh... Heh-heh...

384
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,030
That's good.

385
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,280
Did you go to the US

386
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,920
to learn how to be a good successor?

387
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,920
Don't tell me
the one sleeping over there

388
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,030
is your fiancee from your childhood.

389
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,440
Ha-ha-ha...

390
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,970
Hey, come on.

391
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,630
Well, that's part of the reason.

392
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,550
But there was another reason.

393
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,030
I knew it.

394
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,530
I went to the US because of my mother.

395
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,780
She is really your fiancee?

396
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,620
Yeah.

397
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,240
Heh-heh... Heh-heh...

398
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,340
I knew you were close.

399
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,380
Wait a minute. What are you thinking?

400
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,650
OK! I'm done too!

401
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,660
Wow, the last train is coming.

402
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:15,820
I'll give you a ride.

403
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,390
You two should go home together.

404
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,330
Come on.

405
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,550
Are you done?

406
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,290
Yeah, you are awake.

407
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,220
We are almost ready to leave.

408
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,580
Almost ready?

409
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,660
But he's gone.

410
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,910
Oh...

411
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,350
Ah...

412
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,810
He's really unbelievable!

413
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,690
He should have told me earlier!

414
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,790
I thought it was love.

415
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,640
Ah...

416
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,040
Oh...

417
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,840
I said I'd take the subway!

418
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:02,410
What?

419
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,570
Jun, you just finished working?

420
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,300
Wait, you just got off work?

421
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
It's so late.

422
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,570
Oh...

423
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,230
It has been a long day.

424
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,660
What about you?

425
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,800
Why did you get off work so late?

426
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,710
Should I change my name?

427
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,200
Huh? What are you talking about?

428
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,890
You don't understand.

429
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,130
We are both called Jun,

430
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,540
but we are so different.

431
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,800
I don't think I'm worthy of that name.

432
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,260
Did anybody say that to you?

433
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,640
No, not at all.

434
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,860
I was just

435
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,180
a failed idol who achieved nothing.

436
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,170
The general manager
is the same age as me,

437
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,480
but he's already a general manager.

438
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,680
He's talented and...

439
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,960
There are always people better than you,

440
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,610
could this be the reason
why you give up trying?

441
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,020
No, I don't mean that.

442
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,680
If you fall in love with someone,

443
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,120
the rest of the world will be less good,

444
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,960
am I right?

445
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,470
But Choi Jun...

446
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,560
I'm sorry, the general manager
is really excellent.

447
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,330
His wealth, family background,
fame, ability and so on...

448
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:41,080
There are still some interesting things
you can count.

449
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,920
What do you mean?

450
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,310
How many people in the world

451
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,300
like that person?

452
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,500
Ha-ha-ha...

453
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,880
That's so romantic.

454
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,260
But that can't be objective.

455
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,260
Why?

456
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,120
Because I don't know

457
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,600
how many people like me in the world,

458
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,510
and how many are suffering from

459
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,330
one-sided love.

460
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:31,590
Yes, there are a lot of people like that.

461
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:43,810
Well, it's not Choi Jun's fault
to have a fiancee.

462
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,150
It smells good.

463
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,020
It smells good?

464
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,370
Wake up, Lee Jun!

465
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:17,180
Anyway, it will be good if my shampoo

466
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,800
smells like this. Come on!

467
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,350
Oh, who can take this away from me?

468
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,190
I mean it.

469
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,880
Yeah, we'll be around your company.

470
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,580
Tomorrow?

471
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:41,930
Yeah.

472
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,850
Have lunch with me tomorrow, OK?

473
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,620
Sunbae,

474
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,230
I thought you wouldn't eat anything
other than salad.

475
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,400
It's not that I don't want to, I just can't.

476
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,360
I heard you are looking for models
for new products.

477
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,480
Yes, that's right.

478
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,990
I was about to ask you that.

479
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,580
So I called you first. I did you this favor,

480
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,340
so you will have lunch with me tomorrow.

481
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,500
OK, brother. Thank you.
See you tomorrow.

482
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,920
Brother? Did you just call me brother?

483
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,560
Lee Jun.

484
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,320
(Why did he come?)

485
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,530
Lee Jun. It is me.

486
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,930
(Will he think I'm not in)

487
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,030
(if I keep quiet?)

488
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,050
I know you're in there.

489
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,030
(How does he know?)

490
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,090
I heard you just now.

491
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,960
(He doesn't mean the voice)

492
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,980
(in my mind, right?)

493
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,850
I don't know what you're thinking,

494
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,740
but please open the door first.

495
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:46,930
Oh...

496
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,000
Why did you come at such a late hour?

497
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,300
I'm here for my shirt.

498
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,330
Oh, wait a minute.

499
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,160
Here. Goodbye then.

500
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,760
Goodbye?

501
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,200
Yeah.

502
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,230
You really want me to be here for the shirt?

503
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,830
Of course.

504
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,200
Lee Jun,

505
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,880
fall in love with me.

506
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,650
In fact, I...

507
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,680
Ah...

508
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,730
You are hopeless.

509
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,130
Although you grew up in America,

510
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,280
I didn't expect you to be like this.

511
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,740
Wait, what are you talking about, Jun?

512
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,300
We can't do this.

513
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,800
What?

514
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:26,310
Please keep this distance
from me in the future.

What?

518
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,770
Did he just kick me out?

519
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
You are done? It must have been a long day.

520
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,250
Are you going home now?

521
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,160
Didn't you say you'd quit?

522
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,240
Ah... Yeah.

523
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,510
Don't you think it's inappropriate

524
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,560
to quit without telling me?

It's the first time I have had such an idea.

549

Aren't they planning to get married?

Choi Jun is always like this.
That is the problem.

555
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,390
How could you say that
about your fiance?

556
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,730
