I couldn't cook at first,

00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,590

and fast food every day.

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,850
Don't you remember their deadlines?

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,760

What do you think?

83
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,240
Among these products
that went through blind test,

84
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,190
three were selected as final selections.

85
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,820
Now that the perfumes
have been determined,

86
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,610
let's also take a look at the design

87
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,190
of the bottles and the packaging.

88
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,170
You participated in the concept design,

89
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,830
so tell me if you have any suggestions.

90
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,620
(Why is he acting like nothing happened?)

91
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,470

92
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,250
What about you?

93
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,600
Yeah.

94
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,650
You are trying to avoid me,

95
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,820
so I don't think you are OK.

96
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,210
No.

97
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,970
I am not avoiding you.

98
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,950
You are not?

99
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,860
Well...

100
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,320
Like I said,

101
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,710
I will make effort in my own way.

102
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,180
I also have something to work on,
so if you can tell me

103
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,550
which direction
you are making effort in,

104
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,720
maybe I can help you.

108
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,880
You can't help me with it.

109
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,220
Yeah?

110
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,330
What a pity.

111
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,320
I also have something to work on.

112
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,860
I thought we could

113
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,810
help each other,

114
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,530
and form

115
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,620
a win-win relationship.

116
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,860
Is there anything I can do to help you?

117
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,470
What is it?

118
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,250
I want your love.

119
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,940
Huh?

120
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,090
I want to be loved by you.

121
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,690
I want to rely on you.

122
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,480
I wish we could be as close as before.

123
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,320
So...

124
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,480
We are in the company.

125
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,530
There's work to do.

126
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,420

127
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,880
So do you understand

128
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,100
what I want to say now?

129
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,240

130
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,370

134
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,380
I got it. Stop talking.

135
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,380
Recently,

136
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,590
I have been feeling like

137
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,040
I'm forcing you to stay with me.

138
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,360
I feel very lonely every day.

139
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,520
If it's because of what I said yesterday,

140
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,500
you don't have to explain everything.

141
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,220
I always wanted to tell you,

142
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,780
but

143
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,560
I was afraid
you would hate me like this.

144
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,920
So I didn't say it.

145
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,600
How would I know

146
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,760
if you don't tell me?

147
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,880
You didn't tell me about

148
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,330
where you would go,

149
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,000
where you would be,

150
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,010
how your family was like,

151
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,970
whether you had a fiancee,

152
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,010
so how would I know about that?

153
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,250
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,420
I know the answers now.

155
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,910
I will never misunderstand you
or avoid you again.

156
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,160
Give me some more time.

157
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,490
Please.

158
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,860
OK.

159
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,780
Come on, let's continue.

160
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,800
Oh, this one is really good.

161
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,770
It's a little heavy,

162
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,260
but not too heavy.
The base note is good.

163
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,220
It is stronger than the first one.

164
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,720
You are right.

165
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,960
I think this perfume

166
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,280
will be the most popular.

167
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,480
OK.

168
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,280
OK. 30 minutes later,

169
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,850
we'll have a meeting about proposals

170
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,920
in this conference room.

171
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,480
- Agent Lee?
- OK.

172
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,830
Dong-hyeon, let's go
to give the presentation.

173
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,260
OK.

174
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,630
What should I do?

175
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,490
My proposal is not even ready yet.

176
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,860
Will it be okay?

177
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,050
It's just a meeting.

178
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,990
You'll be fine.

179
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,540
Just say what you want to say.

180
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,500
OK.

181
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,940
I believe everyone has got the papers.

182
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,670
Today's discussion focuses on

183
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,200
the sales plan of the product.

184
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,640
Let's start with
the advertising and marketing team.

185
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,980
Are you all ready?

186
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,250

187
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,240
OK, I'll start now.

188
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,080
The hair perfume we are launching

189
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,540
gives you a refreshing atmosphere

190
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,930
like you have just gone out of a shower.

191
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,640
The highlight

192
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,820
(Perfume+Essence, refreshing feeling)
of this product is the packaging.

193
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,820
The packaging is indeed beautiful.

194
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,800
People would think it's perfume.

195
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,590
You can have perfume and essence
at the same time.

196
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,830
I think that's another highlight.

197
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,610
This product is of fairly high quality.

198
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,080
Now I want to hear your opinions.

199
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,580
This product
has the texture of essential oil.

200
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,430
Don't you think
it's more suitable for a classical style?

201
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,780
It makes you feel

202
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,640
you are in a luxury hotel.

203
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,000
Compared to going on vacation
for several days,

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,640
people tend to
enjoy vacation at home recently.

205
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,810
Its target population

206
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,140
is young people
in their twenties and thirties.

207
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,120
It is also good
to reflect the latest fashion trends.

208
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,290
If we do that,

209
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,080
it will be hard for it to become

210
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,030
a classic product.

211
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,140
Interns, what do you think?

212
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,640
I think blue is good.

213
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,160
It is the color of the sea.

214
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,000
We can accentuate the feeling
with the sea as the background.

215
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,060
I think that's the same thing

216
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,460
we talk about every day.

217
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,320
I think that concept is a little

218
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,680
too contrived.

219
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,880
It will be too similar
to other products of the same type.

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,210
Dong-hyeon, what do you think?

221
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,010
Well...

222
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,310
They've said everything I want to say.

223
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,540
Lee Jun, what is that in your hand?

224
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,310
Oh, this is...

225
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,220
Is it your proposal?

226
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,160
Show it to us
since you've made some preparation.

227
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,400
I think perfume is something that

228
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,690
can change your image in an instant

229
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,370
and leave a strong impression.

230
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,700
So the concept I set for this product

231
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,740
is the moment you lose yourself

232
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,660
unknowingly.

233
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,460
I'm going to show you a short video

234
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,660
about 10 seconds.

235
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,970
That's good. I felt like I fell for it.

236
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,260
In daily life,

237
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,370
you would like to know

238
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,840
everything about that person.

239
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,650
Even if it's only 10 or 15 seconds,

240
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,570
it makes your heart race.

241
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,890
Just like Chim On,

242
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,820
while we were working,

243
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,490
he only smiled at me

244
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,450
when we saw each other's eyes.

245
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,930
This is my idea.

246
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,450
Ads are meant to
catch the audience's attention

247
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,120
in a short period of time.

248
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,980
I think

249
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,850
Lee Jun's idea is very good.

250
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,780
My apprentice is really good.

251
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,980
That's a good proposal.

252
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,010
I can see it already.

253
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,160
The ads must be good.

254
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,170
I also think it's good.

255
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,180
Since everyone agrees,

256
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,110
we'll choose this proposal then.

257
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,260
Lee Jun's idea

258
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,240
will be developed by Group Leader Song

259
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,470
and Ms. Lee.

260
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,650
Then give it to
our photography department.

261
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,180
So that's all for today's meeting.

262
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,670
Thanks for your hard work.

263
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,760
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

264
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,600
What are you gonna eat for lunch?

265
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,400
Thanks for your hard work.

266
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,440
Lunch is on me.

267
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,660
OK.

268
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,280
Was the lunch good?

269
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,420
Yeah, very delicious.

270
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,500
That is a famous gourmet restaurant,

271
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,130
but I don't know if it suits your taste.

272
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,960
The places you introduced to me
were all gourmet restaurants.

273
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,900
So of course

274
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,120
I like everyone of them.

275
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,850
Jun...

276
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,370
(Choi Jun)
Oh...

277
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,430
What's up?

278
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,680
I mean...

279
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,380
You were saying?

280
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,120
Ah... Oh...

281
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,200
Lee Jun, what I want to say is...

282
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,800
I'm sorry, it's Mr. Kim.

283
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,640
OK, answer it.

284
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,440
Hello, sir.

285
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,540
I'll confirm it right away. OK.

286
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,580
Hey, what were you trying to say?

287
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,170
Ah... Well...

288
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,840
Your takeout is ready.

289
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,530
Sorry about that.

290
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,160
It doesn't matter.

291
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,700
Let's go back to the office.

292
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,240
OK.

293
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,510
Oh, I know!

294
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,780
He insisted that

295
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,520
it's boring to be a fan
of an unpopular idol.

296
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,680
And I got a rap over the knuckles.

297
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,560
Ah...

298
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,720
What's more,

299
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,820
the seniors here have terrible taste.

300
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,250
They are all old sticks-in-the-mud.

301
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,020
They even asked me
what the general trend is.

302
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,540
I feel sorry for myself

303
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,880
for ending up here
after so much hard work.

304
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,250
Can I say something
as an old stick-in-the-mud?

305
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,090
No.

306
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,620
Ah, yes, yes, sir.

307
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,170
No matter how much you dislike it,
in the company,

308
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,120
you are a member of a team.

309
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,620
Yes.

310
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,300
Do you know
there are no secrets in this world?

311
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,040
Yes.

312
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:44,510
They will always be heard by somebody.

313
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,180
And although it is different
from your imagination,

314
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,260
the company wants honest people

315
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,720
rather than smart ones.

316
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,990
After some time,

317
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,540
people's abilities will become similar.

318
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,100
Yeah.

319
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,400
Yeong-seok.

320
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,470
Yes.

321
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,960
Although there's no much time left,

322
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,260
I'm looking forward to

323
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,100
seeing your change.

324
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,040
OK. I will work hard.

325
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,830
All right. It's OK.

326
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,770
I will work hard.

327
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,020
You can do that.

328
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,920
The rookies of the marketing team
are really working hard.

329
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,130
That's the only way

330
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,730
to become a regular.

331
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,060
If we make mistakes...

332
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,310
We will try our best.

333
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,180
The shooting is about to start.

334
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,900
Every problem will be solved.

335
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,520
Most importantly,

336
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,480
this will be the first shooting.

337
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,390
You'll be very sad

338
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,280
if you get fired like Yeong-suk.

339
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,900
Should we go together?

340
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,130
I want to stay in the office
to support other colleagues.

341
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,180
See you later.

342
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,860
Let's go then.

343
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,350
The car is waiting downstairs.

344
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,560
- OK.
- OK.

345
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,420
Isn't Group Leader Song
going to the studio today?

346
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,590
Oh, Mr. Song went out this morning.

347
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,110
He'll join us later.

348
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,040
OK. Let's go.

349
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,380
- OK.
- Yeah.

350
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,450
See you later.

351
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,440
- See you.
- Goodbye. Fighting!

352
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,040
- Bye. Fighting!
- Fighting!

353
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,040
See you later.

354
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,140
Ha-ha... Ha-ha...

355
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,910
Be careful.

356
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,280
Can we put it here?

357
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,220
Yeah, just put it there.

358
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,450
Ah, Group Leader Choi!

359
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,620
Oh, you are
the general manager now, huh?

360
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,600
It's been a long time.

361
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,980
How have you been, Director?

362
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,960
I'm still the same.

363
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,010
Work, work and work again.

364
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,220
That's it.

365
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,780
Working can solve every problem.

366
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,640
- Please confirm this.
- OK.

367
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,600
And tell Min-yeong and Dong-hyeon

368
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,330
- to check the finishing touches too.
- OK.

369
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,210
Then please ask Mr. Chim On

370
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,770
to confirm this.

371
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,300
OK. Got it.

372
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,580
I heard about that agency.

373
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,490
Thank you so much for

374
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,410
cooperating with us.

375
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,960
We definitely have shortcomings...

376
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,480
Oh, not at all.

377
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,760
Your new recruits

378
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,780
contacted me.

379
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,120
Everyone is very
enthusiastic and hardworking.

380
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,080
Thanks to them,

381
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,110
although we had a hard time

382
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,530
at the proposal meeting,

383
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,800
it was very interesting.

384
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,660
It's just that
the proposal is very detailed,

385
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,800
but I don't know if Chim On can accept it.

386
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,780
He has great abilities,

387
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,130
but also a bad temper.

388
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,040
He always chooses offers
based on feeling.

389
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,180
How was your trip?

390
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,300
Jun, you have been ignoring
my text messages lately.

391
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,100
It's not like that.

392
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,560
You always text me in the wee hours,

393
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,590
so I can't find the right time
to text back,

394
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,050
because it's rude to reply late.

395
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,090
I did it on purpose.

396
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,350
Don't you want me to text back?

397
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,500
Ha-ha.

398
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,550
I don't mean that.

399
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,640
I love texting you

400
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,350
in the middle of the night,

401
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,400
because it makes me feel close to you.

402
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,960
There's no new content,

403
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,910
except for some clarification.

404
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,300
It's easy to understand.

405
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,560
OK. I'll read it later. Thank you.

406
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,080
OK, if you need anything

407
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,480
or there is any problem...

408
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,160
What are you going to do
after the shoot?

409
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,800
I think I'll have dinner
with my colleagues.

410
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,610
Oh, you'll have dinner with me.

411
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,700
And then we'll go for dessert,

412
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,810
and then to the bar
and then to my place.

413
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,200
It's a perfect arrangement, isn't it?

414
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,110
I'll have a get-together
with my colleagues.

415
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,040
Will you come?

416
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,890
A get-together?

417
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,000
Can you have night snacks with me
after that?

418
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,580
But you can only have salad
for night snack.

419
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,060
No salad.

420
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,000
I'll cook instant noodles for you.

421
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,840
Are your place and my place
in the same direction?

422
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,620
I think so.

423
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,560
Where exactly do you live?

424
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,690
What?

425
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,200
You really want to come?

426
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,890
No.

427
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,240
You said that your place and mine
are in the same direction.

428
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,500
Shooting is about to start.

429
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,370
Nice to meet you.

430
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,420
I'm Choi Jun,
the general manager of the company.

431
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,550
I am looking forward to
your performance today.

432
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,480
OK.

433
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,560
Sunbae, let's go.

434
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,050
Let's talk later then.

435
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,040
You can't run away, you know?

436
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,980
Wow!

437
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,430
Whoa!

438
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,370
Wow!

439
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,170
Ha-ha-ha.

440
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,700
He's killing me!

441
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,510
That's not bad.

442
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,750
I think it is a bit inconsistent
with the proposal.

443
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,390
He's not relaxed enough.

444
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,260
Should I tell him?

445
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,990
Yeah, I think you should.

446
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,300
This is art.

447
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,060
This seems to be
somewhat different from our concept.

448
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,840
Can I tell him about it?

449
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,540
Thanks.

450
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,740
OK.

451
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,820
- Director.
- Yeah?

452
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,810
They have some comments to make.

453
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,850
Customers sometimes feel differently.

454
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,480
What is it?

455
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,220
It doesn't conform to
the concept in the proposal.

456
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,040
What we want

457
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,710
is the charm of a boyfriend
that only I can feel,

458
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,860
and

459
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,700
the special moments

460
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,030
only for me in daily life.

461
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,600
Don't I look like a boyfriend now?

462
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,870
No. There's a sense of distance.

463
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,390
OK.

464
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,280
The pictures look good,

465
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,300
very good.

466
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,420
I want to know what the boyfriend

467
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,740
in your mind is like.

468
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,530
Let's take a break.

469
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,460
Lee Jun, take a break.

470
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,160
No, I have something to say with him.

471
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,120
As the model,
you should take some rest.

472
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,780
And I'll take away my employee.

473
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:32,990
Heh.

474
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,340
The atmosphere is not good,

475
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,690
and the progress is slow.

476
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,980
I'm sorry.

477
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,010
It's my fault.

478
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,460
No, I mean that model.

479
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,900
You already explained it,
but he was still asking.

480
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,450
Why does he always grab your hand?

481
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,540
He's not your boyfriend.

482
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,760
Ha-ha, what are you talking about?

483
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,190
You think you are?

484
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,050
What do you think?

485
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,330
But the director was right.

486
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,880
If we want to get the pictures we want,

487
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,910
I'm afraid the proposal
or shooting time will be changed.

488
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,990
But what you want

489
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,760
is better than
what he showed just now, right?

490
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,660
Anyway, the things you said just now

491
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,190
are hard to understand

492
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,180
for anybody.

493
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,360
Can't you give them
a more specific reference?

494
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:38,680
You. How should I put it?

495
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,000
You are the reference.

496
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,580
How should I tell them that?

497
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,220
Oh...

498
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,380
