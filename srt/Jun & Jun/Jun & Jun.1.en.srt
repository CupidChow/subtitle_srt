Wake up, Jun, you're gonna be late.

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,588
Oh, no!

10
00:01:53,954 --> 00:01:54,890
(My Light, Lee Jun)

00:02:02,982 --> 00:02:05,540
(Mom:
My Jun's first day of work, fighting!)

12
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,537
(You must be well-prepared.
Don't worry about it.)

13
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,250
I will get off work tonight
with the same smile! Fighting!

14
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,188
Hee-hee, I will be a member
of the company then.

15
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,028
Oh, I almost forgot something.

16
00:02:42,857 --> 00:02:44,708
(This is Real Lager)

17
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,977
Welcome.

18
00:02:46,148 --> 00:02:46,948
Morning.

19
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,220
(Eun-hyeong:
Big news! I just saw Lee Jun!)

20
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,794
Hello, bro.

21
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:10,114
Have you come out for breakfast?

22
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,262
You must have breakfast
no matter how busy you are, OK?

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,700
I never expected

24
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,040
to hear that from you.

25
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,394
You never even told me to drink water.

26
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,740
(Min-ji: Lee Jun?)

27
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,737
(Eun-hyeong:
He was an idol from that boy band!!)

28
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:29,691
(Min-ji: Zeus?!
Which one of those three?)

29
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,400
By the way,

30
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,388
there was some accident at line 2.

31
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:43,660
People on it were busy calling in late.

32
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,982
Oh, accident?

33
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:46,537
1,000 won.

34
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,582
Lee Jun, tell me you got out
before that accident.

35
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,137
Well...

36
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,220
Of course, this is my first day.

37
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,780
OK, see you later.

38
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,670
OK. I haven't seen you for quite a while.
See you later.

39
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,590
OK, quite a while indeed.
See you.

40
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,970
Be careful on the road. Don't be late.

41
00:04:13,862 --> 00:04:14,720
(Eun-hyeong: This one.
Min-ji: How sweet. He's an actor now?)

42
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,630
(Eun-hyeong: I think he's going to work.)

43
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,422
Excuse me.

44
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,640
Can you please let me

45
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,180
take the first cab?

46
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:45,611
I can't be late to work today.

47
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:47,830
Nobody can be late to work, you know?

48
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:50,777
You are right.

49
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:52,960
There will be another cab very soon.

50
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,062
Then why don't you take the next one?

51
00:04:55,371 --> 00:04:55,691
Huh?

52
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,520
Oh, a madman early in the morning.

53
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:00,102
Huh?

54
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,382
No, I'm not a madman.

55
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:06,390
Not now, anyway.

56
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,131
Kim Yeong, what are you doing here?

57
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:13,840
Oppa.

58
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:15,428
Are you going to work?

59
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:17,862
Yes. I work in Gangnam, you know.

60
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,571
I can give you a ride.

61
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,622
Really?

62
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,140
You are a savior.

63
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,142
Wait a minute.

64
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:33,450
What's wrong with you?

65
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:36,400
Gangnam Station?
You are going to Gangnam Station?

66
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,885
Could you please also

67
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:41,790
give me a ride? I can pay.

68
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,710
Today is my first day of work.

69
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,130
I really can't be late.

70
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,060
Just now, this person was...

71
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,970
Work is important of course.
You look anxious. Get in.

72
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,600
I'll give you a lift.

73
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,780
(He must be an angel!)

74
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,451
Get in now! Aren't you in a hurry?

75
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:02,754
Oh, OK.

76
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,308
Are you looking for something?

77
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,051
No, nothing.

78
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,390
This is a nice car, so I can't help but...

79
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,950
Hey, you got a free ride already,

80
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,870
so you should be quiet like a luggage.

81
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,280
What are you so curious about?
You keep sniffing around.

82
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:44,640
Sniffing?

83
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,250
He has been sniffing around
since just now. What a pain.

84
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,600
Do you smell flower?

85
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:05,920
Yes, the lavender fragrance
is really nice.

86
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,508
I mean...

87
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:11,268
That's an invitation I got not long ago.

88
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,750
I think there's essence oil on it.

89
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,030
I think it's nice too.

90
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,930
What invitation?

91
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,140
Oppa, you are so kind-hearted.

92
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,150
There were so many
missing pigeons at the station.

93
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:28,230
You should have given them all a ride.

94
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,030
Why did you offer it
to only one of them?

95
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,150
It's good
to put that invitation there, right?

96
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,490
The lavender fragrance

97
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,390
can relieve stress and tension.

98
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,560
Oh, that's precisely the reason
why I like lavender.

99
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,940
Looks like you know this fragrance well.

100
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,630
What's happening?
You are getting along quite well.

101
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,830
Have you met before?

102
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,600
Kim Yeong, have you met him?
Why are you so hostile?

103
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,700
Well, he does look somewhat familiar.

104
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,702
Could it be that
he's got an average face?

105
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,565
No, of course this is
the first time we met.

106
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,130
It's rude
to stare at somebody like that.

107
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,050
But I am really

108
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,110
so cute that if I don't do that,

109
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,620
people will laugh at me.

110
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,130
But maybe you have seen him before.

111
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,670
I think my building is right ahead.

112
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,050
We also work around here.

113
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,380
Which building do you work in?

114
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,170
I still have time. I can send you there.

115
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,300
Oppa!

116
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,480
Really?

117
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,380
Thank you so much.

118
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,268
Please put me off
in front of that building.

119
00:08:57,908 --> 00:08:58,308
What?

120
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,410
What a coincidence.

121
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,160
That's also where I'm going.

122
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,540
Kim Yeong, I'm afraid
you have to take some walk.

123
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,180
You get off here, OK?

124
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,790
But I'm wearing high heels.

125
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,260
There are slippers
in the glove box, take them.

126
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,970
I think they'll fit.

127
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,960
You are always so considerate.

128
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:28,799
(154HA 9858)

129
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:33,314
(154HA 9858)

130
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,180
Thank you so much for the ride.

131
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,300
How should I express my gratitude?

132
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,920
I won't easily
let this kind of thing go.

133
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,680
Don't worry about it. It's nothing.

134
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,531
I don't agree.

135
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,365
Huh?

136
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,250
I believe if your job
doesn't require you

137
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,290
to be gentle and nice to people,

138
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,020
then you should be rewarded
for being nice and gentle.

139
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,730
Otherwise, it's not fair to nice people.

140
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,580
I got it.

141
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:24,160
(Chocolate Milk)

142
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,942
I don't have a business card.
Please take this.

143
00:10:32,914 --> 00:10:33,940
(Chocolate Milk)

144
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:43,550
OK. But it's almost 9 o'clock.

145
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,360
Really?

146
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,240
Anyway, thank you so much.
Be sure to contact me.

147
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,148
(What? This fragrance is so familiar.)

148
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:19,737
Thank you.

149
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,710
Come on. Come on. Come on.

150
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,302
Um? Why are you still here?

151
00:12:00,697 --> 00:12:03,337
The elevator was full.

152
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,420
Hello? I'll be there right away.

153
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,030
That's good.

154
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,560
Our general manager
always comes to work on the dot.

155
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,977
You must be earlier than him, OK?

156
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,994
You don't want to
leave a bad impression.

157
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,188
OK, I'm coming up.

158
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:38,320
(Elevator 1)

159
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,331
You are about to be late.
It's OK. Come in.

160
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:01,977
OK.

161
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,810
I can't thank you enough today.

162
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,910
Many people have helped me.
I have to repay everyone of them.

163
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:33,750
The one who called you is one of them, right?
You must owe him a lot.

164
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,110
He's always with me whenever I'm tired.

165
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,870
It was my dream to work in this company.

166
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,550
I got the chance thanks to him.

167
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:51,828
He's like my real brother.

168
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:55,885
Like your real brother?

169
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,540
The general manager
would punch in on the dot.

170
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,950
That's a very useful information.

171
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,140
Yeah.

172
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,920
I should thank him for that.

173
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,390
Oh, I forgot to press the button.

174
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,100
This is the eleventh floor.

175
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,210
Oh, this is it! W.COS!

176
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:19,348
This is where I work.

177
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,320
Since you want to thank me,
I'll do you a few more favors.

178
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,190
Do you want me to show you
how to always get to the office

179
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,060
earlier than the general manager?

180
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,617
You know that?

181
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,234
Come with me.

182
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,131
Hyun-jae.

183
00:15:10,205 --> 00:15:10,491
Jun.

184
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:12,274
Morning, General Manager.

185
00:15:14,354 --> 00:15:15,097
Morning, General Manager.

186
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,737
General Manager?

187
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:25,250
Now you are earlier
than the general manager.

188
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,502
Right?

189
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,422
Good morning, everyone.

190
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:35,725
This is the first day of work
for the interns, right?

191
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,577
Well done. None of you is late.

192
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,645
What is going on?

193
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,960
We should get to know each other.

194
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,620
Thirty minutes later,

195
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,640
the interns should come to my office
one by one.

196
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,900
OK.

197
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:03,020
(What was that?)

198
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,210
You must be in a flurry
on the way, right?

199
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:22,925
Yeah, this is my first day.
That's embarrassing.

200
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,550
On the first day,

201
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,420
your task is to remember
the names and titles of your colleagues.

202
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,580
This is the first time
I work in a company.

203
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,700
What I worry most is not being able

204
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,380
to get along with colleagues.

205
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,420
The general manager
came back from the US.

206
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,650
So the atmosphere here is pretty good.
Don't worry.

207
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,960
The US?

208
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:43,680
Yes.

209
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,977
He was originally in the US branch,

210
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,030
until he was transferred here to be

211
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,030
our general manager.

212
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,820
Our branch's sales last year
was not very good,

213
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,420
so the managements sent
the best general manager here.

214
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,760
Since he came,
our atmosphere became more active.

215
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,240
Jun, you will fit in very soon.

216
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,640
It sounds like he's nice.

217
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,620
He is indeed nice.

218
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,420
By the way,

219
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,740
why did you come
together with him this morning?

220
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,060
I didn't want to be late,
so I tried to take a cab.

221
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,691
But nothing turned out right.

222
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:31,140
But nothing turned out right.

223
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,960
In the end, Lee Jun

224
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,565
owes me a favor.

225
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,702
Yes.

226
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,350
I'll make another cup.
Please take mine.

227
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:45,188
Thank you, Group Leader.

228
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,640
- Lee Jun?
- Yes.

229
00:17:52,502 --> 00:17:53,200
See you in my office later.

230
00:17:58,091 --> 00:17:59,062
Oh, look at you.

231
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:01,577
Excuse me.

232
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,520
You are indeed in a flurry, Lee Jun.

233
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,890
How did your talk go?

234
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,410
Lee Jun is the last one.

235
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm still scared, come to think of it.

236
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,891
You must have heard it, right?

237
00:18:29,428 --> 00:18:31,657
Whether we can stay
is up to the project results.

238
00:18:31,931 --> 00:18:33,051
I know!

239
00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:34,950
I came here
through a special recruitment.

240
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,874
I thought I'd become a regular worker
right after my internship is over.

241
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,870
That means
maybe none of us can stay.

242
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,942
No wonder

243
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,070
it's so easy to become an intern here,
even easier than the open recruitment.

244
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,630
Maybe it's not that simple.

245
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,650
Sometimes they arrange a recruitment

246
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,817
just to make it easy for string-pullers.

247
00:18:57,931 --> 00:18:58,445
String-pullers?

248
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,340
Maybe this is it.

249
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,740
We've got one of them here.

250
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,970
When you hear string-pullers,
you think of him.

251
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,340
I mean the man named Lee Jun.

252
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,740
He came together with
the general manager this morning.

253
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,520
Could he be...

254
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,660
Jun, that's pretty fast.

255
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:21,771
Yes.

256
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,550
String-puller?

257
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,300
I think we are all string-pullers.

258
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,310
After all, we all came
through special recruitment.

259
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:33,645
Didn't we?

260
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:36,731
Thank you.

261
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:57,005
(Chim On Sunbae: Today is your
first day of work, huh? I miss you too.)

262
00:20:12,731 --> 00:20:14,480
It will be easy for you to repay me
in the future.

263
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,211
We'll often see each other after all.

264
00:20:18,262 --> 00:20:18,662
Huh?

265
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,460
It seems that you didn't mean it

266
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:26,080
when you said you would repay me.

267
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,931
No, no, I will definitely repay you.

268
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:30,651
You saved me. I won't forget that.

269
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,700
Your resumé is really one of a kind.

270
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,720
What's on it is novel and fun.

271
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:46,742
Manager in a cafe.

272
00:20:48,422 --> 00:20:49,702
Is cat cafe a real stuff?

273
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:50,720
Yes.

274
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,140
You can feed
and take care of cats there.

275
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:57,817
That sounds fun.

276
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,600
I'm interested in those
fragrance-themed products.

277
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:22,220
Can you be specific about this?

278
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,070
Whenever something important
happens to me

279
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,280
or I feel tired,

280
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,350
someone always gives me advice
with fragrances.

281
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,520
So when I learned that

282
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,840
we have fragrance-themed products,
I became interested.

283
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:49,480
Who is that person?

284
00:22:01,805 --> 00:22:03,177
Is it Group Leader Song Hyun-jae?

285
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:04,708
Yes.

286
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:09,660
Your letter of recommendation
was written by him.

287
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,770
Looks like he helped you a lot.

288
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,260
He did.

289
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,250
Hyun-jae, I mean, Group Leader,

290
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,022
is a person
whom I should thank a lot.

291
00:22:21,428 --> 00:22:21,954
I see.

292
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,845
Jun, can I ask you a question?

293
00:22:30,342 --> 00:22:30,708
Sure.

294
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:51,370
From this time to this time,
how was your life?

295
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,337
♪I miss you so much♪

296
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:29,497
It's been a long time.
How have you been?

297
00:23:30,114 --> 00:23:34,720
♪I have been waiting for you♪

298
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:37,980
♪I'm trying so hard to forget you♪

299
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,331
Choi Jun?

300
00:23:39,497 --> 00:23:40,274
Choi Jun.

301
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,340
Remember what I told you?

302
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,931
You should run or win the fight.

303
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,950
Do you want to be bullied every day?

304
00:23:49,474 --> 00:23:51,577
I knew you would come to help me.

305
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,890
What if I didn't come?

306
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,200
I can't be by your side every day.

307
00:23:59,977 --> 00:24:00,308
Why not?

308
00:24:02,777 --> 00:24:03,337
What why not?

309
00:24:03,954 --> 00:24:06,102
Didn't you say
you'd be with me forever?

310
00:24:07,142 --> 00:24:10,274
Oh, I did say that.

311
00:24:11,611 --> 00:24:13,020
But what happened today...

312
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,270
- Thank you, Lee Jun.
- Huh?

313
00:24:17,988 --> 00:24:18,560
Thank you.

314
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:28,080
You smell so nice.

315
00:24:30,925 --> 00:24:31,965
I have a smell on me?

316
00:24:32,628 --> 00:24:34,160
Yes, fragrance.

317
00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:36,937
Fragrance?

318
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,560
(Choi Jun is always with a fragrance,)

319
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,022
(a soft and warm one.)

320
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,120
(Jun and Jun)

321
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,262
The primary sales planning work

322
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:18,171
will be on you guys.

323
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:21,828
(That means this position
doesn't belong to me yet.)

324
00:25:22,742 --> 00:25:26,810
(Classic rookie,
making rookie mistakes.)

325
00:25:26,891 --> 00:25:28,742
(Sorry for the trouble
I keep bringing you.)

326
00:25:29,108 --> 00:25:30,400
(I actually like it.)

327
00:25:30,754 --> 00:25:32,068
(It's a special hobby.)

328
00:25:32,582 --> 00:25:35,800
(I want to return all the things
I got from you.)
