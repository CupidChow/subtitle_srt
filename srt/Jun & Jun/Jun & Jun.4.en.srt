00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,460
You are thinking too loud, you know?

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,640
It's tough for both of us.

3
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,380
Am I right?

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,160
Help me with it.

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,040
What?

6
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,970
You.

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,690
What exactly are you talking about?

8
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,400
You would

9
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,100
ask someone to help you at this time?

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,740
I mean, when you
have a physical reaction,

11
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,420
you would ask others to help you?

12
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,680
Is this the way of life you pursue?

13
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,270
Why is it getting bigger?

14
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,440
Ah, I'm surprised about one thing.

What is it?

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,370

Yeong, get in the back.

Why do I have to sit in the back?

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,310
I want to take the shotgun.

Yeong, say hello.

This is Jun.

52
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,180
What is going on?

53
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,660
Is this some kind of game?

54
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,710
Why am I a little upset?

55
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,220
Jun is here.

56
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,220
Cheer up.

57
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,490
What are you saying?

58
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,660
Isn't Jun your name?

59
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,270
Oh!

60
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,510
You mean

61
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,350
this is him?

62
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,320
You just don't understand.

63
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,650
What are you talking about?

64
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,250
I was talking to you!

65
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,920
This pigeon

66
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,990
is the one you mentioned a lot?

67
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,840
I am not a pigeon.

68
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,140
Park Jun...

69
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,280
Ah! Kim Jun!

70
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,160
It's Lee Jun.

71
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,440
That's right, Lee Jun.

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,100
When this guy just returned
from abroad,

73
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,360
he always sang a song
with your name in it.

74
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,940
I thought it was an Arirang song.

75
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,650
A Korean song.

76
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,980
Anyway, we actually met like this.

77
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,410
It's fate!

78
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,570
And you even work in Jun's company.

79
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,640
Nice to meet you.

80
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,990
My name is Kim Yeong.

81
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,970
Yeong is one year younger than us.

82
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,050
Then what should I call him?

83
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,480
I call him Jun,

84
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,630
so I should call you

85
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,560
sister?

86
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,410
Ahem.

87
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,080
Calling a boy sister is a bit...

88
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,930
What's wrong?

89
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,570
I heard that in the past, boys would

90
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,560
call each other sisters
if they were close.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,320
I saw it on TV.

92
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,150
Your Korean is really well.

93
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,420
So, sister!

94
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,740
Maybe you should call me pigeon.

95
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,920
That sounds aloof.

96
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,170
Oh, Jun!

97
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,920
Drop me off here.

98
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,590
I'll walk to my office.

99
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,020
Oh, there's still plenty of time.

100
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,700
I won't bother you two.

101
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,870
You haven't seen each other for so long,
I'm sure there's a lot to talk about.

102
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,080
I will contact you later.

103
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,300
OK.

104
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,950
See you later.

105
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,160
Goodbye, sister.

106
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,780
(She kissed him.)

107
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,590
Jun.

108
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,090
Are you all right?

109
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,170
I'm sorry. My hand...

110
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,050
What's going on?

111
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,620
I'm fine.

112
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,940
It spilled on your hand too.

113
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,640
I'm really sorry.

114
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,140
I'm not in the right state recently.

115
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm really sorry. Where are the wipes?

116
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,070
It's only the second day,
and you're out of form.

117
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
Why are you so reckless?

118
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,390
You are even still wearing pajamas.

119
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,570
But you'll get used to it in no time.

120
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,410
I hope so.

121
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,360
Jun,

122
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,830
do you have time today?

123
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,700
Yeah, what's the matter?

124
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,200
Well...

125
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,000
People tend to form

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,060
similar values

127
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,000
as those around you.

128
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,630
That's right.

129
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,250
People from another country

130
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,860
definitely have
different values from us.

131
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,550
Yes.

132
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,100
That's it.

133
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,650
Sometimes people will

134
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,360
unknowingly form some prejudice.

135
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,740
Is that so?

136
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,640
Of course.

137
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,170
Because this is a world
that respects diversity.

138
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,440
But...

139
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,920
Anyway,

140
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,700
don't you think it's inappropriate

141
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,280
to kiss a girl

142
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,920
after asking your old friend

143
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,520
to do you such a weird favor?

144
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,060
Weird favor?

145
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
What weird favor?

146
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:33,920
Huh?

147
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,120
That's over the line.

148
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,260
Yeah! It's confusing!

149
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,860
Well,

150
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,820
after experiencing that,

151
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,050
I can't get over my prejudice.

152
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,210
Oh...

153
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,660
There are many prejudices in the world
that should be put aside,

154
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,080
but maybe I'm not
that kind of forgiving person.

155
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,080
Woo.

156
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,620
I feel so much better

157
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,740
after telling you that.

158
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,640
Oh, by the way,

159
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,210
let's meet in front of the company
after work.

160
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,960
No, no. I forgot

161
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,620
I had a date tonight.

162
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,620
Is that so?

163
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,440
Oh, I have a training session later.

164
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,580
I'm leaving.

165
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,030
OK. See you later.

166
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,440
Oh... I dug a hole for myself.

167
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,160
Wait, who is that person?

168
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,900
How could he kiss a girl after asking

169
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,770
such a favor from his friend?

170
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:50,500
(General Manager Choi Jun)

171
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,070
Yeah, Yeong.

172
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,020
Jun, did you catch a cold?

173
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,140
No, it's just a sneeze.

174
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,990
You can't catch a cold
or you'll infect Jun.

175
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,970
Why do you care about him
so much now?

176
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,960
That's because

177
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,110
he was in your car this morning.

178
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,320
Are you together now?

179
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,460
Yeah.

180
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,490
Oh...

181
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,120
I thought you would feel awkward

182
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,340
because you haven't met for so long.

183
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,940
It looked better than I imagined.

184
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,800
Although many things have changed,

185
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,050
there are still things
that remained the same.

186
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,550
For example?

187
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,880
Whenever something important
happens to me

188
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,140
or I feel tired,

189
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,670
someone always gives me advice

190
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,580
with fragrances.

191
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,900
So when I learned that
we have fragrance-themed products,

192
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,010
I became interested.

193
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,300
Eyes.

194
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,420
Eyes?

195
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,960
Yeah.

196
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,380
Come on,

197
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,340
I'm saying this as your fiancee.

198
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,180
Perhaps...

199
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,180
Oh, sorry, I'm busy.

200
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,240
I will contact you later.

201
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
(Hair Perfume)

202
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,350
(Dong-hyeon: Anyone has the
latest version of the ppt template?)

203
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,960
Template?

204
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,310
(Mi-yeong: Ah, you can find it
in the cloud data room.)

205
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,790
Cloud?

206
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,820
(Dong-hyeon: Thank you.)

207
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,360
(Yeong-seok: How many batches
should be set in excel?)

208
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,570
What is batch?

209
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,800
(Mi-yeong: I set as many as I use.
There's a lot of data.)

210
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,720
(Yeong-seok: Then I'll do the same!)

211
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,500
Calm down. You can do it.

212
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,650
Just build a ppt that's

213
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,440
similar to that I have seen before.

214
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,720
Lee Jun.

215
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:37,890
Yeah.

216
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,420
Can you go get some coffee for us?

217
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,400
Ah... Coffee?

218
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,660
Everyone is sleepy at this time.

219
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,650
Oh, what coffee do you want?

220
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,740
I want an iced vanilla latte.

221
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,580
Lee Jun, you are going to buy coffee?

222
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,420
I want iced vanilla latte. Thank you.

223
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,580
OK.

224
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,030
Maybe

225
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,390
if the cashier recognizes you,

226
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,610
she'll give you

227
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,210
a free coffee.

228
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,080
I want iced americano.

229
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,370
I also want iced americano,
but lighter.

230
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,610
I want the same.

231
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,020
I want a thicker iced americano.

232
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,690
And next time,
if you want to ask something,

233
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,140
use the company's internal massage.

234
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,910
If you ask blindly like this,

235
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,480
you may get something wrong.

236
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,280
We need to increase productivity, yeah?

237
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,040
And you need to sign your name,

238
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,740
do it electronically.

239
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,390
Oh, got it. I will do it.

240
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,880
See you later.

241
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,020
Thank you.

242
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,990
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Lee Jun.

243
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,600
He had to push himself forward.

244
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,950
Huh?

245
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,010
At that dinner party,

246
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,640
he drank so much.

247
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,040
He made a fool out of himself, right?

248
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,310
He's helping us, don't you think

249
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,120
what you are saying is inappropriate?

250
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,750
He must be a rookie.

251
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,380
You should never
push yourself forward, right?

252
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,380
Oh, right.

253
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,390
He can't even remember
what coffee to order.

254
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,140
And he had to ask us.

255
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,180
What a trouble.

256
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,140
Am I right?

257
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,130
I am more depressed.

258
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,210
Ah, Lee Jun, you're back.

259
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,240
- Yeah.
- Good job.

260
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,880
Thanks.

261
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,530
Thank you.

262
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,200
Thanks.

263
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,420
Lee Jun, please make ten copies of this.

264
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,350
OK.

265
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,300
Still not off work?

266
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,540
I'll be off work in a while.

267
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,680
Is there any difficulty?

268
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,740
Do you want me to help you?

269
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,360
No, I'm good.

270
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,920
Please go home.

271
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,950
People like you should
get off work on time.

272
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:14,340
Well, don't stay here too late.

273
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,450
Of course.

274
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,380
OK. See you tomorrow, Lee Jun.

275
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,890
OK, sir.

276
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,040
Ta-da!

277
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,670
Hyun-jae?

278
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,100
Why don't you eat something sweet

279
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,040
and then do your job?

280
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,750
OK.

281
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,740
Wow, so nice.

282
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,600
Its smell makes me hungry.

283
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,520
I know you like cakes.

284
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,720
You know me so well.

285
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,220
Maybe it's because

286
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,120
we have spent a lot of time together.

287
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,280
Maybe.

288
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,300
♪Thinking of pearlescent her♪

289
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,480
Um...

290
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,020
Oh...

291
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,300
That was a gift from me.

292
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,800
You are still using it?

293
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,770
Oh, it is very comfortable.

294
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,510
It was so long ago.

295
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,400
I'll buy you a new one

296
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,740
as an apology for not being with you.

297
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:45,960
How about that?

298
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,180
It's so precious because it's from you.

299
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,950
I don't want to throw it away.

300
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,090
You can keep both of them.

301
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,150
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

302
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,880
Eat up.

303
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,470
It's really delicious.

304
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,780
Ah-woo.

305
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,640
Oh, are you so satisfied?

306
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,630
It's really tasty.

307
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,400
Yeah? It's cheese.

308
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,560
Min-yeong, your plan is great.

309
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,670
Min-yeong, aren't you nervous?

310
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,300
Of course I am.

311
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,040
I stayed up all night.

312
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,700
Guys, there's
a planning meeting today.

313
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,580
The General Manager will be there

314
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,100
and pick out the first batch

315
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,600
of qualified project proposals.

316
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,160
Please get all the documents ready.

317
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,630
The person in charge of the meeting,
come with me.

318
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,200
See you later.

319
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,500
- OK.
- OK.

320
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,320
Ah, I'm so envious.

321
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,550
My plan was eliminated immediately.

322
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,240
The content must be very good.

323
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,610
I took a look at it.

324
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,940
It's a good plan.

325
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,850
If it's rough,

326
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,840
I will suspect that
you did it on purpose.

327
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,680
Her proposal is very good.

328
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,780
I mean,

329
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,760
Lee Jun, you didn't even finish

330
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,330
your proposal.

331
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,140
I understand though. It's not easy.

332
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,490
Right?

333
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,340
- Ha-ha.
- Yeah.

334
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:30,880
Ah...

335
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,120
This was not adopted last time, right?

336
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,440
The General Manager will be here.

337
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,580
He hasn't read it yet.

338
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,220
Maybe he'll like it. Who knows?

339
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,940
We shouldn't give up
until the last moment.

340
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,700
Fighting.

341
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,470
After spending so much money,

342
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,470
these are the models you want?

343
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,750
What's wrong with you?

344
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,570
We want to cooperate with you,

345
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:13,430
but we have our own budget.

346
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,960
What happened?

347
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,300
Why are you not going in?

348
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,630
Ah, the meeting is not over yet.

349
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,320
We should go in.

350
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,470
Let's go in and get ready.

351
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,290
It's an important meeting.
The General Manager will be here.

352
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
Our meeting is important,

353
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,620
but their meeting must be important too.

354
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,450
Maybe we should tell
the General Manager.

355
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,900
Are you going to his office?

356
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,980
I am already very nervous,

357
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,020
why are they still talking in there?

358
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,450
When we have

359
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,680
a report meeting,

360
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,180
Yeong-seon always sits at the back.

361
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,070
General Manager.

362
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,120
Is it our group's meeting?

363
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,750
Yes, I think it's a brokerage company

364
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,480
with Mr. Lee Joo-hwan.

365
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,470
It doesn't seem to be over yet.

366
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,890
Do we have to use
this conference room?

367
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,040
Yes, sir.

368
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,900
The other meeting rooms
are all occupied.

369
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,140
Um...

370
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,060
Wait a minute outside.

371
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,400
I'll go in first.

372
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,000
He just went in without knowing

373
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,190
what the meeting is about?

374
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,670
Shhh. Make them some coffee first.

375
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,230
OK.

376
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,490
Mr. Park, nice to meet you.

377
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,500
I was going to meet you
after the meeting,

378
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:52,020
but the meeting isn't over yet.

379
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,920
This meeting has taken
such a long time.

380
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,070
There must be something wrong with it.

381
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,180
That is to say,
coordination is very important.

382
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,220
When we work together,

383
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,600
we can't only care about
our own business.

384
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,200
The process of mutual cooperation
is the most important.

385
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,260
Ha-ha-ha.

386
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,950
I also think that process
is the most important.

387
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,020
- That's right.
- Yeah, ha-ha-ha.

388
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,280
Wow, so he can also laugh.

389
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,900
I can also laugh like that, Min-young.

390
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,990
Does he not smile much?

391
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,260
Is it me

392
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,320
or handsome people

393
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,820
really shine?

394
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,900
Maybe he doesn't smile much

395
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,590
because he's too handsome
when he smiles.

396
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,280
I am shocked every time he laughs.

397
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:56,160
Is that so? He used to laugh a lot.

398
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,940
Thanks.

399
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,250
Thank you, Eun-hyeong.

400
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,900
This is yours, sir.

401
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,560
Please excuse me.

402
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,280
Mr. Park, you have been

403
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,420
in charge of our company
for more than 2 years.

404
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,960
You did me a lot of favors.

405
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,400
I remember when I first came here
for a meeting,

406
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,760
I saw you.

407
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,700
You were a group leader back then.

408
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,440
You are still as young as ever.

409
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,080
Yes, our group is young.

410
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,260
Maybe that's the precise reason

411
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,540
why I feel impulsive
from time to time.

412
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,610
As you know,

413
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,500
the models we got you,

414
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,370
especially those who only work for us,

415
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,650
sometimes you can't even
get them with money.

416
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,980
Especially this guy here, and

417
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,610
this one,

418
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,920
and this one too.

419
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,360
You can't hire them with what you offer.

420
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,120
With your budget,

421
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,480
it's impossible to finish these projects.

422
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,010
I very much agree with you.

423
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:17,890
So,

424
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,600
we do not accept
unreasonable requests.

425
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,600
We don't intend to pay
more than the existing budget.

426
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,830
The models you found for us,

427
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,380
we will end our cooperation with them.

428
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,530
Ha-ha-ha.

429
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,080
Sir, don't jump to conclusions yet.

430
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,380
I didn't say they couldn't do it.

431
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,920
I just said they
needed to be coordinated.

432
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,030
Didn't you say they didn't have time?

433
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,300
So how are you going to invite them?

434
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,140
You said they had other jobs to do.

435
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,790
Well, about that...

436
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,730
How about this?

437
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,120
Mr. Choi, let's have a detailed discussion.

438
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,110
Detailed?

439
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,220
I am very familiar with
your working methods.

440
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,230
You charge more money

441
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,870
than the number stated
by the brokerage company.

442
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,840
It's not bad to spend more money
to earn even more,

443
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,770
but compared to that,

444
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,680
we'd rather work
in the marketing group.

445
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,330
What do you mean?

446
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,300
For example,

447
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,740
finding a good model yourself,

448
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,130
creating better ads,

449
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:05,190
or building a good brand.

450
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,280
So that's the end of the meeting.

451
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,590
If you miss me,

452
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,370
you will miss so many great models.

453
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,700
I will see that disgusting Chim On

454
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,400
the moment I step out of this room.

455
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,220
Do you have another way

456
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,400
to get in touch with that arrogant guy?

457
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,040
What's going on?

458
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,500
Why is it so noisy?

459
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,520
Isn't Chim On in Paris now?

460
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,430
Sunbae, are you in Paris now?

461
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,000
Paris?

462
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,420
Lee Jun, has your company
moved to Paris?

463
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,360
No, our company is in Gangnam.

464
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,480
Why are you here?

465
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,830
I couldn't be able to reach you,

466
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,300
so I just came to take a look.

467
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,260
This is impossible.

468
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,760
I thought you were in Paris.

469
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,670
This is what models are like.
Good luck.

470
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,870
So your company is here, Jun.

471
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,830
What?

472
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:52,200
By the way,
you are smarter than expected.

473
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,560
Sunbae.

474
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,740
And your voice is so nice.

475
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,040
Ah, you also smell good.

476
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,740
Ah, no!

477
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,840
Sorry, he's my friend.

478
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,580
I'm sorry for this.
