No.

the members of the marketing group here

46
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,220
will get more opportunities

47
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,270

do your best to make better products.

51
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,840
For this reason, our marketing group

52
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,000
will start a brand new business

53
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,980

that is, the younger generation?

With this,

66
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,220
we want to do something totally different.

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,100
We want to carry out
a new brand promotion

68
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,950

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,180
As for the new product planning,

70
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,370
the design group and our marketing group

71
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,940
will do the design together.

72
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,690
The marketing group also has to
participate in the designing?

73
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,290
Of course.

74
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,820
The design features will be
the highlights of marketing.

75
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,740
And, most importantly,

76
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,490
the primary sales planning work

77
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,760
will be on you guys.

78
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,720

Are we taking on
such a big project so soon?

81
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,140
Although senior employees
will also prepare it with you,

82
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,660
if you contribute too little in the process,

83
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,870
after three months of internship,

84
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,180
the work card you received today

85
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,540

I'm counting on you.

87
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,660
Give them an internship explanation.

88
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,290
In the next three months,

89
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,610
you will have to work hard.

90
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,890

will pass on their experience

91
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,360

They always order the same things,

158
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,380
so I have memorized them.

159
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800

the credit card.

Oh, that's right.

Oh, no.

Lee Jun.

170
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,090
You must take the invoice
when you are using the corporate card.

171
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,020
- Yeah?
- We need it.

172

Thanks.

173
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,020
You are such a rookie.

174
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,700
I'll have to help you in everything.

Oh, Hyun-jae.

176
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,960
I was kidding.

177
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,210
No, I wasn't.

178
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,880
I was good at social life in the band.

179
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,420
That is true.

180
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,290
Really?

181
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,680
Let's go get our coffee.

182
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,690
I'm still not doing very well, right?

183
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,930
I'm afraid you'll have to
take care of me a little longer.

184
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,780
Thank you in advance.

185
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,090
Then how will you thank me?

186
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,540
Don't tell me

187
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,340
you are just saying it.

188
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,540
Mr. Group Leader,
what do you want to drink?

189
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,500
After you get your first salary,

190
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,760
you must treat me to something nice.

191
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,800
Of course.

192
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,650
Well, before that,
decide what you want to eat.

193
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,670
OK, I must have something expensive.

194
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,310
Your drinks are ready.

195
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,190
I'll take it.

196
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,630
Enjoy your relationship.

197
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,440
Enjoy your coffee.

198
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,750
What's the matter?

199
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,540
Nothing, I just find it interesting.

200
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,440
What?

201
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,820
Tell me what's so interesting.

202
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,130
I just think buying coffee with you
is interesting.

203
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,530
Huh.

204
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,290
Thanks.

205
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,630
Goodbye.

206
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,640
Goodbye.

207
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,430
Wow! The coffee must be nice.

208
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,950
(Welcome Party for New Colleagues)

209
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,550
I want cheesecake so much!

210
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,860
Come here. Thank you.

211
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,880
Thank you for the coffee.

212
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,010
Who ordered iced Americano?

213
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:50,990
I did.

214
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,880
This is what you ordered, right?

215
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,170
It must be delicious.

216
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,040
This is yours.

217
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,100
Thanks.

218
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,890
Oh, you got yours already.

219
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,360
Let's eat!

220
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,100
Thanks.

221
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,690
You know what you should do
during the next three months

222
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,530
of internship, right?

223
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,150
I'll take it as a yes.

224
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,850
You know?

225
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,360
Social life?

226
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,270
Yes.

227
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,140
Yes.

228
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,240
We will tell you some dos and don'ts.

229
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,700
Don't worry too much.

230
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,080
Are you curious about anything?

231
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,120
Well...

232
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,700
What the General Manager
said at the meeting,

233
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,220
is that true?

234
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,210
Ah, you're talking about
the new product project, right?

235
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,170
It's true.

236
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,310
No, I didn't mean that.

237
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,590
Will we really be fired
if we can't contribute much?

238
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,710
The most important things in marketing
are authenticity and trust, right?

239
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,670
You mean...

240
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,280
Walking the talk is how I lead my team.

241
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,170
That is to say,

242
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,240
if we can contribute a lot,

243
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,190
we will be hired as full-time employees?

244
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,700
Of course.

245
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,940
I will work hard!

246
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,260
I will also work hard!

247
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,540
Me too.

248
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,230
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

249
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,810
Everyone is motivated, that's good.

250
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:54,180
Formal business training
starts in the afternoon.

251
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,690
You can start working before then.

252
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,920
OK.

253
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,290
By the way, General Manager,

254
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,760
if the business training starts today,

255
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,970
when will the project training start?

256
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,440
Oh, well.

257
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,540
Today.

258
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,560
What? Today?

259
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,660
We can drink water while eating,
can't we?

260
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,090
It's simple.

261
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,570
(He used to be very gentle,)

262
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,380
(didn't he?)

263
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,130
Oh, time to get off work.

264
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,950
Thank you for your hard work.

265
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,020
Let's have a dinner party, alright?

266
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,830
Oh, no problem!

267
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,120
There are no objections, right?

268
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,520
Of course not.

269
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,450
Yeah, OK.

270
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,050
Great. Ha-ha.

271
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,000
(He just said he would
have dinner with me tonight.)

272
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,790
Lee Jun, you are coming, right?

273
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,960
Yes, of course.

274
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,970
Then we will meet
at the restaurant at half past six.

275
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,180
OK.

276
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,400
OK.

277
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,250
- All right.
- No problem.

278
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,170
Ah, but I have a lot to do.

279
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,700
I really don't want to go.

280
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,360
I know. I don't wanna be there.

281
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:11,820
Although I didn't expect much,

282
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,000
it's still a bit improper

283
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,740
to change the appointment suddenly.

284
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,410
I'm also very busy.

285
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,720
But we haven't seen each other
for quite a while.

286
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,140
Have I changed a lot?

287
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,930
Or maybe I didn't change at all.

288
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,260
Oh, maybe he saw me on TV.

289
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,560
I really wonder how he recognized me.

290
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,250
How could I not?

291
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,050
Oh, are you OK?

292
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,300
Yeah, I'm fine.

293
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,680
Take off your shirt.

294
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,560
What?

295
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,790
I said take off your shirt.

296
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,120
Hey, what are you doing?

297
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,630
Aren't I the one
who is supposed to take off my shirt?

298
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,530
You've got coffee on you, isn't it hot?

299
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,580
This is iced coffee.

300
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,690
Ah, that's good.
Anyway, just take it off.

301
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,150
Why are you letting me
take off my shirt?

302
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,820
Wait, why are you taking off yours?

303
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,850
We'll be in the restaurant in 15 minutes.

304
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,930
Oh, really?

305
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,860
What about you?

306
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,080
I have an extra one.

307
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,650
Oh, that's good.

308
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,420
Thank you.

309
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,160
I don't know if it's the right size.

310
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:48,420
Did anyone call you Mom before?

311
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,200
I'm not the weak Lee Jun I was before.

312
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,890
Did anyone

313
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,590
tell you that you are cute?

314
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,090
You must have heard it a lot.

315
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,310
Yes, but only the fans.

316
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,160
Let's make it quick.

317
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,650
We'll do it here?

318
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,890
Heh-heh, you're just a taller version
of the old you.

319
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,050
How could I not recognize you?

320
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,770
What are you talking about?

321
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,410
It's been so long, unexpectedly,

322
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,000
you still need someone
to take care of you.

323
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,480
What?

324
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,740
Oh, wait,

325
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,490
come to think of it,

326
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,680
I kind of expected that.

327
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,850
Sorry for the trouble
I keep bringing you.

328
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,780
No, it's OK.

329
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,290
But...

330
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,720
Well, I like this.

331
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,840
What?

332
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,770
Taking care of you.

333
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,150
It's a special hobby.

334
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,340
Isn't this good?

335
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,260
You need somebody to take care of you,
and I can do that.

336
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,720
And you'll have my smell on you.

337
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,130
It's like you're really mine.

338
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,360
Oh, it's such a coincidence.

339
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,000
I want to return all the things
I got from you.

340
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,120
What if you fail to do that?

341
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,810
I won't.

342
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,660
I'll try my best to fulfill your expectation.

343
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,870
My expectation is high.

344
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,400
Really? That's good.

345
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,680
What style do you like?

346
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,780
I...

347
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,080
American style maybe.

348
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,430
OK, American it is.

349
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,760
Gotta take off a few more pieces
to be American style.

350
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,520
What do you mean?

351
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,900
Are you crazy?

352
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,800
Ha-ha-ha.

353
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,130
Oh...

354
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,600
The only thing that didn't change
is your appearance.

355
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,250
Your original personality
was not like this.

356
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,920
You are the opposite.

357
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,670
I think you look
a bit more aggressive now,

358
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,890
but you are still soft inside.

359
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,640
Hey!

360
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,710
How can you say that I'm soft?
I'm just tender.

361
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,740
Well, I don't know the difference.

362
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,030
Ah, you came back from another country.

363
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,970
These words are too complicated

364
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,390
to explain.

365
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,550
You can try.

366
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,490
I... Why should I?

367
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,220
Didn't you say

368
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,000
you would return
all that you got from me?

369
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,480
Well, you said in American style.

370
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,300
Is this the American style?

371
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,200
Isn't it?

372
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,410
This is tender.

373
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,980
This is soft.

374
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,800
That's a bit too American.

375
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,080
Tender means gentle,

376
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:13,540

389

You have changed a lot.

390
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,990
You are taller and more handsome.

391
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,490
The General Manager is majestic,

392
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,680
while Lee Jun is...

393
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,520
Soft?

394
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,310
An eye for an eye

395
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,290
and a tooth for a tooth.

396
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,570
You know my secret anyway.

397
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,820
Do you want me to tell you
another secret?

398
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,040
Is it because
you came back from America?

399
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,670
This way, we both feel uncomfortable.

400
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,050
Help me with it.

401
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,770
What?
