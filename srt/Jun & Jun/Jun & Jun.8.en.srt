He is not familiar with the job yet.

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,940
He used to always work on the stage,

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,560
it's his first time
to work behind the scenes.

00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,580
I have to bear with it

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,170
because it's his first time?

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,310
No, you have the right to be angry.

You are a perfectionist.

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,000
And you also hate losing to others.

00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,560
Of course.

308
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,500

313
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,060
No, don't.

314
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,940

315
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,300

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,210

321
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,340
Just call her Kim Yeong.

322
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,210
Come on. I'll leave, OK?

323

Thank you.

325
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,190
He said he'd use it like crazy
without even knowing what it is.

326
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,000

the angrier I get.

335
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,470
- Me?
- You owe me one.

336
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,650
How?

337
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,320
I don't care. I'm so angry.

338
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,450
If you hadn't aroused
my desire to win that day,

339
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,370
this kind of thing
wouldn't have happened.

340
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,580

341
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,640
I just complimented you
on your professionalism.

342
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,400

345
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,880

349
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,690
Maybe.

359
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,450
Why did you send me this address?

360
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,310
There's a restaurant
you used to frequent.

361
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,000
It's nearby. Anyway, we haven't
been there for a long time.

362

363
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,700

365
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,160
No.

366
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,160
You came here often.

367
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,230

369
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,700

370
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,720

00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,810
We are here anyway.

375
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,650
Don't bother.

376
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,560
Then let's go to that restaurant.

377
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,750
You just said you don't like soju.

378
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,120
But you like it.

379
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,650
Forget it, let's go.

380
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,550
I'm cold.

381
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,480
Then let's go to my place after.

382
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,670
Is there wine there?

383
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,740
Of course.

384
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,660
I've prepared your favorite red wine.

385
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,260
What?

386
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,840
You have the same taste as me now.

387
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,480
We've been together for five years.

388
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,200
Hey, did you make a fortune?

389
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,130
This is such a nice wine.

390
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,720
You only know a little

391
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,570
about my hobbies.

392
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,100
You care about Lee Jun
so much more than me.

393
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,390
Why did you start

394
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,440
talking to me like that?

395
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,450
And you stopped calling me brother.

396
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,900
That's why. That's why

397
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,610
I care so much about Jun.

398
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,620
Hey, are you an old fogey?

399
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,420
Ah, forget it.

400
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,140
It's different from before now.

401
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,820
Well, dinner is on you.

402
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,280
Ah, OK.

403
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,820
Wait a minute.

404
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,970
Didn't you invite me here?

405
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,120
I'm sorry.

406
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,580
Didn't you invite me here, brother?

407
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,300
You can't come to my house
empty-handed, right?

408
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,980
What does that have to do with this?

409
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,340
I'm here prepared.

410
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,690
So dinner is on you.

411
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,580
Are you a punk?

412
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,230
Maybe.

413
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,580
Ha...

414
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,030
People who got dumped

415
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,870
should drink a lot tonight.

416
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,110
Don't get drunk.

417
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,340
My drinking capacity
is as good as anyone's.

418
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,660
You mean nobody's?

419
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,260
Heh...

420
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,460
Hee-hee-hee...

421
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,330
Hee-hee-hee...

422
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,540
Hee-hee-hee...

423
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,460
What are you doing?

424
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,060
Nothing, I just find it funny.

425
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,020
Jun.

426
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,130
Ha-ha-ha...

427
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,640
Lee Jun.

428
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,100
Do you like candy?

429
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,420
Uh, well...

430
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,960
But I like it.

431
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,790
Yeah?

432
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,480
Oh, I like it too.

433
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,380
Heh-heh...

434
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,740
Is it sweet?

435
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,650
Well, yes.

436
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,140
I like eating candy the most.

437
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,670
Why?

438
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,760
Why?

439
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,040
Why?

440
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,790
Don't you remember?

441
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,620
What?

442
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,810
You gave it to me when we were little.

443
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,920
Ah, really?

444
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,730
Mmm, this candy tastes good.

445
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,940
Forget it.

446
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,400
You are not qualified to eat this candy.

447
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,830
I don't remember
because I was too young.

448
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,890
Forget it.

449
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,990
Hey! Hey.

450

- Morning.

478

Hm?

479
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,140
Are you using the same shampoo?

480
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,850
The smell is the same.

481
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,240
What? How is that possible?

482
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,310
Ah, Lee Jun recommended
the shampoo to me.

483
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,980
Maybe I used too much.

484
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,640
I'm losing some hair recently.

485
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,660
Oh, I see.

486
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,130
They look pretty close, Mr. Song.

Well, that's right.

488
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,720
Lee Jun is trying to
adapt to the company.

489
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,860
This is a good sign.

490
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,340
See you later.

491
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,990

00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,230
Four hot lattes.

00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,590

the new products we launched
are very popular.

529
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,750
Many people are waiting

530
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,130
for our next project.

531
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,090
Everyone should be ready

532
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,700
to continue working hard.

533
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,560
Yes.

534
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,330
Will it also be a blind test this time?

535
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,460
Of course.

536
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:42,710
However,

537
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,410
we are going to give

538
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,370
equal opportunities for all employees.

539
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,820

Isn't it interesting?

542
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,460
We are expanding,

543
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,900
and there are more and more new ideas.

544
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,380
Will the solicitation activities

545
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,640
for new products also be held by us?

546
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,600
Of course.

547
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,730

548
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,940
Of course.

plus the solicitation activities...

552
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,450

00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,080
I don't want to be so busy today.

564
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,500
Take me home directly.

565
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,290
Are you sure you are going home?

566
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,690
It's not good
to be alone on your birthday.

567
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,560
What are you doing?

568
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,690
Since you are alone...

569
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,620
Are you going to celebrate it with me?

570
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,120
Yeah.

571
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,890
Why? You want to be my agent again?

572
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,840
No.

573
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,010
Then why?

574
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,020
Let's go home.

575
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,260
My home?

576
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,110
Then let's go to my house after that.

577
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:12,570
Ha...

578
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,720

I almost forgot to open it.

585
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,080
What is it?

586
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,580
Hey, what are you doing?

587
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,460
Didn't you hear me calling you?

588
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,900
Hm?

589
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,780
What is that?

590
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,660
What?

591
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,300
What is that?

592
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,240
It's nothing.

593
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,080
I'm curious.

594
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,040
It's nothing. Nothing at all.

595
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,270
Tell me what it is.

596
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,110
Photos from the past?

597
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,000
No.

598
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,690
Photos of your ex?

599
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,900
I don't have that kind of thing.

600
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,300
You are my first love.

601
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,330
What exactly

602
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,520
is that?

603
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,540
This? This isn't mine.

604
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,070
Technically speaking, it is mine.

605
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,750
But you can also say that it's not mine.

606
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,590
Jun.

607
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:53,810
Huh?

608
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,580
Do you want to continue being like this?

609
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:01,980
No.

610
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,600
But didn't you say you would repay me?

611
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,500
When will you do that?

612
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,530

or anything you want to do?

617
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,100
Well, then...

618
