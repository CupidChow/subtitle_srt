1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And you're paying off your father's debt.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,520
Just follow the rules.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,920
But if you won't to stay here anymore,

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,320
Just tell your father

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,120
to pay the debts quickly.

6
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,440
That's it.

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,520
You always said

8
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,320
it's about debts.

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,760
I'm a poor man!

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,240
Just go back.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,720
Huh? No!

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,720
If you want me to go, just pay.

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,400
Pay what?

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,080
Can I go to Lek island tomorrow?

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,280
I just...want to see father.

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,200
I miss him.

17
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,200
Is this really not a boxing camp?

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,880
Yep

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,800
He always practice alone?

20
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,120
Why you ask a lot?

21
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,280
You have everything,

22
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,600
Except your competitor.

23
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,880
What do you want me to do?

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,320
Did you see my father?

25
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,720
He works everydays.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You can try to ask him

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,640
if he's ever been interested in me or not.

28
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,320
If you like,

29
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,560
Just go for it.

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,200
You're close too fast.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,520
Arthid

32
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,120
What are you doing here?

33
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,960
And you...

34
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,240
Why don't you go to help uncle at beach?

35
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,479
Don't need to chase me.

36
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,320
I'll go soon.

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,320
It's almost dark.

38
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,520
You've to go early.

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,160
From here, I take 15 minutes.

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,840
It's not for walk to take half hours.

41
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,120
Just a moment. I'll go back.

42
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,480
Fine, I go now.

43
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,920
Your feet.

44
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,000
Hey!

45
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,320
D*mn!

46
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,360
How about me?

47
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,520
Sh*t.

48
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,000
Go back.

49
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,080
Are you insane?

50
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,720
Your friend just leave me.

51
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,520
How can I go back?

52
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,600
I mean

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,320
Go back to Bangkok.

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,160
Don't need to chase me, I'll go.

55
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,560
Or if you want me to go back,

56
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,920
Just pay my dad's ten million baht to me.

57
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,160
Why you smile?

58
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,520
Do you trust your dad?

59
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,680
Yes, I do.

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,280
Why he lie to me?

61
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,120
So, can you tell me

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,320
who is a creditor,

63
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,000
who is a debtor?

64
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,560
Let me repeat that,

65
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm a creditor.

66
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,560
And you're debtor.

67
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,040
So...

68
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,560
See?

69
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,000
Act cool?

70
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,200
Thanks

71
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
I don't want anyone die here.

72
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,280
Can you go back now?

73
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,040
You come late today.

74
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,120
I just snuck off from my son to come.

75
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,960
Okay

76
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,640
Here is the first amout of money.

77
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,720
Oh my god!

78
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,640
I'm so happy

79
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,200
to talk with someone rich.

80
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,400
So wonderful.

81
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,480
But don't tell anyone.

82
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,640
especially my son.

83
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,840
Of course!

84
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,000
Keep secret of us.

85
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,960
Don't worry.

86
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,320
I'm bored to hearing him gumble.

87
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,640
And the left money,

88
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,679
I'll bring it again.

89
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,720
It's in the bank

90
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,679
I kept at the son in the province.

91
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,480
Everything can fix.

92
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,440
No problem.

93
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,240
It's wonderful.

94
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,480
What's that man?

95
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,240
Such a cruel people.

96
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,800
Come on, why the battery gone now?

97
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,960
What should I do?

98
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,560
It's so beautiful at day.

99
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,240
But so scary at night.

100
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,280
From here, I take 15 minutes.

101
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,760
It's not for walk to take half hours.

102
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,280
Or

103
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,520
He chase me,

104
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,840
because he'll bury his treasure?

105
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,160
I'd go back and see.

106
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,200
But I walked fifteen minutes.

107
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,680
If I go back, it takes another fifteen minutes.

108
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,680
Compared to the time walking back to the hotel,

109
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,720
It's same.

110
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,040
What should I do?

111
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,640
Sh*t!

112
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,360
Hey! You!

113
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,440
If you still here,

114
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,320
Can you call someone to pick me up?

115
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,920
Or bring me with you now.

116
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,280
It's an order.

117
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,560
If you want to go back,

118
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,560
Just go alone.

119
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,800
I should go back to hotel is better.

120
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,760
What am I doing here?

121
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,760
I can't get the money.

122
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,280
Who's that?!

123
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,760
You!

124
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,000
What the heck?!

125
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,120
You trick me!

126
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,840
D*mn!

127
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,520
What??

128
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,280
Do you want to go back?

129
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,520
Of course!

130
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,200
It's nonsense question.

131
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,680
So, stand up.

132
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,480
Hurry up!

133
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,600
Hold on.

134
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
Why don't you drive here?

135
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,680
Silence.

136
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,640
Keep walking.

137
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,160
You should shine the light well.

138
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,960
Sh*t!

139
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,720
Be careful.

140
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,400
Thanks

141
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,520
What did you say?

142
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,240
Thanks

143
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,600
"Thank you"

144
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,040
"Thanks" for closed person.

145
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
If not?

146
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
"Thank you"

147
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,960
You should go back to Bangkok tomorrow.

148
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,440
What did you say?

149
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,680
I can't hear you.

150
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,800
You got nothing while you stay here.

151
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,640
Go back.

152
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,640
No!

153
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,520
I won't go!

154
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,520
You always chase me.

155
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,880
Annoying!

156
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,920
I won't go back!!

157
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,720
What the heck?

158
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,800
Boss! Who ordered you to work hard like this?

159
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,520
Talay! Is it your duty?

160
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
You're so bad!

161
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,480
What?!

162
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,480
You guys...

163
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,400
Do you still argue with me?

164
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,920
Go away, we'll be working.

165
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,800
Annoying!

166
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,360
Enough.

167
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,120
And stop talking.

168
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,240
Did you see we have guests?

169
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,200
Just go back to work.

170
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,880
Okay, boss!

171
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,400
Okay, boss!

172
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,599
That one,too.

173
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,880
Sataw, let's go.

174
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,319
Welcome

175
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,920
This way.

176
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,400
Good morning,

177
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,200
Brother-in-law

178
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,040
And good morning,

179
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,200
Servant

180
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,040
What?

181
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,200
Who is he?

182
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,880
Do you remember me?

183
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,040
Of course, JJ.

184
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,280
But what are you doing here?

185
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,560
I came here to find my boyfriend.

186
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,120
Nemo's boyfriend??

187
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,320
He's funny face.

188
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,560
I've no idea what are you talking about, servant.

189
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,640
Enough.

190
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,200
Nemo isn't here.

191
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,840
You should go back.

192
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,200
Not here?

193
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,800
But he just send messeges to me.

194
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,280
This

195
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,400
Brother-in-law

196
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,640
Can I go to see my boyfriend now?

197
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,880
I came to take him home.

198
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,960
You know that he loves me so much.

199
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,840
We just upset each others.

200
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,880
Talay, I'll let you deal with him.

201
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,520
Me??

202
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,360
What the heck?

203
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,880
Follow me.

204
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,240
Come!

205
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,440
Father

206
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,240
We don't like to do like this.

207
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,680
But...you still don't pay debt.

208
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,160
At least...

209
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,920
Can you pay the interest to us first?

210
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,680
Mek, who is he?

211
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,840
I've never seen him before.

212
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,080
My name is Tai.

213
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,520
You should hurry give money back.

214
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,480
You waste our time.

215
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,520
You!!

216
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,080
Tai!

217
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,200
I'm so sorry, father.

218
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,360
It's first job of him.

219
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,160
I told you,

220
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,920
I let Sun to find it.

221
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,520
Don't you have any money?

222
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,440
Boss told us you are an investor.

223
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,320
Who said?

224
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,800
Your boss?

225
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,000
Nah

226
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,480
It's not true.

227
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,480
Father, let's do like this.

228
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,880
Can you speed it up for us?

229
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,960
If not, boss will kill us.

230
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,200
I told you several times, I don't have it.

231
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,680
If I have money like before, I can give you.

232
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,200
But I don't have it now.

233
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,760
Otherwise, why let Sun go to find money?

234
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,640
And then I'll do it right away.

235
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,760
Please, Mek....Please

236
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,880
No!

237
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,160
Tai!

238
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,600
I got it, father.

239
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,040
We'll be back again.

240
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,160
We can't got it, what should we do?

241
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,800
Just go first.

242
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,520
We've lost all our plans.

243
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
You...

244
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,760
If I'm young...

245
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,240
Tai!

246
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,560
You need to calm down.

247
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,000
If we can't get it, what's next?

248
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,720
You made me lose all my plans.

249
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,680
Do you still want that money?

250
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,360
Mek! Release me!

251
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,160
No!

252
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,720
You promise me first you won't get inside again.

253
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,760
No

254
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,840
I will.

255
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,960
Work is work.

256
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,080
I don't care who's father he is.

257
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,280
Can you care about Sun little bit?

258
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,960
Don't act like you're not professional.

259
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,640
Tai, I beg you.

260
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:17,960
Fine!

261
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,720
I won't get inside.

262
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,960
Thanks a lot.

263
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,960
Only Sun's father that I can't get money back from him.

264
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,120
One side is friend's father.

265
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,600
One side is boss.

266
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,800
I feel so sorry.

267
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,720
Because you are friend with Sun.

268
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,920
After today,

269
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,640
I'll handle it.

270
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,080
Alright

271
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,880
I won't use force.

272
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,040
Okay?

273
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,280
Go

274
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,440
Really?

275
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,960
Did you send your staffs to get money from me?

276
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,080
Because you're my debtor.

277
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,480
But we are friends.

278
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,960
Can't you help me out?

279
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,520
You should stop.

280
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,520
Stop tricking other people into your vain investment.

281
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,480
Just stop it.

282
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,760
Okay

283
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,280
But can't you be flexible with me?

284
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,160
It's my job.

285
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,520
Whoever comes to hire me, I have to do it.

286
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,960
Right?

287
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,720
I know that.

288
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,800
Did you have any news from my son?

289
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,200
Did he success or not?

290
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,640
I didn't talk to him yet.

291
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,440
I don't know he got bad news or good news.

292
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
So headache.

293
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,320
Did you see his face?

294
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,200
If he can get that money, he will be back.

295
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,960
I'll tell you honestly,

296
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,360
I've really help you.

297
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,720
I know.

298
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,320
You should pay interest to my staffs.

299
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,480
Otherwise, they will pulling my tit.

300
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,720
Do you understand?

301
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,400
Yes, I do.

302
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,800
Tai

303
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,360
Don't forget to get money back.

304
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,480
I can go there.

305
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,680
You promise me.

306
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,040
And....

307
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,320
Excuse me.

308
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,360
Is this company can track the debt?

309
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,120
Yes

310
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,040
Boss is inside that room.

311
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,680
But seem like he has a guest.

312
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,000
So, is this company can track dept ten million baht?

313
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,240
Ten million!!

314
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,440
The call comes.

315
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,160
Well~ So busy.

316
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,600
Hello?

317
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,560
How can he come here?

318
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,760
Sir, I'm a lawyer of Arthid and mr. Tiwa.

319
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,440
This is a contract.

320
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,960
You have to sign to accept the debt condition.

321
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,360
I'll continue to do my work.

322
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,960
It won't be a big deal.

323
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,280
Eh? Sign?

324
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,320
Even though I signed,

325
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,560
But...

326
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,640
I don't have any money to spend.

327
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,760
You can pay in installments.

328
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,720
And then don't need to go to court

329
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,080
Ouch!! Headache!!

330
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,120

331
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,680

332
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,760
I have to go now,

333
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,840
Good bye.

334
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,960
Good bye.

335
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,360
So much hurt.

336
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,280
I gonna die.

337
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,560
What?

338
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,080
Aha? Did you get it?

339
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,800
Today!

340
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,120
I've to talk to him to make it clear.

341
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,280
And get the money back home.

342
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,040
That's  the Scammer!

343
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,320
Hey! Scammer!

344
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,880
Have you seen your friend?

345
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,200
Do you ask me?

346
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,720
Am I ask a shell?

347
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,800
Am I ask a shell?

348
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,840
A shell~ How are you? You're so bigger than before.

349
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,520
No! It can't speak.

350
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,200
Not funny.

351
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,960
Where is Arthid?

352
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
I've to talk with him.

353
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,480
Ummm....Where is he?

354
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,440
Do you have something to talk with me?

355
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,360
Here!

356
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,680
What's up?

357
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,040
Anything all right?

358
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,360
Yes, all right.

359
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,320
But your brother's boyfriend is talk too much. So annoying.

360
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,880
I just think of Nemo.

361
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,440
Otherwise, I'll kick his boyfriend into the sea.

362
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,080
Just forget it.

363
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,200
But thanks.

364
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,240
I'll handle here.

365
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,000
Okay, I'll go for work there.

366
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,440
That's good to see you here.

367
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,000
Mr. Debtor

368
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,240
When will you pay the debt to me?

369
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,160
I'm tired to ask you.

370
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,080
Where!

371
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,520
What are you doing?

372
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,360
Where is the money?

373
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:07,880
I don't have it!

374
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,320
Where?

375
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,440
I don't have it!

376
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:09,840
Where?

377
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,120
No!

378
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,520
Give it to me.

379
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,400
A debt must be paid back!

380
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,440
I don't have it. Don't pick my pocket!

381
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,000
What did you pick up?

382
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,960
Oh my god!

383
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,560
I don't see anything.

384
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,360
That's fine. Go on.

385
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,960
I just walked past.

386
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,960
It's not like that.

387
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,640
What's wrong with you?

388
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,640
Come and sit here.

389
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,000
And talk about it.

390
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,320
You'd pay back my father's debt.

391
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,440
I can't stand it anymore!

392
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,800
If you can't, just go back.

393
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,000
Before I lose my patience.

394
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,640
That's me to say that words.

395
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,760
I have right to stay here.

396
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,360
Really?

397
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,640
As what?

398
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,960
As your creditor.

399
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,760
Really?

400
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,400
It's serious.

401
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,440
Listen to me,

402
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,840
Even though, I'm not your creditor.

403
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,000
I also have a right to stay here.

404
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,720
As a customer of this hotel.

405
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,080
Okay

406
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,160
You're good at arguing.

407
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,600
So, let me ask you last time as a creditor,

408
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,760
How long will you stay here?

409
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,600
Until..

410
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,880
You paid all debts.

411
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,280
Stupid question.

412
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,920
How about as a customer?

413
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,680
As long as I can stay.

414
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,840
Why?

415
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,160
Will you chase your customer?

416
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,480
No

417
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,360
I won't chase my customer.

418
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,120
But just pay the deposit for the room

419
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
to me please.

420
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,160
During this time, the sea is beautiful.

421
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,720
It's high season.

422
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,000
Sure!

423
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,320
How much of it?

424
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,480
Tell me.

425
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,960
So, deposit of...

426
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,720
One month?

427
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,400
Sh*t!!

428
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,800
One hundred and fifty thousand!!

429
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,800
That's correct.

430
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,360
If you haven't enough monet to pay,

431
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,080
Please leave.

432
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,640
Please

433
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,840
I can stay somewhere else.

434
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,200
There are many beautiful hotels here.

435
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,600
I don't care!

436
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,760
Why it be full everywhere?

437
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,560
Is that Scammer?

438
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,000
Scammer!

439
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,760
My name is Talay.

440
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,720
Talay

441
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,960
Not Scammer.

442
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,520
Whatever

443
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,280
Talay,

444
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,880
please told boss that I was sick and asked for a day off.

445
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,960
I got it.

446
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,320
Wait

447
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,640
Boss?

448
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,360
Is your friend owner here?

449
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,480
Yes

450
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,160
I see.

451
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,200
It's all an act.

452
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,480
It's not only this hotel.

453
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,920
He's owner of every place.

454
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,800
Every place?!

455
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,440
Yep

456
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,960
All hotels and resorts on this island

457
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,040
It's all a chain of Arthid's family.

458
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,680
What the heck.

459
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,040
He is a richman.

460
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,600
Why he doesn't pay the debts?

461
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,040
It's all done, right?

462
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,000
I've to go now.

463
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,360
Hey! Wait!

464
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,040
What's more?

465
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,360
Do you

466
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,920
know any places that he doesn't own?

467
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,600
Help me please.

468
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,920
Just think helping me and repay that I buy meal for you.

469
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,480
Of course!

470
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,560
Well. Get on my motorcycle.

471
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,960
Hurry up!

472
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,719
Wait a minute.

473
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:28,760
Go

474
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,840
Take it easy.

475
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,040
Faster!

476
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,719
Harder!

477
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,639
More

478
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,760
More!

479
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,440
I said more.

480
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,280
More

481
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,400
When you punch, don't lift your leg.

482
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:46,960
More

483
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,400
Don't lift your leg.

484
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,600
I can't do it.

485
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,160
Huh?

486
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,480
You already tired?

487
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,320
You're weak.

488
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,960
I'm not a boxer like you.

489
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,760
Like me? Am I a boxer?

490
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,120
I've never been.....ever fight once.

491
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,080
I'll be your boxing partner.

492
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,120
I will win you.

493
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:44,720
Come!

494
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,480
I'll show you.

495
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,360
You should boxing well first.

496
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,560
I have a deal.

497
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,600
If I can win you,

498
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,240
You have to do my orders.

499
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,600
Deal?

500
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,440
Before you win me,

501
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,080
you should boxing well.

502
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,360
Before you win me,

503
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,400
Give me some water.

504
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,920
Give me.

505
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,280
You spilled it.

506
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,040
Hurry up!

507
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,640
Good.

508
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,080
Dad

509
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,920
Are we debtor?

510
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,720
If you want that money,

511
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,320
You must stay here.

512
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,360
All of these are your plan, right?

513
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,800
That you made him know the truth.

514
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,720
The boat of little boss on the sea without little boss!

515
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,200
What?!

516
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,520
Of course.

517
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,920
You are friends.

518
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,040
You will be his side.

519
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,080
If it doesn't like what you think...

520
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,000
Nemo!!

521
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,920
What the hell are you doing?

522
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,760
Where is Tai?

523
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,800
I didn't saw him.

524
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,280
I thought he go to meet Moo.
