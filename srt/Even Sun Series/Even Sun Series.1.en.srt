1
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,840
Older sister

00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,480
Younger sister

3
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,840

4
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,120
Bro!

5
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,560
What should I call?

6
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,520
What do you want?

7
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,840
I come to get money back that you borrowed.

8
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,000
Hey! Bro!

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,440

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,560
I come to get money back.

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,280
Give me please.

12
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,680
No! Go away!

13
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,400
Can she do that?

14
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,520
Pay money back to me, please.

15
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,960
I don't want to hurt women.

16
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,640
Wait wait!

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,160
Calm down bro.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,160
I...

19
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,759
I'm joking.

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,520
I can't hurt anyone.

21
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,960
That's all.

22
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,000
So....When you can give money to me?

23
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Do you have....

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,920
Not have, Not run, Not pay!

25
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,960
Do you understand?

26
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,000
Damn it!

27
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
Why it so hard to get money back?

28
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,240
It's so hard everywhere.

29
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,360
What should I do?

30
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,000
Hi! My friend, Sun.

31
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,840
Mek!

32
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,960
You frightened me.

33
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,320
Please don't come quietly.

34
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,680
You're a little jumpy.

35
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,600
What's wrong?

36
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,160
You make your face like a monkey's ass.

37
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,760
Let's smile.

38
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,440
Mek!

39
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,920
Don't be serious

40
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,760
I think you're not success again.

41
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
Right?

42
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,080
So, what's your problem?

43
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,600
Can you tell your buddy?

44
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,840
I went to get money everywhere,

45
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,360
but I didn't get from anyone.

46
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,680
Especialy, this man!

47
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,960
He never give to me.

48
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,680
Oh my friend.

49
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,960
I'll do it for you.

50
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,960
Please hold this.

51
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,640
I'll get money from that guy for you.

52
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,200
No way!

53
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,640
I ask him all these months

54
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,600
He never give to me.

55
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,520
Hey~ Who am I?

56
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,840
I'm a teacher Mek.

57
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,800
Prepare to respect me.

58
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,560
Hello uncle~

59
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,760
Okay. Fully payment.

60
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,240
Principal and interest

61
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,600
I already count it.

62
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,200
How can you do that?

63
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,000
I never get it.

64
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,000
He never give to me.

65
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,560
That's fine.

66
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,280
Let's go.

67
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,560
Practice so hard, my friend.

68
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,600
Mek! Sun!

69
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,920
Exercise so hard~

70
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,720
I just practice

71
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,080
Did your dad found your couple to you?

72
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,920
Sun!

73
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,960
Watch your mouth.

74
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,960
Why you poke me, Mek?

75
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,280
Why you look at me like that, Ashing?

76
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,960
I mean your competitor.

77
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,080
You known that his dad didn't made this boxing camp for competition.

78
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,880
My friends~

79
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,840
Do you come to see my dad?

80
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,080
He's inside there.

81
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,200
Just go.

82
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,800
Yes, sir!

83
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,080
Okay

84
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,400
Who's there?

85
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,440
Sun and Mek

86
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,560
This is Tai.

87
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,720
He tooks internship.

88
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,920
Let's be friend.

89
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,800
Okay boss.

90
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,920
He doesn't look like trainee.

91
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,040
He looks like work more than 10 years.

92
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,800
Where is my money?

93
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,720
Here it is.

94
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,440
It's fully payment.

95
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,880
Who get this money?

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,920

97
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes

98
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,200
I am.

99
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,320
I let you answer again.

100
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,840
It's me.

101
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,600
Sun!

102
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,080
When you can work by yourself?

103
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,280
If you don't have Mek, what should you do?

104
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,400
I'm so sorry, boss.

105
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,280
I promise it won't be like this again.

106
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,360
How many times you said that?

107
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,320
I'm so much kind for you, right?

108
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,560
It's not like that boss.

109
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,680
When I go to get money,

110
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,040
Moo Brother will use axe to kill me!

111
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,400
I don't care.

112
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,840
I give you one month.

113
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,200
One month!

114
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,800
If you can't do it,

115
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,360
I will let you...

116
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,520
Do nothing.

117
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,040
And let Tai replace you to work.

118
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,800
He will work with Mek.

119
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,360
How about me?

120
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,480
What do you want me to do?

121
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,960
Anything

122
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,040
If you can't do it, you fire!

123
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,320
Boss! You can't do that!

124
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
Why can't I?

125
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,080
I'm your boss!

126
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,720
It's not why.

127
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,280
But it can't be like that.

128
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,120
Just like that! I give you one month.

129
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,440
Go! Not go?

130
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,400
No! Boss!

131
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,720
Sun, we should go now.

132
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,000
Boss is very angry.

133
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,240
Excuse me, boss.

134
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,960
Good bye boss.

135
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,720
Mek!

136
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,560
Just go!

137
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,320
Mek!

138
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,160
Just go!

139
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,680
Why? Will you jump to river?

140
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,560
Go ahead.

141
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,720
That's fine.

142
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,920
Please jump.

143
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,240
Go ahead buddy!

144
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,520
Don't you think I really jump?

145
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,040
Do you dare?

146
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,480
It's a pitty for my handsome face.

147
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,600
D*mn!

148
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,360
Boring!!

149
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,160
What's that noise?

150
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,760
What are you doing here?

151
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,200
I just come to take a photo.

152
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,480
And say hi to my new friend.

153
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,240
Because we will work together soon.

154
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,760
Right?

155
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,400
And you,

156
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,600
Tell me when you ready to work with me.

157
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,360
I'm always.

158
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,920
What the heck on you?!

159
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,040
That's nothing buddy.

160
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,480
When I saw him,

161
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,720
I'm so dissatisfied.

162
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,400
You think too much.

163
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,280
Shall we go home?

164
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,120
Or jump to the river?

165
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,400
I'm kidding.

166
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,600
Hey!

167
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,080
Don't you really ask me anything?

168
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,920
Ask what?

169
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,800
Are you my son?

170
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,400
Okay

171
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,840
What's happen daddy?

172
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,760
I'm so disappoint in you.

173
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,680
Dad

174
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,560
Will you be sued?

175
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,440
That's right.

176
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,760
You've to help me now.

177
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,120
How?!

178
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,880
It's a lot of money!

179
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,240
Ten million baht!

180
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,840
You must get money from my deptor to me.

181
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,800
Dad! It's not about me!

182
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,200
Dept pays by himself.

183
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,040
Wait!

184
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,320
You...

185
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,000
Dad

186
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,320
If not,

187
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,520
I'll call the police.

188
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,800
It's not funny.

189
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,760
Funny?

190
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,680
How can you arrest me?

191
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,160
I haven't done anything wrong.

192
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,000
Wrong!

193
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,640
You're wrong.

194
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,600
How?!

195
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,680
This!

196
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,280
You play slot casino online.

197
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,000
Do you want to see me filed for bankruptcy?

198
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,520
That's fine.

199
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,120
If you don't help me, I'm fine.

200
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,480
Sometimes, we should have father when we are ready.

201
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,120
And this is the place you have to go.

202
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,960
Boss!

203
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,640
Why always me?

204
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,760
I don't want to go to work far away!

205
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,800
Please let me go is better than him.

206
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,200
Piss off!

207
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,079
Tai

208
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,000
I really want you to hand this job.

209
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,400
But it's very important job,

210
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,800
and I need someone I can trust.

211
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,800
Boss, did you mean

212
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,680
Am I not trustworthy?

213
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,680
Not really?

214
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,680
And you just started to work here.

215
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,880
Another one,

216
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,560
This job is ....

217
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,000
His father's money.

218
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,400
It's right to let his son do it.

219
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,400
But...I'm...

220
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,800
Can I go instead of him?

221
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,320
Stop it!

222
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,960
Sun

223
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,800
I give you a last chance.

224
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,440
If you don't do it, you really fired!!

225
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,720
If you don't do it, you really fired!!

226
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,280
Boss!

227
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,080
That's all.

228
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,880
I give you one month.

229
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,200
If you can't do it.

230
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,160
Don't need to comeback!!

231
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,840
Remember that!

232
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,720
Hey!

233
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,680
Who are you?

234
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,200
Hey!!

235
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,720
What the f*ck you doing?

236
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,520
I ask who are you?

237
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,640
And who are you?

238
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,880
Don't piss me off.

239
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,240
If you don't want to tell me,

240
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,880
Just get out of my place!

241
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,560
Is this your place?

242
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,400
Yes

243
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,680
This is my house.

244
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,480
I won't go.

245
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,680
You won't go?

246
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,800
Do you want to have a problem?

247
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,760
Yep

248
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,080
I do it for you!

249
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,240
Hey!

250
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,880
What are you doing?

251
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,000
Is he your friend?

252
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,040
No, he is deptor.

253
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,120
Ah~ Just deptor.

254
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,760
If you want to meet my dad,

255
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,720
he is over there.

256
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,880
Listen to me first.

257
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,960
His father is your dad's deptor.

258
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,760
But he doesn't have money.

259
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,680
So, he send him for clear the interest.

260
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,960
Is that true?

261
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,840
What's it going to be useful for?

262
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,240
Hey! What's happen?

263
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,520
You're here.

264
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,280
Yes.

265
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,760
I'm so boring about deptors.

266
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,680
Really boring.

267
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,080
It's good that you come.

268
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Ashing, if you want anything, you can use him to do it.

269
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,560
Just think he is your servant.

270
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,840
Dad!

271
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,440
I don't want him.

272
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,200
Come on~

273
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,600
What's your nam? Huh?

274
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,080
Your name?

275
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,360
Umm..

276
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:27,960
Huh?

277
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,880
Fine!

278
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,440
You don't have to answer,

279
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,560
But you have to stay here.

280
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,120
And take care of my son.

281
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,600
Do you understand?

282
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,920
When you stay here,

283
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,120
just do everything that boss want.

284
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,720
Okay?

285
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,360
Ashing!

286
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,640
Congrats to you.

287
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,440
You got your mate now!

288
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,960
Hey!

289
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,960
He will punch your face if you said like that.

290
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,200
I'm kidding.

291
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,880
Let's talk about yours.

292
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,840
And I'm hungry now.

293
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,240
Shall we find some food?

294
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,280
Ashing

295
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,960
Do you join with us?

296
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,880
Yes, I'll change clothes first.

297
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,640
Hey! Let's go together!

298
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,800
What's that noise?

299
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,320
Let's go.

300
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,480
Go go!

301
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,800
Sun...

302
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,800
Can I go with you?

303
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,240
Can you go?

304
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,160
Can you ask your dad for me?

305
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,480
Nah...

306
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,840
I don't want to bother.

307
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,080
You know that?

308
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,880
I'm fine, Mek.

309
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,920
I can do it.

310
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,960
Are you crazy?

311
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,880
It's ten million!

312
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,320
I'm not crazy.

313
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,640
You can't do that.

314
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,920
Agree.

315
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,240
Why you laughing?

316
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,640
Just only ten baht, you can't get it back.

317
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,200
Don't you remember when we were young?

318
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,360
If Ashing and I didn't help you,

319
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,240
If Ashing and I didn't help you,

320
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,800
You can't get that ten baht.

321
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,200
Give money back to me now!

322
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:42,920
Ouch!

323
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,040
I don't have! I won't give you.

324
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,240
If not, I will tell your mother!

325
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,720
Okay, fine!

326
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,400
That's when I was a kid, don't take it all together.

327
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,280
Whenever you can't do it.

328
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,360
If you don't have Mek,

329
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,720
You got kicked out a long time ago.

330
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,120
Ashing!

331
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,800
Are you my friend?

332
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,280
Don't you think to cheer me up?

333
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,040
Okay~ When you arrive there

334
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,800
If you want our help,

335
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,200
Just call me, okay?

336
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,920
Thanks buddy.

337
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,200
Eh? How about me?

338
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,280
You're just friend.

339
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,240
You said that? Fine~

340
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,920
I'll tell dad to kick you out.

341
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,800
Come on, save yourself first.

342
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,920
You first.

343
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,400
Just watch yourself.

344
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,520
Be aware about Tai.

345
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,080
I think he'll work better than you.

346
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,520
Someday, you'll out on

347
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,720
Mek and Sun

348
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,440
to be Tai and Mek.

349
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,080
Wow! Such a nice name.

350
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
Are you gossip about me?

351
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,240
Let's eat.

352
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,800
One black coffee, please.

353
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,160
D*mn it.

354
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,960
Look at him.

355
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,880
He has money to eat well.

356
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,040
But he doesn't have money to pay.

357
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,240
Is he too much?

358
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,640
Is that normal?

359
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,640
People need to feed himself.

360
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,320
Do you want him to photosynthesize?

361
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,760
No!

362
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,760
Before he having happy,

363
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,960
He has to pay bepts first!

364
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,200
What will you do?

365
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,720
Come, I'll do this case.

366
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,240
You!

367
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,120
Who are you?

368
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,280
Who do you owe?

369
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,520
You get the wrong person.

370
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,320
Hey~

371
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,960
Just pay back the money.

372
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,920
You gonna make the big problems.

373
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,200
Are you threaten me?

374
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,480
I'll call the police!

375
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,240
How dare you?

376
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,880
Just pay back the money.

377
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,920
You can eat something expensive.

378
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,920
You can buy new phone.

379
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,760
Hey! Will you attack me?

380
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Should I use violent?

381
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
Or put it on the internet?

382
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,320
Creditors must ask the debtor politely.

383
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,320
Respect and refrain from condemnation.

384
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,600
Not to cause the debtor to be disgraced or shamed

385
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,840
To protect the rights of the debtor.

386
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,600
Otherwise, they will be punished according to Act 13.

387
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,720
Who are you?

388
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,360
I'm a lawyer. I just walked past.

389
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,920
Lawyer, help me, please.

390
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
You are the same.

391
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,600
Deptors must pay money back to Creditors.

392
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,480
Did you know?

393
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,920
Creditors can bring all evidence of your borrowing money

394
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,400
to sue you as well.

395
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,320
Give me your money.

396
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,000
Here you are. Please don't mess with me anymore.

397
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,840
Enough.

398
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,760
How can he do that?

399
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,760
We got the money. Just don't care him.

400
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,400
Where's he from?

401
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,560
You haven't pack your stuff yet. Let's go back home.

402
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,320
You'll traveling tomorrow.

403
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
Let's take the money to boss.

404
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,480
That's right.

405
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,480
Next day

406
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Hello, dad?

407
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,120
Don't worry.

408
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,000
That ten million,

409
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,760
I'll take it for you.

410
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,680
Bon Voyage, my son.

411
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,640
Thanks dad.

412
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,040
Wish the mission will success.

413
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,520
See you dad.

414
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,160
Your name, sir.

415
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:04,960
I'm David.

416
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,160
Okay

417
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:06,840
Yes, thank you.

418
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,320
Mek, sir.

419
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,640
Mr. Mek...Okay.

420
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,640
Is this the pier to take boat?

421
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,640
Yes, that way.

422
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
You! Can I ask something?

423
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,360
Is this the boat go to Arthid Island?

424
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,080
And what time will you get off?

425
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,760
The Boat to Arthid Island is already out. It's the boat to Pra Chan Island.

426
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,560
Huh? Pra Chan?

427
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,520
If you hurry, you can ask boss.

428
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,960
Maybe he can bring you together.

429
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,240
What did she say?

430
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,560
Pick it up.

431
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,440
Hey

432
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,200
You

433
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,400
I want to go to Arthid Island.

434
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,760
Do you know there?

435
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,000
Lifting slowly.

436
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,120
I can pay for it. Please bring me with you.

437
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,800
I'll lift it.

438
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,400
Such a rude person.

439
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,040
Don't let me see you again.

440
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,480
You're heartless!

441
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,640
So cruel hearted!

442
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,760
Evil-minded!!

443
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,720
What should I do now?

444
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,240
Let's stay here first.

445
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,840
Excuse me, sir.

446
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,040
I want a room with single bed.

447
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,800
Here, room number 305 at third floor.

448
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,680
You can pay rent fee when you check out.

449
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,480
Thank you.

450
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,640
It's so haunting people and haunting hotels.

451
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,440
Do you scare of ghost?

452
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,640
Ghost?

453
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,000
Hey uncle~

454
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,680
Who scare?

455
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,480
Ghost must scare of me.

456
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,800
That's good.

457
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,480
Good luck.

458
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,560
You're kidding me.

459
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,120
Where should I go?

460
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,760
Thanks.

461
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,720
What?! Double bed?

462
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,880
It's because of you.

463
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,440
I've to be in trouble.

464
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,160
Wait and see

465
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,360
Let I found you.

466
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,200
Who's that?

467
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,000
Yes?

468
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,720
Ghost isn't real.

469
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,920
According to science,

470
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,080
he'll kncok wrong.

471
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,080
When we open the door,

472
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,800
That's a relief.

473
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,160
What the?!

474
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,640
Ghost isn't real.

475
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,800
What the f*ck!

476
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,840
I won't stay here!!

477
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,160
Ghost!

478
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,240
Ghost!

479
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,960
Uncle! I want to change the room!

480
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,199
You said you're not scare of ghost.

481
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,639
Ghost?

482
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,560
The water comes not well.

483
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,520
Please~ I want to take a shower.

484
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,440
None.

485
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,520
This boy got the last one.

486
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,159
Can you....

487
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,960
change the room with me?

488
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,760
Oh! You know that?

489
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,360
Ghost can go anywhere.

490
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,560
It's not about ghost.

491
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,520
It's about water isn't good.

492
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,400
I want to take a shower.

493
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,159
If it true,

494
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,280
how can I change the room with you?

495
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,280
Clearly....

496
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,400
Actually, the water comes well.

497
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,360
But I'm scare of ghost.

498
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,880
Let me change the room, please~

499
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,960
Shall we sleep together?

500
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,000
Really?

501
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,440
It's already morning in a few hours.

502
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,000
I'll went in the morning.

503
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,840
Sure!!

504
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,840
I'm fine now.

505
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,440
I'll also save on accommodation costs.

506
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,000
You can join with me.

507
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,880
I don't want the room now.

508
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,120
That's alright.

509
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,720
Thank you.

510
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:50,960
You're welcome.

511
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,120
Please.

512
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,120
Thanks.

513
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,880
By the way, your face is not familiar at all.

514
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,720
What are you doing here?

515
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,640
I'll get money....

516
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,480
I mean I'm on traveling.

517
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,240
And tomorrow, Mister......

518
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,160
Can I call "You"?

519
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,440
Our age probably wasn't that much different.

520
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,320
I'm Nemo.

521
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,040
I'm Sun.

522
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,960
What's your plan tomorrow?

523
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,920
I'll go to island.

524
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,920
Arthid Island.

525
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,280
Do you know there?

526
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,840
Of course!!

527
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,880
Of course!!

528
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,560
I'll go there too!

529
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,880
Really?

530
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,320
Can I go with you?

531
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,640
Pleaseeeeee

532
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,400
Sure!!

533
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,280
But you've to sleep early.

534
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,120
I want to get the first boat.

535
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,960
Okay, deal!

536
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,120
Please bring me with you.

537
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,200
I find the guide whole day.

538
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,800
If not you, I'll be bad.

539
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,360
Okay.

540
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,280
Why is your face so familiar?

541
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,960
Have we met before?

542
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,840
I think no.

543
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,360
It's so beatiful.

544
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,160
Isn't it?

545
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,560
I really love this place so much.

546
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,320
So fresh!!

547
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
What's that noise?

548
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,400
Bro!

549
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,520
Do you come to see P'Arthid?

550
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,600
Do you know him?

551
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,400
Of course!

552
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,360
How can I meet him?

553
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,160
Go back!

554
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,680
No!

555
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,800
If you pay, I'll go then.

556
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,520
Pay for what?

557
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,280
Just go back to Bangkok!

558
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,560
How dare you chasing me?

559
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,200
You'll know who am I.

560
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,600
What do you want from me?

561
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
Do you see my dad?

562
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,320
He was interested in collecting debts and releasing that stupid loan.

563
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,560
I said go back to Bangkok!

564
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,000
Don't chase me, I'll go soon.

565
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,200
Or if you want to go back a lot, take 10 million back to my father.
