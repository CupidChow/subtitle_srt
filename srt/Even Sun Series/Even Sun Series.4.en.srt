1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,800
Come on, why the battery gone now?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,040
Sh*t!

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,080
Why don't you go back to bed?

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,160
If you still here,

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,960
Can you call someone to pick me up?

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,600
You should go back to Bangkok tomorrow.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,440
What did you say?

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,920
I can't hear you.

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,680
You got nothing

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,800
while you stay here.

11
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,680
Go back.

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,360
Can you pay the interest to us first?

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,000
Mek, who is he?

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,880
My name is Tai.

15
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,440
You should hurry give money back.

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,360
You waste our time.

17
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,440
You!!

18
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,360
Mek! Release me!

19
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,160
No!

20
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,640
You promise me first you won't get inside again.

21
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,920
Work is work.

22
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,960
I don't care who's father he is.

23
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,560
So,

24
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,240
Is this company can track dept ten million baht?

25
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,960
Ten million!!

26
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,880
Today!

27
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,920
I've to talk to him to make it clear.

28
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,040
And get the money back home.

29
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:50,800
Where!

30
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,200
What are you doing?!

31
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,000
Where is the money?

32
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,640
No!

33
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,160
Where is it?

34
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,160
I don't have it!

35
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,040
Listen to me,

36
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,760
Even though, I'm not your creditor.

37
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,880
I also have a right to stay here.

38
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,120
As a customer

39
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,560
Of this hotel.

40
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,520
So,

41
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,880
Would you pay the deposit for the room

42
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,960
to me please?

43
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,760
Sh*t!!

44
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,840
One hundred and fifty thousand!!

45
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:16,800
That's correct.

46
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,280
I can stay somewhere else.

47
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,800
There are many beautiful hotels here.

48
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,760
I don't care!

49
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,680
Is that Scammer?

50
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,120
Hey!

51
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,120
Hey!

52
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,160
Scammer!!

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,880
My name is Talay.

54
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,800
Talay

55
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,120
Not Scammer.

56
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,560
Whatever

57
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,479
Talay,

58
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,960
Please tell boss that I was sick and asked for a day off.

59
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,800
I got it.

60
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,240
Wait

61
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,840
Boss?

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,120
Is your friend owner here?

63
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,360
It's not only this hotel.

64
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,720
He's owner of every place.

65
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,160
Huh??

66
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,720
Every place?!

67
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,520
All hotels and resorts on this island

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,040
It's all a chain of Arthid's family.

69
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,760
He is a richman.

70
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,600
Why he doesn't pay the debts?

71
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,120
It's all done, right?

72
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,400
I've to go now.

73
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,560
Hey! Wait!

74
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,600
What's else?

75
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,440
Do you know any places

76
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,400
that he doesn't own?

77
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,760
Help me please.

78
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,360
Just think helping me and repay that I buy meal for you.

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,880
Are you ask for a debt of gratitude from me?

80
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,960
Of course!

81
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,120
Well. Get on my motorcycle.

82
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,360
Hurry up!

83
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,920
Wait a minute.

84
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,600
Let's go!

85
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,400
Hey! My bag!!

86
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,400
Come

87
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,320
Are you sure to stay temporarily?

88
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,920
Yes

89
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,000
Talay! You!

90
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,920
Don't let boss know about this.

91
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,400
Yes

92
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,520
There was no one else in this house.

93
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,600
And this is Arthid's first house.

94
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,760
But boss ordered to us no one can stay here.

95
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,360
I'm really troubled.

96
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,080
If I don't say

97
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,040
You don't say

98
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,040
You don't say

99
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,520
And you don't say

100
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,560
Who will know?

101
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,160
I don't say

102
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,480
You don't say

103
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,279
But if boss knows,

104
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,399
I'm die.

105
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,720
You have to die with me, understand?

106
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,680
What?

107
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,240
Can I go now?

108
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,520
How about Sataw?

109
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,159
Here is it.

110
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,640
Sataw, let's go.

111
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,080
Out of money now.

112
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,160
I can help you with just that.

113
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,240
I'll go.

114
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,880
I hope there is no ghost here.

115
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,680
So many dust.

116
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,200
What is it?

117
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,400
What is it?

118
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,000
I think this place is The House of Love.

119
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,560
Will you be sued?

120
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,400
You've to help me now.

121
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,000
How?!

122
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,480
It's a lot of money!

123
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,520
Ten million baht!

124
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,040
You must get money from my deptor to me.

125
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,840
And this is the place you have to go.

126
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,520
Why always me?

127
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Please send me go is better than him.

128
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,360
This is his father's money.

129
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,720
It's right to let his son do it.

130
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,520
It's right to let his son do it.

131
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,200
Yes!

132
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,760
Why he lie to me?

133
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,120
So, can you tell me

134
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,200
who is a creditor,

135
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,040
who is a deptor?

136
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,960
How dare you chasing me?

137
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,360
It doesn't matter.

138
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,480
You must go,

139
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
before you can't go.

140
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
Sh*t!!

141
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
My bag

142
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
D*mn it!

143
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
What are you doing?

144
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,480
Hey!! What did you do?

145
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,120
Let me go!

146
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,480
Hey!

147
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,120
Hurt!

148
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
It's hurt.

149
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,400
It's hurt.

150
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,040
Are you sadist? Huh??

151
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,000
I know you want money back.

152
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,720
If you want it,

153
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,360
You must stay here.

154
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,760
I know you want money back.

155
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,840
I want to go home.

156
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,440
I'm so sorry.

157
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,880
I'm really sorry.

158
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,120
Please

159
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,520
Please

160
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,080
Hey!

161
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,120
Hey!

162
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,920
Let me go!

163
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,120
It's too late. You fools.

164
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,760
Squid

165
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,720
Yes

166
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,640
Prawn, Snapper

167
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,360
And

168
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,080
Oyster

169
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,160
Oh my god!!

170
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,160
When you arrived here? Why don't you tell me?

171
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,600
Let me help you.

172
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,000
I'll bring your bag to your room.

173
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,200
I'm going.

174
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,480
What's up!

175
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,400
How are you?

176
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,760
Very well.

177
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,560
But you have time to see your friends now?

178
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,280
You already know that why am I here.

179
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
Ah~

180
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,560
Over there! The house at the end of the beach.

181
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,400
I got it.

182
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,280
Thanks

183
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,280
Wait!

184
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,080
It's not time to go there.

185
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,000
Why?

186
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,880
Why is it too long?

187
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,760
He's having fun.

188
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,200
Hey! How are you guys?

189
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,080
Here he comes

190
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,720
How was it?

191
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,880
Are you tired?

192
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,720
Do you want some water?

193
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,680
Yes

194
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,440
Waiter, water please.

195
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,200
Thank you.

196
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,120
What's up?

197
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,440
What about you

198
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,520
Why don't you tell me when you arrived?

199
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,360
I just arrived and waiting for you here.

200
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,400
What was that?

201
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,920
Were you bite from someone?

202
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,440
Let me see.

203
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,480
Come on

204
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,720
So big!

205
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,079
It's so big wound.

206
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,960
Boss~~

207
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,040
Stop it.

208
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,800
It's too late. You fools.

209
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Let me go!

210
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,560
It's too much!

211
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,240
If you want me release you,

212
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,040
Pay debts first.

213
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
And

214
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,600
Be nice

215
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,680
Do you understand?

216
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,640
Fine!

217
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,560
Be nice

218
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,360
Am I a good boy enough?

219
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,400
No

220
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,840
You can be more.

221
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,640
A bit more

222
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,000
Am I a good boy enough?

223
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,840
Why it so easy?

224
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,000
I'll loosen it up a bit.

225
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,240
It's hurt!!!

226
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,680
Are you a dog?

227
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,960
Do you want more?

228
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,960
If you don't want, just let me go!

229
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
Let me go now!

230
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,160
No

231
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,560
Let me go!

232
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,360
D*mn it!

233
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,160
It's so funny.

234
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,480
Is he shock?

235
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,120
Of course! He shout out loud.

236
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,760
But the bite hurts.

237
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,560
So he knows the truth now?

238
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,840
Yes

239
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,160
What's your plan now?

240
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,000
Oh! I have a phone!

241
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,800
Hello?

242
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,480
Hello?

243
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,240
Hello dad?

244
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,640
My son~

245
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,400
Did you get that money?

246
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
What's money?

247
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,480

248
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,160
What?

249
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,240
Hello?

250
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,560
Hello?

251
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,160
Dad!

252
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,720
It's not funny.

253
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,760
I'm locked up here.

254
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,920
Are we in debt?

255
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,600
Wait a minute.

256
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,560
Hello?

257
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,080
I can't hear you.

258
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,760
It's bad signal.

259
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,600
Wait

260
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,480
Hello?

261
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,480
Dad!

262
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,720
Don't joke on me, Dad

263
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,480
Help me right now!

264
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,280
Hello?

265
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,280
I'm not doing funny.

266
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,840
It's raining.

267
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,680
Hello?

268
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,880
So bad signal.

269
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,560
Dad!

270
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,480
Wait a minute.

271
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,160
Dad!

272
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,000
Hello?

273
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,640
What the heck weather. Rainy and windy.

274
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,560
It's so bad.

275
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,280
Dad

276
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,920
Don't joke with me.

277
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,160
Just help by yourself first.

278
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,160
Find something or money to pay him.

279
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
Wait dad.

280
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,360
It's many millions baht, how can I pay?

281
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,600
How long I have to stay here?

282
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,240
Anything

283
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,960
Just pay him anything.

284
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,520
What??

285
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,480
Pay anything first.

286
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,320
Anything, just pay him.

287
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,720
What's anything?

288
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,960
Just stay or help him first.

289
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,800
That's it.

290
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,200
Hello?

291
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,080
Rainy and windy.

292
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,440
I can't hear you, my son.

293
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,520
Hello?

294
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,040
So bad signal. Talk later.

295
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,040
Oh my life...

296
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,280
Dad...

297
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,320
D*mn it!

298
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,040
Anyway, I feel sorry for Sun too.

299
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,600
So bad luck.

300
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,960
Agree

301
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,200
He's so unlucky to meet someone like you guys.

302
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,520
Huh? I'm not!

303
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,640
That's Arthid!

304
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,880
Do you think I don't know you?

305
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,800
Huh?

306
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,760
Is this all your plan?

307
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,640
To make him know the truth.

308
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,160
Don't forget what we talk about.

309
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,320
According the plan, understand?

310
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,720
Okay

311
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,600
I know that.

312
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,400
But why would boss do this?

313
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,160
I think so.

314
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,720
Why you want to know?

315
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,680
Don't be silly to me.

316
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,200
If not our boss,

317
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,680
I don't do it.

318
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,840
One-two punch

319
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,480
Harder!

320
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,600
Elbow

321
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,280
I know!

322
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,160
Elbow!

323
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,440
Punch

324
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,680
Hit with knee

325
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,880
Ouch!!

326
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,400
I'm sorry.

327
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,880
Are you hurt?

328
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,640
Of course! How can you ask that?

329
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Here?

330
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,400
Hey!

331
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,680
What's happen?

332
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,040
Nothing father.

333
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,240
Just a little accident.

334
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Mangkorn

335
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,320
Could you tell your father?

336
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,120
About money,

337
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,920
When will he pays me back?

338
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,640
Fine

339
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,720
I'll sent Tai to do it.

340
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,320
Good afternoon, boss.

341
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,080
I bring money from Moo Brother to you.

342
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,600
Did you see my staff?

343
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,040
No, I didn't see him.

344
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
May I go now?

345
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,760
Good bye.

346
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,400
Good afternoon, boss.

347
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,360
Do you come alone?

348
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,280
Yes

349
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,600
Do you work alone also?

350
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,160
Where is Tai?

351
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,600
I don't know.

352
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,160
I thought he go to meet Moo Brother.

353
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,760
So, where is he gone?

354
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,040
Where is he?

355
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,560
What's happen?

356
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,520
It's hurt.

357
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,040
Here you are.

358
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,360
The rest of money.

359
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,440
Wow!!

360
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,720
Congratulations!

361
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,480
Thank you.

362
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,120
See? I told you this stock is going up!

363
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,240
Everything is going well right?

364
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:03,880

365
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,000
Absolutely!

366
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,840

Yes

373
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,640
He is a lawyer.

374
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,640
A lawyer?!

375
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,040
Good luck to you.

376
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,960
Bon Voyage.

377
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,640
Please drive safely.

378
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,680
A lot of money~

379
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,520
Did you see Sun?

380
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,680

381
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,920
A lot of money~

382
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,720
You don't need to help or do to him anymore~

383
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,080
We have money now~

384
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,880
So d*mn hot.

385
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,560
And so tired.

386
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,960
How can you come here, JJ?

387
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,480
Brother-in-law want me bring you back.

388
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,480
P'Arthid told you that?

389
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,880
Yes

390
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,160
Don't you believe me?

391
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,680
Just watch this.

392
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,200
My honey, watch this first.

393
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,280
P'Arthid...

394
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,600
Why you do like this to me...

395
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,360
Honey

396
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,360
I'm so sorry about that night.

397
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,400
Please go back with me.

398
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,360
Come on~

399
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,560
Let's go.

400
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,040
What's wrong with you?!

401
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,240
I try so hard to reconcile with you.

402
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,400
It's so far and so d*mn hot!

403
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,880
If it's hard,

404
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,920
You don't have to come.

405
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,640
You said like that...

406
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,960
What do you mean?

407
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,480
Do you want to break up with me?

408
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,160
You said that!

409
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,160
D*mn it!

410
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,040
Fine!

411
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,160
Just break up!

412
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,600
A stupid idiot boy like you.

413
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,360
If your dad and brother aren't rich.

414
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,040
Who want you?

415
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,160
Hey!

416
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,720
Just speak to me nicely.

417
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,360
Don't refer to my family like this!

418
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,200
I'll speak!

419
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,040
From now, I'm going to stop acting nice to you.

420
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,680
Or that you make me mad on you,

421
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,720
Because you secretly like your brother's friend?

422
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
Who are you talking about?

423
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,400
That lawyer!

424
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,320
You think I don't know?

425
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,120
That you learn about law,

426
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,960
You don't want to help your father and brother.

427
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,720
But you!

428
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,640
You want to see that guy more!

429
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,720
And you!

430
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,040
Cheat on me first!

431
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,400
I never cheating on you.

432
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,240
You lie!!

433
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,120
D*mn!!

434
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,480
What the heck!!

435
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,320
How did he come?

436
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,480
I see he's really angry.

437
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,560
You

438
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,240
Boss!!

439
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,120
Oh my god!

440
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,720
Oh my god!

441
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,200
There is a boat!

442
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,240
What's a boat?

443
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,240
Boat...Boat!

444
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,520
Slow down, TaKhai.

445
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,600
Little boss's boat!

446
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,960
Nemo?!

447
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,560
Why?! What's happen??

448
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,600
The boat of little boss on the sea without little boss!

449
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,040
What?!

450
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,240
I send 2 staffs to checking there now.

451
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,320
No! I'll go.

452
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,640
Hey!

453
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,120
You!

454
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,000
Wait for me!

455
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,160
Please take care of him.

456
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,440
Wait for me too!

457
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,840
D*mn it

458
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,240
Nemo!!

459
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,920
Nemo!! What are you doing?!

460
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,240
Will you kill yourself?

461
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,200
I won't kill myself.

462
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,040
So why you down there?

463
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,680
I dropped my phone when I arrived.

464
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,840
I'll find it and call you to pick me up.

465
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,440
Oh my crazy brother.

466
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,640
You make me shock.

467
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,960
Why does your ship floating on the sea?

468
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,960
Ah~

469
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,000
The rope must have fallen off.

470
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,520
I don't know what to do.

471
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,240
But that's good.

472
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,240
It make you come to me.

473
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,320
If not,

474
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,960
I'm probably stuck here.

475
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,800
Don't be careless.

476
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,840
Next time,

477
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,480
Please don't come alone.

478
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,840
I'm sorry.

479
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,160
Let's go home.

480
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,080
Someone came to see you, you know?

481
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,360
In case you want to see him.

482
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,360
Who?

483
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,000
You'll know.

484
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,240
Before we go back,

485
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,760
Would you go to see father?

486
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,840
Okay.

487
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,000
Be careful.

488
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,240
Be careful.

489
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,320
Thanks

490
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,640
I know your story.

491
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,840
I'm so sorry.

492
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,800
About what?

493
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,880
About your father.

494
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:23,800
My dad?

495
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
My dad is not dead yet.

496
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,400
Why you say sorry?

497
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,080
I know.

498
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,560
You dad still alive.

499
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,120
I mean about ten million baht.

500
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,520
Ah~

501
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,320
Are you going to mock me?

502
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:40,840
Huh?

503
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,240
That's right.

504
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,160
You and him are friends.

505
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,720
You must be on his side.

506
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,000
Really?

507
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,360
If it doesn't like what you think...

508
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,199
Thank you.

509
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,480
What's happen?

510
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,719
Are you guys okay?

511
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,159
It's just misunderstanding.

512
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,040
It's good you are alright.

513
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,520
I'm so sorry.

514
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,040
It's because of me.

515
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,880
P'Nai!

516
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,880
What's up little devil!

517
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,639
Where did you go naughty?

518
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
I...

519
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,880
Never mind.

520
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,199
It's good you are alright.

521
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,679
I'm really sorry.

522
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,440
I messed everything up.

523
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,200
Don't think too much.

524
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,320
Arthid

525
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,200
I'll go back to work.

526
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,560
There are so many customers today.

527
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,120
See you.

528
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,360
Hey!

529
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,880
But....

530
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,360
How about that guy?

531
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,120
I forgot it!

532
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,040
Why are you doing that?

533
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,960
If you have a chance to judge a person's life

534
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,760
Will you choose from your feeling,

535
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,080
Or your duty?

536
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,000
Father

537
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,400
I want to boxing.

538
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,960
I want a boxing competitor.

539
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,680
This!!

540
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,480
Remember that,

541
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,600
There is no competition here!

542
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:45,960
Father!!

543
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,840
Don't be in a hurry to eat.

544
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,640
It will stuck in your throat.

545
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,120
I'm so starving.

546
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,360
If I can escape from here.

547
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,440
I'll play 'em hard!

548
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,480
So, do you want to escape now?
