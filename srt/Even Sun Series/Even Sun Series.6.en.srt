1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,360
If you have a chance to judge a person's life

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,560
Will you choose from your feeling,

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,240
Or your duty?

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,000
Your everyday is only money.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,840
Money!

6
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,800
Money!

7
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,600
I hate you!!

8
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,240
Mangkorn

9
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,600
Pack your things now.

10
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,880
And leave here.

11
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,360
Don't you think I'm not tired?

12
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,160
You tired?

13
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,200
There are tens of millions baht of money to lend to others.

14
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,560
You can live

15
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,600
without working.

16
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,840
Because you have thinking like this.

17
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,160
Don't you scare your father?

18
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,440
I'm scare!!

19
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,160
But I'm scare to be without you more.

20
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,240
Where do you going?

21
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,440
Let's go to sleep.

22
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,400
Quickly

23
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,480
Ouch!

24
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,080
What's wrong?

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,920
Um...

26
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,680
Nah..

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,680
Not...

28
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,640
Nothing

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,000
Um...

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,440
Can I ask you something?

31
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,080
Why do you have candles in your room?

32
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,200
The lights shut often.

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,360
This is island.

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,440
That's why I prepare candles here.

35
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,120
Ah~

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,600
Just like that.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,200
I won't run away.

38
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,600
I don't trust you.

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,880
Just trust me one time.

40
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,280
It's been like this.

41
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,840
Go

42
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,160
It's time to sleep.

43
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,520
Go

44
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,080
Go to sleep.

45
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:02,960
Quickly.

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,840
I said go to sleep.

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,640
Ouch!

48
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,840
You stubborn.

49
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,160
Will you sleep?

50
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,520
Let me move first.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,440
Go

52
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,800
Raise your hand up first.

53
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,520
Why you stand here?

54
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,160
Um

55
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,760
Um..

56
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,640
Nothing.

57
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,040
Do you bring that meal to them?

58
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:55,720
Yes

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,720
How about you?

60
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,200
Do you buy some drinks to them?

61
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,360
Yes

62
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
But I think...

63
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
They don't want it.

64
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,080
I think so.

65
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,160
People just worried.

66
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,760
Just give time to them.

67
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
By the way,

68
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,079
Let's eat with me.

69
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,400
Huh?

70
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,520
Such a pervert!

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,920
What do you mean??

72
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,960
See?

73
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,280
You have meal.

74
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,280
I have drinks.

75
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,320
Let's eat.

76
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,760
Ah~

77
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,840
You mean eat meal.

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,560
Of course!

79
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,000
Ah~ Let's eat the meal.

80
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,760
What's wrong with you?

81
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,000
I have meal and you have drinks.

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,920
Let's go!

83
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,520
When we grow up,

84
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,440
I will do something to make you can remember me.

85
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,560
But you have to say 'Hi' to me.

86
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,280
Um..

88
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,520
That's fine.

89
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,280
Just go to take a shower.

90
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,800
Okay

91
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,120
And don't think to run away.

92
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,520
Someone will pick you up.

93
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,920
I know,

94
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,920
I won't run away.

95
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,920
Ouch!

96
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,120
Sorry

97
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,080
I won't play with you!

98
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,120
It's hurt!

99
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,720
You just play alone!

100
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,480
So...

101
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,280
You should sit here.

102
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,880
I'll get balm for you.

103
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,720
Hurt?

104
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,000
Of course!

105
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,840
Of course!

106
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,440
Aha!

107
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,280
It's just a bit.

108
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,200
You will be fine.

109
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,040
What's your name?

110
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,920
You don't need to know.

111
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,080
Why?

112
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,360
I won't stay here anymore.

113
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,840
Where do you go?

114
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,880
Can you stay and play with me longer?

115
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,040
No

116
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,560
Hey!

117
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,320
When we grow up,

118
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,280
I will do something to make you can remember me.

119
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,640
But you have to say 'Hi' to me.

120
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,440
How can I remember you?

121
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,720
Oh...

122
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,720
So!

123
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,400
I'm going to do orange hair.

124
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,320
Like the sun

125
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,280
Because my name is Sun.

126
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,400
It's mean the sun.

127
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,040
Okay?

128
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,840
Okay

129
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,200
Brother!

130
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,920
I want to go to Arthid Island.

131
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,920
Do you know there?

132
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,120
Oh! Tie it well.

133
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,400
Tie it tight, the ship will be lost.

134
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,800
So many people today.

135
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,320
Over there, two more will come.

136
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,200
There is also a customer bag.
P'Talay may tired today.

137
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,480
In the evening, we will go to see the accommodation.

138
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,360
Please follow the boys.

139
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,320
Work hard.

140
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,520
Hey!

141
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,120
P'Arthid comes!

142
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,160
P'Arthid!! This way!!

143
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,040
Hey

144
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,960
What are you doing here?

145
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,280
I came to help your work.

146
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,080
Nai? You too?

147
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,920
Yes

148
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,280
So you don't go back to Bangkok?

149
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,840
I guess I'll go back later.

150
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
I'll go with your brother.

151
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,440
About Bangkok work,

152
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,440
I'll handle it. Don't worry.

153
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,720
I send someone to watch Sun's father.

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,840
This time, he's finding money to pay your debts.

155
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,920
I handle it.

156
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,720
Okay

157
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,560
What are you talking about?

158
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,720
Why look so serious?

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,360
It's all about father.

160
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,240
What's about son?

161
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,800
Is it done?

162
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,800
What do you mean?

163
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,120
P'Arthid

164
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,960
You should find some happiness for yourself.

165
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,200
Don't stress at all

166
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,240
We have a lot of money.

167
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,920
And...

168
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,840
When I graduated,

169
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,600
I will come to help your business.

170
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,000
You should focus on your study.

171
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
Don't worry about me.

172
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Yes, sir.

173
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,720
Boss! I'm coming.

174
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,920
I'm coming.

175
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,640
Watch out!

176
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,720
Come!

177
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,920
I'm coming.

178
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,520
Guys

179
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,040
Please take care them.

180
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,800
Come with me!

181
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,560
Hey!

182
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,160
Nemo!

183
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,960
Help me please.

184
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,400
Uh..

185
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,120
Please~~

186
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,480
I think I can't help you about this.

187
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,280
I’m Sorry.
Talay!

188
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,160
Talay, help me please.

189
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,200
No! It's not my business.

190
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,920
I won't!
Talay!

191
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,760
Ouch! Let me go.

192
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,280
Talay!!

193
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,120
Ouch!

194
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,840
Barbarians!!

195
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,520
Don't let me meet you in Bangkok.

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,440
I will call the police to and arrest you all!

197
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,880
Bad guys!

198
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,800
Barbarians!!

199
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,400
I will call the police to and arrest you all!

200
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,840
Oh my god!

201
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,040
It's like "Beauty and the Beast"

202
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,080
Agree.

203
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,360
Where are we going?

204
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Just follow me.

205
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,800
Can I wear the glasses first?

206
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,520
It's hot.

207
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,520
And burning eyes.

208
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,360
Why you stop?

209
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,400
Arrived.

210
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,000
Arrived What??

211
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,840
The work that you have to do today is

212
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,160
Collect these coconuts.

213
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:36,680
Again?!

214
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,640
I see...

215
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,000
Does this island have no other jobs?

216
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,920
Huh?

217
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,520
And one more thing,

218
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,080
I'm a human!

219
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,840
Not monkey

220
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,360
Not monkey to climb to get coconuts.

221
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,160
I said collecting,

222
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,760
Not climbing.

223
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,400
Who knows?

224
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,000
Hey!

225
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,000
Hey!!

226
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,240
Hey what?

227
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,000
Hold on....

228
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,920
Hey!!

229
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,320
I will waing for you upstairs.

230
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,240
Get it all.

231
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,480
Don't run away.

232
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,640
Yes, sir.

233
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,560
I got it.

234
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,640
You speak everyday that make me crazy.

235
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,160
Get it all.

236
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,160
Hey!

237
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,520
Crazy monkey!

238
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,320
Hey!

239
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,840
I won't let you eat bananas.

240
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,600
You! Don't climb down!

241
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,720
Stop!!

242
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,440
Watch out!

243
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:32,760
Ouch!

244
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Are you hurt?

245
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,080
Never mind.

246
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,520
It's gonna be alright.

247
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,000
Sure?

248
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,400
Yes

249
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,520
So,

250
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,200
I will take you sit.

251
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,600
Over there.

252
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,240
How was it?

253
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,760
It serves you right.

254
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,720
What??

255
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,600
Nothing!

256
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,360
But...

257
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,680
Thanks for helping me.

258
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,760
Huh?

259
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,320
Thanks for helping me.

260
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,360
Why you smile?

261
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,400
I know you heard that.

262
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,480
By the way,

263
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,640
Our name

264
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,960
are same.

265
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,760
Really?

266
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,280
Yes

267
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,880
Your name is Arthid.

268
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,160
In English is the sun.

269
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,120
And my name

270
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
is Sun.

271
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,360
In Thai, is the sun.

272
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,040
It's strange.

273
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,560
It's same meaning.

274
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,800
It's luckless.

275
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,160
That's me!

276
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,960
Do you know that?

277
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,200
My job is the dept collector.

278
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,720
But I haven't do it success.

279
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,440
At first,

280
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
My dad send me to get money from you.

281
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,160
I just think,

282
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,480
If successful

283
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
it will be able to restore my dignity back.

284
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,440
But the result

285
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,280
It was the same.

286
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,160
I think I'm not suitable for this job.

287
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,160
Um..

288
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,760
So what do you think

289
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,560
you are suitable for?

290
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,680
I don't know.

291
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,200
Why do you keep it?

292
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,560
I just want my home clean.

293
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
When it clean,

294
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,560
It's nice to live, right?

295
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,520
Is it all done?

296
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,800
Thank you very much.

297
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,359
Oh! Sun!

298
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,440
Dad!!

299
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,599
My son...

300
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,720
How are you?

301
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,079
Eh???

302
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,400
Hey!

303
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Why are you doing this to my son?

304
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,160
Huh!?

305
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,800
I'm going to report to the police.

306
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,200
How dare!

307
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,880
Oh...My son

308
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,240
It's that me,

309
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,000
who want to call the police to arrest you.

310
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,520
I'm so bored to let my staffs to get money from you.

311
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,480
Hey!

312
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,680
You should give money back to me.

313
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,440
My son has graduated.

314
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,120
And he will move to island.

315
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,800
Please speak slowly.

316
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,480
We already grown up.

317
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,440
Hey!

318
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,040
Do you know that?

319
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,360
I try to collect money

320
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,440
to buy some island to my son.

321
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,680
If I don't give it to him as promised

322
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,000
He may sells it to someone else.

323
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,720
What should I do?

324
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,000
Do you know that?

325
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,320
I know~

326
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,400
Give me more time, my best friend.

327
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,800
Don't use the word best friend to negotiate with me again.

328
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,040
Just give it to me now.

329
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,240
Ten millions baht.

330
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:24,880
What?!

331
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,520
Ten millions?

332
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,440
Yes

333
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,360
He borrows me ten millions baht.

334
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,240
Oh my god!

335
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,360
Don't know how,

336
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,280
Just give it to me now.

337
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,400
I...

338
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,200
I don't have it.

339
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,440
You said you have it?

340
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,360
Hey! What's happen??

341
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,600
Nothing...

342
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,280
Hey!

343
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,200
Hey!

344
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,240
Wait! Cool down.

345
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,320
Cool down.

346
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,400
I'll give it to you.

347
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,720
Okay, I will call ambulance.

348
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,560
Cool down.

349
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,200
Um...

350
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,880
I'm sorry about that.

351
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,400
But I apologize to your father everyday.

352
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,840
And after that...

353
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,000
How about now?

354
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,040
Well....

355
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,920
Never mind.

356
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,120
It's been a long time.

357
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,240
I'm really sorry.

358
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,600
I guarantee that such a thing will never happen again.

359
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,480
Please

360
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,760
My son

361
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,760
Let's go home, my son.

362
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,480
Dad

363
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,360
What?!

364
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,160
What do you mean?

365
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,120
I...

366
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,680
This is a ten million baht cash check.

367
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,120
That uncle returned.

368
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,920
And this is loan agreement.

369
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,880
See?

370
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,400
Did you see?

371
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,440
Hey!

372
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,760
Sun

373
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,440
You are free now.

374
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,240
You...

375
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,560
How about this check?

376
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,720
I'll let you to deal with the check as well.

377
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,000
Okay

378
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,880
So...

379
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,440
My son

380
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,200
Sun

381
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,760
Let's go back to our home.

382
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,920
My dear son

383
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,880
Please

384
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,560
Let's go home.

385
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,440
Wait!!

386
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,520
You!

387
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,240
Hey!

388
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,040
You should go back with your father.

389
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,920
Why do you like chasing me so much?

390
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,920
You don't want to stay here anymore.

391
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,080
How do you know that?

392
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,080
Maybe I change my mind.

393
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,680
What's that?

394
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,680
This place is not bad.

395
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,000
You can't stay here.

396
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,400
You should go.

397
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,480
If I want to stay,

398
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
No matter you chase me, I won't go!

399
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,640
But you don't owe me any more.

400
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,880
Just leave.

401
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,280
Hey

402
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,120
Can I borrow your money?

403
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,240
How much?

404
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,080
As much

405
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,640
as I'll never pay off your debt.

406
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,440
Huh?

407
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,600
Don't come to me yet?

408
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,240
I will cheer Mangkorn.

409
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,440
I will cheer Ashing.

410
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Mangkorn

411
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,720
Ashing practicing boxing for a year.

412
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,120
Just look at his pattern first.

413
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,560
Ashing too.

414
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,400
Oh!

415
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,000
How was it?

416
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,400
His pattern.

417
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,360
It's definitely.

418
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:43,880
Aha!

419
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,760
You will see.

420
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,560
Okay

421
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,560
Don't use forehead hit forehead.

422
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,520
And don't kick lower the crotch.

423
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,880
Sportsmanship

424
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,480
Who do you think won?

425
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,800
Absolutely my son won!

426
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,360
Aw~

427
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,240
So I bet opposite side.

428
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,160
Do you want to bet?

429
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
Stop it.

430
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,000
Just little bit.

431
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,680
Oh~

432
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Just little bit.

433
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,480
Do you have money?

434
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,320
I'm boring to ask your old one.

435
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,640
If he lose,

436
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,440
Will you pay me?

437
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,160
I went to invest last time and got a lot of money.

438
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:27,960
Believe me.

439
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,520
If I don't have it, I won't do it again.

440
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,000
I won't do it again. Amen~

441
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,840
I swear it.

442
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:33,960
Alright!

443
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,360
May I ask you?

444
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,360
Why you run this boxing camp for your son?

445
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,360
What is the happiness of my son,

446
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,680
I can do it all.

447
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,680
You run this camp for your son or for your self?

448
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,120
Watch your mouth.

449
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,120
Your mouth...

450
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,360
Why you speak like that?

451
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,440
Cool down.

452
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,320
We are old now, why we still fighting?

453
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,120
I'm collecting money to buy some island to my son.

454
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,040
and will be given as the property of their descendants.

455
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,920
Well, you speak like that.

456
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
Such a pitty.

457
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,480
My son is a boy.

458
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,560
Your sons are boys too.

459
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,320
If not then....

460
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,920
We have come to the same family.

461
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,120
Well, if one of our children is a woman,

462
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,320
By this time, they can get marry.

463
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,880
And if that's true,

464
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,360
I will give them all the treasures of the island.

465
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,240
Hey~

466
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,360
Any gender is the same.

467
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,280
For the happiness of the child,

468
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,080
We have to be willing to open up to it a bit wider.

469
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,840
Yes, you are right.

470
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,160
Nowadays, any gender can love each other.

471
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,480
Let our children love,

472
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,880
We must love too.

473
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,080
Do you agree?

474
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,320
Agree.

475
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,080
But me...

476
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,480
So much thinking.

477
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,360
Why?

478
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,920
It doesn't have any heirs.

479
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,760
No problems.

480
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,760
Just let it be a matter of the future.

481
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,160
Whatever is the happiness of the child, give it to them.

482
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,680
That's right.

483
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,960
Let's take a photo as a souvenir, shall we?

484
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,960
Because when I'm gone, you'll miss me.

485
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,640
Your mouth...

486
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,080
Oh! That's good.

487
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,280
When you say like this,

488
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,160
It's like saying that you are going to die.

489
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,120
I mean I go there.

490
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,320
You just go to stay there.

491
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,080
Sound like you are going to die.

492
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,160
Your mouth...

493
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,960
Let's take a selfie.

494
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,080
Good!

495
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,840
When I go to the island.

496
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,920
I can't come back in time to see you.

497
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,720
Let's take it!

498
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,640
Can you use it?

499
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,440
I just bought it.

500
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,560
The newest one.

501
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,080
Come closer.

502
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,080
Okay

503
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
Action!

504
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,640
Amen

505
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,440
Alright!

506
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,440
That's fine.

507
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,400
Good!

508
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,000
I bet...

509
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,000
20,000 baht!

510
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,920
Go!

511
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,680
Hey!

512
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,520
Ashing!

513
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,600
Yeah!

514
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,960
Yeah!

515
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,160
Yeah!

516
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,600
Hey!

517
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,640
Yeah!

518
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,040
Yeah!

519
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,920
Yeah!

520
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,000
Ashing!

521
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,200
Again!

522
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,120
Yeah!

523
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,080
Ashing, Ashing

524
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,040
Yeah!

525
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,920
Yeah!

526
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,320
Yeah!

527
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,440
Yeah!

528
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,680
Elbow!

529
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
You lose.

530
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,880
1

531
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,320

532
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,560

533
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:26,960
4

534
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,520
5

535
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,680
6

536
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,120
7

537
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,480
8

538
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,880
9

539
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,360
10!!

540
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,280
You lose!!

541
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,040
Lose what?

542
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,320
I win~

543
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,960
What? Mangkorn knock down.

544
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,000
You see that?

545
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,120
Oh my...

546
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,320
Your son win,

547
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,560
But lose for Mangkorn's heart.

548
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,040
Hey!

549
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,960
Hey!

550
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,280
Give my money back!

551
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,160
Hey!!!

552
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,160
Don't you scare your father?

553
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,440
I'm scare!!

554
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,800
But I'm scare to be without you more.

555
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,360
So...

556
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,880
I can stay here more, right?

557
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,720
Of course.

558
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,480
As long as you want.

559
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,160
Oh!

560
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,520
I said...

561
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,800
If someone has the same name, it will be unlucky.

562
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,840
I take it back.

563
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,760
Why?

564
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,200
If someone has the same name, it will be unlucky.

565
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,400
But now,

566
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,880
It's not unlucky.

567
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,600
What do you mean?

568
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,640
Well, we're the same person.

569
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,320
Idiot

570
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,880
You are so cute.

571
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,320
P'Arthid!

572
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,040
Arthid!

573
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,720
P'Arthid!

574
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,000
Silence.

575
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,200
Arthid!

576
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,320
Arthid!

577
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,760
Please open the door!

578
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,440
Arthid!

579
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,960
Hey!

580
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,840
P'Arthid!

581
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,560
Arthid!

582
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,120
Are you inside?

583
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,400
Open please.

584
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,120
Arthid!

585
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
What's happen?

586
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,240
You take so long time, what are you doing inside?

587
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,760
What??

588
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,120
I'm alone.

589
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,000
Then why not sleep in a big house?

590
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,320
Yes...Where is Sun?

591
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,719
I don't know.

592
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,960
If you not meet him, that's fine.

593
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,239
Well, P'Nai and me

594
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,320
We will go to Bangkok. I come to tell you first.

595
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,639
Oh! Really?

596
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,440
So...

597
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,880
Please take care to my brother.

598
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,520
Don't worry.

599
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,000
For the new lawyer of Arthid Island.

600
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,360
Are you?

601
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,280
P'Nai~

602
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,239
I've been helping P'Arthid every day.

603
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,360
Who will dare~

604
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,480
Huh?

605
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,080
How about me?

606
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,600
You?

607
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,840
You all have work to do.

608
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,800
Then I must be a subordinate of Arthid forever?

609
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,800
Are you sure that

610
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,400
You are subordinate of him?

611
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,360
Yes! I worked.

612
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,320
I didn't rich like you.

613
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,440
Really?

614
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,560
Both of us know everything about you now.

615
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,200
Because of your father,

616
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,240
He gives money to Arthid's father before he pass away.

617
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,280
To buy Lek Island.

618
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,320
Um...

619
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,280
Guys

620
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,680
That's fine. I don't want it.

621
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,480
That's fine.

622
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,240
I returned this money to you.

623
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,280
You should take it.

624
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,920
Thank you both of you very much.

625
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,160
My best friends.

626
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,880
Thank you.

627
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,360
We are your best friends.

628
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,560
So...

629
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,400
Where is..

630
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,200
Your lover?

631
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,040
Nemo!

632
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,960
Will you go now, right?

633
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,320
I'll send you.

634
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,640
You can wait me at restaurant.

635
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,000
I got it.

636
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,440
I will change my clothes for a moment.

637
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,400
May I go to toilet?

638
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,440
No!

639
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,640
It's strange.

640
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,960
It's my private space.

641
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,600
Suspicious

642
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,040
Nothing

643
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,400
I will change my clothes.

644
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,600
What the hack you guys.

645
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,760
It's strange.

646
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,000
Yes

647
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,480
Absolutely

648
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,400
Let's hide over there.

649
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,440
Okay

650
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,360
Have you finished changing clothes?

651
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,280
Yes

652
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,640
We will go to send them together.

653
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,160
Huh?

654
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,800
Didn't you tell them

655
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
That we are together now?

656
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,680
Yes

657
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
So...

658
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Let's go out together.

659
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,360
But separated and met at the beach

660
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,200
Okay

661
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,000
Let's go.

662
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,920
Surprise!!!

663
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Oh~

664
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,840
Oh~

665
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,440
So chill~

666
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,720
He's shy~

667
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,360
It's too late.

668
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
He's shy~

669
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,400
What?!

670
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,280
Well~

671
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,520
Come take a peek?

672
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,760
Congratulations P'Arthid!

673
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,960
Clap your hands!

674
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,480
Heh?

675
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,440
You are not lonely now.

676
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,160
You should be shy to your friends.

677
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,360
Why?

678
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,080
Why you keep it?

679
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,120
I want your house to be nice to live in.

680
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,760
So, do you want to live?

681
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,800
Do you allow me to live here?

682
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,520
Yes

683
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,600
Forever.

684
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,720
Forever.

685
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,080
Oh!

686
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,040
Have we forgotten anything?

687
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,720
Um...

688
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,000
As far as I can remember,

689
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,480
No

690
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,600
Okay

691
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,040
Forgotten...

692
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,160
Everyone must have forgotten me.

693
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,200
Whoever...

694
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,080
Help me~~~

695
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,680
Help me please~~~~
