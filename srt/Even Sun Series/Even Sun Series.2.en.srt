1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,600
Will you be sued?

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,760
You must get money from my debtor to me.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,600
Dad! It's not about me!

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,480
Debt pays by himself.

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,400
Hey!

6
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,240
And this is the place you have to go.

7
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,560
Why always me?

8
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,880
If you don't do it,

9
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,680
Don't need to comeback!!

10
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,079
Can I go with you?

11
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,360
Can you go?

12
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,760
Can you ask your dad for me?

13
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,480
Nah...

14
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,320
I can't ask anything for me.

15
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,880
I want to go to Arthid Island.

16
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,920
Do you know there?

17
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,000
You're heartless!

18
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,160
So cruel hearted!

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,040
Evil-minded!!

20
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,840
I want a room with single bed.

21
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,200
Here, room number 305 at third floor.

22
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,400
It's so haunting people and haunting hotels.

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,240
Do you scare of ghost?

24
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,120
Hey uncle~

25
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,560
Who scare?

26
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,760
Ghost must scare of me.

27
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,320
Ghost!!

28
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,360
Ghost!!

29
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,040
What's your plan tomorrow?

30
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,840
Arthid Island

31
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,360
Do you know there?

32
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,840
I'll go there too!

33
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,760
I come so far

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,440
to eat instant noodles?

35
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,480
Sh*t!! Cockroach!!

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,000
Cockroach!!

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,800
I got it!

38
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,560
Don't think to escape from this.

39
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,920
It's so beautiful.

40
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,040
Agree?

41
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,960
I love this place so much.

42
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,120
So fresh!

43
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,280
What's that noise?

44
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,120
Brother!

45
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,320
Brother?

46
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,920
Wait!!

47
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,280
When you arrived here?

48
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,520
Come, let me help you.

49
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,480
That's fine.

50
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,440
Come on, quickly.

51
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,480
Thanks.

52
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,000
Yep

53
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,960
Let's go.

54
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,440
Hold on.

55
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
Why I run away?

56
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,520
No one knows me here.

57
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,840
Bro!

58
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,960
Bro

59
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,160
Do you know about that two men?

60
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,840
That they're walking together.

61
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,520
Yes, I know. What's your business?

62
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Nothing,

63
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,960
but I...

64
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,240
I want to know where is his house.

65
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,200
Nothing? But why you want to know about him?

66
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
Well, I've some business to talk with him.

67
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,960
I can't tell you.

68
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,160
If you want to know, you've to find it by yourself.

69
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,600
Because my boss is so cruel.

70
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,120
I'm moving, just find it by yourself!

71
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,080
What kind of person who name Boss?

72
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,159
Give me some water.

73
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,280
I said give me some water.

74
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,440
What the heck on you?!

75
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,520
I talk to you several times.

76
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,720
To give me some water.

77
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,920
It's over there.

78
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,040
You also have hands, you must get by yourself.

79
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,240
Aha~ I also have hands.

80
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,240
Ew!! Dirty!

81
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,840
Why?

82
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,720
Did you forgot

83
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,280

84
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,000
So what?

85
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,200
So what??

86
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,440
How dare you ask me?

87
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,880
You're my debtor.

88
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,640
You've to do my order.

89
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,000
Go and get some water for me. I'll continue practicing.

90
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,600
Thirsty?

91
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,200
If you can wait, just wait.

92
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,360
If you can't wait, just wait!

93
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,560
You want to have a problem?

94
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
Do you want to fight?

95
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,280
Hey!! What's it happening?

96
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
Will you use violence?

97
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,880
What the heck on you, Ashing?

98
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,240
What's happen?

99
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,680
Mek! Please get him over me!

100
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,720
Why?

101
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,880
He's so eyesore.

102
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,360
He never do my orders.

103
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,360
He's just standing there. Annoying!!

104
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,560
Ashing, you need to cool down.

105
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,840
He was never a subordinate either.

106
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,760
You need to cool down and be patient.

107
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,120
And you're paying off your father's debt.

108
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,520
Just follow the rules.

109
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,600
But if you won't to stay here anymore,

110
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,720
Just tell your father to pay the debts quickly.

111
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
That's it.

112
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,000
You always said it's about debts.

113
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,640
Right! I'm poor!!

114
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,880
How was it?

115
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
It's not going to work, boss!

116
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,600
It's not...

117
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,920
Will it able to work?

118
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,040
It's oil leak, I think it won't.

119
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,240
You!

120
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,040
You

121
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,880
Do you..

122
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,560
Just check fuel pump.

123
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,760
Do you know this hotel?

124
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,440
Nope.

125
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,400
Hang on.

126
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,720
Did you known what I want to ask?

127
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,160
Hey! I'm talking with you.

128
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm a creditor...

129
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,200
What creditor?

130
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,480
I just tell...

131
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,920
I'm a traveler.

132
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,920
Go away.

133
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,880
People are working.

134
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,000
Go!

135
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,480
Idiot.

136
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,680
What crazy person stepped on a shell?

137
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,720
Stand up.

138
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,240
Wait!

139
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Just stand up and heal.

140
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,520
Ouch! It's hurt!

141
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,160
Stay still. Let me check.

142
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,000
Ouch!

143
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,840
It's hurt!

144
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,760
Just sit here

145
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,880
And hold it.

146
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,600
Where are you going?

147
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,600
For wash.

148
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,200
Not for drink.

149
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,760
It's hurt!

150
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,480
What are you doing here?

151
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,080
You ask me?

152
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,080
Am I ask a shell?

153
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,200
A shell can speak?

154
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,000
Do you hear?

155
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,400
Are you driving me crazy?

156
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,520
If yes, why?

157
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,320
Nah~

158
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,840
Why? Do you think I take a shell

159
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,720
to kill myself?

160
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,560
Yes

161
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,280
Only some idiots will done it.

162
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,000
Probably?

163
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,000
Will you answer me well

164
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,920
What are you doing here?

165
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,080
Just travel

166
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,520
Really?

167
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,360
Is it finish?

168
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,520
It's just a small island. That's all.

169
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,800
I think so?

170
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,720
Just go back.

171
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,600
Huh? No!

172
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,720
If you want me to go, just pay.

173
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,640
Pay what?

174
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,680
My son, did you found debtor?

175
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,560
Dad!!

176
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,880
Quiet!

177
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,560
I know, I got it.

178
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,520
Just hang up.

179
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,240
Where's he gone?

180
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,000
Jesus.

181
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,880
Here you are.

182
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,560
Here you are.

183
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,520
Don't want it?

184
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,080
Give it to me.

185
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,040
Is there something inside you?

186
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,960
It's weird.

187
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,880
Why?

188
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,640
If yes, why?

189
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,760
Will you kick,

190
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,880
punch,

191
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,760
or chase me?

192
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,480
No

193
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,680
But I'll...

194
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,640
How dare you.

195
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,640
You drunk again.

196
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,240
It's a little bit, honey.

197
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,680
Why you still wake up?

198
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,800
Someone still haven't returned home.

199
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,800
Honey, it's as cute as ever.

200
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,640
Please don't.

201
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,119
Please don't.

202
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,560
Did you push me?

203
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,200
Because you go far.

204
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,720
Aha~ Or

205
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,920
Will you keep your rhythm to do with someone else?

206
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,360
Why you talk like that?

207
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,840
Have you never believe me?

208
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,520
Believe you?

209
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,760
Have you ever made me believe?

210
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,440
I knew that

211
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,400
You secretly like your brother's friend.

212
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,000
JJ! It's not like that.

213
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,520
Lies that it's not true

214
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,880
Just speak to me nicely.

215
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,400
My wife likes someone else. Will you let me speak nicely?

216
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:00,840
JJ!!

217
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,720
It's too much!!

218
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,080
Do you want to leave?

219
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,880
If you want to leave, just go then!!

220
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,200
Fine!!

221
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,600
I'll go!!

222
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,880
Go away!

223
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,400
And don'r come back!!

224
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,600
Fine!!

225
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,000
What are you doing here?

226
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,000
Nothing

227
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,200
When you here?

228
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,680
Just a moment.

229
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,320
Don't you know that?

230
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,880
I just....space out.

231
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,400
By the way, are you okay?

232
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,200
Did you fight with your boyfriend again?

233
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,360
If you won't to tell, that's okay.

234
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,080
I'll go to bed.

235
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,000
You too.

236
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,600
I got it.

237
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,880
Brother

238
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,840
Can I go to Lek island tomorrow?

239
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,720
I just...want to see father.

240
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,200
I miss him.

241
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,120
Can I go there?

242
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,320
Of course.

243
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
Thanks.

244
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
You should go to bed.

245
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Where is it?

246
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,120
I'm gonna die.

247
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,400
Hey!!!

248
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,840
How can you get in?

249
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,240
And who used to not lock the door?

250
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,640
Did you steal mine?

251
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,800
You forgot it.

252
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,200
And you'll still be blaming others.

253
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,280
I think you should leave.

254
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,520
This is my room. You should leave.

255
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,600
I mean

256
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,840
Just go back to Bangkok.

257
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,360
How dare you chasing me?

258
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
You'll know who am I.

259
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,160
It doesn't matter.

260
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,400
You must go,

261
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,000
before you can't go.

262
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,480
What are talking about?

263
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,320
I'm your creditor.

264
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,280
And you're my debtor.

265
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,160
If you want me to go back,

266
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
Just pay it.

267
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,880
It's ridiculous.

268
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,160
So, will you join me in investing?

269
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,120
This stock is going up.

270
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,640
I think that's good.

271
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,600
I'm interesting.

272
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,800
If it works as you said.

273
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,840
It's already works!

274
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,280
I'll take my head as a guarantee.

275
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,400
So, how much money do I have to invest to make it worthwhile?

276
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,640
About ten million baht.

277
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,400
What about my profit?

278
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,920
I'll speculate stocks at least

279
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,160
Five million baht.

280
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,000
It's true.

281
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,840
I've insider.

282
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,040
Okay

283
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,880
Okay means okay, right?

284
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,640
Okay

285
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,600
But give me a time.

286
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,880
Alright.

287
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,320
Give you a time.

288
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,280
It's alright.

289
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,040
That's mean you'll come again, right?

290
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,000
So, see you later.

291
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,720
Okay, see you.

292
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,040
Come on.

293
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,240
Sun! What's up!

294
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,400
I'm fine now.

295
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,640
I'm just sick that the signal is hard to find.

296
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,520
If you're fine, it's okay.

297
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,160
Hurry back, friends miss you.

298
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,640
Look,

299
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,680
Ahing

300
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:44,880
Ahing

301
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:45,840
Sun's here.

302
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,160
What's up! Did you get some money?

303
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,640
Don't worry about me.

304
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,480
How about you?

305
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,320
Can you control your new debtor?

306
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,880
Shut up.

307
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,960
Did you know? Mangkorn looks like a cat.

308
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,040
Meow~

309
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,640
What breed of cat?

310
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,880
Scottish Fold?

311
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,000
See? Your cat is coming.

312
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,920
I'll continue practicing. See you.

313
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,880
Who is he going to fight with?

314
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,560
Your father just opened a fake boxing camp.

315
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,520
F*cking mouth.

316
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,640
I'm sorry. I'm joking.

317
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,160
I understand. That's fine.

318
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,480
Forget it.

319
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,240
He upset.

320
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,640
See you.

321
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,680
Ashing

322
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,320
Let me ask you,

323
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,680
What's about you and Mangkorn?

324
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Why are you avoiding each other?

325
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,880
I'll go now.

326
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,880
What??

327
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,760
Is this really not a boxing camp?

328
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,800
Huh?

329
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,440
Yep

330
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,120
That's mean...

331
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,280
He always practice alone?

332
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,400
Right?

333
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,600
Why you ask a lot?

334
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,320
Come, I'll take it.

335
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:05,800
Thanks.

336
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,360
I'll be right back.

337
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,400
When you feel comfortable, then come back later.

338
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,520
It's nothing. I really miss father.

339
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,360
Nemo!

340
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,000
You just come, why you leave now?

341
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,960
P'Talay!

342
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,560
You've grown up a lot.

343
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,200
Did you graduate yet?

344
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,920
It's last year now.

345
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,840
Why you leave early? You haven't been fishing for squid with me.

346
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,200
I'm not leave.

347
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,040
I just go to Lek island to see my father.

348
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,440
Ah~ I'll wait here.

349
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,880
Let's fishing for squid later.

350
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,240
Deal!

351
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,600
Will you go now?

352
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,720
Yes

353
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,880
See you.

354
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,280
Bye-bye.

355
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,640
Did your brother fight with his boyfriend again?

356
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,840
Maybe?

357
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,800
Let me bring him to the sea?

358
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,960
Do you have time to do that?

359
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,560
Yes, I've so much time.

360
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,080
If you have much time,

361
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,680
I'd go to work.

362
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,720
But I'm your friend.

363
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,600
You just tell to another staffs.

364
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,880
Are you not my staffs?

365
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,640
What the heck?

366
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,840
Fine.

367
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,400
Who's that?

368
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,000
His face isn't familiar.

369
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,920
A stranger.

370
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,280
A stranger?

371
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,040
You!

372
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,760
Do you know that man?

373
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,520
Nemo?

374
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,560
He is my close friend.

375
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,400
Do you know him?

376
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:30,880
Yes

377
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,480
What are you two?

378
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,800
Boyfriend?

379
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,280
No! Just a friend.

380
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,760
Ah~

381
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,240
My name is Talay.

382
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,160
I'm Sun.

383
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,720
But how do you know Nemo?

384
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,120
You just said

385
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,920
you know about Nemo's brother?

386
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,520
Yes

387
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,240
What's your business?

388
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,600
[hutch]

389
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,920
[hutch]

390
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,000
I want to know who talking about me.

391
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,760
It's not funny.

392
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,120
Just go and get chili fish sauce.

393
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:52,960
Yes, sir.

394
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,600
Sorry.

395
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,960
I guess someone talking about me.

396
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,240
Isn't it?

397
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,680
Why you don't believe me?

398
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,120
I didn't say anything.

399
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,080
Why you buy food for me?

400
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,800
We just each others.

401
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,720
Can I ask you something?

402
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,480
Does your friend have any possessions?

403
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,360
My friend?

404
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,320
Arthid?

405
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,560
Are you asking directly like this?

406
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,160
Yes.

407
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,800
Okay, I'll tell you.

408
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,280
He has a treasure that he's very cherished.

409
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,400
Are you curious?

410
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,000
Yes!

411
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,840
I'll take you to see.

412
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,560
Are you hurry?

413
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,560
Of course.

414
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,280
Wait.

415
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,720
Do you know where is it?

416
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,760
No, I'll follow you.

417
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,520
Okay, let's go.

418
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,760
Why are you staring me?

419
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,000
We can have a good talk.

420
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,320
You're weird.

421
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,960
Sometime good, sometime bad. Who's going to guess your heart, right?

422
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,560
I know. That's how hard you train,

423
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
Who will you compete with?

424
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,800
Ah~ I got it.

425
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,760
None of your business.

426
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,360
Actually, you should talk to your father.

427
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,720
You got everything, except your competitor.

428
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,960
None of your business.

429
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,040
Can you only said that?

430
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,520
What do you want me to do?

431
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,160
Did you see my father?

432
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,280
He works everyday.

433
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,920
You can try to ask him

434
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,440
if he's ever been interested in me or not.

435
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,600
Don't you think I've never ask him?

436
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,720
I done all!!

437
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,640
He's only interesting in his business.

438
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,120
Do you want a competitor?

439
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,840
Stupid question again.

440
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,920
I train it hard, that's mean I want a competitor.

441
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,520
Good

442
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
Why? Will you find someone for me?

443
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,440
No

444
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,800
But I'll be your competitor.

445
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,960
Can you boxing?

446
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,360
You just teach me.

447
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,560
No

448
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,160
Maybe

449
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,960
Doing something that you like,

450
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,320
at least,

451
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,640
it might be happy.

452
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,520
If you like,

453
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,840
Just go for it.

454
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,520
Are we arrive?

455
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,760
Yep

456
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,760
Where is his treasure?

457
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,679
Calm down, are you hurry?

458
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,920
Of course!

459
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,000
Usually my friends come to see the sunset here.

460
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,040
But he won't come today.

461
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:07,840
Huh?

462
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,920
Why you bring me here?

463
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,960
Are you kidding me?

464
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,400
I don't know who are you.

465
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,760
You suddenly asked me about his treasure,

466
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,440
Should I trust you?

467
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,560
We have to get to know each other first.

468
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,520
Take me to hotel now!

469
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:30,840
No

470
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,840
Until you tell me who are you.

471
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,920
What are you with Arthid.

472
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,360
And why you ask about his treasure?

473
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,160
Arthid?

474
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,480
What are you doing here?

475
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,600
You too.

476
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,800
Why don't you go down and help uncle at the beach?

477
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,160
Don't chase me.

478
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,040
I'll go soon.

479
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,520
It's getting dark, so hurry back.

480
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,120
From here, I took 15 minutes to there.

481
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,800
It's not a half hour by walking.

482
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,200
Just a moment. I'll go.

483
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,880
Okay

484
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,600
Alright, I'm going.

485
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,320
Hey! Wait!

486
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,200
You leave me?

487
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,240
D*mn it.

488
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,080
Just go back.

489
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,280
Are you crazy?

490
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,960
Your friend just leave me.

491
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,800
How can I go back?

492
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,840
I mean...

493
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,680
Just go back to Bangkok.

494
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,960
You always said that.

495
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,600
You don't need to chase me, I'll go.

496
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,160
Or if you want me to go sooner,

497
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,400
Just pay my dad's ten million baht to me.

498
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,960
Why you smile?

499
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,040
Do you trust your dad?

500
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,440
Yes!

501
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,600
Why he lie to me?

502
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,440
So, can you tell me

503
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,560
who is a creditor,

504
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,520
who is a debtor?

505
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,360
Let me repeat that,

506
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,640
I'm a creditor.

507
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,560
And you're debtor.

508
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,480
So...

509
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,600
Sh*t!

510
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,440
Why don't you go back to bed?

511
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,840
You're so cruel.

512
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,560
Come on, why the battery gone now?

513
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,840
Can you pay the interest to us first?

514
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,880
Hey!!

515
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,600
Mek, who is this?!

516
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,000
I don't care who's father he is.

517
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,560
Can you care about Sun little bit?

518
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,160
Don't act like you're not professional.

519
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,000
Is this company can track debt ten million baht?

520
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,680
Ten million baht!!

521
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,680
You sign to accept the debt condition.

522
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,480
I'll continue to do my work.

523
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,320
It won't be a big deal.
