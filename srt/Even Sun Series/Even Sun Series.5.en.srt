1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
I can help you with just that.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,080
I hope there is no ghost here.

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,400
D*mn it!

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,760
What are you doing?

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,800
Hey!! What did you do?

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,640
If you want it,

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,240
You must stay here.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,840
Do you think I don't know you?

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,760
Huh?

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,160
Is this all your plan?

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,960
To make him know the truth.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,360
Do you come alone?

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,280
Yes

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,360
Where is Tai?

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,640
I don't know.

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,360
I thought he go to meet Moo Brother.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,720
So, where is he gone?

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,080
That's well we break up!

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,960
A stupid idiot boy like you.

20
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,680
If your dad and brother aren't rich.

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,680
Who want you?

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,120
Just speak to me nicely!

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,880
Don't refer to my family like this!

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,480
I'll speak!

25
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,319
The boat of little boss on the sea without little boss!

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,200
What?!

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,160
Hey!

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,520
You!

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,039
You and him are friends.

30
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,560
You must be on his side.

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,920
If it doesn't like what you think...

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:19,880
Hey!

33
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
But...

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,520
Where is Sun?

35
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,840
Oh yeah

36
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
I forgot him!

37
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,360
Don't be in a hurry to eat.

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,680
It will stuck in your throat.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,759
Here you are.

40
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,240
I'm starving.

41
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,400
Your friend is...

42
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,600
So cruel.

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,759
Drink some water first.

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,759
He must have teased you.

45
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,160
I have no idea.

46
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,960
No one has ever done this to me before.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,240
If I can escape from here.

48
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,800
I'll play 'em hard!

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,840
wait and see.

50
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,480
So, do you want to escape now?

51
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,960
You ran away here.

52
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,720
Hi

53
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,920
Where have you been for a few days?

54
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
What's wrong?

55
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,720
You can't get money back?

56
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,720
So, you can't to see boss?

57
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,680
Yes

58
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,800
Huh?

59
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,000
Did I hear something wrong?

60
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,840
You can't get money back?!

61
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,480
Is it right?...Nah~

62
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,280
You said you will be the number one debt collector.

63
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,120
What's that bag?

64
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,160
Hey!

65
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,200
Give it to me!

66
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,080
Why?

67
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,880
Is there any secret to me?

68
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,720
Huh?

69
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,560
Money?

70
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,400
D*mn!

71
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,040
So many!

72
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,440
Who's money?

73
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,920
Debtor

74
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,640
Debtor?

75
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,800
Who is debtor?

76
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,160
I already get money from all of your debtors.

77
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,240
If there will be left...

78
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,080
Maybe...

79
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,200
Mangkorn's father

80
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,040
Why are you doing this?

81
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,680
If you have a chance to judge a person's life

82
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,800
Will you choose from your feeling,

83
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,720
Or your duty?

84
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,560
I just think...

85
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,440
What's the relationship made out of?

86
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,400
The good moments..

87
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,200
Are too short?

88
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,159
You mean....

89
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,559
Yes

90
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,679
Here you are.

91
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,400
Don't want it?

92
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,560
No, I want.

93
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,560
You have everything,

94
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,320
Except your competitor.

95
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,720
What do you want me to do?

96
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,600
Don't you think I've never ask him?

97
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,120
I done all!!

98
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,880
If you like,

99
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,880
Hit

100
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,920
Ouch!!

101
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,000
Hey!

102
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,240
Hey!

103
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,200
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,200
Are you hurt?

105
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,160
Give me some water.

106
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,640
Drink a lot.

107
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,560
That's right.

108
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,680
Tai

109
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,920
The relationship...

110
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,760
It was not created by only time.

111
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,160
It's also made up of good feelings.

112
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,000
Thank you

113
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,800
What's happen?

114
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,080
Are you guys okay?

115
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,520
I'm so sorry.

116
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,120
It's because of me.

117
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,720
Don't think too much.

118
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,080
Arthid

119
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,720
I'll go back to work.

120
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,320
There are so many customers today.

121
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,280
Okay

122
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,040
See you.

123
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,360
Hey!

124
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,680
But...

125
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,200
How about that guy?

126
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,720
oh yeah

127
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,080
I forgot him!

128
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,640
Let's go

129
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,560
Let's go!

130
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,400
go!

131
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,640
What the heck on you?!

132
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,000
Get up and go to work now.

133
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,920
What?!

134
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,960
Why am I here?

135
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,360
If I can escape from here.

136
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,960
I'll play 'em hard!

137
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,240
wait and see

138
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,680
So, do you want to escape now?

139
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,040
Can you help me escape from here?

140
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,200
Is it right?

141
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,640
Of course!

142
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,200
That's a piece of cake.

143
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,400
Let's go!

144
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Calm down~

145
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,320
Just eat first.

146
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,080
Don't be in a hurry.

147
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,440
Arthid still not come back.

148
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,520
But I want to go back now.

149
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,560
Just eat first.

150
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,000
Why am I so stupid??

151
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,000
Do you really think

152
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,080
my friend will help you?

153
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,440
You guys!

154
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,840
are con man!!

155
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,120
How dare you say that?

156
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,600
Who actually are con man?

157
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,680
Let me go!!

158
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,720
If not,

159
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,480
I will call the police to and arrest you!

160
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,200
Hey!

161
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,360
How dare you do this?!

162
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,480
Let me see

163
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,680
That you will still be able to escape

164
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,160
Here!

165
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,240
Now change your clothes.

166
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,040
Change my clothes??

167
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,520
Why?

168
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,360
Huh?

169
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
To work

170
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
How can I change my clothes?

171
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,960
You want me to change?

172
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,360
Like this??

173
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,800
Should I wear clothes like this?

174
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,760
How can I change my clothes?

175
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,400
Unlock the key first.

176
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,480
Done

177
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,720
Okay

178
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
Look better

179
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,920
Right?

180
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,720
I think so.

181
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,320
Look better for work now.

182
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,040
Work?

183
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,600
What's work?

184
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,680
Just work.

185
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,800
If you want to work,

186
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,760
You just do it alone.

187
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,320
I won't run away.

188
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,280
you still don't know your situation?

189
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,240
Nah

190
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,280
As a debtor,

191
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,880
You have to work to pay off the debt.

192
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,080
Walk quickly!

193
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,560
Quickly!

194
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,440
Boss, where are you going?

195
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,520
I bring a new staff to help your work.

196
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,640
Sit down

197
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,120
I said sit down.

198
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,000
You can go to work somewhere else first.

199
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,680
Alright

200
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,960
I will done it here.

201
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,200
Look

202
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,400
I said look.

203
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,960
How to choose coconut?

204
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,160
Choose a coconut that has no blemishes and cracks.

205
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,360
The islanders had to take them to the hotel.

206
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,160
Do you understand?

207
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,600
Do I have to do it?

208
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,880
I told you to go back at the first time,

209
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,240
But you are stubborn.

210
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,320
Go back

211
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,080
Go back to Bangkok.

212
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,760
You should go back to Bangkok tomorrow.

213
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,400
You should go,

214
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,160
Before you can't go.

215
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,599
Just do it.

216
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,000
*sigh*

217
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,760
Hurry up.

218
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,000
Do you see me as a monkey?

219
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,120
I hate your face.

220
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,880
So thirsty.

221
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,880
You!

222
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,040
I'm thirsty.

223
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,760
I said I'm thirsty!

224
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,600
Give me some water.

225
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,040
I done all works.

226
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
Can you find some water for me?

227
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,920
I haven't had a drink yet.

228
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
Here you are.

229
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
Give me closer.

230
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,040
Oh!

231
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,840
Delicious!

232
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,760
It smells fresher than the coconut water sold in Bangkok.

233
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,720
Absolutely!

234
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,320
That which is in its place,

235
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,760
It must be better anyway.

236
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,080
What are you talking about?

237
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,040
Are you done here?

238
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,640
We have to go on.

239
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,280
Huh?

240
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:28,840
To where?

241
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,040
I just finished here.

242
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,360
Let me take some rest.

243
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,120
I have no more energy now.

244
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,200
Get up

245
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,280
Get up!

246
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,640
Do you still escape?

247
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,360
You can't escape me anyway.

248
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,120
Please let me go.

249
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,440
I will find money to pay you back.

250
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,360
Do you think I will believe you?

251
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,440
Believe me,

252
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,600
My dad will come to help me.

253
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,720
Get up

254
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,440
I saw you been pretentious before,

255
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,760
Why are you now like a puppy?

256
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,160
You can blam me anything,

257
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,600
but please let me go.

258
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,360
And how much longer will I have to stay here?

259
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
Until your father come to pay the debt.

260
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,240
If he not coming?

261
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,400
You have to stay here

262
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,080
Until you work and pay off all your debts.

263
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,480
Are you insane?

264
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,520
So I don't have to live in here my whole life, huh?

265
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,640
Keep walking

266
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,280
Ouch!

267
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,400
Get on my motorcycle.

268
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,800
I can't sit.

269
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,000
It's been a long time you gone.

270
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,640
But it's good to get your money back.

271
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,200
I'm going to kick you out.

272
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,920
I'm sorry.

273
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:35,760
I just...

274
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,120
Hey!

275
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,920
Hey! Mangkorn!

276
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,480
You should go to pack your things and go home.

277
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
I got all my money.

278
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,400
But...

279
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
What?!

280
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,640
He paid all his father's debt.

281
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,440
Why he still stay here?

282
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,640
It's waste.

283
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,760
Boss

284
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,720
May I apply for jobs here?

285
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,200
Huh?

286
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,760
The debt collector?

287
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,360
No! It's full!

288
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,040
I mean...

289
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,120
I want to be a boxer.

290
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,400
You known that

291
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,360
Here is not a real boxing camp.

292
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,040
I don't accept that.

293
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,960
Father

294
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,600
What?!

295
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,040
You known that too,

296
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,920
Why I open this boxing camp?

297
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Because I want to set up cover my real business.

298
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,240
Just set up.

299
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,200
Father

300
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,240
I want to boxing.

301
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,120
I want a boxing competitor.

302
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,960
A boxing competitor?

303
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,960
This!!

304
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,480
I told you several times.

305
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,680
You already know that,

306
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,840
Oh my...

307
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,000
This stage you need, I built it for you.

308
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,920
You're going to kick or punch whatever's up to you.

309
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,600
But remember that,

310
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,320
Remember again.

311
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,480
There is no competition here!

312
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,440
I don't understand.

313
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,960
How risk about my job,

314
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,280
You already know that.

315
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,640
If the police know it,

316
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,400
And they come,

317
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,280
We will die all.

318
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,360
Absolutely!

319
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,320
Informal debts are illegal.

320
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,440
But boxing camp,

321
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,960
It's legal!

322
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,360
Shut your mouth!

323
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,080
You never understand me.

324
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,760
I want a boxing competition.

325
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,680
I want to boxing.

326
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,800
I want a friend who understand me.

327
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,160
But you never try to understand me.

328
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,440
Your everyday is only money.

329
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,480
Money!

330
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,520
Cool down

331
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,640
You always think money is better than me.

332
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,160
I hate you!!

333
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,720
Cool down

334
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,360
Mangkorn

335
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,320
Yes?

336
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,120
Pack your things now.

337
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,240
And leave here.

338
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,600
Father!!

339
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,920
What did you bring me here for?

340
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,400
I'm tired of dying already.

341
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,160
And sleepy.

342
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,600
I worked all day and still haven't taken a break.

343
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,280
Are you tired now?

344
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,680
Yes!

345
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,520
I'm tired.

346
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,880
What a question.

347
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,200
Don't you think I'm not tired?

348
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,000
You tired?

349
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,200
There are tens of millions baht of money to lend to others.

350
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,120
You can live

351
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,200
without working.

352
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,240
Because you have thinking like this.

353
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,680
Some people have a hard time earning money.

354
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,680
They just want their family to live happily.

355
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,360
But in the end,

356
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,360
they had to die because of a lie

357
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,320
of best friend.

358
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,480
In the end,

359
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,680
And finally there was nothing left.

360
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,120
Even life.

361
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,800
What are you talking about?

362
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,880
I don't get it.

363
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,680
You will understand what I said in one day.

364
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,840
Should we go back now?

365
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,120
Just come and wait to see the sunset?

366
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,320
Act on selfish impulse.

367
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,240
Do you think you will run away from me?

368
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,000
Big boy!

369
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:08,840
Hey!

370
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,280
What are you doing?

371
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,600
Ouch!

372
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,520
Um...

373
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,640
Um...I suddenly stomachache.

374
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,440
So why you doing here?

375
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,160
I..

376
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,280
I find the toilet.

377
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,960
I don't know that place...

378
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,760
or wherever I can go.

379
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,120
So I just come here.

380
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,200
Are you crazy?

381
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,240
Go back!

382
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,440
Can I go back to Bangkok now?

383
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,040
I mean go back to that house.

384
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,840
Release me.

385
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,080
Ask me well first.

386
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,120
Please release me~

387
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,240
I worked all day.

388
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,920
Since this noon.

389
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,200
Fine

390
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,480
Happy now?

391
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,440
Go back home.

392
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,920
Wait...

393
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,080
Will you sleep here?

394
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,960
Yes,

395
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,120
why?

396
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,400
But this is my house.

397
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,960
It's my house.

398
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,560
Yes...

399
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,880
Yes...yes!

400
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,320
But I mean...

401
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,320
It's my private place.

402
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,000
It's my private time.

403
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,880
Do you know?

404
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,640
But you are my debtor.

405
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,120
You like this word, right?

406
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,520
It's go far!

407
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,280
That's my dad who are the debtor.

408
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Not me!

409
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,920
Um...

410
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,360
Do you get inside by yourself,

411
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,360
or should I carry you?

412
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,720
You are barbaric.

413
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
You are very barbaric.

414
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
You are the most barbaric!!

415
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,520
Where do you going?

416
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,720
Wait for me.

417
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,360
Let's go to sleep.

418
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,520
Quickly

419
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,920
Ouch! It's hurt.

420
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,080
Come in

421
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,880
I'll go then.

422
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,840
It's so late night.

423
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,680
Why you don't go tomorrow?

424
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,160
I should go now is better.

425
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,840
If your father see me,

426
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,200
he will be angry again.

427
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,880
What's about competition?

428
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,080
Nah

429
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,560
You should listen to your father.

430
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,360
I don't want to be a trouble maker.

431
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,920
Will you do that?

432
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,520
Fine!

433
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,040
You come with me.

434
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,720
What are you doing?

435
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,080
Why are you doing this?

436
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,240
You have to compete with me right now.

437
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,040
Ashing

438
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,520
You told me that,

439
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,680
If you won me,

440
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,960
You can ask anything from me.

441
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,400
But at first,

442
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,720
You have to compete with me.

443
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,960
Please don't do like this.

444
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,160
But if I won you,

445
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,560
I will ask anything from you.

446
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,480
And you have to win me tho.

447
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,040
But...

448
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,480
What?!

449
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,160
You fight

450
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,880
You should fight to me!

451
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,400
No

452
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,640
I won't.

453
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,240
Fight!

454
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,240
You fight me!

455
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,400
No!

456
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,760
I won't fight with you!

457
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,320
Why?!

458
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:13,960
You fight me!

459
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,159
I want to win fair.

460
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,159
Not like this.

461
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,280
What are you doing for?

462
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,679
For yourelf

463
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,120
If you fight,

464
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,679
I will fight with you.

465
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,120
I don't want you arguing with your father.

466
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,880
I will talk to him by myself.

467
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,679
You told me in one word

468
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,159
that you want to compete with me or not.

469
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,520
Yes!

470
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,639
I want to fight with you.

471
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:44,920
Good!

472
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
I will talk to my father.

473
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,159
Don't you scare your father?

474
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,400
Huh?

475
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,280
I ask you don't scare your father?

476
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,520

478
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,400
Ashing...

479
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,160
I mean...

480
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,440
I'm scare to have no partner.

481
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,520
That's it?

482
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,840
Yep

483
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,560

484
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,040
If I won you,

485
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,160
Don't forget to do as I tell you.

486
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,720
Okay?

487
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,440
Okay

488
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,240
You too.

489
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,400

00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,320
Help me please.

491
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,040
Talay, help me please.

492
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,920
No! It's not my business.

493
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,640
Don't touch me!

494
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,200
The work that you have to do today is

495
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,200
Collect these coconuts.

496
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,120
Heyyyyy!!

497
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,200
Bad money!

498
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,680
Why are you doing this to my son?

499
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,000
I'm going to report to the police.

500
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,520
How dare!

501
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,440
I will go back to Bangkok with P'Nai.

502
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,520
So I come to let you know first.

503
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,600
Both of us know everything about you now.

504
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,480
Yeah!!!!
