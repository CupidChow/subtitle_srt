00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,143
Stand here for a moment please.

198
00:09:49,143 --> 00:09:50,482
Just a moment, I'll come soon.

199
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:51,458
Just a moment.

200
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:52,640
Sir

201
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,272
Ohhh

202
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:54,182
Sir

203
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:57,271
Sir

204
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:58,577
It just... ummm.

205
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:00,511
I would mind you

206
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:01,619
Just a moment

207
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:02,364
That…

208
00:10:02,364 --> 00:10:03,968
I want you to be a model for taking picture

209
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:05,109
to post on a page.

210
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:06,580
Can I take your photo?

211
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,104
Yeah, you can

212
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:09,278
Let’s go.

213
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:10,637
That’s great Sir.

214
00:10:10,637 --> 00:10:11,943
Over here

215
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:13,790
This way

216
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,931
This corner looks good.

217
00:10:16,931 --> 00:10:18,290
It's good to change here.

218
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:19,400
Fine

219
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:21,409
Ah…

220
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:24,023
Can you move towards each other a little?

221
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,467
Yes

222
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:29,438
A little bit closer

223
00:10:31,617 --> 00:10:32,253
Ah

224
00:10:32,253 --> 00:10:33,659
A little

225
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:34,470
Aha

226
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,135
Ahhh

227
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,560
Fantastic!!!

228
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,338
Let’s do it!

229
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:39,173
123

230
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:40,135
OK

231
00:10:40,135 --> 00:10:42,286
123

232
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:43,427
Uh

233
00:10:46,168 --> 00:10:47,442
Well...

234
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:50,566
Sir, with the blue shirt. Could you please smile a little?

235
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,278
Now it's like

236
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:52,717
fought with boyfriend.

237
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:53,470
hahaha

238
00:10:53,965 --> 00:10:55,377
hahaha

239
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:57,484
Uh

240
00:10:57,484 --> 00:10:57,984
um

241
00:10:57,984 --> 00:10:58,762
It's okay.

242
00:10:58,762 --> 00:10:59,606
Like that. It's okay.

243
00:10:59,606 --> 00:11:00,351
Right

244
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,478
Ok Jam, it's okay.

245
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:05,337
The photo app can help.

246
00:11:05,337 --> 00:11:07,557
Just pull the corners of his mouth.

247
00:11:07,557 --> 00:11:08,830
OK

248
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,830
123

249
00:11:11,984 --> 00:11:13,805
Cool!

250
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:14,649
Thank you so much.

251
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,682
Sorry to disturb your time.

252
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:17,955
Thanks

253
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:19,063
Thank you so much.

254
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:19,563
hahaha

255
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:20,836
A million baht is not so far from me.Bottom of Form

256
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:22,209
hahaha

257
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:23,232
Hey!!!

258
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:25,472
Wowww

259
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:27,537
The waves have come.

260
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:28,943
Waited for a long time.

261
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:30,316
Finally

262
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:37,960
Ah

263
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:39,826
wave

264
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:42,960
came just in time.

265
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,116
take pictures of the waves

266
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:46,059
Right here

267
00:11:47,546 --> 00:11:48,159
But

268
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,201
I already took it.

269
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:52,528
Haven't taken a picture there yet.

270
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:16,257
Hello

271
00:12:18,173 --> 00:12:19,829
I guess I forgot the key.

272
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:23,339
I'm sorry,

273
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:25,622
Well…

274
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:27,245
Here we…

275
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:31,116
also lost our spare key as well.

276
00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:32,191
or

277
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:34,441
Tonight, you can sleep outside.

278
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:35,318
Noway!

279
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:37,366
Or maybe

280
00:12:37,366 --> 00:12:38,724
You sleep together

281
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,163
with him.

282
00:12:40,824 --> 00:12:42,052
Sorry

283
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:46,324
Why am I still so unlucky?

284
00:12:46,951 --> 00:12:48,673
I heard that one.

285
00:13:01,486 --> 00:13:02,395
Hey you!

286
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:05,618
This is my stuff. You can use it at your convenience.

287
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,627
Don't be considerate.

288
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:07,999
wait

289
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:08,678
I

290
00:13:08,678 --> 00:13:10,150
go take a shower first.

291
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:49,306
(humming)

292
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,199
Ho!

293
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,064
Hey!

294
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,222
WOW! Your body was fit.

295
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:03,680
go to fitness center often

296
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:04,920
right?

297
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,507
Give me a towel.

298
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:27,091
Oh, I thought you asking for hand.

299
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:32,115
Well, that's it.

300
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,590
For you

301
00:14:35,572 --> 00:14:36,878
Or…

302
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,061
You’ll use mine

303
00:15:10,364 --> 00:15:12,526
You're handsome too.

304
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:14,434
But only one loss

305
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:15,891
Mischievous

306
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:19,155
Look, your face is like a statue.

307
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:26,294
Hey!

308
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:39,448
Oops! Uh-huh

309
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:42,802
You didn't drop my phone, it means you haven't slept yet, right?

310
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:43,830
Ah

311
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:45,028
Well

312
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:46,750
you

313
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:50,326
offer yourself to me and say you want to work there.

314
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:52,742
You told me you’re free.

315
00:15:52,742 --> 00:15:53,751
This new year, you're not going anywhere.

316
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:54,761
Didn't go to the countdown with anyone.

317
00:15:54,761 --> 00:15:55,572
Is that right?

318
00:15:57,484 --> 00:15:58,405
So why

319
00:15:58,405 --> 00:15:59,834
Why did you get these photos like this?

320
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:00,928
What’s that?

321
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:01,910
Huh???

322
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,255
Take photos from the same corner, same light.

323
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:04,561
Oh my gosh! Jesus christ

324
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,648
Can use less than 10 photos.

325
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:10,714
Or?

326
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:13,028
I know.

327
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,761
I’m good at thinking.

328
00:16:17,818 --> 00:16:19,818
Actually

329
00:16:19,818 --> 00:16:22,115
You want to work.

330
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,654
Or want to meet someone?

331
00:16:27,622 --> 00:16:29,372
Oh boss

332
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:31,358
I checked in at 2 p.m.

333
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,720
After taking a photo for just a moment, the light was gone.

334
00:16:37,494 --> 00:16:38,635
Pretending

335
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:40,000
Listen!

336
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:42,911
I'll tell you something.

337
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:46,860
Today is a holiday, right?

338
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,351
I can go to the countdown.

339
00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:50,516
I can go celebrate the new year.

340
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:51,908
But why?

341
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:52,851
And why?

342
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:54,455
Why am I here?

343
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:57,710
Because I sacrificed

344
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,000
I saw that you were working.

345
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,500
Hmm

346
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,619
I work.

347
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:03,680
So so

348
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,647
Same same

349
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:06,907
We’re same

350
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:08,480
Right?

351
00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:11,467
Thinking about it, I'm probably wrong.

352
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:13,995
Knowing anything is not as good as knowing it, right?

353
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:16,839
I probably better to take pictures by myself.

354
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:18,033
Probably got more as well.

355
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:20,000
Then why did you come?

356
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:20,783
Oh

357
00:17:20,783 --> 00:17:22,835
Hey!

358
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:23,811
If you're near me

359
00:17:24,504 --> 00:17:26,504
Prick it, prick it for sure.

360
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:27,004
Well!

361
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:29,835
If I go by myself, why would I hire you?

362
00:17:29,835 --> 00:17:30,520
Huh?

363
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:31,425
Oh!

364
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,484
Nerve pain, having a subordinate like this gives me a headache.

365
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:34,611
Hey

366
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:39,218
Oops!

367
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,613
Back off!

368
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,646
Move

369
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:47,693
Ah!

370
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:50,302
hahaha

371
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,071
Oh, I know the answers.

372
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,047
Very smart

373
00:17:53,047 --> 00:17:54,816
Actually, you didn't go to work.

374
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,716
You go find your couple.

375
00:17:56,716 --> 00:17:57,296
Right?

376
00:17:57,725 --> 00:17:58,998
Don't you dare tell me?

377
00:17:58,998 --> 00:17:59,498
Umm

378
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:00,896
So...

379
00:18:01,854 --> 00:18:04,098
You go find glassy white skin like..

380
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:04,796
No!

381
00:18:04,796 --> 00:18:06,598
How can you bring your couple?

382
00:18:06,598 --> 00:18:07,098
Um

383
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:08,140
No need

384
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:09,579
Don’t answer.

385
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:10,291
I know.

386
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:10,791
I know.

387
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,230
You don't have to make excuses.

388
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:13,272
But...

389
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:14,347
behind you

390
00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:16,743
Undressing?

391
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,560
Oh OH my godddd

392
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,074
Oh!

393
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:22,083
Ohhhh

394
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,711
annoying

395
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:25,225
Oh

396
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:26,300
Don’t gets jealous really easily.

397
00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:30,000
I already know

398
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,736
why did you get this photo like that?

399
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,108
Absolutely

400
00:18:33,273 --> 00:18:35,788
You were busy traveling with your boyfriend.

401
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:37,061
not working

402
00:18:38,612 --> 00:18:39,753
Can't be fooled.

403
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,169
By the way

404
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:44,335
Where’s Khwan?

405
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:45,509
I don’t see her.

406
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:48,467
Definitely!

407
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:48,967
I know

408
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:50,000
Really know

409
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,227
Smart again

410
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:51,906
Uh

411
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:56,520
You renting more rooms for Khwan to live in separately, right?

412
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,322
You'll be able to do something convenient, right?

413
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:01,511
hahaha

414
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:03,560
Good plan.

415
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,971
Wow, a white face like yours can't be trusted.

416
00:19:09,293 --> 00:19:09,859
But...

417
00:19:10,495 --> 00:19:12,165
Behind this...

418
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:15,321
It isn't allergic to you.

419
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:16,712
Oh!

420
00:19:18,363 --> 00:19:20,481
Ummmm

421
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:21,980
Oh my gosh!

422
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:23,286
offend

423
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,544
People like me really have no merit.

424
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:29,565
So

425
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,414
tomorrow

426
00:19:31,414 --> 00:19:34,768
You went to take pictures of the morning light. When the sun is rising, understand?

427
00:19:34,768 --> 00:19:38,155
The light will look not hard, but smooth & soft.

428
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:40,882
It will look romantic.

429
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:42,603
You know why?

430
00:19:42,603 --> 00:19:43,843
If I had a boyfriend

431
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:45,216
I'll take him there too.

432
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:47,664
Be able to see the atmosphere.

433
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:48,442
Like this

434
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,180
I know

435
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,362
I will punish you

436
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,536
tomorrow

437
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,225
You must take

438
00:19:57,149 --> 00:19:58,918
that white-robed man

439
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,257
go block shots too.

440
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:01,595
That’s it

441
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:04,216
Huh? Hey!

442
00:20:17,393 --> 00:20:18,752
By the way

443
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:21,497
My subordinates all have girlfriends & boyfriends.

444
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,339
go to the year-end countdown.

445
00:20:27,245 --> 00:20:28,948
There's only...

446
00:20:41,238 --> 00:20:42,071
What?

447
00:20:42,736 --> 00:20:46,109
Beautiful, perfect, smart, Fit & Healthy

448
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:47,052
Oh! All Good

449
00:20:47,052 --> 00:20:48,326
Can't find it anywhere.

450
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,500
I'm not disappointed.

451
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,146
Continue working

452
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:06,861
You

453
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:08,815
I don’t even know your name yet.

454
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:09,812
What's your name?

455
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:20,364
My name’s Golf.

456
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:25,093
I really like going to the mountains, waterfalls, and the sea.

457
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:27,556
My hobby

458
00:21:27,556 --> 00:21:28,895
like to take pictures

459
00:21:28,895 --> 00:21:31,193
So I became a location scout.

460
00:21:32,106 --> 00:21:33,647
But the main job

461
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:36,727
Is to go exploring and find delicious food.

462
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:38,661
Especially the fried food, I like it.

463
00:21:39,223 --> 00:21:41,587
Fried shrimp, fried pork

464
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:43,421
or fried squid

465
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:45,256
No matter how many dishes.

466
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:55,047
And you?

467
00:21:55,675 --> 00:21:59,032
Where do you like to travel? What are your hobbies?

468
00:21:59,032 --> 00:22:01,209
Which kind of food do you like?

469
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:01,854
Well

470
00:22:03,242 --> 00:22:04,601
Why would you want to know?

471
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,757
Talking a lot like never had friends before

472
00:22:17,572 --> 00:22:20,493
Hey, you're talking about not having any friends. How can you joke like this?

473
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:24,260
You know?

474
00:22:25,516 --> 00:22:26,945
Since I was a childhood

475
00:22:28,828 --> 00:22:30,432
Friends tease me all the time.

476
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,225
a weak face

477
00:22:34,373 --> 00:22:35,435
I understand

478
00:22:36,261 --> 00:22:38,261
that being born a boy

479
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,013
I was determined to study.

480
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:43,707
don't like having trouble with anyone.

481
00:22:45,227 --> 00:22:46,751
It's hard to get along with friends

482
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,000
Then

483
00:22:51,223 --> 00:22:52,500
I don't have any friends.

484
00:22:53,576 --> 00:22:56,749
Going to find of girl’s gang is difficult.

485
00:22:57,315 --> 00:22:59,710
But to get along with the men

486
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:02,940
I can’t

487
00:23:05,154 --> 00:23:06,024
You know

488
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:09,798
how uncomfortable it is?

489
00:23:20,463 --> 00:23:21,472
You

490
00:23:23,422 --> 00:23:23,965
Hey

491
00:23:24,295 --> 00:23:24,976
I’m

492
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:25,674
sorry

493
00:23:30,631 --> 00:23:32,717
hahaha

494
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,732
Hey!

495
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,831
You’re trying to pose handsomely all the time.

496
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:41,327
Are you into it?

497
00:23:42,153 --> 00:23:43,426
I’m just kidding.

498
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,558
I don't care

499
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:47,228
What will anyone think.

500
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,394
I just want my family

501
00:23:49,691 --> 00:23:51,162
understand what it is

502
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:53,724
and be proud of what I do

503
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:56,512
this makes me feel comfortable.

504
00:23:58,065 --> 00:23:58,743
Hey

505
00:23:58,908 --> 00:24:00,253
Don't be serious.

506
00:24:00,253 --> 00:24:01,120
I’m just kidding.

507
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:07,274
My acting skills can be used as well

508
00:24:11,438 --> 00:24:12,876
It's different from our family.

509
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,119
They never let me go out of the box.

510
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:20,522
Must be in order since childhood.

511
00:24:21,868 --> 00:24:23,974
Until now, I have never lived independently.

512
00:24:25,593 --> 00:24:27,802
Never been able to choose anything in my life.

513
00:24:31,714 --> 00:24:33,180
Only my father

514
00:24:33,345 --> 00:24:34,750
understand.

515
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:38,720
Never mind.

516
00:24:41,926 --> 00:24:43,066
You told me that I got into it

517
00:24:43,363 --> 00:24:44,603
Also, you are into it too.

518
00:24:50,981 --> 00:24:51,849
What?

519
00:24:54,394 --> 00:24:54,923
Well

520
00:24:55,683 --> 00:24:57,947
Things you carry with you before going to bed?

521
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:00,600
Don't you have any?

522
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,346
Yes, I have.

523
00:25:04,891 --> 00:25:07,601
Oh really?

524
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:09,600
What is it?

525
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:12,380
Secret

526
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:16,221
Hey, Please tell me.

527
00:25:16,618 --> 00:25:18,089
what are you addicted to before going to bed?

528
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:19,759
What?

529
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:21,218
Can you tell me?

530
00:25:24,225 --> 00:25:24,781
No

531
00:25:25,508 --> 00:25:26,197
way

532
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:31,602
Not telling?

533
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:33,833
So tonight

534
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:36,881
You definitely didn't sleep on the bed.

535
00:25:37,046 --> 00:25:37,711
A doll

536
00:25:40,817 --> 00:25:42,560
I have to hug, smell and kiss, just like you.

537
00:25:43,552 --> 00:25:44,825
Oh wow.

538
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,356
A young man with his rotten doll

539
00:25:51,868 --> 00:25:52,743
Aww!

540
00:25:58,196 --> 00:25:59,703
I don’t really know your name yet.

541
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:01,968
But your name

542
00:26:01,968 --> 00:26:03,968
should be…

543
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,505
Stone?

544
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,615
No, it's too hard.

545
00:26:09,838 --> 00:26:11,012
or

546
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:12,186
Iron?

547
00:26:14,235 --> 00:26:15,640
not that heavy.

548
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,014
Eh! Or maybe...

549
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,680
Better not think about it.

550
00:27:42,616 --> 00:27:44,523
This is a spare key, Sir.

551
00:27:44,523 --> 00:27:45,023
And then

552
00:27:45,023 --> 00:27:46,726
This is the shirt that you ordered.

553
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,245
Anyway, about last night I have to apologize again.

554
00:27:52,245 --> 00:27:54,245
If there's anything missing, you can always inform us.

555
00:27:55,137 --> 00:27:55,801
Thank you.

556
00:27:57,222 --> 00:27:59,850
Oh, what would you like for breakfast?

557
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,991
We have

558
00:28:00,991 --> 00:28:03,520
Beef rice bowl, Fried pork on rice, Fried shrimp on rice

559
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,355
And also karaage chicken rice.

560
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,144
Beef on rice please.

561
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:07,809
Sure

562
00:28:10,552 --> 00:28:12,387
And what will the customers inside eat?

563
00:28:12,387 --> 00:28:13,495
awake or not.

564
00:28:13,495 --> 00:28:14,504
Fried shrimp on rice.

565
00:28:23,955 --> 00:28:25,001
sleep together.

566
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,612
Good morning.

567
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:32,280
I'll go down and prepare food for you.

568
00:28:33,974 --> 00:28:35,201
So adorable.
