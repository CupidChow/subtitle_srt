1
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:45,147
You wake up so early.

2
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:06,000
Good atmosphere

3
00:01:06,654 --> 00:01:08,217

Did you buy it?

7
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:32,528

00:01:45,576 --> 00:01:46,985
Wow

11
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:49,043
a private place like this.

12
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:51,829
It's probably hard to buy.

13
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:52,717
But

14
00:01:52,717 --> 00:01:53,646

What are you looking for? Let’s eat.

19
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:16,673
You haven't brushed your teeth yet.

20
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:18,137

Come on

24
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:27,035
If we just brush our teeth The shrimp won’t be crispy.

25
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:28,835
There you go.

26
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,700

You have a good figure.

30
00:02:55,268 --> 00:02:56,892
I probably won't eat fried food right?

31
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,604

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,401

107
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,127

You can sit and take photos.

115
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:52,256
Let’s try a low angle like you can see the sky.

116
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:53,039
Let’s try.

117
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,234

00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:03,627
The chair is so high.

121
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,411
Just a moment

122
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:10,484

127
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:19,400
Alas!

128
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:21,931
It's so high. My legs can't reach it.

129
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:27,323

Like being happy to stay here.

139
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:10,348
Let’s try.

140
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:12,569
How can I? I don't know how to smile.

141
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:14,739

142
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,189
What a difficulty?

143
00:08:18,516 --> 00:08:19,607
You just

144
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:22,149
Lift the corners of your mouth like this.

145
00:08:24,341 --> 00:08:26,226
Yes. Keep it.

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,846

00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:39,807
You

148
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:41,174
Smile so weird.

149
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:42,728
Like a person who has never smiled before.

150
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:43,755

151
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:45,961

156
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:00,369

If I don’t have you, I probably wouldn't get as many beautiful pictures as this.

160
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:54,391
Today, I'll treat you to snacks and drinks.

161
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,600

00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:33,464
Why?

198
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:35,561
or you are

199
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,380
a teetotaller?

200
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:41,287
nope

201
00:11:41,745 --> 00:11:43,956
I think…

202
00:11:45,134 --> 00:11:46,628
You just bought this.

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,479
Will there be enough to eat?

204
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:53,689
Bingo

205
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:56,490
If you could eat all of this.

206
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,160
I can go out and buy more.

207
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,480
But just eating it isn't fun.

208
00:12:09,471 --> 00:12:10,981
Well

209
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:12,801
Let's play RPS.

210
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,609
Whoever loses, take 1 shot.

211
00:12:16,623 --> 00:12:17,454
OK

212
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:19,655
Ready

213
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:26,398
Let’s go.

214
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,320
This time I allow you, Next time I won’t give it to you.

215
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:42,000
This time you won’t give it to me?

216
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:44,540
Time for me

217
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:56,985
What was that?

218
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:57,925
Alas

219
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:13,182
Tipsy?

220
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:18,000
What?

221
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:19,418
Who?

222
00:13:20,748 --> 00:13:21,858
No one gets drunk.

223
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,564
Another 10 bottles is fine.

224
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:32,320
Oh

225
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,784
Stop it

226
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:39,503
You know

227
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,205
You Smashed

228
00:13:56,494 --> 00:13:57,437
And you..

229
00:13:58,074 --> 00:14:01,013
Do you usually travel alone like this?

230
00:14:02,205 --> 00:14:03,069
Nope

231
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:05,759
Er

232
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:10,334
My car broke down and had to wait 2 days for repairs to be completed.

233
00:14:11,276 --> 00:14:14,274
So I had to find a place to stay nearby.

234
00:14:15,743 --> 00:14:16,640
Really?

235
00:14:22,183 --> 00:14:22,856
But

236
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:27,055
if the liquor doesn't enter your mouth. You really strike a handsome pose.

237
00:14:27,776 --> 00:14:29,776
You won't smile. What kind of crazy person are you?

238
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:34,308
I'm really asking.

239
00:14:34,697 --> 00:14:35,641
Did you once have a boyfriend?

240
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:43,513
I used to have.

241
00:14:45,592 --> 00:14:46,344
Really?

242
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:50,384
What's your type?

243
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:52,113
My type?

244
00:14:53,332 --> 00:14:55,938
A person who is comfortable to live with.

245
00:14:57,019 --> 00:14:59,515
I want to see him first

246
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,377
when I wake up every morning.

247
00:15:04,925 --> 00:15:07,809
Take me as I am.

248
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:10,928
and

249
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,066
Be the one

250
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:16,591
who is good at smiling

251
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:20,642
like

252
00:15:20,864 --> 00:15:21,894
this

253
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:48,703
and

254
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:50,870
How many exes do you have?

255
00:15:52,727 --> 00:15:53,341
5

256
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:55,258
50?

257
00:16:00,496 --> 00:16:00,996
4

258
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:03,939
3

259
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:07,048
2

260
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,386
1

261
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:26,103
Hey.

262
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,667
Take a look.

263
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,751
Me, too.

264
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:56,423
Nice Fireworks.

265
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:10,773
Let's see.

266
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:19,842
Why didn't you invite me to Scout Lo today?

267
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,665
Last night I saw you very drunk. Want you to rest.

268
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:30,886
You look like you're addicted to rotten dolls too.

269
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:35,041
How do you know?

270
00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:38,743
So what?

271
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:46,366
What a heavy.

272
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:49,582
Rotten teddy bear

273
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,192
Where are you going?

274
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:57,390
Why don't we sleep together?

275
00:19:57,806 --> 00:20:00,000
I miss you. Haven't seen you for one day.

276
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:03,774
I'm not your rotten teddy bear.

277
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,525
Why not?

278
00:20:09,682 --> 00:20:11,097
Soft like this

279
00:20:12,787 --> 00:20:15,092
It’s mine!

280
00:20:18,362 --> 00:20:19,364
Give me a kiss.

281
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:25,545
You were very drunk.

282
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:26,604
Let me go.

283
00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:29,582
I feel delighted to see you.

284
00:20:30,857 --> 00:20:31,357
Hey

285
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,217
Let me go.

286
00:20:34,605 --> 00:20:35,247
Hey!

287
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,693
I can’t help missing you.

288
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:48,550
How do you know? It doesn't matter.

289
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:51,710
You'll be able to hug your rotten doll soon.

290
00:22:18,948 --> 00:22:19,448
You

291
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:21,001
Huh

292
00:22:23,163 --> 00:22:30,269
Thank you for making my year end. It's very happy.

293
00:22:36,283 --> 00:22:37,414
Thanks you too.

294
00:22:38,495 --> 00:22:40,187
came to help my work.

295
00:22:41,296 --> 00:22:43,570
You also be my friend to celebrate New Year's with me.

296
00:22:53,852 --> 00:22:58,213
If this new year you can make one wish.

297
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,608
What are you going to ask for?

298
00:23:02,603 --> 00:23:03,768
Well…

299
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:09,479
Please stop this time

300
00:23:10,147 --> 00:23:11,231
for a long time.

301
00:24:09,677 --> 00:24:13,642
Actually, I still have many locations. Where to go scouting.

302
00:24:14,418 --> 00:24:15,549
Shall we hit the road?
