00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the greenery

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is shining on my face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if it were a universe

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The life is a dream

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The life is a dream

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One day

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You are clear and mysterious

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the background

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are clear and mysterious

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like a background

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You are clear and mysterious

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Like a background

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What's wrong? Let me see. Where am I?

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't know.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Come on, let me do it for you.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Clean it up.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay, I understand.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Master, did you take the thing out?

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay, I'll go back to the police.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Do you know?

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If I didn't repair it with him at that time

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm afraid you will be in trouble.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Who said I'm not?

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I tell you, if I had been a little more

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I would have been in trouble.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You don't know?

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The broken shoes were very terrible.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If I continued to repair it with him

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I would have been in trouble.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Master is very powerful.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He will be fine.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm fine.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't worry, I will not be in trouble.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If it's done

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I will give you a lot of rewards.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You have to put your hands on it.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
100 yuan?

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Small thing.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
1000 yuan?

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Small thing.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What do you mean? Is it 10000 yuan?

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You are a big mouth, right?

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I tell you

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You are a big fan of me.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
10000 yuan, I will give you a lot of money.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Can you say something?

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Master Gu, since we can't talk about it

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Please ask for another name.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
No, no, no, Master.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Wait, wait.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't be so naughty.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You are going to run away.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If Master Gu comes out

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
what should we do?

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's good.

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You can explain to him

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
that Master Gu hit him.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If Master Gu hits him

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
he will be in trouble.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You want to come to me?

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I tell you

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Do you want me to kill your sister?

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Do you believe it?

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I will kill you

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
with this demon.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What demon?

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Master Gu

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You are wearing clothes.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't be so rude.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You should think about the price.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Please come in.

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is it.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Now let's begin.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This is to Corey wi d.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
PSY COOkay

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
You two should rest early.

92
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Thank you.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You look good in this.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I gave it to him by accident.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Take the dress off.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I took it off.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I took it off.

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I took it off.

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I didn't expect you to be a monk.

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You are a monster.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You are very good at it.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I am not.

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That's not true.

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's a monster.

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You are not the one who is dead.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Of course you are cruel.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But I am not like this to people.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I think you are not so soft to Lord Gu.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Do we really have to be together?

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Do you feel uncomfortable?

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's okay.

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I will take the dress and sleep outside.

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You don't have to sleep outside.

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Why?

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Lord Gu knows we are brothers and sisters.

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If he sees you sleeping outside,

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
he will be in trouble.

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's okay.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He can't do anything to me.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Then you can't do it.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's cold outside.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
How about this?

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You sleep here and I sleep there.

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You can play with water in the middle.

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Come on.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Lord.

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What is it called?

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Am I that old?

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's called Ge.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Ge.

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I will help you to remove the dress.

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Don't be so excited.

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He will come by himself.

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Lord.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Lord.

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Get up.

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Lord.

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Lord.

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Lord.

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Master.

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Master.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Master.

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Open the door.

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Wu Xin.

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Open the door.

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Wu Xin.

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Master, open the door.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Master, help me.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Wu Xin.

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Wu Xin.

151
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Help me.

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Why are you so mad at me?

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Are you that ugly?

154
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You are not ugly.

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You are so beautiful.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Master.

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Help me.

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I have a monster in me.

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Master.

160
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Did you see it wrong?

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He is not a monster.

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Did you see it wrong?

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You should save me and get rid of him.

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yuan Wu.

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This is not a good idea.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You can't see me.

167
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You...

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Master.

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Master.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Why are you so mad?

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You should get rid of him.

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Ten thousand.

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Ten thousand.

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Ten thousand.

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I will get rid of him.

176
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Master.

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Gu Xuan Wu.

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You bastard.

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Let me go.

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Gu Xuan Wu.

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You are a traitor.

182
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You are so evil.

183
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Bastard.

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Are you okay, Si Ling?

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Stop it.

186
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Am I that small?

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
No.

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I am fine.

189
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Master.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Go to sleep.

191
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Hello.

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Thank you, Master.

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
A little.

194
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Have you slept yet?

195
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yes, I have.

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Where are the two suits you give me?

197
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Why is it so useful?

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,120
It's not that disease.

199
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
It's my blood.

200
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Blood?

201
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,520
Your blood wants to be removed?

202
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,840
It's not that bad.

203
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,200
It's a bit useful.

204
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,320
Who are you?

205
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,440
Who am I?

206
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,160
Anyway,

207
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,160
I'm not a monk.

208
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,840
I'm just a monk to escape from life.

209
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,760
Think about it.

210
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,920
If I want to be a monk,

211
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,760
would I be more comfortable?

212
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,760
But...

213
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,800
What about you?

214
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,400
Who are you?

215
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,920
Me?

216
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,080
I'm just a blind girl.

217
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,240
Blind girl?

218
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,720
Xiaoxia,

219
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,760
you're not far from here.

220
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,560
You said you didn't want to go home.

221
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,680
Why?

222
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,160
No one in the family loves me.

223
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,120
Why should I stay there?

224
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,640
Is your family...

225
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,840
dead?

226
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,720
No.

227
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,280
My father is still alive.

228
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,520
My mother died five years ago.

229
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,400
My father married a stepmother.

230
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,280
She gave birth to a son.

231
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,040
He listened to everything.

232
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,840
Now,

233
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
I'm going to sell my stepmother

234
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,760
to an old brother and a wife.

235
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,360
She's already 62 years old.

236
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,200
She's half-naked, half-naked,

237
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,520
and full of yellow teeth.

238
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,720
I'm a good girl.

239
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,440
Why should I marry her?

240
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,160
Later,

241
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
I escaped from the field

242
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,640
for this.

243
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,760
I was starving.

244
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,760
I wouldn't have

245
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,440
a coffin for my whole life.

246
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,240
So,

247
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,560
you're not easy to get rid of.

248
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,480
What?

249
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,480
What's the point?

250
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,280
I can escape.

251
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,360
It's a good thing.

252
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,240
Besides,

253
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,360
there's a place to stay now.

254
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,680
And you can chat with me.

255
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,680
What's the good thing

256
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,440
to be happy about?

257
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,240
I'm sleepy.

258
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,480
Go to sleep.

259
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,960
Otherwise, it's too late.

260
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,440
Okay.

261
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,520
Go to sleep.

262
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,200
Applause

263
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,040
greasy

264
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,040
You can't rest assured of your daughter?

265
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,040
You've been in this for so many years.

266
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
It's not easy for you.

267
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,040
But you still have to leave.

268
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,040
You have your own life.

269
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,040
Why are you so stubborn?

270
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,040
Okay.

271
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Fine.

272
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
If you don't want to listen,

273
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
then you can stay.

274
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Stay until...

275
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,040
until you can't stay.

276
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Come on. Let's eat first.

277
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,040
Don't wait for him.

278
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Mr. Gu, I didn't wait for you.

279
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
Just eat.

280
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Master. Master.

281
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Are you still in the kitchen tonight?

282
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,040
Master, listen to me.

283
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
I...

284
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,040
You have to know this.

285
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Then you can stay.

286
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,040
No. I...

287
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Mr. Gu, you send someone to give me the document first.

288
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
I'll go through it.

289
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
Master.

290
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
Here. Eat.

291
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Where did you get it?

292
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
The kitchen is good.

293
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
Hurry up.

294
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
How is it?

295
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,040
I've found out the background of this contract.

296
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Really?

297
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,040
It's been eight or nine years.

298
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,040
This contract is related to a woman named Yue Qiluo.

299
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Yue Qiluo?

300
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,040
It's a good name.

301
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Is she dead or a ghost?

302
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
No. She's not a ghost.

303
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Then...

304
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,040
I don't know what it is.

305
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
Then who is Yue Qiluo?

306
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
Look.

307
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,040
This Yue Qiluo is a lonely and lonely woman.

308
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
She's a woman of the family.

309
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
She's a woman of the family.

310
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,040
But her family has no family.

311
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
They can't be together.

312
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,040
They're going to the forest to find the gold.

313
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,040
But after they find the gold,

314
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,040
Yue Qiluo is afraid of her and runs away.

315
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,040
After the day, Yue Qiluo and her servant disappeared.

316
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,040
The rumor spread that Duan's family killed two people for revenge.

317
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
They were looking for the third person.

318
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,040
They were 16 when she disappeared.

319
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
What's wrong?

320
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,040
I think Yue Qiluo is not a serious person.

321
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
Why?

322
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
She knows how to be nice to men.

323
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
She won't say it.

324
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Because they're together.

325
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,040
She's so timid.

326
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Why doesn't she stop her from fighting?

327
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,040
She's just staring at them.

328
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,040
And she's dead.

329
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,040
She's been home safely.

330
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
She's so ungrateful.

331
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
Yes. Ungrateful.

332
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,040
I'll take this ungrateful guy back to love in a few days.

333
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
I'll take you to the forest.

334
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
I'll take you to the forest.

335
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
I'll take you to the forest.

336
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,040
I'll take you to the forest.

337
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
I'll take you to the forest.

338
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
I'll take you to the forest.

339
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,040
I'll take you to the forest.

340
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
I'll take you to the forest.

341
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,040
I'll take you to the forest.

342
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
I'll take you to the forest.

343
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
I'll take you to the forest.

344
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
I'll take you to the forest.

345
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
I'll take you to the forest.

346
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,040
I'll take you to the forest.

347
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,040
I'll take you to the forest.

348
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,040
I'll take you to the forest.

349
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,040
I'll take you to the forest.

350
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,040
I'll take you to the forest.

351
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,040
Sir!

352
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Master, Master died last night.

353
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
Why?

354
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,960
Yes.

355
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,320
Master,

356
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,480
can you help me to think of a way?

357
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,400
I'm so bored.

358
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,080
I should have gotten the monster earlier.

359
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,520
I'm fine now.

360
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,880
Zili.

361
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,800
What's wrong?

362
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,360
The old man was sitting outside.

363
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,880
He didn't come out last night.

364
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,040
Who was he?

365
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,400
He was in a water tank.

366
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,840
He didn't see the old man in the morning.

367
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,920
He jumped into the water tank and left.

368
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,360
He got scared at first.

369
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,240
I thought you and Chong kop heard me.

370
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,280
Hope that General is right here.

371
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,080
I heard some of the sounds of thunder.

372
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,320
Hold on.

373
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,200
Remember this.

374
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,960
Remember it.

375
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,520
I can't.

376
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,920
We'll talk about that together.

377
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,560
Master,

378
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,560
With these two,

379
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,860
we should check if there's a certain enemy of the developing army.

380
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:52,660
Let's give it to the

381
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,560
Shanghai agree to fight

382
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,960
to find up the lives of the Vietnamese,

383
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,960
I'll go get him now.

384
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
You're going to get him now?

385
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
Then...

386
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Do you want me to go with you?

387
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
No one is following me this time.

388
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
I'll go by myself.

389
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
By yourself?

390
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Do you need me to prepare something for you?

391
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
Get me a horse.

392
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Okay.

393
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
Hurry up.

394
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,960
Get me a rope.

395
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
Hurry up.

396
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
Hurry up.

397
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
Hurry up.

398
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Hurry up.

399
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
I'll go get him.

400
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
Hurry up.

401
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Go.

402
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
You're a traitor.

403
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,960
I'll take the punishment and make you pay for it.

404
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
I don't know how you're going to deal with this.

405
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
You're going to kill me.

406
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Don't blame me for being impolite.

407
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,960
I'll kill you.

408
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
Who are you talking to?

409
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,960
Who am I?

410
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,960
Yuqing, I'm your partner, Sanlan.

411
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,960
Sanlan?

412
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,960
I promised to live with you.

413
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,960
Why did I get married?

414
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
But you're still alive.

415
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Where's the person?

416
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
Well, Master...

417
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
He's talking to you.

418
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,960
Where's he?

419
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,960
He's in the house.

420
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
He's holding a demon.

421
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
Holding a demon?

422
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,960
Then why did you come back?

423
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
He doesn't need my help.

424
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
I'm back.

425
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,960
He said he didn't want your help.

426
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
You didn't help him.

427
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,960
I'll go get him.

428
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Even if he doesn't want your help,

429
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
you should stay here.

430
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,960
What's the surprise if you come out?

431
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Go back with me.

432
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,960
What are you doing, Yu?

433
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
I don't know how to do magic.

434
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Why did you let me go back?

435
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,960
Don't you have a gun?

436
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Gun?

437
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
You're so useless.

438
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Come with me.

439
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
No, no.

440
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
Listen to me.

441
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,960
You didn't see that old man die.

442
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
He's so lazy.

443
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
He's like a head.

444
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
I didn't see him.

445
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
I didn't see him.

446
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,960
Come with me.

447
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
No, I'm not going.

448
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
I said I'm not going.

449
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,960
I'm not going.

450
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
Are you going?

451
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
No.

452
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
You called him master.

453
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,960
You called me a fairy, right?

454
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
Yes.

455
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
I'm his sister.

456
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
Right?

457
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Yes.

458
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,960
He's capable.

459
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
I'm not capable.

460
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
I'm different from him.

461
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,960
But I'm a little bit capable.

462
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
Listen to me.

463
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
If you don't go today,

464
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
I'll ask the big-hearted to go to the body.

465
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
At that time,

466
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
the monster in the house will not kill you.

467
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
The big-hearted will kill you first.

468
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Hurry up.

469
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
No, Yu.

470
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
Yu.

471
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Can I go?

472
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,960
You should stop your magic.

473
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Come on, let's go.

474
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
You're not lucky.

475
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,960
Or you think I'm not lucky?

476
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
No.

477
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,960
No.

478
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Choose your eye.

479
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
No.

480
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,960
The monster from the body is entering.

481
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,920
Where is the headband?

482
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,640
Here.

483
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,840
No.

484
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,920
Isn't that the headband?

485
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,240
What is this?

486
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,120
The demon.

487
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,760
It's a wooden shape.

488
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,160
Wood?

489
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,680
But the headband is real.

490
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,240
Isn't it big?

491
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,800
Why is it so small?

492
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
That's his figure.

493
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,840
After he took it out of the scene,

494
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,320
he appeared.

495
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,920
It's just a wooden shape.

496
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,120
Yes.

497
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,440
How can a wooden shape be a demon?

498
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,720
It's not a demon.

499
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,640
Someone lost his hair.

500
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,920
He became the body of energy.

501
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,080
Energy?

502
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,040
Body of energy?

503
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,320
What kind of child is that?

504
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,640
Who gave him the hair?

505
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,600
I don't know.

506
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,280
But the hair is on his body.

507
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,640
It's been a hundred years.

508
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,440
It's useless to know so much.

509
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Anyway, we know now

510
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,440
that he can't harm anyone anymore.

511
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,440
Yes.

512
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,320
Yes.

513
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,800
Mr. Gu.

514
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,880
The hair is broken.

515
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,760
You won't be punished, right?

516
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,320
No.

517
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,120
No.

518
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,760
Mr. Gu will never be punished.

519
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,560
Don't worry.

520
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,200
That's good.

521
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,560
Mr. Gu.

522
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,880
Please send someone

523
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,200
to find some dried fruit and lamb.

524
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,480
Okay. No problem.

525
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,240
Go.

526
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,160
Find some dried fruit and lamb.

527
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,680
Hurry up.

528
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,160
Yes.

529
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,200
Find some dried fruit and lamb.

530
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,880
You two go to the garden to wait for us.

531
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,520
It's not good to burn it later.

532
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,440
I'll go outside.

533
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,080
It's okay.

534
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,160
It'll be fine later.

535
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,520
Hurry up!

536
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:16,880
Sam.

537
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,880
Nebula.

538
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,640
I'm afraid that it'll break down.

539
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,920
It's useless to live a wear-out life.

540
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,360
Let me go.

541
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,760
No matter who you are, don't hurt him.

542
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,360
He's so pitiful. He's already guilty.

543
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,960
Who is he? Aren't you Yue Qiluo?

544
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,160
He's my Xiaojie. He's the one.

545
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,760
Who made you look like this?

546
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,760
Xiaojie likes to be old.

547
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,760
I secretly arranged them to meet each other.

548
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,960
But Master found out that I was going to beat him to death.

549
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
Xiaojie didn't want me to die.

550
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,760
I didn't want to die either.

551
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,960
My soul was on my head.

552
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,560
Then I put my head on the pillow.

553
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,360
Then I became my body.

554
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,360
Who gave you the right to do that?

555
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,360
I just want to be with Xiaojie. I don't want to kill anyone.

556
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,960
But I want to protect Xiaojie.

557
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,360
When he comes out, if I don't kill anyone,

558
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,960
my soul will soon be gone.

559
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,760
Xiao Lan, you can't stay here anymore.

560
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,160
Don't worry about anything else.

561
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,560
Soul-flying broken, one stroke of the chest.

562
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,360
How good it is.

563
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,560
Master. Master!

564
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,960
I'm really a good person.

565
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
You guys come with me.

566
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,160
You guys send me to hell.

567
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,560
Although you've done a lot of evil before,

568
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,160
you've killed innocent people.

569
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,560
But I should still read a book for you.

570
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,160
Come on. Eat more.

571
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,360
Yu Yang, eat more.

572
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,760
Master, come on. Let's drink.

573
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,160
Come on.

574
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,560
Master Gu, do you really want to move back to that house?

575
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,760
I definitely want to move back. Isn't this house a good place?

576
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,160
Besides, there are some weird monsters inside.

577
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,560
They don't let you clean it up.

578
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,760
But I think that house is still not clean.

579
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,360
What do you mean?

580
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,160
Because hundreds of years ago, that house was destroyed.

581
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,160
Isn't it the house you cleaned up?

582
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,160
That house is just a compensation.

583
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,560
It's not a government house.

584
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,760
If the government house is dead, it's not a good house.

585
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,960
How about this, Master Gu, you eat first.

586
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,760
I'll tell you after you finish eating.

587
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,960
Because this story is a bit heavy-tasting. I'm afraid you won't be able to bear it.

588
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,360
You've already made me feel sick.

589
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,760
I'm still a piece of shit.

590
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,560
Then I'll eat first.

591
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,960
Take it.

592
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,560
Thank you.

593
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,960
I'm Master Gu.

594
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
The first round of the game is not worth a million dollars.

595
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,960
The first round is not worth a million dollars.

596
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
The first round is not worth a million dollars.

597
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,960
The first round is not worth a million dollars.

598
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,960
The first round is not worth a million dollars.

599
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,960
The first round is not worth a million dollars.

600
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,960
The first round is not worth a million dollars.

601
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
The first round is not worth a million dollars.

602
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,960
The first round is not worth a million dollars.

603
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,960
The first round is not worth a million dollars.

604
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
The first round is not worth a million dollars.

605
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,960
The first round is not worth a million dollars.

606
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,960
The first round is not worth a million dollars.

607
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,960
The first round is not worth a million dollars.

608
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
The first round is not worth a million dollars.

609
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Then I'll pay the money.

610
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,960
The first round is not worth a million dollars.

611
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,960
The first round is not worth a million dollars.

612
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
I'll pay the money.

613
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Master Gu, you're being too modest.

614
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,960
What do you mean by being modest?

615
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,960
What are you doing?

616
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,960
I'll kill you.

617
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,960
Don't, don't, don't.

618
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
I was just kidding.

619
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,960
He's joking.

620
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,960
No, my money

621
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,760
is in my wife's house.

622
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,760
It's in her little palace.

623
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,160
How about I

624
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,560
get you a fish soup later?

625
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,960
I'll get you a wine and wine.

626
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,760
So you're joking with me.

627
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,160
You're so humorous.

628
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,160
So humorous.

629
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,560
So humorous.

630
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
I haven't spent a million yuan

631
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,760
on the house I bought.

632
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,760
I just want to

633
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
spend so much money on a magic flower.

634
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,760
Can I not be humorous?

635
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,560
Yuya,

636
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,360
keep it today.

637
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,360
I...

638
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,760
So,

639
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,160
this is the thing.

640
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,960
So,

641
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,760
do you call this thing

642
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,960
Yue Qiluo?

643
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,560
I'm not sure.

644
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
I thought so.

645
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
But I found out

646
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,160
that she's not Yue Qiluo.

647
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,960
Who?

648
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,960
You need to say

649
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,360
she's Yue Qiluo's maid.

650
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,760
No way.

651
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,160
She's a demon.

652
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,760
I don't know who she is.

653
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,160
But I know

654
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,760
they're close.

655
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,960
Even if she's dead,

656
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,760
I can't bear to see her

657
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,360
with you.

658
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,360
No.

659
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,360
This...

660
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,960
Is this maid

661
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,960
the one who took

662
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,560
the old Duan family?

663
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
It's written on the paper

664
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,960
that they're missing.

665
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
But in my opinion,

666
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,560
it must be Duan's.

667
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,560
Duan family thinks Yue Qiluo

668
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
killed her.

669
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
So they reported it.

670
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,560
They kept Yue Qiluo

671
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
in the coffin.

672
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,160
That time,

673
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,360
the Wen County

674
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
wasn't here yet.

675
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,360
The coffin was buried in the imperial chamber.

676
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,560
No one knew.

677
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,360
The maid saw it.

678
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
She wanted to save the lady.

679
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,720
So she

680
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,560
took the time

681
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,560
to wait for the time.

682
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,560
She waited

683
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,560
for more than 100 years.

684
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,960
After that,

685
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,160
the Duan family was destroyed.

686
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,360
After the Yue family made a mess,

687
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,160
they couldn't find anyone.

688
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,960
So they took the time to rest.

689
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,760
Then the Wen County

690
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,960
became more and more prosperous.

691
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,960
The place where the corpse was buried

692
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,760
was also destroyed.

693
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,360
There were houses and streets.

694
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,360
It became the most prosperous place in Wen County.

695
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,360
No, master.

696
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,360
Is the emperor

697
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,160
our family?

698
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
Mr. Gu is so smart.

699
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,360
Yes.

700
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,960
The emperor is your family.

701
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,760
And the maid was so stupid.

702
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
She was so stubborn.

703
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,160
When I wanted to take her away,

704
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,960
she wanted to save the lady

705
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
from the police.

706
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,160
No.

707
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,360
She was the only one

708
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,360
who didn't want to save the lady.

709
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,160
Why did she have to

710
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:18,960
be a friend?

711
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,160
They shouldn't be in a fight.

712
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:20,960
Yes.

713
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,360
I remember now.

714
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,160
No wonder she was so shameless.

715
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,760
She sold the house

716
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,960
as soon as she said she would sell it.

717
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,560
The little maid

718
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,560
sold the three big houses to me.

719
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,560
I thought

720
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
she was the one

721
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
who was bullied by me.

722
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,360
I didn't expect her to play with me.

723
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,560
I was so stupid

724
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,560
that I took the money.

725
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,760
I was so stupid.

726
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
I must have killed her.

727
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,360
Besides,

728
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,160
I was so stupid.

729
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,960
I lived for 20 or 30 years.

730
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,360
I never said that.

731
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,760
More than 100 years ago,

732
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,160
I had a bad relationship with her.

733
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
You two, wait for me.

734
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,560
Look.

735
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,760
I will take a winner tomorrow.

736
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,960
I will dig the water pipe and the underground tunnel.

737
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,360
I will give her all the vegetables and water purifier.

738
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,560
Where are you going?

739
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,360
We are tired.

740
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,560
We should go back to rest.

741
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:11,960
Master.

742
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,560
I have 50 people in my hometown.

743
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,160
If you don't have anything to do,

744
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
you can stay here with me.

745
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,560
I want to stay here for a long time.

746
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,360
Okay.

747
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,360
Thank you.

748
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,560
I beg you, little maid.

749
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,560
I beg you, little maid.

750
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:43,960
Wow.

751
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
Is this real?

752
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,160
Of course.

753
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,760
I have grown up.

754
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,160
I have never seen so many gold.

755
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,360
By the way,

756
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
take this.

757
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,160
Take it.

758
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,160
What are you doing?

759
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,160
I said

760
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
I will ask you to practice.

761
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,560
And I will help you make a lot of money.

762
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,960
This is your money.

763
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,560
Don't give it to me.

764
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,560
You should take it.

765
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,560
I just want you to keep it.

766
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,160
I don't want it.

767
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,760
Yu.

768
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,960
We can meet and catch the demon together.

769
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,560
Do you mean fate?

770
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,760
Yes.

771
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,560
You also said

772
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,160
you have nowhere to go, right?

773
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,760
How about this?

774
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,960
Before you find the place,

775
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,360
can you stay here

776
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,160
and do me a favor?

777
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,960
So,

778
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,560
help me to keep it.

779
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,360
I...

780
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,760
Think about it.

781
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,360
My money is made of demons.

782
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,360
I take ten gold bars every day

783
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,360
and catch demons everywhere.

784
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,960
If I lose it,

785
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,360
it will be cheaper to catch the demon.

786
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,560
But...

787
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,560
Why did you help me?

788
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,360
I...

789
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,360
I can't afford it.

790
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
Who wants you to pay for it?

791
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
You can make more money.

792
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,960
Such a big trouble.

793
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,560
We...

794
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,160
We have been living here.

795
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,960
What do you plan to do?

796
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,560
The money is in your pocket.

797
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,560
You can make it.

798
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,160
I want some water.

799
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,160
You can take a shower.

800
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,360
I...

801
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,160
I...

802
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,960
I...

803
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,560
I...

804
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,560
I...

805
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:44,960
I...

806
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:45,960
I...

807
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,160
I...

808
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,960
I...

809
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,560
I...

810
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,160
I...

811
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,760
I...

812
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,160
I...

813
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,760
I...

814
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,160
I...

815
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,760
I...

816
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:51,960
I...

817
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,560
I...

818
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:52,760
I...

819
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,160
I...

820
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:53,560
I...

821
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:53,760
I...

822
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,160
I...

823
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,560
I...

824
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:54,760
I...

825
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,160
I...

826
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,560
I...

827
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:55,760
I...

828
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,160
I...

829
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:56,560
I...

830
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,160
I...

831
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,560
I...

832
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:57,760
I...

833
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,160
I...

834
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,760
I...

835
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,160
I...

836
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,760
I...

837
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,160
I...

838
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,760
I...

839
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,160
I...

840
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:01,760
I...

841
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,160
I...

842
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,760
I...

843
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,160
I...

844
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,760
I...

845
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,160
I...

846
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,760
I...

847
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,160
I...

848
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:05,760
I...

849
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,160
I...

850
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,760
I...

851
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,440
I...

852
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,160
I...

853
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,160
If it's not for my son's revenge...

854
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,760
why would they exist?

855
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,560
You should shake hands.

856
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,660
Do not피 districts

857
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,660
Don't hurt him.

858
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,660
No matter who you are, don't hurt him.

859
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,660
He's so pitiful. He's already guilty.

860
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,660
Who is Yu Qilong?

861
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,660
Yu Qilong

862
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,660
Yu Qilong

863
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,660
Yu Qilong

864
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,660
Yu Yan

865
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,660
I seem to be out of my mind.

866
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,660
I don't know what to do.

867
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,660
What should I do?

868
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,660
I'm afraid you can't.

869
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,660
I'm afraid I can't.

870
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,660
Keep me company.

871
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,660
I'll do what I want to do.

872
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,660
Don't look at me.

873
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,660
I'm afraid I can't.

874
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,660
I'll do what I want to do.

875
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,660
Don't hurt him.

876
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,660
No, don't hurt him.

877
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,660
No, don't hurt him.

878
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,660
No, don't hurt him.

879
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,660
No, don't hurt him.

880
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:41,660
With this warm starlight, I've asked the flowers in the night

881
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:48,660
I've wandered all the way, but I still remember the hometown

882
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:55,660
The life is a legend, the corner of time

883
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:02,660
He closely watched people love and hate

884
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:09,660
Even though time has passed, although he has forgotten

885
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:17,660
I still remember the memories he left, the living that has been re-established

886
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:24,660
The life is a legend, the corner of time

887
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:31,660
He closely watched people love and hate

888
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:39,660
Even though time has passed, although he has forgotten

889
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:47,660
I still remember the memories he left, the living that has been re-established

890
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:58,660
The life is a legend, the corner of time

891
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:12,660
The life is a legend, the corner of time

892
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,660
My lovely little fox-tailed face

893
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:42,660
The life is a legend, the corner of time

894
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:50,660
Uncle Si, I must take you with me today

895
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:07,660
Uncle Si, I must take you with me today

896
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:15,660
Uncle Si, I must take you with me today

897
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:22,660
Uncle Si, I must take you with me today

898
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:29,660
Uncle Si, I must take you with me today
