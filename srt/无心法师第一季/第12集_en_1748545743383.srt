00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the greenery

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is shining on my face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if it were a universe

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The life is a dream

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The life is a dream

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One day

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You are clear and mysterious

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the background

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are clear and mysterious

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like a background

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The Love by 花花

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The Love by 花花

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The Love by 花花

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Love by 花花

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I heard you want to see me.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I just want to go out.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Go out?

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Do you want to deal with me?

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm just hungry.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I want to go out to find food.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I want that.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Jianing where did some food go?

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You so upset!

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Do you want to see Big Bro?

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Not yet.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why am I already eating?

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,280
I really want to eat at公待

44
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,500
You want to eat at since the immediately�

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Do you want to eat?

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,560
She slipped

47
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,000
She is really about to break the egg

48
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,640
I really am

49
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,400
I'll ask you

50
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,840
When do you send me out

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,980
You shouldn't

52
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,500
Things are better

53
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,620
You're quite brave

54
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,480
It's just full moon

55
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,200
Turned out

56
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,200
How can I find someone to take care of you?

57
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Your identity?

58
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,200
It's just a half-human, half-dead, nine-dead.

59
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,200
Your quietness is just to live a long life,

60
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
and not to be punished by the old demon.

61
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
You want to be angry all day long?

62
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
No way!

63
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
But if you let me go,

64
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
maybe we can be friends.

65
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,200
If you don't die,

66
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
I'll be able to get you out of here.

67
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
I want to eat the cooked one!

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Master Gu! Master Gu! Wake up!

69
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Master Gu! Master Gu!

70
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Master Gu!

71
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Master Gu!

72
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Master Gu!

73
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Master Gu!

74
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Master Gu!

75
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Master Gu!

76
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Master Gu! Wake up!

77
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Wake up!

78
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
I just...

79
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
994466, come.

80
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Let's go find him.

81
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
What are you doing?

82
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Is he your man?

83
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Do you hear me?

84
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
How did he tell you before he left?

85
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
If you really want to help him,

86
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,200
you can just stay here and be honest with him.

87
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Don't scare yourself.

88
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Who gave you this idea?

89
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Were those Taoists from the Qingyun Temple?

90
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
You're so stupid.

91
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Do you want to take revenge on me for this?

92
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
No one gave me the idea.

93
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,200
But I don't want to be punished by you.

94
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
I'll take it.

95
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
I'll take it.

96
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
I'll take it.

97
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
I'll take it.

98
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
I'll take it.

99
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
I'll take it.

100
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
I'll take it.

101
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
I'll take it.

102
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
I'll take it.

103
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
I can't be compared to Yueya.

104
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
I mean,

105
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,200
isn't he a good guy around you?

106
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Why don't you love him?

107
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
A man of the past.

108
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
He doesn't deserve it.

109
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
He's not as good as you.

110
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,200
I guess he can understand my loneliness.

111
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Even if I don't kill Yueya,

112
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
he will die.

113
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
By then,

114
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,200
you'll still be a star.

115
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
But I'm different.

116
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
I can accompany you forever.

117
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Until the end of the world,

118
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
I'll always be you.

119
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
Your absence will not kill me.

120
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,200
My soul will not disappear.

121
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
We're a team of heaven and earth.

122
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
We're destined to be together.

123
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Amitabha.

124
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Yueqi Luo, Yueqi Luo,

125
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,200
you've lived for hundreds of years.

126
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,200
You don't know what love is.

127
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Fine.

128
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,200
I'll let you know what love is.

129
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Take it.

130
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
No, no, no, no.

131
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
No, no, no.

132
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Hongzhuang, don't come back.

133
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Let's go.

134
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Amitabha.

135
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
Yueqi Luo,

136
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
this is what love is.

137
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Let's go.

138
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Why is she so good?

139
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Because I want to get her.

140
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
But she will only make you angry.

141
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Being able to anger me

142
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
is also her ability.

143
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
Except for her,

144
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,200
the mortal son of this world

145
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
is not worthy of making me happy.

146
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
She is not worthy of making me happy.

147
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
She makes me angry.

148
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Yueya,

149
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
are you

150
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
still worried about me?

151
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
You sent me off to the Buddha Buddha.

152
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
I also sent you off.

153
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
We're one.

154
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Go back early.

155
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Don't make a fool of me.

156
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Don't go anywhere.

157
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
I have to find a way out.

158
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Come in.

159
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Qi Luo,

160
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
this is the owner of the kitchen.

161
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Liu Yang came back.

162
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
He opened a photo studio here.

163
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Everyone said he was looking for it.

164
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
I brought it here today.

165
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
I'll take some for you.

166
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
I'm not in a mood to do that.

167
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Let her go.

168
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Qi Luo,

169
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
what's wrong?

170
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Can you not treat me as a little girl?

171
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
What's the point of making these useless things?

172
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Look at these jewelry and jewelry you gave me.

173
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Except for this,

174
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
it's useless.

175
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
It's useless.

176
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
And those candies.

177
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
You're so stupid.

178
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
I suggest you to be more careful.

179
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Report.

180
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Report, Commander.

181
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
The people in the police are asking for her surrender.

182
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Really?

183
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Yes.

184
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
What?

185
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
You've figured it out?

186
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Yes.

187
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
It's too cold here.

188
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
I can't bear this.

189
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
It's okay if you want to come out.

190
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,200
You should take your clothes off first.

191
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Me?

192
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Okay.

193
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Let her go.

194
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
What are you going to do with me?

195
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
How can I keep you for a few days?

196
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
If you make me happy,

197
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
maybe I can let you go.

198
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
It's not certain.

199
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Qi Luo,

200
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
then

201
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
I'll be free

202
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
from my life.

203
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Qi Luo.

204
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Qi Luo.

205
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Qi Luo.

206
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
I'm hungry.

207
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
I'm hungry.

208
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Eat.

209
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Eat.

210
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
It's good.

211
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Eat slowly.

212
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
No one is going to rob you.

213
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
If you want to pass away early,

214
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
you don't have to suffer this.

215
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
You don't know me.

216
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,200
I can't bear to torture you.

217
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Say it!

218
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Thatなんか is gone?

219
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,200
If it's not gone,

220
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
then I'll call him disturbing them in second floor.

221
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
I want the photo.

222
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
I want the photo too.

223
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Okay, don't move.

224
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Get ready to shoot.

225
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Okay, let's do one more.

226
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Wait a minute.

227
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Okay.

228
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Wait for me.

229
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
I'll go change.

230
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Okay, I'll wait for you.

231
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Okay.

232
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Okay.

233
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
It's so delicate.

234
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
It can be used for people's eyes.

235
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Yes.

236
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
It's good for the eyes of the western-town.

237
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
It's very clear.

238
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Look.

239
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Look.

240
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Okay.

241
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Let's go.

242
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Let's continue shooting.

243
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Get in the car.

244
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Chase them.

245
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
It's okay.

246
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
I want to see people.

247
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
I want to see the world.

248
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Chase them.

249
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Go.

250
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
You guys, this way.

251
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Go.

252
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Go.

253
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Go.

254
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
Go.

255
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Go.

256
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
They're all dead.

257
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Why are they leaving this letter?

258
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Commander, Wuxing is dead.

259
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
Leave this to me.

260
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Go back to the game early.

261
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Find a big brother and put it in.

262
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Then send it to my room.

263
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
What are you waiting for?

264
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Find him and tell him to sit.

265
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Yes.

266
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Go.

267
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Wuxing.

268
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
Wuxing.

269
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
Wuxing.

270
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Wuxing.

271
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,200
Wuxing.

272
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
Wuxing.

273
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Wuxing.

274
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Wuxing.

275
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Wuxing.

276
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Wuxing.

277
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Wuxing.

278
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Wuxing.

279
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,200
I want to see how you're going to die.

280
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Xia.

281
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Yu'er.

282
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
What's wrong?

283
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Let me see.

284
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Hanxiang.

285
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
No.

286
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
I can't wait.

287
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
You don't take me there.

288
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
I'll go there myself.

289
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Wait a minute.

290
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Grandma Gu, stop it.

291
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
If Master doesn't let you go, you can't go.

292
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
It's been three days.

293
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
He hasn't come back.

294
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Something must have happened.

295
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
No way.

296
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Wait a minute.

297
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
You said

298
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Master's head is a bit stupid.

299
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Then he forgot the truth.

300
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Or he fell.

301
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
He broke his head.

302
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Then he went back.

303
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Right?

304
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Do you believe me?

305
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
I do.

306
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Let me see.

307
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Yu'er.

308
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
I'll kill you if you stay here.

309
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
You die.

310
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
You die.

311
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
I'll watch.

312
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
If you don't want to die, let me see.

313
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
No.

314
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Stop it.

315
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Let him go.

316
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Let him go.

317
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Let's wait a day more.

318
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Maybe Master will come back.

319
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
If he doesn't come back, I'll take you to work.

320
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
Good girl.

321
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Good Yueya.

322
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Yueya.

323
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Listen to me.

324
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
I just want to keep you.

325
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Why do you have to suffer?

326
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
I'm scared.

327
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
I'm going to die.

328
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Let's go now.

329
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Hurry.

330
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Watch your step.

331
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Be careful.

332
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Watch your step.

333
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Watch your step.

334
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
Watch your step.

335
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Watch your step.

336
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:31,660
He got

337
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,880

338
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,360

Are you out of your mind again?

347
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,080
You should rest early today.

348
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,080
You can rest early. I have to work overtime today to get to Qingyun Temple.

349
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,080
I'll take our Dong family back.

00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,080
Brother Zhang San, please try it. You can leave now.

351

I'm leaving.

Take care.

Oh,本当?

But you have to return to that person.

Got your earpick on the mountain

373
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,080
How could I see him?

374
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,080
I want to see Hu Xin's hand.

375
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,080
Hu Xin's hand?

376
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
How could you see it?

377
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,080
Hu Xin, is it you?

378
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
What did you write?

379
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080

Stop.

When I left,

383
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,080
I promised to be good.

384
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,080
I said how to go back.

385
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,080
How could you do this?

386
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,080
Don't follow me.

387
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,080
Yu Yang. Yu Yang.

388
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Yu Yang, come back.

389
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
It's okay. It's okay.

390
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,080
Didn't you fall down your head last time?

391
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
Why did you give up this time?

392
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,080
Why did you give up this time?

393
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
Come.

394
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,080
I don't care what you are.

395
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,080
You have to find me back.

396
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,080
Yu Yang, you said it.

397
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,080
How could you go back?

398
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,080
Yu Yang, wait a minute.

399
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,080
Master,

400
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
I'm sorry to say something to him.

401
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,080
He said he would guarantee you.

402
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,080
Don't force yourself.

403
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,080
It's dangerous to run away.

404
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,080
His fingers are too small.

405
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,080
He ran down the mountain.

406
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
He used his eyes.

407
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,080
It's all because of you.

408
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,080
He was afraid you would be anxious.

409
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,080
Master also said

410
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
if you don't mind him,

411
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,080
you can just leave a hole and find some soil.

412
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
You can bury him.

413
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,080
He will grow up.

414
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,080
You don't have enough room.

415
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,080
You have to bury him.

416
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,080
You will die in winter.

417
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,080
What did he write?

418
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,080
Tell me what he wrote.

419
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
He said

420
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
he was afraid you would be weird.

421
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,080
He was afraid he would scare you.

422
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,080
He wanted to follow me.

423
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,080
He wanted to sleep with me.

424
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,080
No.

425
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
You are afraid of him.

426
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,080
You are not afraid of me.

427
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,080
Fine.

428
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,080
As long as he doesn't die,

429
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,080
he won't go to the woods.

430
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,080
I don't care where he lives.

431
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,080
No.

432
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
I don't care.

433
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
You bury him.

434
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
I will bury you.

435
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
Do you agree?

436
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
Fine.

437
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
You can live with me.

438
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,080
But you have to guarantee me.

439
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,080
I will sleep with you.

440
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
I will wake you up.

441
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,080
Don't come out of the woods at midnight.

442
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,080
Go.

443
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,080
Yu Yang.

444
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,080
You are asleep.

445
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,080
No.

446
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,080
If you sleep so tight in the daytime,

447
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,080
you have to wake up at night.

448
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,080
No.

449
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,080
What are you doing?

450
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,080
Don't touch him.

451
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,080
I drove him out.

452
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,080
I will cover him up.

453
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,080
Don't let him catch a cold.

454
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,080
No.

455
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,080
He is just a broken hand.

456
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,080
He is a bad man.

457
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,080
If you have a girlfriend,

458
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
you should treat me like this.

459
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,080
I am dead.

460
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
I don't want to be blind.

461
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,080
Do you hear me?

462
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,080
Wu Xin.

463
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
Are you hungry?

464
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,080
How can I eat this?

465
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,080
Before your mouth is full,

466
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
you should eat it for a day or three.

467
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,080
If you are hungry,

468
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,080
you should soak it in water.

469
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,080
How can water be so full?

470
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,080
How about

471
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,080
you soak it in the soup?

472
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Don't add salt.

473
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,080
I'm here.

474
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
Where are you?

475
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,080
When the sun is out today,

476
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,080
I saw you and her drinking...

477
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,080
Keep going.

478
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,080
Chief.

479
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
Chief.

480
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,080
Chief.

481
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,080
Chief.

482
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,080
Chief.

483
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,080
Why did you drink the monster's tea?

484
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
It's not a monster.

485
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,080
It's a heartless monster.

486
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,080
What?

487
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,080
What?

488
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
It's a heartless monster.

489
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,080
Then there's a hand left.

490
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
It's still moving.

491
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,080
What is it?

492
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,080
No.

493
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
Wait a minute.

494
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
Explain to me.

495
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,080
I'm begging you.

496
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,080
I'm begging you.

497
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,080
Please take her down.

498
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,080
Please.

499
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,080
Chief.

500
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,080
Chief.

501
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Chief.

502
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,080
Stop.

503
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,080
I'm not your grandma.

504
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,080
How about this?

505
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,080
What's your idea?

506
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,080
What's your legal plan?

507
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,080
You're going to be shot by your uncle.

508
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,080
If you have a body,

509
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,080
can you come back and live?

510
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
You can?

511
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,080
Don't worry.

512
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
If you keep this in mind,

513
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,080
it's all because of you.

514
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
I...

515
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,080
What do you mean?

516
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Listen.

517
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,080
If you dare to leave,

518
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,080
I'll get your little business out of you.

519
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,080
What?

520
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,080
You want to kill my aunt?

521
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,080
You want to kill my uncle?

522
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,080
You want to kill my elder brother?

523
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
You want to kill my uncle?

524
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,080
You want to kill my uncle?

525
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
I get it.

526
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,080
You want to live.

527
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,080
I'll stay here.

528
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,080
But don't let anyone know that he lives here.

529
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
If anyone sees me,

530
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
I'll be in trouble.

531
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,080
I can't keep my food anymore.

532
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
Fine.

533
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
Deal.

534
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Thank you.

535
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
Well.

536
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,080
The priest wants to drive us away.

537
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,080
How is that possible?

538
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,080
I'm not a man of my word.

539
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,080
Just keep it.

540
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,080
Master.

541
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Don't worry.

542
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:08,080
I've thought about your good for me.

543
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,080
I'm a kind and loyal man.

544
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,080
I won't leave you two alone.

545
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,080
Master Gu.

546
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,080
You seem to be not as annoying as before.

547
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,080
But if you really can't get back to the original state,

548
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,080
don't be a burden to Yueyan.

549
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,080
Let him find a good man to marry.

550
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,080
For example, I'm good at Gu Xuanwu.

551
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
No.

552
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,080
You can't do that.

553
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,080
Let go of me.

554
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,080
Let go of me.

555
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,080
Let go of me.

556
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,080
Head.

557
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,080
Head.

558
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,080
Head.

559
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
Master.

560
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
What's wrong?

561
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,080
What's wrong with me?

562
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,080
What's wrong with you?

563
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
Master.

564
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,080
No.

565
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,080
You said...

566
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,080
It's not like this yesterday.

567
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,080
What's the deal now?

568
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,080
If it's the same as the day before,

569
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
what should we do?

570
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,080
What else can we do?

571
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,080
No matter what,

572
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,080
he's a heartless man.

573
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,080
I'm just going to do what I want.

574
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
Where's the heart?

575
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:18,080
I finally know why he's going to bury himself in the soil.

576
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,080
Wu Xin.

577
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,080
Why are you like this?

578
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,080
How could I write two words yesterday?

579
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,080
Even if I don't know the words,

580
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,080
Master Gu can also read them to me.

581
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
Now,

582
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,080
you're cold and hungry.

583
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
I can't even know.

584
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,080
Don't worry, Yue'an.

585
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,080
Master said he could change back.

586
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,080
Give him some time.

587
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,080
The more you worry, the more he will worry.

588
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,080
He'll change back.

589
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,080
Are you really dead?

590
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,080
Yue'an!

591
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,080
Yue'an!

592
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,080
Did he change back?

593
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,080
Hurry!

594
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,080
Why is it like this?

595
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,080
It's still moving.

596
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,080
What's this smell?

597
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,080
It's so good.

598
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,080
It's the smell of the past.

599
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,080
Come and find a box.

600
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,080
What for?

601
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,080
Go, hurry.

602
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,080
What's this?

603
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,080
It's a box.

604
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,080
What's this?

605
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
It's a box.

606
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,080
What's this?

607
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,080
It's a box.

608
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,080
It's a box.

609
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,080
What's this?

610
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,080
It's a box.

611
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,080
It's a box.

612
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,080
What's this?

613
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,080
It's a box.

614
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,080
It's a box.

615
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,080
What's this?

616
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,080
Master is getting older.

617
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,480
When can I become a human?

618
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,040
What do you mean?

619
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,920
I don't mean anything.

620
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,480
I didn't ask you to change your price.

621
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,840
You haven't changed yet, have you?

622
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,960
Actually, I'm planning to

623
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,920
stay in this Taoist temple forever.

624
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,280
We have to think about the future.

625
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,960
After that, we have to have a way.

626
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,760
You have?

627
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,160
I really have.

628
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,760
I'm planning to do that.

629
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
But you're still young.

630
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,760
We'll go to Tianjin with master.

631
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,160
Tianjin?

632
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,760
What are you doing there?

633
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,360
Don't bother.

634
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:29,760
After Tianjin, I'll have a chance to be a human.

635
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,760
At that time, you only care about the smell and the spicy taste.

636
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,960
You're a good actor.

637
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,160
Will your old woman talk?

638
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,360
Life has to be a little bit of a traitor.

639
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,360
Is it a little bit of a goal?

640
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,960
Just like that, I still have to be a traitor?

641
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,560
Moreover, I can't be the master of a woman.

642
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,960
I used to listen to her.

643
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,760
I'll ask her.

644
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,760
I'll ask her.

645
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,760
She agreed?

646
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,760
Why did she agree?

647
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,960
Master, where are you eating?

648
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,960
Don't fall.

649
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,960
What are you doing?

650
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,960
Master and I are here to say goodbye to you.

651
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,960
Say goodbye?

652
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,960
I, master, Yueya, and the three of us are going to Tianjin.

653
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,960
Why are you hiding?

654
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,960
Master wants me to bring her here to see you.

655
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,960
I've been saying this for so long.

656
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,960
Thank you for taking care of us.

657
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,960
This is all because you didn't come back.

658
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,960
It's not necessarily.

659
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,960
But we're planning this.

660
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,960
If you really don't want to,

661
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,960
I'll leave Master here.

662
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,960
Let him stay in the house and be a companion with you.

663
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,960
Wait!

664
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,960
I'll leave him.

665
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,160
If you don't want to,

666
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,960
I'll just keep him.

667
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,960
Then please get us two tickets.

668
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,960
Don't say two times.

669
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,960
I have no problem with 20 tickets.

670
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,960
Yueya, if you said that master changes his character,

671
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,960
will he be a woman?

672
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,960
Why must he be a woman?

673
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,960
I'll make you a eunuch.

674
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,840
I have to go.

675
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,640
Don't worry.

676
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,640
I have to send the car to your car station.

677
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,080
No.

678
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,720
You are too polite.

679
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,640
Thank you, sir.

680
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,800
Master Wu Xin has also followed us.

681
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,320
Is it here?

682
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,200
Yes, it's here.

683
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,440
Well, you go on the car.

684
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,360
Yu'er, get on the car.

685
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,840
I won't send you.

686
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,280
Have a safe trip.

687
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:13,800
Take care.

688
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,760
Thank you, sir.

689
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,600
See you later.

690
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,600
Yang.

691
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,840
You must send them on the car.

692
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,640
I got it.

693
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,200
All right. Master, get on.

694
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,360
No, get on the car.

695
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:27,960
A'Jing.

696
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,480
What a pity.

697
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,400
Finally, I left.

698
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:50,960
Master.

699
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,960
His mind is not at peace.

700
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:56,960
He...

701
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,520
囉死了?

702
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:04,840
They fell into each other?

703
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,280
How long have they been in�� lasciously?

704
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,160
How many times didoses had taken prices down?

705
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,720
Do independanity link them.

706
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,360
Right.

707
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,600
Can they match?

708
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,480
Sword Eye P jás

709
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,640
What if he wakes up this time

710
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,480
Let's fall asleep

711
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Stone Dialect, I'm the littleточl

712
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,080
Drink some tea and then leave

713
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,200
Unending ignorance will die
