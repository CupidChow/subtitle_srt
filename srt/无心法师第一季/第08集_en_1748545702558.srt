00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the grass and the shadow

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is full of love and face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if the clouds are floating

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The pain is so hard to describe

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The madness of ice

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Just one day

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You clearly have a life

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In the north side of the lake

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You clearly have a life

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In the north side of the lake

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You clearly have a life

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
How strange.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Why is everybody's neck hazy?

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why is he not here?

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And...

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There's no breathing.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But there's a heartbeat.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Boss Lu.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Boss Lu.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Wake up, Boss Lu.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Boss Lu.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Ghost!

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why isn't he dead?

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm not dead.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why is the fire here?

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're so fast.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm asking you.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You're still afraid of water.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Other people can't wake up.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Why can you wake up?

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Don't forget.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't know. I'm afraid.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You're afraid?

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You're not saying you're a tough guy.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're a coward.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Listen.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If you don't tell me the truth,

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll make you regret it.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I... I said...

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't think...

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Boss, is this the same?

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Where did this talisman come from?

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This...

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is the talisman I got from Qingyun Temple.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Qingyun Temple?

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Why did you ask him to do it?

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I know that the talisman is not clean.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I can take the super price.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But...

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm afraid of sticking something on it.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I specially asked this talisman

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
from Qingyun Temple

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
to pay a price.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They said

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
this talisman was used to make him feel better.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He's not good at magic.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's why I'm so hard-hearted.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It seems that this blood

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
didn't move because of this.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What happened just now?

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I... I'm not sure either.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Anyway,

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
there was a black wind blowing over us.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It was blowing them all over.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
My neck and neck were hurting.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It was like...

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It was like being blown away by a snake.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Then, the black smoke came out of my eyes.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I was also very confused.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
When I woke up,

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I found that you were here.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why did those people who were bitten

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
fall into the water and die?

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The medicine...

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It must be the medicine!

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He's coming again!

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I...

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What are you doing?

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Give me back my talisman!

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What are you talking about?

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let me tell you.

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You're a mortal...

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Aumei Fairy Pujing Entertainment City

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
9994466, KOM

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The most exciting game on the line.

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The horse is running away.

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The horse is running away.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The reward is given to the queen.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The reward is given to Huang Jincheng.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You should pay attention to it.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The bonus is earned.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The reward is evil.

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The memorable tally would be the amount you earn

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and pay for your bonus now.

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Aumei Fairy Pujing Entertainment City 9994466, KOM

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, my goodness.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's a dangerous plan to kill your rewards.

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You may give this back to me.

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll take you to the family SOC.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If that war may bring you back,

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
we will set out together.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You may have a offer to offer to awake the festival.

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,760
But...

119
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,360
But...

120
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,880
But...

121
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,400
But...

122
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,120
But what?

123
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,240
If it weren't for us,

124
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,640
look at the water.

125
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,080
Okay.

126
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,280
I'll give you this.

127
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,440
You take me to the mountain.

128
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,080
Okay.

129
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,240
Let's go.

130
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,920
While you were hurt,

131
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,200
why didn't you go with me on the mountain?

132
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,600
You couldn't leave.

133
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,500
You went with me to the mountain and liked it.

134
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,680
What's wrong?

135
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,960
How can you express the feeling of your love

136
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,880
as if you didn't do anything?

137
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,840
What should we do now?

138
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,080
What should we do?

139
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,960
We have to die here, Fa Chen.

140
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,360
You have to die?

141
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,640
Then stay here.

142
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,280
We have to die here, Fa Chen.

143
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,360
Shut up.

144
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,480
Don't be afraid.

145
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,800
It's just a tentative.

146
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,560
Follow me.

147
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,800
I'll go.

148
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,560
Ma Chuchu, we're out.

149
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,160
We're out, Ma Chuchu.

150
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,640
I said, you can't die.

151
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,440
What's wrong with you?

152
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,000
Chuchu, Chuchu, don't be angry.

153
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,040
If you don't sell the mountain,

154
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,360
what about your body?

155
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,240
Body?

156
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,240
Is the body important or not?

157
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,080
It's my body.

158
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Why do you have to sell the mountain?

159
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,880
I've said it.

160
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,720
Chuchu.

161
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,200
You can't sell the mountain.

162
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,600
Take it back.

163
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,600
Hello, boss.

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,760
Boss Yu.

165
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,440
Boss Yu.

166
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,280
Boss Yu.

167
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,200
Well, I think

168
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,240
I still have no reason to buy your mountain.

169
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,200
No, that's too much.

170
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,520
I don't want to kill you.

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,680
You should find another buyer.

172
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,360
Another buyer?

173
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,880
Where else can I find another buyer?

174
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,920
The time has passed.

175
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,880
But no one is going to the mountain.

176
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,080
I guess they won't come.

177
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,120
Boss Bai.

178
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,360
I'm counting on you.

179
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,880
Look, if you still want to buy the mountain,

180
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,160
we can discuss it

181
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,480
on the price.

182
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,000
Boss Bai.

183
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,320
Didn't you say you'll win the mountain?

184
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,320
Now, there are no other competitors.

185
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,520
You should be more sincere.

186
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Why are you afraid?

187
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,480
I don't know.

188
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,600
Is it that powerful?

189
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,560
Didn't I say you were tough?

190
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,400
I don't care.

191
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,520
I'll buy it.

192
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,640
I'll make it.

193
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,880
I don't want to buy it now.

194
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,680
I can do it.

195
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,200
Master Fang.

196
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,440
I'll take you down the mountain.

197
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Why are you like this?

198
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,920
I...

199
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,920
Master Fang.

200
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
I'm begging you.

201
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,240
You must help me break the barrier.

202
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
Otherwise, it's hard to get out of the mountain.

203
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,480
My wife is really brave.

204
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,240
If I can't sell the mountain,

205
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,400
my wife will...

206
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,200
Wu Xin.

207
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,080
We must help her.

208
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,720
I've made up my mind.

209
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,920
I'll stay here.

210
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,520
It's weird.

211
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,520
What's the matter?

212
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,480
I'll stay here.

213
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,800
I'll leave after I break the barrier.

214
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,000
At that time,

215
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,880
Master Yu can buy more.

216
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,800
You can sell the mountain.

217
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,440
No.

218
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,240
Master Fang.

219
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,160
If you don't leave,

220
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,840
I'll go down the mountain.

221
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,680
It's weird.

222
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,800
Your legs are on your body.

223
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,960
You're still on the road.

224
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,400
Why do you want to go?

225
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,080
No.

226
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,400
I'll go to the barrier

227
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,840
if I meet someone.

228
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
I'll hold it and put it in a jar.

229
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,200
What should I do?

230
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,400
It's possible.

231
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:00,960
No.

232
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,840
Master Fang.

233
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,760
My fate is in your hands.

234
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,200
I want to leave you.

235
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,480
I won't leave anyway.

236
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,720
Master Fang.

237
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,920
Master Fang.

238
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,680
Miss Yueya.

239
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,320
I...

240
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,400
Why do you want to leave her?

241
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,000
You look so depressed.

242
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,840
Come on.

243
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,240
What do you want me to do?

244
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,240
Think about it.

245
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,480
Master Yu is learning now.

246
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,720
After breaking the barrier,

247
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,680
sell it to her.

248
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,720
Then, she can save her time

249
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
to find the traitor.

250
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,080
That's right.

251
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,200
You're still thinking about it.

252
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,440
But...

253
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,840
I'm thinking about

254
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,960
how to get out of the mouth.

255
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,840
That day,

256
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,640
I saw him when I was asking him.

257
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,720
Do you think

258
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,120
he's still there?

259
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,680
Yes.

260
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,560
Let's go.

261
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,240
Don't worry.

262
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,960
Stop.

263
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,000
These hot scrolls must be the use of theopa as well.

264
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,840
Talk nicely.

265
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,880
Stop talking!

266
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,920
Tell other members that

267
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,040
the regal body belongs to이싚

268
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,120
so

269
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,920
At first doesn't mean

270
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,880
we know

271
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:40,760
원�

272
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,480
but

273
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,600
they never know

274
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,920
they laugh

275
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,000
Zhao Yun Ren

276
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,260
But

277
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,320
Oh

278
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,920
That man died

279
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,680
whenuated

280
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,560
But

281
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,920
they get sick

282
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,820
That is

283
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
What about buying the clothes?

284
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
This one.

285
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Boss Yu, what are you so anxious about?

286
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
Since the shoes are all gone,

287
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
you're afraid that the clothes won't be sold out.

288
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
Call more people up.

289
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
It's a good deal.

290
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,820
Yes.

291
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,820
Please.

292
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,820
Please.

293
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,820
Don't.

294
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,820
I'll buy it.

295
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
It's a good deal if you don't pay me.

296
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,820
It's a good deal.

297
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
Although it's cheap,

298
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
I'm still anxious about Boss Yu.

299
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,820
I'm here.

300
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
You can sleep well today.

301
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,820
Go.

302
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,820
Boss Yu.

303
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:47,820
President Fatigue

304
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
Gu Gu.

305
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,820
Gu Gu.

306
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Thank you.

307
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,820
This is a promotion.

308
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
The mountain villa is going to open again.

309
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
It's not a good time to rest.

310
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
We have to have a new air.

311
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
Yes.

312
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,820
I'll go down the mountain tomorrow.

313
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
I'll send someone to come up.

314
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,820
The people in the west are in charge.

315
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,820
From now on, I'll talk to Boss Bai.

316
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
Boss Bai.

317
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,820
The mountain villa is sold.

318
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,820
But I'm not happy at all.

319
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,820
It's the best result for Boss Yu.

320
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
Come on.

321
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,820
Yu Xiao Zhu.

322
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
I'm not talking about you.

323
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,820
You have too few tricks in the mountain.

324
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,820
You're a big piece of land.

325
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
You can see so many houses.

326
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,820
You can make two or three circles.

327
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,820
How many people live here?

328
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
How many people are there?

329
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,820
I'm the boss now.

330
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
You have to listen to me.

331
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,820
All the houses are with Xiao Luo.

332
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,820
Two floors.

333
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,820
Three floors.

334
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,820
And a few more circles.

335
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
I'll make ten more.

336
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
By the way,

337
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,820
your name is not very good.

338
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,820
It's too quick.

339
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,820
Change to Huang's Palace Circle.

340
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,820
How is it?

341
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,820
Is it good?

342
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,820
Xu Yu.

343
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
You are here to see me, right?

344
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,820
Didn't you say that the evil spirit has cleared the way?

345
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Boss Bai, you misunderstood me.

346
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
The internal organs are crying.

347
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,820
What the hell are you doing?

348
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,820
You have to be careful.

349
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
I'm sorry.

350
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
My wife.

351
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,820
My wife.

352
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,820
My wife.

353
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,820
My wife.

354
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,820
My wife.

355
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,820
My wife.

356
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,820
My wife.

357
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,820
My wife.

358
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,820
My wife.

359
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,820
My wife.

360
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,820
My wife.

361
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,820
My wife.

362
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,820
I'm very grateful to this villa.

363
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,820
I don't want to be a loser.

364
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,820
I'm in a bad mood these days.

365
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,820
You have to find a partner for me.

366
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,820
If your wife is like this,

367
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,820
what will I do with my business?

368
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,820
I won't.

369
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
I'll persuade her.

370
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,820
You'd better persuade her.

371
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,820
Or

372
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,820
I'll have to think about

373
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,820
the conditions you live here.

374
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,820
You are too much.

375
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,820
This villa is the heart of Boss Yu and Mrs. Yu.

376
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,820
She is a long-time lover.

377
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,820
Why do you say that?

378
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,820
Miss Yuan Ya.

379
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,820
It's their business to be sad.

380
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
Who can leave it to me?

381
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,820
It's my business.

382
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,820
Why can't I say it?

383
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,820
Miss Yuan Ya.

384
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,820
Thank you.

385
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,820
Boss Bai said it was reasonable.

386
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,820
I'll persuade her.

387
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,820
She won't be in trouble.

388
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
This is your wedding day.

389
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,820
Go back.

390
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,820
Boss Yu.

391
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
You should persuade Mrs. Yu.

392
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,820
Don't make her sad.

393
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,820
She is in a bad mood.

394
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,820
I have to do something.

395
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,820
Ok.

396
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,820
Then you have a good time.

397
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,820
I'll be there for you.

398
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,820
Zhu Chuan.

399
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,700
Chuchu, why are you so hardworking?

400
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,780
I don't want to.

401
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,940
But I lost my body.

402
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,700
Even the mountain villa is gone now.

403
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,300
I won't. I won't.

404
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,580
Believe me.

405
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,540
If you listen to me,

406
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,660
one day, I'll redeem her.

407
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,820
Don't be selfish.

408
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,380
We both know

409
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,380
we won't be able to go back to the past.

410
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,580
Now, we just lost the mountain villa.

411
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,580
But if you continue doing this,

412
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,980
I'll lose you too.

413
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,380
Great!

414
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,780
Let's get back to the day we were born.

415
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,980
We'll die together.

416
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,180
No!

417
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,380
I don't want that.

418
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,180
Chuchu, let go of me.

419
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,380
As long as you want to,

420
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,780
everything will be gone.

421
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,180
Everything will be gone?

422
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,380
You know that

423
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,180
losing you is meaningless to me.

424
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,780
No matter what, I'll keep you.

425
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,380
Since that,

426
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,180
I'll go find the hairpin myself.

427
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,180
No! Chuchu!

428
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,980
You're doing this

429
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,380
to make me open the sword?

430
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,380
I know that no matter what,

431
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,780
I'll help you redeem this life.

432
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,780
I can't afford it. Let go of me!

433
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,780
Let go of me!

434
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,780
Let go of me!

435
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,780
Let go of me!

436
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,180
Let go of me!

437
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,580
Let go of me!

438
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,980
Wait for me!

439
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,380
Chuchu! Chuchu!

440
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,380
Chuchu! Chuchu!

441
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,380
Chuchu! Chuchu!

442
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,380
Chuchu! Chuchu!

443
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,380
Chuchu! Chuchu!

444
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,380
Chuchu! Chuchu!

445
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,380
Chuchu! Chuchu!

446
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,380
Chuchu! Chuchu!

447
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,380
Chuchu! Chuchu!

448
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,380
Yu.

449
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,380
Yu!

450
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,380
Yu.

451
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,380
Mrs. Yu.

452
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,380
Chuchu! Chuchu!

453
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,380
Chuchu! Chuchu!

454
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,380
I'm here to save you!

455
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,380
Yu.

456
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,380
What's Yu?

457
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,380
Let go of him!

458
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,380
Yu.

459
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,380
Yu.

460
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,380
Yu.

461
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,380
Mrs. Yu.

462
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,380
Mrs. Yu.

463
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,380
Mrs. Yu.

464
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,380
Are you okay?

465
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,380
You scared me to death.

466
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,380
Open your wound.

467
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,380
Don't be afraid.

468
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,380
I was just looking at the sea.

469
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,380
Actually, she didn't hurt me.

470
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,380
Don't be afraid.

471
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,380
Yu.

472
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,380
We're helping you.

473
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,380
How could you hurt us?

474
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,380
Let go of me.

475
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,380
Why?

476
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,380
Why did you do this to me?

477
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,380
Because I don't want to see you

478
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,380
taking away the love

479
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,380
you gave me.

480
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,380
But we...

481
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,380
Look.

482
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,380
I'm leaving.

483
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,380
Let's not fight again, okay?

484
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,380
I don't want to leave.

485
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,380
I can't leave without you.

486
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,380
I don't want to leave.

487
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,380
Stay with me.

488
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,380
Chuchu.

489
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,380
I'm going to be free.

490
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,380
You should be happy for me.

491
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,380
Chuchu.

492
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,380
Will we have a future?

493
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,380
Jinsheng.

494
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,380
We've made up our minds.

495
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,380
And we're still alive.

496
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,380
Chuchu.

497
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,380
Don't be stubborn.

498
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,380
Just give me a few more shots.

499
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,380
Okay?

500
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,380
Okay.

501
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,380
Okay.

502
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,380
I'm sorry.

503
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,380
Chuchu.

504
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,380
I'm sorry.

505
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,380
Chuchu.

506
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,380
Take care.

507
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,380
Chuchu.

508
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,380
Chuchu.

509
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,380
Chuchu.

510
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,380
Chuchu.

511
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,380
Don't leave.

512
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,380
Don't leave.

513
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,380
Don't leave me.

514
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,380
Chuchu.

515
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,380
Don't leave me.

516
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,380
Don't leave me.

517
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,380
Don't leave me.

518
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,380
This is all my fault.

519
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,380
I've been practicing for over 900 years.

520
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,380
I'm not doing it right.

521
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,380
The process of getting into the mortal world is the same as the last decades.

522
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,380
I've been through all the things I've been missing.

523
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:40,380
But I've never had the chance to fall in love with someone.

524
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,380
I've been through a lot.

525
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,380
I've been crazy about her.

526
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,380
I've been acting.

527
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,380
But I don't know anything.

528
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,380
Until I met her.

529
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,380
I thought we'd be happy together for the rest of our lives.

530
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:09,380
But I know that our good days are short.

531
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,380
Why?

532
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,380
Why can't my beloved stay with me?

533
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,380
I've been practicing for over 900 years.

534
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,380
I'm not doing it for this.

535
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,380
So you're going to kill someone?

536
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,380
I'm not.

537
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,380
I'm just trying to save her.

538
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,380
I've got some advanced magic.

539
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,380
What kind of advanced magic?

540
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,380
I'm a mortal.

541
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,380
I'm very serious.

542
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,380
I often play with it.

543
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,380
Once, I came to a strange cave.

544
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,380
I learned the technique of the West-winged Titan.

545
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,380
To save her.

546
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,380
I started to use the technique of the West-winged Titan.

547
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,380
To protect her spirit.

548
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:16,380
But the magic I learned can only protect her spirit.

549
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,380
Other things can't be saved.

550
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:28,380
At the beginning, I was just taking some energy from different guests.

551
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:34,380
So they were weak and didn't know how to die.

552
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:40,380
But later, my wife refused to use this method to make her life.

553
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,380
So she started to make her scary spirit in the cave.

554
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,380
I scared many guests away.

555
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,380
The guests in the cave are getting weaker.

556
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,380
The spirit she needs is getting more and more.

557
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:59,380
I started to take more and more spirit from one guest.

558
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:05,380
Until everything is settled.

559
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,380
Xiao Zhu.

560
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,380
What's wrong?

561
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,380
I just...

562
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,380
I'm getting a bad breath.

563
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,380
What? You killed someone?

564
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,380
No, I didn't.

565
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,380
I didn't kill anyone.

566
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,380
I still have a breath.

567
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,380
I use my cultivation to protect her spirit.

568
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,380
She won't die.

569
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,380
But...

570
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,380
She's asleep.

571
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,380
Will she wake up?

572
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,380
What's wrong?

573
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,380
She's asleep.

574
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,380
She's asleep.

575
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,380
She's asleep.

576
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,380
She's asleep.

577
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,380
She's asleep.

578
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,380
What's the difference between killing and killing?

579
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,380
Xiao Zhu, I don't want this.

580
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,380
Let me go.

581
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,380
No.

582
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,380
I don't want you to be the one who killed those innocent people.

583
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,380
I don't want you to be the one who killed those innocent people.

584
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,380
It's not worth it.

585
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,380
No, it's worth it.

586
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,380
It's worth it.

587
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,380
I can only see you.

588
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,380
It's worth everything.

589
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,380
I've never met a chance

590
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,380
to see the spirit of Jiang Nai

591
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,380
in person.

592
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,380
I've never met a chance to see the spirit of Jiang Nai

593
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,380
in person.

594
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,380
I can't help but think about it.

595
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,380
Even so,

596
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,380
I can't help but think about it.

597
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,380
So, you're in the Manor?

598
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,380
You can do it?

599
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,380
You can say that.

600
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,380
Only when the Manor has been changed,

601
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,380
the guests will come to the mountain again.

602
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,380
But when you came,

603
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,380
he was already weak.

604
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,380
That night,

605
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,380
I was afraid that he couldn't hold on to it.

606
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,380
I wanted to find some energy to make him happy.

607
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,380
So,

608
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,380
I found the girl of Yueya first.

609
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,380
So, that white man

610
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,380
is actually Mrs. Yu who wanted to protect me?

611
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,380
You have the magic heart

612
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,380
and the bodyguard.

613
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,380
So, I hurt him.

614
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,380
After he was hurt,

615
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,380
he couldn't stop me.

616
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,380
So, I could successfully

617
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,380
wash Mr. Lu's spirit.

618
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,380
So,

619
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,380
the white eye I saw in the hot spring

620
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,380
is Mrs. Yu too?

621
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,380
Yes.

622
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,380
I tried to find some energy for him.

623
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,380
But once he's recovered,

624
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,380
he'll stop me.

625
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,380
I was so confused.

626
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,380
I just wanted to find the target.

627
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,380
But who knew that

628
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,380
the white man who found the spirit

629
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,380
was trying to kill me

630
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,380
with his bodyguard.

631
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,380
I didn't do anything to them.

632
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,380
But,

633
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,380
I was so surprised.

634
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,380
I couldn't hold on to it.

635
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,380
That white man

636
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,380
seemed to have some blessing.

637
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,380
So, I let him go

638
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,380
and quickly went back to the mountain villa.

639
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,380
I was so hurt.

640
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,380
I went back to the room to calm myself down.

641
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,380
But I only knew after I woke up

642
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,380
that my wife had come down the mountain herself.

643
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,380
So, did she?

644
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,380
She wanted to drive you out of the mountain villa.

645
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,380
She wanted to stay here.

646
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,380
She once again messed up my plan.

647
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,380
Mr. Bai didn't want to buy the mountain villa.

648
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,380
I only acted for a while.

649
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,380
I let you feel

650
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,380
that the blood was already being cut off.

651
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,380
No wonder.

652
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,380
No wonder that day,

653
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,380
after the green snake was born,

654
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,380
there was no demon at all.

655
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,380
So, it was your husband.

656
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,380
That's right.

657
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,380
From then on,

658
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,380
I let the people in the mountain villa

659
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,380
secretly go back to the mountain villa.

660
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,380
I was so anxious.

661
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,380
I wanted to let everything

662
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,380
return to my plan again.

663
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,380
After the business of the mountain villa was settled,

664
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,380
I didn't do anything.

665
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,380
I waited until the people in the mountain villa

666
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,380
were getting more and more

667
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,380
and more curious about them secretly.

668
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,380
In order not to make it worse,

669
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,380
I was so anxious.

670
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,380
I didn't want to go to the imperial palace.

671
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,380
But I didn't expect

672
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,380
that she was so unfilial.

673
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,380
She wanted to leave me.

674
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,380
Seeing how Nian Yuan suffered,

675
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,380
she wanted to break through the imperial palace.

676
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,380
I want to destroy her now.

677
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,380
I can't do anything.

678
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,380
So you want to leave me.

679
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,380
You want to kill Yue Yang.

680
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,380
But I didn't expect

681
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,380
that you were so hard-working to protect Yue Yang.

682
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,380
I don't understand.

683
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,380
I don't understand why.

684
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,380
I'm willing to sacrifice everything for her.

685
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,380
I'm willing to pay for her.

686
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,380
She insisted on leaving me.

687
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,380
But you don't understand her pain.

688
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,380
You're willing to sacrifice everything for her.

689
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,380
Maybe she wanted to.

690
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,380
She left you because she didn't want you to be killed.

691
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,380
How could you not understand?

692
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,380
I'm too stubborn.

693
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,380
I'm too obsessed with her.

694
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,380
I'm so lucky to have a love.

695
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,380
She didn't want to

696
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,380
sacrifice everything for me in the next life.

697
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,380
I regret it now.

698
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,380
But it's too late.

699
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,380
You're very powerful.

700
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,380
You can save them.

701
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,380
If you can,

702
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,380
your wife will be happy.

703
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,380
Don't worry.

704
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,380
I know what to do.

705
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,380
Actually, Boss Yu is a pitiful person.

706
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,380
You're going to pay for your own death.

707
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,380
You're pitiful.

708
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,380
You're not a pitiful person.

709
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,380
You still say that you're pitiful.

710
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,380
You're pitiful.

711
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,380
You should take some medicine.

712
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,380
It's okay.

713
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,380
I'm just a little bit pitiful.

714
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,380
That's not good.

715
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,380
I didn't look carefully.

716
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,380
What if I get a bruise?

717
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,380
Let me see.

718
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,380
I want to see.

719
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,380
What's going on?

720
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,380
I'm just a little bit pitiful.

721
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,380
But you didn't bleed today.

722
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,380
I'm just pitiful.

723
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:56,040
He's

724
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,380
hurt a little bit today.

725
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,380
So I'm bad.

726
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,880
But anyway,

727
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,380
he sure is good to you.

728
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,380
That's why...

729
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,380
He picked the один Aggrochelle.

730
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,420
Uh,

731
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,420
I'm afraid I'll hurt you.

732
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,420
Look, even if you're not in the dream,

733
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,420
you'll still worry about me and be afraid of my injury.

734
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:39,420
Yue'er, I'm really happy.

735
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,420
Episode 1

736
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,420
Since I'm done with you,

737
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:59,420
I'll use my life to return it.

738
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,420
Episode 1

739
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,420
Boss Yu!

740
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,420
Boss Yu!

741
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,420
I've already given them the bag.

742
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,420
They'll wake up in an hour.

743
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:57,420
All of this will be a dream for them.

744
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,420
What about you?

745
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,420
I...

746
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,420
I've already made three thousand for that bag.

747
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:11,420
I've already made three thousand for that bag.

748
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,420
I'm not far from death.

749
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,420
I've earned all of this.

750
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,420
I finally have the honor to see my wife.

751
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,420
From now on, I won't let my wife

752
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,420
be sad for me anymore.

753
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,420
Episode 1

754
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,420
Let's go.

755
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,420
Yu Yan.

756
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,420
Yu Yan, what's wrong?

757
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,420
Tell me.

758
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,420
Boss Yu,

759
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,420
I'm sorry.

760
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,420
I'm sorry.

761
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,420
I'm sorry.

762
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,420
I'm sorry.

763
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,420
I'm sorry.

764
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,420
I'm sorry.

765
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,420
I'm sorry.

766
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,420
I'm sorry.

767
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,420
I'm sorry.

768
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,420
Boss Yu has been alive for so long.

769
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,420
Did he not expect that

770
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,420
he would be so short in a good life?

771
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,420
Yes.

772
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,420
Who would have thought that?

773
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,420
What about us?

774
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,420
We're all mortal.

775
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,420
We don't know how to spell it.

776
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,420
Even if we know how to spell it,

777
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,420
we can't be like Mrs. Yu.

778
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,420
We can't be like Mrs. Yu.

779
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,420
It's been decades since the death of the old soldier.

780
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,420
It's been a lifetime.

781
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,420
Tell me.

782
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,420
Should we take the good days

783
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,420
and move them into two days

784
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:50,420
and make them more and more real?

785
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,420
So,

786
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,420
I don't want to be short anymore.

787
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,420
I think that

788
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,420
if we two are together,

789
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,420
we should be happy.

790
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,420
This life is not a waste.

791
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,420
Do you understand?

792
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,420
Do you understand?

793
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,420
Yueya.

794
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,420
Marry me, okay?

795
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,420
As long as we're together,

796
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,420
we can do whatever we want.

797
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,420
I'm so lonely.

798
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,420
Do you still remember the hometown?

799
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,420
Life is a legend.

800
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:58,420
The corner of time.

801
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,420
He's watching people

802
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:05,420
love and hate.

803
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,420
Even if time passes by,

804
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,420
even if he forgets,

805
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:16,420
I still remember the memories

806
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,420
of him that he left.

807
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,420
Life is a legend.

808
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,420
The corner of time.

809
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,420
He's watching people

810
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:35,420
love and hate.

811
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,420
Even if time passes by,

812
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,420
even if he forgets,

813
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,420
I still remember the memories

814
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:47,420
of him that he left.

815
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,420
Life is a legend.

816
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,420
The corner of time.

817
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:58,420
He's watching people love and hate.

818
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,420
Even if time passes by,

819
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,420
even if he forgets,

820
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,420
I still remember the memories

821
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:10,420
of him that he left.

822
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:15,420
The corner of time.

823
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,420
What's wrong? Why are you fighting?

824
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,420
The one who's in the house is fighting with him.

825
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,420
Just pick whatever you want.

826
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,420
You can buy whatever you like.

827
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:27,420
I heard it's his wine.

828
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,420
It's too much.

829
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,420
No wonder you're so proud.

830
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,420
Tell me, what exactly are you?

831
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,420
I'm warning you again.

832
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,420
If you dare to come near Yueya again, I'll kill you.

833
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,420
Yue Qilong!

834
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,420
I don't know. I don't know.

835
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:07,420
Wu Xie, what exactly are you?
