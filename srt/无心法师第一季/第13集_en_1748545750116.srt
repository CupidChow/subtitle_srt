00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the grass and the shadow

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is full of love and face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if the clouds are floating

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The pain is so hard to describe

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The madness of ice

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Just one day

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You clearly have a life

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In the north side of the lake

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You clearly have a life

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In the north side of the lake

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You clearly have a life

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In the north side of the lake

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You clearly have a life

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You still don't admit your crime?

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You have failed my love for you

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How dare you do such a dirty thing?

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Master, I beg you to believe me

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I really was caught by Yuanhang

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't want to see him again today

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You are so right

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I will die and won't let you go

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The new year is coming

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The summer is coming

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Master Gu

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Master Gu

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Come on

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Why are you here?

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Long time no see

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
No need

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I come by myself

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No need

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Ok, get in the car

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I am coming

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't move

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Come inside, please

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Come

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Master Su

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Master Gu

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You have worked hard on the car

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You are so polite

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I prepared some fried egg rice

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
To welcome you

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Come on, please

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yu'er, come on

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Sit down

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Master Gu, you are so polite

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Come on, help Master Gu pack the bags

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No need

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I carry this bag by myself

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I am used to it

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's comfortable

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Where is the hairpin?

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Didn't he come with you?

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He...

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He went to the garden

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
When will he come to Tianjin?

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's not fixed yet

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I can't say it

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Come on, eat

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Eat

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Ok, Yu'er

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Eat

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Please

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Don't move

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's ok

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Keep eating

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Eat

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yu'er, come on

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Come

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's not convenient to see people

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's talk about it in a few days

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You are living in my house

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I will take care of your business

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We don't live here

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Why?

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I have some money recently

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Someone is chasing me

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So I can't live here

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You should live here

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You are so generous

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Who dares to come to my house to find me?

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Master Su

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I am so happy for you

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I can live here

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I can live here

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Don't bother me

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I have found the place

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Come on, drink

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Master Su, you are here

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Give it to me

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You are asking for it?

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If I don't live here

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I will have to find a place like this

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I am really...

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I won't say it

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Ok

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I will take care of the rest of the yard

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You can live here for two days

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you are not used to it

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You can live here

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Come here

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Master Su

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Can you take some time to see the commander?

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Don't worry

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Take care of it

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You can have a rest

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I will go back

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I will send you off

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No need

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If you need anything

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Just tell me

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Just put this thing at the door

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't come here

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Do you hear me?

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
One day three meals

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What three meals?

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Why are you talking so much?

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Get out of here

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yes

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What are you doing?

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Why are you moving?

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why are you pulling the string?

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Stop it

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The soup is ready

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Drink it

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
No, come here

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I have something to tell you

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What are you doing?

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Get out

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't go in

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I beg you

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What are you doing?

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't go in

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He is a big man

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What's so good about him?

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He is my man

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I can't see him

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I am bigger than you

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You should call me a brother

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Listen to me

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I am related to my master

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He is my brother

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I don't care what he looks like

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But you two are different

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You two sleep on the same bed

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I am afraid you have a long time

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I feel bad

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I am sure he is not here

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
No matter what he looks like

165
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No

166
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You don't care about him

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You see, I like him

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
more than my father

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Because I saw him

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I am afraid he will be killed

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I don't want to see him again

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Besides

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
This is what my master said

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Listen to me

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I am afraid he will be killed

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I am afraid he will be killed

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I am afraid he will be killed

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I am afraid he will be killed

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I am afraid he will be killed

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I am afraid he will be killed

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I am afraid he will be killed

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I am afraid he will be killed

183
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I am afraid he will be killed

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I am afraid he will be killed

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I am afraid he will be killed

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Master

187
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I told you

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Don't leave me

189
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Do you want to go?

190
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't want to go

191
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I want to go to the white robe

192
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Ok

193
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Give it to me

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You go back first

195
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Ok

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You are so stupid

197
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I will sleep with you

198
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Listen

199
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Stop it

200
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What happened?

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I have four claws

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I am afraid I will be killed

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Give it to him

204
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Don't worry

205
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Go back

206
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
These claws

207
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I am afraid he will be killed

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I am afraid he will be killed

209
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I am afraid he will be killed

210
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I am afraid he will be killed

211
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I am afraid he will be killed

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I am afraid he will be killed

213
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I am afraid he will be killed

214
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I am afraid he will be killed

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I am afraid he will be killed

216
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I am afraid he will be killed

217
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I am afraid he will be killed

218
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I am afraid he will be killed

219
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I am afraid he will be killed

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I am afraid he will be killed

221
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I am afraid he will be killed

222
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I am afraid he will be killed

223
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I am afraid he will be killed

224
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I am afraid he will be killed

225
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I am afraid he will be killed

226
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Zhang Xianzong

227
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I am hungry

228
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Wait

229
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Wait

230
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You are good to me

231
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I will help you

232
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I can help you kill Gu Xuanwu

233
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What about it?

234
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,960
You don't want to?

235
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,440
Of course I do.

236
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,040
But we don't know where Gu Xuanwu is.

237
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,160
My niece brought back the news.

238
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,640
She and Yueya went to Tianjin's train.

239
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,440
Tianjin?

240
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,360
Tian...

241
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,360
Tianjin is the leader of the general.

242
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,800
If I send them there...

243
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,960
You don't need to care about these.

244
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,880
You're right.

245
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,600
In the way I say it,

246
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,760
Will they know it wouldn't die or not?

247
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,360
Where're the other kids?

248
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,400
Well, I can't return the money.

249
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,400
So I can't return it now.

250
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,640
Then no bother.

251
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,720
Who's that?

252
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,200
Move out of here.

253
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,560
It's a ghost.

254
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,320
You ungrateful devil.

255
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,880
Get off the Fasting!

256
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Master, are you going to become a human?

257
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
Yes.

258
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,960
If you're cold, you wait here.

259
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
I'll boil some hot water for you.

260
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Wait here.

261
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
Yueya!

262
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Yueya!

263
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
What's wrong?

264
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
You're going to burn the house?

265
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
What house?

266
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
Master said it's cold.

267
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
I'll boil some hot water for him.

268
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,960
I'll wash his head and body.

269
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,960
I'll burn the stove.

270
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
He's talking.

271
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
What?

272
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
He's talking about something better.

273
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
Let me see.

274
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Wait.

275
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
He's so ugly.

276
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Don't scare him.

277
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
I'll go.

278
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
Don't go.

279
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
I'm not warning you.

280
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
You'll scare him if you go.

281
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Don't blame me if you do.

282
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
You always say he's ugly.

283
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
I don't even dare to think about it.

284
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
Now look at him.

285
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,960
He's not ugly.

286
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
He's not ugly.

287
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
Yueya!

288
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
He's almost the same.

289
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
He's like this.

290
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,960
He looks like a human.

291
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
Don't touch me.

292
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
He's so cute.

293
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
He's like a big brother.

294
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Take him to the room.

295
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
I'll take care of him.

296
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
Aren't you scared?

297
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
He doesn't even want to scare me.

298
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
He's a human now.

299
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
What are you afraid of?

300
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,960
It's raining.

301
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
It's raining.

302
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
It's raining.

303
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,960
I came to find a little king.

304
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,960
You say you.

305
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
I'll take care of you.

306
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
You go to the room.

307
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
If you don't,

308
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
you'll come here yourself.

309
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
What's wrong with your face?

310
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
Let me see.

311
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
How many times have I told you?

312
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
Don't pull him.

313
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,960
You're looking for him.

314
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
He's so tender.

315
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Look at him.

316
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
I'm afraid of scaring you.

317
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
You're...

318
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,960
You know how to be a man.

319
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,960
What are you doing?

320
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
I'm a man.

321
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,960
I'll strangle you to death.

322
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
Is it sweet?

323
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
It's sweet.

324
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Where's my sister-in-law?

325
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,960
She's gone.

326
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,960
She's going to eat poison.

327
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
It's not.

328
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
I put it here.

329
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,960
You can take it out.

330
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
Take some more.

331
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Just laugh.

332
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
I'll let you get used to it.

333
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,960
I'll let you get used to it.

334
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
There's a cat.

335
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Come on.

336
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
Come on.

337
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
This is the key to your room.

338
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
Thank you.

339
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
You're welcome.

340
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Why didn't you move in?

341
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
I was working on the money.

342
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Here you are.

343
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
How can I get this?

344
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
I've already given you 20 big boxes.

345
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
Why did you ask me for money?

346
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
20 big boxes

347
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,960
is the price of one box.

348
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Look at how many boxes there are.

349
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,960
20 big boxes for one box.

350
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
You two should have taken the money.

351
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
It's hard to listen to this little guy.

352
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Do you want us to...

353
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
What are you doing?

354
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Let go of me.

355
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
Let go of me.

356
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
Get out of here.

357
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,960
Are you all right?

358
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
Shi Touge.

359
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,960
Is it you?

360
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Don't you know me?

361
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
I'm Xiaochunzi.

362
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
Xiaochunzi?

363
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
Shi Touge.

364
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
Here you are, Xiaochunzi.

365
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Let's eat.

366
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
I'm not eating. I'll eat later.

367
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,960
You're not eating. It's getting cold.

368
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
I'll eat first.

369
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
Okay.

370
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,960
I like the spicy food you made.

371
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
It's delicious.

372
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Come on. Let's eat.

373
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
It's delicious.

374
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Shi Touge.

375
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Shi Touge.

376
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Xiaochunzi.

377
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Xiaochunzi.

378
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
Xiaochunzi.

379
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
Xiaochunzi.

380
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Wait for me.

381
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
I'll come back after I finish.

382
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
I'll marry you.

383
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Shi Touge. I'll come back after I finish.

384
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
I'll come back after I finish.

385
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Wait for me.

386
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960

They're out of the world.

404
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
They're dead.

405
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
They're here.

406
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Why do you stay here?

407
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
My family is away from here.

408
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
Who would want you to close yourCs?

409
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960

Then what are you going to do?

415
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
I have some private money.

416
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,960
I'll pay it back one day.

417
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
Don't you want to ask me how I'm doing?

418
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
I...

419
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,960
am I still qualified to ask you?

420
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
What are you talking about?

421
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
You used to be my little boy.

422
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,960
Now you are my little boy.

423
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,960
You will still be my little boy!

424
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Are you almost done? I...

425
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,960
I'm going to take a shower.

426
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,960
Xiaochun, are you asleep?

427
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Xiaochun!

428
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,960
Brother Shi Tou, why are you here?

429
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
I went to the market just now.

430
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
I bought you some things.

431
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,960
If you don't think it's enough,

432
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,960

433
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
So many things.

434
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,960
It's too much trouble for you.

435
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
It's not trouble.

436
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,960
If you're done, tell me.

437
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
That... that...

438
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,960
It's getting late.

439
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,960
I'm going back to rest.

440
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
You should go to bed.

441
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960

444
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,960

445
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
Have some tea.

446
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
Okay.

447
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960

448
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,960
Let's go.

449
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Let's go.

450
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
If you say...

451
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Have some tea.

452
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,960
Come.

453
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
Come.

454
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,960
What are you doing?

455
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
Go away!

456
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
Go away!

457
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
What are you doing?

458
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
Go away!

459
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Xiaochun!

460
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,960
Go away!

461
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
What are you doing?

462
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
Open the door.

463
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
What's wrong with you?

464
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
What's wrong?

465
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
How could this happen?

466
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,960
You're really dead.

467
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
You're wearing a too much shoes.

468
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
I need to make more shoes for you

469
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,960
after I sew this shoe.

470
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
Enough.

471
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
It's too much trouble for you.

472
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
It's too much trouble for you.

473
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,960
How many pairs of shoes are you wearing?

474
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
Okay.

475
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
Pick it up.

476
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
We've had dinner.

477
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
What are you going to do?

478
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Just get some.

479
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
Okay.

480
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
Master Gu.

481
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,960
Did you get caught by someone?

482
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
No.

483
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
Really?

484
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
Yes.

485
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Go to the swimming pool.

486
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,960
Help me to write this down.

487
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
What's this?

488
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,960
It's just a piece of paper.

489
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
What's this?

490
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
It's just a piece of paper.

491
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
You're not eating?

492
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
No.

493
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,960
You're still saying it's okay?

494
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
kicking

495
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,960

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,960

497
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,960
Hurry up.

498
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,040
Okay,

499
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,960
ways to come out.

500
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
Be careful.

501
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,960
What are you doing?

502
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,960
You leave.

503
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Go away.

504
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,160
There are many people here

505
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,380
This is a good place

506
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,340
Shiteuge

507
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,800
I wanna talk with you

508
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,040
What's wrong?

509
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,520
Let's have a toast.

510
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,720
What's the matter?

511
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Let's go.

512
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
Come on.

513
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,320
Why is there no wine?

514
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,520
I'll pour you another glass.

515
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
Here.

516
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,160
Why are you looking at me?

517
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,360
You look good.

518
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,960
You're so handsome.

519
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,360
I mean it.

520
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,360
I'll go back to you again.

521
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,360
But you're not here.

522
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,360
I can't forget you.

523
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,360
Go away.

524
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,360
I want you to go.

525
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,360
Are you crazy?

526
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,360
What are you looking at?

527
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
Let me go.

528
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Fine.

529
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
I'll tell you that I'll never meet you again.

530
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,360
I know you're sincere.

531
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
I mean to say

532
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,360
don't leave tonight.

533
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,360
Fine.

534
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,360
I won't go.

535
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,360
Xiao Chunzi.

536
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,360
Xiao Chunzi.

537
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,360
Xiao Chunzi.

538
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,360
Get up.

539
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,360
Xiao Chunzi.

540
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,360
Come here.

541
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,360
What are you doing?

542
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,360
What's wrong with him?

543
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,360
He's not Xiao Chunzi.

544
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,360
He's a hostage.

545
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,360
What's wrong?

546
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,360
What's wrong?

547
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,360
Let me go.

548
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
Let me go.

549
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,360
Let me go.

550
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,360
Let me go.

551
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,360
He's Xiao Chunzi.

552
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,360
He's my sister.

553
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,360
What are you doing?

554
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
What are you doing?

555
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360
Come on.

556
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,360
What are you doing?

557
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,360
What are you doing?

558
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
Don't be anxious.

559
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,360
You'll never see him again.

560
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,360
Don't be anxious.

561
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,360
Don't be anxious.

562
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,360
Don't be anxious.

563
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
Qi Long.

564
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,360
Isn't he...

565
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
Send him to Tianjin.

566
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,360
He'll help you get the head of Gu Xuanwu back.

567
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,360
That's it.

568
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,360
He killed me.

569
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,360
He wanted to take me with him.

570
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
But

571
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,360
I wanted to see you so much.

572
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,360
So I left him alone.

573
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,360
Then I got the head of Gu Xuanwu back.

574
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:20,360
I was sent to Tianjin with this hostage.

575
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,360
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

576
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,360
His magic was pressing me.

577
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,360
I tried my best

578
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,360
to keep him safe.

579
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,360
Actually

580
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,360
I've watched the hostage move.

581
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,360
But I can't do anything.

582
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,360
I'll do my best

583
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,360
to make you feel better

584
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,360
when he wants to hurt you.

585
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
Why are you doing this?

586
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
Go away.

587
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,360
Wujiang, go away.

588
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,360
Wujiang, go away.

589
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,360
Wujiang, go away.

590
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,360
Wujiang, go away.

591
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,360
Wujiang, go away.

592
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,360
It's okay.

593
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,360
What's wrong?

594
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,360
What's wrong?

595
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,360
Don't be so polite.

596
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,360
You're too serious.

597
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,360
Don't be so polite.

598
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,360
Are you going to make him like this?

599
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,360
Are you?

600
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,360
No.

601
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,360
It's not his fault.

602
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,360
I...

603
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,360
I can't keep going.

604
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,360
Don't remind me again.

605
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,360
My will

606
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,360
will become more and more important.

607
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,360
Thanks to his blood

608
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,360
I can make Yu Bin Qi Luo's magic.

609
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360
I can tell you

610
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,360
a little bit more.

611
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,360
Shi Tou Ke,

612
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,360
I'm leaving.

613
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,360
I promise you.

614
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,360
Promise me.

615
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,360
You must take good care of yourself.

616
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
I promise you.

617
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,360
Shi Tou Ke,

618
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,360
I'm leaving.

619
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
I promise you.

620
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,360
I promise you.

621
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,360
I promise you.

622
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,360
I promise you.

623
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,360
I promise you.

624
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,360
I promise you.

625
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,360
I promise you.

626
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,360
I promise you.

627
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
I promise you.

628
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
I promise you.

629
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
I promise you.

630
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,360
I promise you.

631
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,360
I promise you.

632
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,360
I promise you.

633
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,360
I promise you.

634
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,360
I promise you.

635
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,360
I promise you.

636
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,360
No.

637
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,360
Take you life.

638
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,360
No.

639
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,360
Thank you.

640
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,360
Finland.

641
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
Finland.

642
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,360
Russia and China.

643
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,360
What happened?

644
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,360
It's Wu Xin.

645
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,360
Didn't Wu Xin die?

646
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,360
Wu Xin didn't die.

647
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,360
She and Gu Xuan Wu are hiding in the heaven.

648
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,360
Minister Gu.

649
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
Have some tea.

650
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,360
I'm sorry, Xiao Chun.

651
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,360
I'm sorry.

652
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
She's about to die.

653
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360
She still remembers me.

654
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,360
I swear

655
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,360
I'll marry her.

656
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,360
But I can't even see her now.

657
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,360
Xiao Chun's life is on your side.

658
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,360
If you don't live well,

659
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,360
how can you be so impatient?

660
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
Yes.

661
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,360
I must live a life.

662
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,360
The puppet of Yue Qiluo has killed Tian Jin.

663
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,360
We have to make a plan.

664
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,360
I'll go back to revenge

665
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,360
after I get out of the army.

666
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,360
I'll revenge for Xiao Chun.

667
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,360
Mr. Su.

668
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,360
If you don't let me see the commander,

669
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,360
just wait and see.

670
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,360
I didn't let you see the commander.

671
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,360
He's just a mess at home.

672
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,360
He doesn't feel good at all.

673
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
What's wrong?

674
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,360
Stop selling me the coffin.

675
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,360
Just tell me the truth.

676
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,360
Wu Xin.

677
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,360
Are you ready?

678
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,360
Wu Xin.

679
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,360
Wu Xin.

680
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,360
Wu Xin.

681
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,360
Wu Xin.

682
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,360
Wu Xin.

683
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,360
I'm here.

684
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,360
I'm sorry.

685
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,360
This...

686
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,360
Well,

687
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,360
put on your clothes first.

688
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,360
Okay.

689
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,360
I'm here.

690
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,360
What are you doing?

691
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,360
You just grew up.

692
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,360
You can't say that, right?

693
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
You...

694
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,360
Wu Xin.

695
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,360
Be gentle.

696
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,360
He just grew up.

697
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,360
He's not even a water bean.

698
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,360
I know you care about your old man.

699
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,360
I know you care about your old man.

700
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,360
I know you care about your old man.

701
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,360
I know you care about your old man.

702
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,360
I know you care about your old man.

703
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,360
I know you care about your old man.

704
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,360
I don't care about him.

705
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,360
Who do I care about?

706
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,360
Yu'er.

707
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,360
Give us two dishes.

708
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,360
Two dishes.

709
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,360
We'd better have two hotpot wine.

710
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,360
How can we deal with the wedding?

711
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,360
Of course we can.

712
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,360
Don't ask so much about old man.

713
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,360
Yu'er.

714
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,360
Hurry up.

715
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,360
Master.

716
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,360
I have a big wedding.

717
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,360
I want to discuss it with you.

718
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,360
I'll put on the clothes.

719
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,360
No.

720
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,360
Master.

721
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,360
The 12th eunuch of the Great General of Tianjin

722
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,360
was found by the Great General.

723
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,360
He was kicked out.

724
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,360
I tell you.

725
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,360
What's more,

726
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,360
his son was killed.

727
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,360
The doctor of the Chinese Medical Academy

728
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,360
invited a doctor.

729
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,360
He didn't use it at all.

730
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,360
It's almost done.

731
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,360
The Great General's heart is in a state of chaos.

732
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,360
That's the good news you said.

733
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,360
No.

734
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,360
Listen to me.

735
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,360
If we succeed in the Great General's case,

736
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,360
it will be a fat meat.

737
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,360
And this is a great tree.

738
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,360
It will be a good tree.

739
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,360
It will be good for health.

740
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
I won't go.

741
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,360
I haven't grown up yet.

742
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,360
What? You haven't grown up yet?

743
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,360
You're not grown up

744
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,360
as a human now.

745
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,360
What?

746
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,360
What haven't you grown up?

747
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,360
I tell you.

748
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,360
You can't see the place.

749
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,360
You're still white.

750
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,360
I told you to catch the demon.

751
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,360
And I didn't tell you to sell yourself.

752
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,360
What's the relationship between you and the horse?

753
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,360
Anyway, I won't go.

754
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,360
The catch is too dangerous.

755
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,360
No.

756
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,360
When you go,

757
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,360
when you see someone,

758
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,360
who will take care of you like the god?

759
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,360
I'm your stepmother.

760
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,360
I'm your stepmother.

761
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,360
Listen to me.

762
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,360
If you dare to do anything,

763
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,360
I'll kill you.

764
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,360
As you wish.

765
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,360
As you wish.

766
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,360
You're not afraid.

767
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,360
Yu'er is afraid.

768
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,360
Don't tell me

769
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,360
that you're not a woman.

770
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,360
If you don't let me catch you,

771
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,360
I'll go to catch him.

772
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,360
Wait for me.

773
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,360
Who are you going to catch?

774
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,360
A mosquito.

775
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,360
It's winter.

776
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,360
Where are you going?

777
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,360
Look at this, Brother Wei.

778
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,360
It's a problem.

779
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,360
It's a problem.

780
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,360
No.

781
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,360
Master.

782
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,360
I'm begging you.

783
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,360
Please help me.

784
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,360
I'm old.

785
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,360
If I can't do it,

786
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,360
I'll be...

787
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,360
Amitabha.

788
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,360
It's useless to me.

789
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,360
Amitabha.

790
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,360
My master.

791
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,360
Please let me go.

792
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,360
Please help me.

793
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,360
I'm sorry.

794
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,360
I'm sorry.

795
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,360
What's going on?

796
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,360
I'm going to live again.

797
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,360
I'm going to live again.

798
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,360
You're old.

799
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,360
Is there really a ghost?

800
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,360
Master.

801
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,360
Do you like me?

802
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,360
Are you all me?

803
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,360
You're so rude.

804
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,360
You want to be a man?

805
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,360
You want to be a man?

806
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,360
Go to your dreams.

807
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,360
Help.

808
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,360
You're a man of heart.

809
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,360
You still have a lover.

810
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,360
Help.

811
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,360
Help me.
