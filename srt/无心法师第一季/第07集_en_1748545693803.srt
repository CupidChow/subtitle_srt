00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the greenery

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is shining on my face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if it were a universe

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The life is a dream

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The life is a dream

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One day

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You are clear and mysterious

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the background

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are clear and mysterious

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like a background

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You are clear and mysterious

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Like a background

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Counting

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Dying

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Counting

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Knowing

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Knowing

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,960
CONFID infectious

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You are the most beautiful woman

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Are you going to meddle in��time?

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,280
Come on,

37
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,000
he's not the one

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No, he shouldn't come.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
속 볶繠

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
She is an eternal soul

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I like it.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Look at this one.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's so pretty.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I like it.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Look at this one.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's pretty.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Look at this one.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's so pretty.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Shut up.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You, you and you.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You bastards.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What are you doing?

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're out of your mind.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Where did you go?

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're blind.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Did you hear that?

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Some of the guns were made by hand.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Some of them were made by hand during the release.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But it's not clear.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I found out that they lost so many.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Are they too smart?

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Or are you too incompetent?

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Sorry, Commander.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Commander.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I've known this man a long time ago.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Why don't you even give a shit?

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Commander.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm worried about the cleanliness.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But I've found out about this.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm worried about the fire.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Tell me.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How's the investigation going?

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's been a long time.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's not convenient to talk about it.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Then we'll keep the news.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Keep investigating.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Not enough.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Tell me.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The eunuchs are ready.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
When are we leaving?

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Tell them to follow me.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Come, let me.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Take my car.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Send the big master and the big sister to the mountain.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
They said it was fine.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why didn't they go?

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
They're not coming.

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The car is not free.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
How annoying.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We're still together.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay.

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Madam, Saturdayang is Miss D Honda's son.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He's cool.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We decided to bodied together at the BVC.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The rain starts now.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You特別 pals.

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
BVC?

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We're gonna watch you play.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Shut up,…?

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm scared when I'm asleep.

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Seriously.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I didn't expect to see such a beautiful girl in the water in the mountains and rivers.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is the name of the person.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Let's meet again.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
How to communicate more in the future?

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Bai Wenliu.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Boss Bai.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you meet any demon in your house,

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
we must communicate more.

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Master Gu,

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
is there a friend who can speak Chinese?

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Or a color match?

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yes.

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let's go.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I am Yu Xiaochun.

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I am the boss of this Qingchuxuan.

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's been a long time since we met.

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Come, let's go inside.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Miss Yue,

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
the dress is warm.

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's basically this style.

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's much more than others.

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's just a dress.

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's do it.

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes.

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's really hot.

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you want to come,

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
you can come to the ice-cold-cooking class.

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Really?

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Of course.

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What is this house for?

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This house is for the temper.

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's the place where I and my wife live.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Since you built such a house,

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
you ruined the whole house.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You are so rude.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Rude.

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This is...

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Let me explain.

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Since the news of the mountain villa has been published,

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
many friends have bought it.

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I met them in the mountain villa.

155
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This is Mr. Lu from Beiping.

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He will arrive tomorrow afternoon.

157
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And the last two guests.

158
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You are quite good at business.

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Mr. Lu, let me introduce you to him.

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is Mr....

161
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Mr. Bai,

162
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
you are the one who made the decision.

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Where are you going?

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I can see you everywhere.

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You are so stupid.

166
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So you know each other.

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You are a rich man.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You come to buy this wind-dry house.

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You don't need to pay for it.

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's not enough to pay for the house.

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What's the relationship between this wind-dry house?

172
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm afraid your waist bag is not warm enough.

173
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You are so bold.

174
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I want to see if you are really capable of

175
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
making the mountain villa.

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Everyone, please don't be so tired.

177
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I have prepared some wine for you.

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Please have a seat.

179
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We will talk later.

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Then I will take you to the wine room.

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,200
Long time no see.

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Just drunk.

183
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes.

184
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Wu Xin, come and have a look.

185
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Come, let's have tea.

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay.

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Come.

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Boss Yu,

189
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm an old man,

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
but I see your plate.

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm really a man.

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Why do you sell it?

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I told you it's not clean.

194
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's not clean.

195
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
There are a few things.

196
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's a bit exaggerated.

197
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Is it a mountain?

198
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's hard to find a place

199
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
to take a walk and take a walk.

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's scary.

201
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Some rumors are not true.

202
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's hard to find a place.

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's hard to find a place.

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But it's all about

205
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
the capture.

206
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's a pity

207
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
that I'm the boss.

208
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Boss Yu,

209
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
this person on the photo

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
is your wife, right?

211
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Why didn't she come down to have tea?

212
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Indeed,

213
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
the person on the photo

214
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
is indeed the one.

215
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Actually, I went out to buy clothes

216
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
for her.

217
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
When I was singing in Beiping,

218
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I met my wife.

219
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
She was my best friend.

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
She was my best friend.

221
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
At that time, there were still poor students.

222
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But every time I sang the bridge,

223
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
she would definitely come.

224
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
She would walk away after the battle.

225
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
She never deliberately sent flowers

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
or came to the stage to see me.

227
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
She loved my heart.

228
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It was my bridge.

229
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So,

230
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I actually pursued her.

231
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
When we were playing in the mountains together,

232
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:26,240
I found this

233
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
strange and strange

234
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
passing of the ghost.

235
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The people in the mountains

236
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
are getting less and less.

237
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I care for my wife.

238
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't care about business.

239
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I can't

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
earn the money

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
that I can't buy

242
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
because of the few people in the mountains.

243
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So, I sold her.

244
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Boss Yu is really

245
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
a man of love.

246
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Love is love.

247
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Business is business.

248
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Mr. Bai,

249
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
you are right.

250
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So,

251
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
the price of the villa

252
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
can be discussed again.

253
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But,

254
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I have a small request.

255
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I hope that

256
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
the house I live in

257
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
can be left to my wife

258
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
in the future.

259
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Of course,

260
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I can do business

261
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and make a deal.

262
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I will keep

263
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
the number of flowers

264
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
in the villa

265
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
in person.

266
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I like

267
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
the man of love.

268
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Your villa

269
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
is a good place to live.

270
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
No matter what,

271
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I will

272
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
have a good life.

273
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Mr. Cheng Menglu,

274
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I am sorry.

275
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But,

276
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
we only have money

277
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and a good fortune.

278
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
We don't want to talk about business.

279
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Since we are talking about business,

280
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I will take the initiative.

281
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I will help you.

282
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Good.

283
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's do it.

284
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Come on.

285
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Your unit is here.

286
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Good.

287
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,480
The patient that

288
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,000
you promised,

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:07,000
always

290
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I will live my life with you

291
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Boss Yu, you sing so well

292
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's time to rest

293
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Everyone, it's late

294
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You should rest early

295
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Tomorrow, when the other two are in the mountain

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
We will talk about the mountain decoration

297
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Boss Yu, I am really lucky

298
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
When the time comes

299
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't know if you will be so happy

300
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What are you talking about?

301
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Come, let's sing together

302
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's okay

303
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's probably the line of the song

304
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Let's go back to the room

305
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Come, please

306
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You can sing yourself

307
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Please

308
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Come

309
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Why is there a water drop?

310
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's raining

311
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Where did the water come from?

312
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's a one-star-star-star-star

313
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You are so good at singing

314
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I didn't expect that

315
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You are so small

316
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
There is a water drop

317
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Look

318
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I heard footsteps just now

319
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Maybe it's a little rain

320
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
There are footsteps

321
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Maybe the weather is too cold

322
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There is a hot spring outside

323
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The water must be the water drop of the hot spring

324
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Mr. Lu, don't worry

325
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
As for the footsteps

326
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It must be a response

327
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Really?

328
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Dear guests

329
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The reason why this mountain decoration is so strange

330
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Is that something strange happens sometimes

331
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But since Mr. Bai invited the hair stylist

332
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I think the hair stylist

333
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Can definitely clean the top and bottom of the mountain

334
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It won't affect the future experience

335
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What?

336
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Are you scared?

337
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You are scared

338
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You are scared of such a little thing

339
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What if it's really a ghost?

340
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It must be a cat

341
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Don't come here

342
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You are not coming

343
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Don't come here

344
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Are you scared?

345
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Not scared

346
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Do you want to accompany you?

347
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Are you scared?

348
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No.

349
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Do you want to accompany me?

350
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What are you talking about?

351
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Go back to your room.

352
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Okay.

353
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Don't be scared.

354
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What are you doing?

355
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You scared me.

356
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You said it's not scary.

357
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It hurts.

358
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm afraid that I won't be able to accompany you.

359
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's the only way.

360
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Did you bring the yellow clothes?

361
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I did.

362
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Okay. Go to sleep.

363
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'll be next door.

364
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Call me if you need anything.

365
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,000
BaiMIara.

366
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
BaiMIara.

367
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,000
If you find Mika here and break her up.

368
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Embraer Ch exile will Sama Y Bonus

370

I'll accompany you for a while.

Please go back, please.

376
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,240
Don't worry, father.

377
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,200
Everything will be all right.

378
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,840
Please.

379
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,240
All right.

380
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,880
You guys can just go back and rest a bit.

381
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
You can have some rest.

382
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,280
Yeah.

383
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,640
See you then.

384
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,200
See you then.

385
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,120
Bye.

386
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,240
Stir-fried disk我們,

387
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Go to sleep. I'm not leaving. I'll stay with you.

388
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
Go to sleep.

389
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
Go to sleep.

390
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,240
Go.

391
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Go to sleep.

392
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
Go to sleep.

393
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,240
Go to sleep.

394
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Boss Yu.

395
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Master, did you see Mr. Lu?

396
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,840
What's that?

397
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,040
Your body is destroying again.

398
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,040
It's up to the sky.

399
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,240
But the thing on the ground Isn't like it did.

400
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,540
Maybe he sent it for something?

401
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
No.

402
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,200
Mr. Lu is so generous.

403
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Who can do it?

404
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,920
I'm afraid no one can do it.

405
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,480
Have you found the evidence?

406
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,320
Yes.

407
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,160
The murderer is killed.

408
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,160
I told you it's not clean.

409
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,600
You even dare to do nothing.

410
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,720
You want to come here to be punished?

411
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,360
You're so desperate.

412
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,440
Boss Li,

413
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,320
you're so fierce.

414
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,080
You didn't tell the truth before.

415
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,800
Are you trying to fool us?

416
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,960
Mr. Bai,

417
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,320
my dress

418
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,560
has never happened before.

419
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,240
I only believe what I saw

420
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,480
and I don't care about it.

421
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,920
But now,

422
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,480
if you want to sell this dress,

423
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,600
you can't come here on time.

424
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,000
Mr. Bai is right.

425
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,160
We can discuss the price.

426
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,960
And the fee of the dress

427
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,760
is also on me.

428
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,240
The price is really not good.

429
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,960
I'll tell you the truth.

430
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,200
One thousand yuan is enough.

431
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,520
One thousand yuan?

432
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,040
One thousand yuan

433
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,880
can only be bought in one yard.

434
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,400
It's too little.

435
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,960
Mr. Bai,

436
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,120
there are two guests

437
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,400
going to the mountain this afternoon.

438
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,480
Or

439
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,400
you can listen to their opinions later.

440
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,440
I have something to do.

441
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,760
I'll leave first.

442
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,160
Goodbye.

443
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,120
Excuse me.

444
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,880
Where did you go these days?

445
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,400
Ms. Xu.

446
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:42,360
You have only

447
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,000
I have an idea here.

448
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,960
Boss Bai.

449
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,440
You have time.

450
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,360
I will go with you.

451
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,720
Do you have some other cooks?

452
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,000
What a coincidence.

453
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,120
Besides,

454
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,800
can you prepare food here?

455
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,360
Do you know this, Mr. Bai?

456
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,200
No, no, no.

457
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,400
I am a man.

458
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,600
I am lucky.

459
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,040
I am not close to anyone.

460
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,200
Don't worry about it.

461
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:17,960
I will do it.

462
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,680
Such a fart!

463
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,200
My guest!

464
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,080
Have you the ability to speed aêshe the building up?

465
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,200
Are you scared of the sound just like that?

466
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
What if it's a real ghost?

467
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
It must be a ghost.

468
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,040
How dare you run over to the castle without any preparation?

469
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,040
You're looking for death?

470
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,040
This white one is really a donkey pulling out the stone.

471
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,040
It looks like it's sitting on a piece of paper.

472
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,040
Actually, it's all black and dry in the belly.

473
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,040
What's wrong?

474
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
It's all because of the clothes.

475
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Boss Yu and Mrs. Yu are so pitiful.

476
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
She still wants to be a maid.

477
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,040
How do you know?

478
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
I passed by their room.

479
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,040
I heard that Boss Yu and Mrs. Yu were arguing.

480
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
I heard a big cover.

481
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,040
It was Mrs. Yu's heartache and the clothes.

482
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
They said it was their blood.

483
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
It was so sad.

484
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,040
But Boss Yu said it was because of Mrs. Yu's illness.

485
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,040
We must sell this dress.

486
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,040
I feel sad for them.

487
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
If we really help the white one,

488
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
it will be as dark as her.

489
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
Don't worry. I have my own idea.

490
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040
Really?

491
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
You don't trust me?

492
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
Stop crying.

493
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
You're even out of your room.

494
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
Go and soak in the hot spring.

495
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,040
Otherwise, it won't be good to come here.

496
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
Yes.

497
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
I forgot what you said.

498
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
I forgot.

499
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,040
This is a place for female guests.

500
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
Why are you here alone?

501
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,040
Okay. Go in.

502
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,040
I'll wait for you here.

503
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,040
Yue.

504
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Stop biting.

505
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Does it hurt?

506
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,040
Okay.

507
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,040
I won't bite.

508
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
I'll go in with you.

509
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,040
You're annoying.

510
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
It's so pretty.

511
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
I'll go in.

512
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
I'll go in.

513
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,040
I'll go in.

514
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,040
Why is it so cold?

515
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
No.

516
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,040
It looks like we need to boil water at home.

517
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,040
No.

518
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
No.

519
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
Yue.

520
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,040
What's wrong?

521
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,040
The water is cold.

522
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,040
I feel something is pulling me down.

523
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,040
What?

524
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,040
It's strange.

525
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
The water is hot.

526
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
No way.

527
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
There's something in the water.

528
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,040
Sometimes, it's not good to be in the water.

529
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
You should go in.

530
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
Don't be afraid.

531
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,040
Boss Yu.

532
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Where's Wu Xin?

533
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,040
I saw Wu Xin went down the mountain just now.

534
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,040
I need to pick up two friends.

535
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,040
Or I'll go find her for you.

536
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
Okay.

537
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
Super high-quality,

538
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
and more rewarding,

539
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
you can get more opportunities.

540
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,040
Join us soon.

541
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,040
The first in the Aomeng Fairy Peking Entertainment Center 994466.

542
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
Miss Yue.

543
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
It's cold outside.

544
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Why don't you go back and rest?

545
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
It'll be bad if the winter is over.

546
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,040
Fortunately, it's daytime now.

547
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,040
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

548
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,040
I'll go first.

549
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
I'm not sure.

550
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
I'll go and find her.

551
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,040
Boss Yu.

552
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Boss Yu.

553
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Boss Yu.

554
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
This is Shige Danyang.

555
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,040
No hard work.

556
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
You three

557
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,040
will be on the way here today.

558
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,040
As long as you see

559
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
a businesswoman

560
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
trying to get on the mountain,

561
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
tell them

562
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
the man in the mountain is dead.

563
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
Don't be polite.

564
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,040
If they don't listen to you,

565
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
just go for a walk.

566
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,040
Got it?

567
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
Yes.

568
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,040
Okay.

569
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
This old man

570
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,040
is indeed a good friend of a tiger.

571
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
No.

572
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
I have to tell Boss Yu.

573
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,040
The next day

574
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,040
I'll go to meet a girl.

575
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,040
I'll be there!

576
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,040
Boss Yu.

577
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,040
Boss Yu.

578
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,040
Boss Yu.

579
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Boss Yu.

580
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,040
Boss Yu.

581
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,040
Boss Yu.

582
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,040
Boss Yu.

583
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
Boss Yu.

584
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
Boss Yu.

585
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,040
Boss Yu.

586
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,040
Boss Yu.

587
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,160
I'm not...

588
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,160
I don't know you.

589
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,680
I don't know you.

590
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,880
I'm not human.

591
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,120
Si Ling, I'm not human.

592
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,880
You're talking nonsense.

593
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,920
I'm going to kill you.

594
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
Si Ling, I know I'm wrong.

595
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,080
Please spare my life.

596
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,040
I'm just going to let you take back the gun.

597
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
Si Ling,

598
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,880
believe me and go back.

599
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,960
Don't talk nonsense with me.

600
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,200
I'm not talking nonsense.

601
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,440
I beg you.

602
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,080
Please let me go.

603
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,040
Si Ling,

604
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,600
it's better to kill him

605
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,480
than to kill your son.

606
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,160
Besides, if you kill him,

607
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,000
you won't be able to find the soldiers.

608
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
If you want me to kill him,

609
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,600
why don't you give him a chance

610
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,960
to see how powerful he is?

611
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,760
You can say it.

612
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
Si Ling.

613
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,320
Thank you, Si Ling.

614
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
Thank you, Si Ling.

615
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,320
What are you doing?

616
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,560
I... I'm so hungry.

617
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,360
I need to eat.

618
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,200
How can it be?

619
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,480
Wait here.

620
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,280
I'll take him to the university.

621
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,280
Yes.

622
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,520
Come on.

623
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,520
Chief,

624
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,200
my teacher is afraid that

625
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,560
everything will be taken down.

626
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,480
You promised me

627
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
that you should be off.

628
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,560
Yes.

629
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,360
I've always been like this.

630
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,440
What are you doing?

631
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,120
Didn't you say

632
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,720
someone came to take me out?

633
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,320
Black and white, Wu Chang Zhen is waiting for you.

634
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,680

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,480
I'm all right.

639
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,240
It can be hidden by something multi-we gern Ikibuki.

640
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:56,920
If you want to escape,

641
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,600
you can evade that.

642
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,800

When you came here

654
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,360
Sinovac concluded

656
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,960

you wanted to fight with this NSG team.

658
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,800

663
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:29,880

Yes.

665
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,880
Go to the infirmary.

666
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,680
Pack the wound well.

667
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,680
It's late.

668
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,880
You should catch up with him.

669
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880

670
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,280
Thank you, Commander.

671
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,280
Miss.

672
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,480
Are you hungry?

673
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,080
Can I have a meal with you?

674
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,680
Let's go, boss.

675
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,480

676
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,080

00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480

688
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,480
Come.

689
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Come.

690
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
Come.

691
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
Come.

692
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,680
Come.

693
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,680
Come.

694
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,680
What's your name?

695
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,880
Yue Qiluo.

696
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,280
When you passed by the alley,

697
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,680
did you hear any sound?

698
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,880
I heard it.

699
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,880
I heard someone playing the drums.

700
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,280
Then I went to see it.

701
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,280
I saw you were full of blood.

702
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,880
And someone was lying there.

703
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,880
Then your soldiers ran over.

704
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,880
I knew they were playing the gun.

705
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,880
These money can be paid with a meal.

706
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,880
You can call them.

707
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,880
Where are you going?

708
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,880
I...

709
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,880
Can I come with you?

710
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
Why?

711
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,880
Because I can't go anywhere.

712
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,880
Yueya, I'm back.

713
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,880
Where did you go?

714
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,880
Why are you back now?

715
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,880
I saw something in the water.

716
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,880
I was so anxious to see you.

717
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
Yueya, don't be afraid.

718
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,880
I'm here to see you.

719
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,880
I'm here to see you.

720
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,880
I'm here to see you.

721
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,880
Yueya, don't be afraid.

722
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,880
I'm here to see you.

723
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,880
Yueya, don't be afraid.

724
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,880
I'm here to see you.

725
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,880
Don't come near me!

726
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,360
Bring the rest back now!

727
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:25,920
How about that?

728
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,560
Hurry!

729
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,840
Go ask the police here!

730
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,560
Disperse similarity坐!

731
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,000
Me?!

732
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,320
How can I choose these girls?

733
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,880
I just met a lot of girls.

734
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,560
I think you are a great date!

735
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,680
It's easier than boxing.

736
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,160
Давай, let's party!

737
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,320
No🐸

738
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,440
OK.

739
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,000
Women?

740
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,960
How is theMax family doing so far?

741
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,920
You go out.

742
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,200
Ouch.

743
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,520
You chill?

744
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,120
Yep.

745
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,600
Playing hide and seek with me.

746
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,600
What are you thinking?

747
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,880
By using this ph knit Dowager was supposed to apply it back back to his father, is he the trouble?

748
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:07,100
Anyways he liberté months 그럴 열심히 모르는 불꽂

749
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,400
You're Chu Zhou Impossible

750
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,560
But as for my 15 years here, where should I go?

751
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:21,560
Oh, Boss Yu went to pick up the buyers.

752
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,560
What? You didn't see him?

753
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,560
I didn't see him.

754
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,560
Oh, no.

755
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,560
What's wrong?

756
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,560
I saw the white, weird, little boy going down the mountain.

757
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,560
So I followed him up.

758
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,560
I found out that he was looking for someone to buy him a house.

759
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,560
Buy another house? Why?

760
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,560
Think about it. No one is going up the mountain.

761
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,560
Only he is alone.

762
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,560
Boss Yu didn't pick up the buyers.

763
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,560
He doesn't even know how to put up with them.

764
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,560
What? Why is he so shameless?

765
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,560
No.

766
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,560
If Boss Yu really meets them and gets angry,

767
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,560
he will be ashamed.

768
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,560
I want to go down the mountain.

769
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,560
I want to go with you.

770
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,560
Boss Yu.

771
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,560
Boss Yu.

772
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,560
Boss Yu.

773
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,560
Boss Yu.

774
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,560
Boss Yu.

775
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,560
Boss Yu.

776
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,560
Boss Yu, how are you?

777
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,560
At the same time, I met Xie Sui on the mountain.

778
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,560
He wanted to kill me.

779
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,560
I escaped with my life.

780
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,560
Do you remember whether he was in Baiwen?

781
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,560
He went down the mountain.

782
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,560
Did he?

783
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,560
Did he...

784
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,560
Boss Yu, don't worry.

785
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,560
Go and rest.

786
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,560
I will handle the rest.

787
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,560
Okay.

788
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,560
Hurry up.

789
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,560
Why is he gone?

790
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,560
Let's go.

791
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,560
I will give you a ride.

792
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,560
Boss Yu, where are you going?

793
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,560
I will go with you.

794
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,560
Boss Yu, I really need to see you.

795
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,560
Boss Yu, I really need to see you.

796
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,560
Boss Yu.

797
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,560
Boss Yu.

798
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,560
Boss Yu.

799
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,560
Boss Yu.

800
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,800
You want me to keep my word?

801
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,120
How about this supermint gallbladder?

802
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:05,660
Stand right where the guards are.

803
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,000
Yes.

804
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,680
They…

805
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,060
Did they all die?

806
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,560
They probably have.

807
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,060
But...

808
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,720
Those people who died were supposed to漂 freely in make this water.

809
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,640
And while they wereists in there,

810
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,760
they're still making this big amigurus.

811
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,140
There is a whole lot of explainer.

812
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,380
Who betrayed him?

813
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,440
Yes.

814
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,440
I don't know what happened.

815
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,660
But Jo Jo said it was unstable.

816
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,740
Jo Jo told me so.

817
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,960
But Ko Ko also told me that

818
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,760
I had lots of fault

819
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,200
and I said this love wish wouldn't tolerate me.

820
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,600
So I gave her an explanation?

821
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,720
If it was sembla,

822
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,080
Jio Jo joined for the competition next Saturday.

823
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:01,040
《The Story of the Phoenix》

824
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:08,520
风带着它走上最长的旅途

825
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:15,920
一路跟着晚霞再没有停下

826
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:24,220
用这温暖星光 也问过夜里的话

827
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:30,620
一路似一流浪 还记得故乡吗

828
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:37,820
人生名穿梭 时间的角落

829
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:45,460
它静静看着人们爱过和恨过

830
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:49,020
算时间飘的

831
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,220
随它忘了 我记得

832
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:59,820
它离开它的回忆重复的活着

833
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:08,020
人生名穿梭 时间的角落

834
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:14,820
它静静看着人们爱过和恨过

835
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:18,620
算时间飘的

836
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,820
随它忘了 我记得

837
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:29,420
它离开它的回忆重复的活着

838
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:40,420
离开它的回忆后重复的活着

839
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:50,820
离开它的回忆

840
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,220
奇怪 为什么每个人的脖子上都有牙印

841
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,220
你们要死了吗

842
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,420
那就留在这儿吧

843
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,020
I'm wondering how to get out of here

844
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,420
I lost you

845
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,420
Everything is meaningless to me

846
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,420
No matter what I do, I will keep you

847
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,420
Chuchu, I'm here to save you

848
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:44,420
Chuchu, I'm here to save you
