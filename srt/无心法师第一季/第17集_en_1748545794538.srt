The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the grass and the shadow

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is full of love and face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if the clouds are floating

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The pain is so hard to describe

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The madness of ice

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Just one day

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You clearly have a life

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In the north side of the lake

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You clearly have a life

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In the north side of the lake

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You clearly have a life

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
In the north side of the lake

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You clearly have a life

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The Love by 花花

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yuya, what time is it?

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What time is it? What time is it?

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What time is it?

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
According to Li, yesterday was a night shift

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What time is it?

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I can't tell you

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He doesn't want to do anything to you

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He is so worried about you

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Get lost

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What's wrong?

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He doesn't want to do anything to you

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He is worried about you

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Master, good morning

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I want you to see if I can do it

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Master, good morning

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There is only a dream

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's go

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There is only one dream

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You肉 is over

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yuya, come on

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We need to stop

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We need to stop

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's go

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Come on

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Come on

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We need to stop

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Mr. Leo

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
I've got to call him.

58
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,920
Tonight, exaggerate it for me.

59
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,920
Your Austin is a lot!

60
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,140
Give me turn first.

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Be careful with your head.

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:19,600
meters

63
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:30,440
w

64
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,800
m

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:18,240
I spend a hundred years cleaning your house that way and I'll build everything possibly worse for you.

66
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Zhang Xianzong, hurry and get me up!

67
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What's wrong? What happened?

68
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You're hurt?

69
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Leave here first.

70
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This place is not safe. Hurry and seal the cave and go down the mountain.

71
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We'll talk about the rest later.

72
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Put the cave down!

73
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes! You two, put the cave down!

74
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Go!

75
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Does it still hurt?

76
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm fine.

77
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
How is it?

78
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I can't die.

79
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But it's a pity that this skin is still in the cave.

80
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If my skin is damaged, it's heartless.

81
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I must take the moon off.

82
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Even if I don't need it, you'll destroy it and get this bad breath.

83
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Hold it.

84
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's okay.

85
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's not poisonous.

86
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's just a little bit of skin.

87
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You think it hurts so much because you took it off?

88
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Hold it.

89
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It doesn't hurt anymore, does it?

90
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll let my subordinate go to the town to buy some high-end medicine.

91
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You'll be at the bottom in a few days.

92
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Zhang Xianzong.

93
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Why are you so nice to me?

94
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Why are you so nice to me?

95
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Because I love you.

96
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But I don't love you.

97
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I know.

98
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But it's okay.

99
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
For me, I want to take care of you and be with you.

100
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm satisfied.

101
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Isn't it love that you want to love?

102
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Love is love.

103
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But there are not many people in this world who love each other.

104
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's hard to love.

105
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There are more people like me.

106
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
For me, I love you.

107
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No one will help me.

108
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Zhang Xianzong.

109
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I really don't love you.

110
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But I will protect you.

111
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay.

112
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You picked up the mine today, right?

113
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm telling you, there is indeed a mine there.

114
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But I'm telling you not to move.

115
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Why?

116
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I used to be in that cave for decades.

117
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I've always known there was a mine next door.

118
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But I've never touched it.

119
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The reason why you picked up the mine today

120
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
is because you're so nice to me.

121
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I dare not touch anything.

122
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
How dare you touch it?

123
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But since I can see there is a mine there,

124
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I can see it for sure.

125
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Will they...

126
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So you should let the news out.

127
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let them know that you want to open this mine.

128
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm telling you,

129
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm telling you,

130
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
this mine...

131
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Come on, drink some.

132
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Do you know the mine?

133
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't know.

134
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Tell me the news.

135
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You want to dig the mine on the mountain?

136
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Dig the mine?

137
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Of course.

138
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's a good thing.

139
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
If we dig it,

140
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
our brothers will eat and drink the incense.

141
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,600
I'm telling you, Commander Zhang is going to dig a well.

142
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,200
Really?

143
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
There's no way.

144
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,400
I'll leave first.

145
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,800
I'll leave first.

146
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,400
Okay.

147
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,000
Commander Zhang is the most diligent.

148
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,400
He's been doing it for a long time.

149
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,600
He's been doing it for a long time.

150
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Okay.

151
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm telling you, Commander Zhang is going to dig a well.

152
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Dig a well.

153
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Come on, let me tell you something.

154
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,200
What's up?

155
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,800
Commander Zhang is going to dig a well.

156
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,400
Dig a well?

157
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,200
Where?

158
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,000
To the west.

159
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,800
I heard he brought two soldiers.

160
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
Two soldiers?

161
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So many people.

162
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,800
How big is the well?

163
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Yes.

164
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Commander Zhang.

165
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Commander Zhang sent someone to dig a well.

166
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
What?

167
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,200
Commander Zhang?

168
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,600
What's the meaning of Commander Zhang?

169
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,800
He's a little blind.

170
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,400
He dares to dig a well?

171
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,800
He's standing there.

172
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,000
He's going to dig a well.

173
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,400
What's the matter with the well?

174
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
He's not going to dig a well?

175
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,400
Okay.

176
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,600
I'm going to dig a well.

177
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Tomorrow.

178
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,200
You take someone to the mountain tomorrow.

179
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,800
We'll talk about the well after we finish the digging.

180
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,600
Yes, Commander Zhang.

181
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,600
Hurry up and find a wife.

182
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,400
You're always here for me.

183
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
You have to serve me.

184
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,600
You're my sister.

185
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,800
Go and give me some snacks.

186
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Got it.

187
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,600
Old Gu.

188
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,800
Are you going to the well?

189
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,000
Of course.

190
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,600
Commander Zhang is dead.

191
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,800
Can you go?

192
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,400
I think the well is a little weird.

193
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,000
What's wrong?

194
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,200
When I was in the well last time,

195
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,800
I found something.

196
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,000
What is it?

197
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,600
I escaped too fast.

198
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,200
I didn't see clearly.

199
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,400
It's just a group of shadow.

200
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,800
They're all small.

201
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,200
It seems hard to deal with.

202
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Is it a bear?

203
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
No.

204
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,800
Definitely not.

205
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,600
What if you get into a well?

206
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,200
What if you get into it?

207
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,600
It doesn't matter what you get into.

208
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,000
Actually, I don't want to go there so quickly.

209
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,400
I was thinking

210
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,000
to train the group of people

211
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,200
who came to me.

212
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,000
I want to train some new people.

213
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,600
You see,

214
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,800
the plan has changed.

215
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,400
My plan has to change too.

216
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,000
I can't just stay here

217
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and fight with strangers.

218
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,600
If there's any change,

219
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,800
I'm afraid I can't hold it.

220
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,600
That's right.

221
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,200
It's all because of Zhang Xianzong.

222
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,000
He doesn't want to go with me.

223
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,800
I have to take him down.

224
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,000
You should check on the money.

225
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,200
Don't care about money or not.

226
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,000
If I really get into something,

227
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,400
I'll buy him some money.

228
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,600
It's a real deal.

229
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,800
What is a real deal?

230
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,600
Stop right there.

231
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,800
Come on, sit down.

232
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,400
Little girl, what do you know?

233
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,000
You should be careful.

234
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
It's not that simple.

235
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,400
Stop talking nonsense.

236
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,800
Tell you what,

237
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,400
there must be a way to get there.

238
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,600
I won't go this time.

239
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,400
The Wenxin is too close.

240
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,000
If Yue Qu Lou finds out,

241
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,800
I'll be in trouble for you.

242
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
It's true.

243
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,800
It's true.

244
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,200
You two should stay here for a while.

245
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,800
Be careful.

246
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,400
Once you get into something,

247
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,800
you'll be in trouble.

248
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,200
Tell me.

249
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,400
Okay.

250
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,200
Don't worry.

251
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Yu, the camp is almost ready.

252
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,000
You two,

253
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,600
take care of the area here.

254
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,800
The most important thing is to check

255
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,200
if there are any people or something else.

256
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,600
Yes.

257
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,400
Be careful.

258
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,600
Come here.

259
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,000
I'll give you some words.

260
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,600
Okay.

261
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,600
Look here.

262
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,800
And here.

263
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,000
Commander Gu, look at these watermelons.

264
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,600
Commander Guan,

265
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,000
the check is done. Everything is normal.

266
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Did you find anything suspicious?

267
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,600
No.

268
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
There's nothing.

269
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,200
Go ahead.

270
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,600
Yes.

271
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,600
Commander Gu, since there's nothing wrong,

272
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,000
let's go and check it out.

273
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,600
But...

274
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,400
The commander has already told us before we leave.

275
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
We must hurry up to start the work.

276
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,000
We won't check it out.

277
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,400
How can we open the mine?

278
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,200
Yes.

279
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,000
Everyone, get ready.

280
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,400
Be careful.

281
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,200
Don't worry.

282
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,800
We're eating dinner after all.

283
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,200
Yes.

284
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,000
Hurry up.

285
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Hurry up.

286
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,600
Yes.

287
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,800
This is the protective suit.

288
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,600
It's a small shoe.

289
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
It's for keeping you safe.

290
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Don't leave the camp.

291
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,600
Go back now.

292
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Be careful.

293
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Okay.

294
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Pack up.

295
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,800
Brother,

296
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,600
I think there's a sound.

297
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Oh, this sound is fine.

298
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Let's hurry up and start the work.

299
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Okay.

300
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,800
What's the time?

301
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,600
Two in the middle.

302
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Two in the middle?

303
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Why won't they come up?

304
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,000
Is it possible that

305
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,600
Wu Xin's words are really serious?

306
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,200
What's the problem?

307
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,600
Wu Xin's words are serious.

308
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,000
Captain.

309
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Are you okay?

310
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Who's that?

311
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,800
Hurry up.

312
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,200
Are you okay?

313
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,400
Come.

314
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,600
Come.

315
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,200
Come.

316
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,600
It's okay.

317
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,200
Come.

318
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,000
Pack up.

319
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,400
Hurry up.

320
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,600
Pack up.

321
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,400
Come.

322
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,600
How are you?

323
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,200
It's okay.

324
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,000
Come.

325
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,600
What's going on down there?

326
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,000
It's okay.

327
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,200
This hole

328
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,000
was damaged by the fire.

329
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,200
It's a bit loose.

330
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,000
We were too cruel just now.

331
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,600
We accidentally caused a slight collapse.

332
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,000
We were a bit frightened.

333
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,900
But luckily,

334
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,200
we were safe.

335
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,800
Don't worry.

336
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
It's nothing serious.

337
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,000
It's good that you're fine.

338
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,400
It's good that you're fine.

339
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
Brothers,

340
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
you've worked hard.

341
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Let's go.

342
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Let's ask for help.

343
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,000
Okay.

344
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,800
What did the minister say?

345
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,400
Nothing.

346
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,800
It's just some nonsense.

347
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,400
He told us that it's normal to be there.

348
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,800
He told us to be careful.

349
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,800
That's the best.

350
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,800
Come.

351
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I said I don't want to eat.

352
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,400
Why are you eating again?

353
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,000
What's wrong?

354
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,200
Recently, the yellows are salty.

355
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,400
I always want to eat melon seeds.

356
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,800
I always eat all the seeds.

357
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,200
Come.

358
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,400
Let me see.

359
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,400
Don't eat anymore.

360
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,000
I heard a new word in the play.

361
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,800
It's called secret music.

362
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,200
Secret music?

363
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,800
What is it?

364
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,600
After the wedding,

365
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,800
we go to a place

366
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,600
and play for a month.

367
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,200
Where are you going?

368
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,400
Anywhere.

369
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
As long as I don't go to a place,

370
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,600
I can go anywhere.

371
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
It's fresh.

372
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,800
Where do you want to go?

373
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,800
How would I know?

374
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,600
I'm a blind girl.

375
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,000
I've been to Wenxian and Tianjin

376
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,400
except for my family.

377
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,000
How about we go to Beiping?

378
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,800
Is it far?

379
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,600
No.

380
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
We'll sit on the train and play.

381
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,200
Let's go.

382
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,600
Okay.

383
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,400
It's so lively.

384
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,800
So lively.

385
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,600
Come on.

386
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,000
Come on.

387
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,200
Come on.

388
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
Come on.

389
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,800
Come on.

390
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,600
Come on.

391
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,800
It's so lively.

392
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,400
Let's go.

393
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,200
I'll go to Beiping.

394
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Please take it for me.

395
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Thank you.

396
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,000
Okay.

397
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Come on.

398
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,800
I've been to Wenxian and Tianjin

399
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
except for my family.

400
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,400
I've been to Wenxian and Tianjin

401
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,600
except for my family.

402
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,400
Life is a journey

403
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,000
and a road to time.

404
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,400
It's so lively.

405
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,800
It's so lively.

406
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,000
It's so lively.

407
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,800
It's so lively.

408
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,400
it's so lively.

409
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,400
It's so lively.

410
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
It hurts.

411
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
It hurts.

412
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
You sit down.

413
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Ready?

414
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
3, 2, 1.

415
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400
Look, after five tests,

416
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
we can make a decision.

417
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Although the amount is not big,

418
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
the quality is high.

419
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,400
The quality is high.

420
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Now we can start.

421
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
We can start?

422
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
Yes.

423
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
The better the big one is,

424
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
the sooner it is.

425
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,400
But now the skill and equipment are open.

426
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
It will take a few days.

427
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
You have been down so many times.

428
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
You didn't touch anything.

429
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
What?

430
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,400
It's something very dangerous.

431
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,400
The mining must be dangerous.

432
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
But be careful.

433
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
If you don't come here,

434
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
there will be no accident.

435
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,400
It seems like you didn't touch anything.

436
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
You didn't find anything.

437
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Fine.

438
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Since it is like this,

439
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
we can do it according to the order of the general.

440
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
The general let us catch the tight.

441
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Then we can catch the tight.

442
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
We have many soldiers here.

443
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
Let them go first.

444
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
We can run after the stone is up.

445
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
See?

446
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Fine.

447
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
I will go to order.

448
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Okay.

449
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Go.

450
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Come in.

451
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Oh, it'solar 내가?

452
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,400
A key.

453
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,400
I know it.

454
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,960
I'll start digging the gold mine.

455
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,960
Okay.

456
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,300
Let's wait and see.

457
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
What kind of good play?

458
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,960
Or you think

459
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,460
why I don't let you go to dig the gold mine?

460
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,300
There are things inside.

461
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,400
Who digs and who dies?

462
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
By the way,

463
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,640
didn't Wu Xin come with him?

464
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,440
No.

465
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,880
If something happens,

466
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,880
I don't believe he won't come.

467
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
There is no movement.

468
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
It's been so long since we went down.

469
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,880
Why there is no movement at all?

470
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,880
Why don't you go down and have a look?

471
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,880
Let's wait a little longer.

472
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
Help!

473
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,880
Help!

474
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
Hurry up!

475
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
Come on.

476
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
Help!

477
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
Help!

478
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
Help!

479
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
Help me!

480
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
Come on.

481
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
Help!

482
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
Help!

483
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
Help!

484
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
Help!

485
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,880
Go up!

486
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
Go up!

487
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,880
Help!

488
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Hurry up!

489
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Put the hole in the hole!

490
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,880
Hurry up!

491
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,880
Hurry up!

492
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Hurry up!

493
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,880
Captain.

494
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
You go out first.

495
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
Yes.

496
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,880
How are you two?

497
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
To be honest,

498
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,880
what did you see in the mine?

499
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,880
Speak!

500
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,880
It's my fault!

501
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,880
It's a big fault!

502
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,880
There was a shadow.

503
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
It was a shadow.

504
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
We came here all of a sudden.

505
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
At that time,

506
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
we ran out of the house.

507
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
We were watching the brothers.

508
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
One was shot down by the gun.

509
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,880
You fool!

510
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
The skin was gone.

511
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,880
It was like...

512
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
like a white flower.

513
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,880
It was like a bone.

514
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
A bone?

515
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,880
It's my fault.

516
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
Bone.

517
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
They...

518
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
Anything else?

519
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Don't worry, Captain.

520
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
We've checked everything.

521
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
Nothing serious.

522
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
This is not a serious problem.

523
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,880
It should be here.

524
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Here?

525
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,880
Go and take care of them.

526
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,880
Yes.

527
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,880
Captain, you go find me.

528
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,880
I've found out about the White Pill.

529
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,880
When the fire started,

530
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,880
a bear was in the mountain.

531
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,880
It was a bear.

532
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
A bear?

533
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
Yes.

534
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,880
Tell them not to go around

535
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
and wander around.

536
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,880
If there's a chance,

537
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,880
we'll punish them.

538
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,880
Yes.

539
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
No.

540
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,880
Arrest those two medical staff.

541
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,880
Don't let them get in touch with anyone.

542
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Yes.

543
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,880
What's that sound?

544
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
Over there.

545
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
Let's go check it out.

546
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
What's that?

547
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Go.

548
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Stop!

549
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,880
Captain, look.

550
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,880
There's a stick here.

551
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
Stick?

552
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
Did they stay here?

553
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,880
Keep searching.

554
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
Yes.

555
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
What's that?

556
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
A bear?

557
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
A bear?

558
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
I don't know.

559
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
You...

560
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
A bear is so fierce.

561
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,880
I heard that it's lost half of its body.

562
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,880
I don't know.

563
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
I don't know.

564
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,880
I don't know.

565
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,880
I don't know.

566
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,880
I don't know.

567
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
I don't know.

568
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
I don't know.

569
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,880
I don't know.

570
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
I don't know.

571
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,880
It's lost half of its body.

572
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,880
In my hometown,

573
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,880
there are so many bears.

574
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,880
Once you catch them,

575
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,880
you'll be killed.

576
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,880
Really?

577
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,880
Yes.

578
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,880
Enough.

579
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
Stop talking.

580
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
Go to take a shower.

581
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
Go to take a shower.

582
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,880
I won't go there.

583
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,800
Anything momciate can do.

584
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,880
Enough.

585
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,880
Just you wait.

586
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
ンモリ should friendgle with an other teammate.

587
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,880
there is no water ahead.

588
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,880
Bring it here.

589
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
No.

590
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,880
I won't.

591
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,880
Leave here.

592
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,880
Let's see.

593
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,840
That fat thing.

594
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,880
What if Yue Qiluo finds out?

595
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,880
I'll give you a hard time.

596
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,880
What do you mean?

597
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,880
Take some medicine and blow it up.

598
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,880
After that,

599
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,880
there's nothing to be ashamed of.

600
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,880
I'm still a kid.

601
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,880
Who's a kid?

602
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,880
You're a kid.

603
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,880
I'm not a kid.

604
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,880
I'm not a kid.

605
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,880
Look.

606
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,880
You're not young.

607
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,880
100 years ago

608
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,880
Commander

609
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,880
Wake up

610
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,880
Something's wrong.

611
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,880
Something's wrong.

612
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,880
Right.

613
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,120
Dead!

614
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,080
How was it,

615
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,360
God Puerto?

616
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,840
It was a pleasant or drains you

617
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,120
too serious for me.

618
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,880
As long as I've been Netherlands.

619
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,040
Don't worry,

620
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,080
I've seen all the ThemaINGING.

621
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:59,080
But... but I don't know why they are like this.

622
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080
I'm here.

623
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,080
Don't be afraid.

624
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,080
Clean up the county magistrate.

625
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,080
Yes.

626
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,080
Listen, the people who were married a few days ago are all dead.

627
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,080
I'm not a lawyer.

628
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
Right.

629
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
The chief said it was a blind man.

630
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,080
He's lying.

631
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Right.

632
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
A blind man can't be like this.

633
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,080
I didn't expect the chief to lie to us.

634
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,080
He's taking our lives instead.

635
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,080
Right.

636
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,080
Chief.

637
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
Take the trusted man to the heaven.

638
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,080
Ask the chief's lawyer to come here.

639
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,080
Yes.

640
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,080
Fa Shi, let's go inside.

641
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Fa Shi.

642
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
Fa Shi.

643
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,080
Fa Shi.

644
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
Something happened to Jin Kong.

645
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,080
Master Gu, let you go.

646
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
Don't worry.

647
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,080
Let's drink some water.

648
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
Let's go.

649
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,080
I got it.

650
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
Here, drink some water.

651
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,080
Thank you.

652
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,080
Master Gu, something happened.

653
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,080
Let's pack up and go there.

654
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
Okay.

655
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,080
I'll send him a pill in the spring.

656
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,080
I'll go get it ready.

657
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,080
Wait a minute.

658
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,080
I'm thinking of bringing another person.

659
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
Okay.

660
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,080
Go.

661
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,080
Okay.

662
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,080
Chief Chu Chen, let me introduce you.

663
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,080
This is the history scholar of the UK.

664
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,080
James Werson.

665
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,080
He came here to visit the city.

666
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,080
He wanted to know about the mysterious history of the Qingyun Temple.

667
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,080
Speaking of this history,

668
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,080
where should I start?

669
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,080
A period of great history must be made up of a great man.

670
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,080
Mr. Werson said that a great history must have great characters.

671
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,080
So, Chief, please tell us about the great characters

672
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,080
from the Qingyun Temple.

673
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080
Speaking of the history of the Qingyun Temple,

674
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,080
it's a long history.

675
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,080
It's been more than 400 years.

676
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,080
It's not a long story.

677
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,080
It's called a human being.

678
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,080
I'll...

679
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Master,

680
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,080
I'm here to visit you.

681
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,080
Sorry, please enjoy yourselves.

682
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,080
I'll go there.

683
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
This way.

684
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,080
So, this man is quite good.

685
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,080
That's right.

686
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,080
Let's take this opportunity to get rid of him.

687
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,080
You can leave the city alone.

688
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,080
I'll help you to make up for this.

689
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,080
Go.

690
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,080
With my help, you can run faster.

691
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
Mr. Welson,

692
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,080
Qingyun Temple has a long history.

693
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,080
This is...

694
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,080
Let me introduce you to him.

695
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,080
He's a British historian.

696
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,080
He's Werson.

697
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
Nice to meet you.

698
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,080
He's here to visit Chief Chu Chen Zi.

699
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,080
He wants to know about the mysterious history of the Qingyun Temple.

700
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,080
He's a friend of mine from the channel.

701
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,080
You said something at home.

702
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,080
Hurry up and get it.

703
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
No hurry.

704
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
I heard from you two

705
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,080
that you want to know about the history of the Qingyun Temple.

706
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,080
There must be a person who knows about it.

707
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,080
Please sit down.

708
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,080
Please sit down.

709
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
Okay.

710
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,080
This man is the master of the Taoism Sect.

711
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,080
The little monk Zhang Xizong,

712
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,080
who is a scholar of the Taoism Sect,

713
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,080
is here to visit you.

714
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,080
No hurry.

715
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,080
When I finish talking to Mr. Welson,

716
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,080
you can leave.

717
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
You're not in a hurry.

718
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,080
Please explain to Mr. Welson.

719
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,080
Our interview today is here.

720
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,080
I'm really sorry.

721
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,080
We'll take our leave now.

722
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,080
Okay.

723
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,080
I'm really sorry.

724
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
I'm really sorry.

725
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,080
I'm really sorry.

726
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,080
We're leaving now.

727
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
I'll see you off.

728
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,080
Goodbye, sir.

729
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
Take care.

730
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,080
Wuxian.

731
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,080
You're too much today.

732
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,080
Taoist.

733
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,080
Don't be so impolite.

734
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,080
I have a friend, Mr. Wang.

735
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,080
He's a famous scholar of the Qingyun Temple.

736
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,080
Maybe he's very interested in your story.

737
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
You dare?

738
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,080
Taoist.

739
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,080
Don't force me.

740
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,080
Do you believe I'll go now?

741
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,080
Maybe he can add something to your story.

742
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,080
Turn it around.

743
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
Turn it around.

744
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,080
Stop!

745
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,080
I'll go with you!

746
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,080
The old man is here.

747
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,080
You're fat again.

748
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Long time no see.

749
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,080
You're so broad-minded.

750
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
You're so tall.

751
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
You know nothing.

752
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,080
This is called a talisman.

753
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
And.

754
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,080
Don't keep challenging the old man.

755
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,080
He looks like a young man.

756
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,080
I'm a little girl.

757
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,080
Don't say that.

758
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,080
Don't take away my wife.

759
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,080
Don't take away my wife.

760
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,080
I'm a young man.

761
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,080
I'm a young man.

762
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
You're too old.

763
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
I'm a little girl.

764
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
I'm a young woman.

765
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,080
I'm a young woman.

766
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,080
I'm a young woman.

767
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,080
You're too old.

768
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,080
Xiao Liang is quite lovely.

769
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,680
Why do you think your family is getting more and more tender?

770
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,280
You're like a breadwinner.

771
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,680
Be careful not to be taken away.

772
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,280
You're the one who's taking the lead.

773
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,080
Just...

774
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,680
Master, I'm telling you.

775
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,680
I don't know what's going on these past two days.

776
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,080
I'm so confused.

777
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,480
It's only a few days.

778
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,880
I'm starting to run away. What should I do?

779
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,080
Fine. Do something legal.

780
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,680
What legal? It's not a joke.

781
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,280
Look, you don't understand this.

782
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,680
This is not a joke. It's a real thing.

783
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
It's also a real thing to do.

784
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,280
I think I'm a good student.

785
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,680
I'm a good student.

786
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,480
You're right.

787
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,480
The Chief of Chuchan Bureau is a great man of the Great Marshal.

788
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,480
He's a great man of the world.

789
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,480
He's not more than anything in legal matters.

790
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,680
I think you're a bit modest.

791
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,880
Master Gu, don't worry.

792
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,480
I'll keep the peace treaty in mind.

793
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,680
Sister, let's go.

794
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,480
Now.

795
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:29,680
It's a real world.

796
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,800
It wasn't这样.

797
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,960
Didn't you...

798
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,400
Do you think I'll be able to make it?

799
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,680
Your feet were crushed with a fasting incidence.

800
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,080
Right?

801
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,200
People with a fit of height over the introduce Sedan prosecutors

802
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,600
and doctors

803
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,520
had been uncomfortable in the court between friendships.

804
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,640
Yes

805
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:22,260
Captain Gu, let's go ahead

806
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:23,760
Shark,

807
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,960
this porteThere isn't even a sip of dust

808
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,680
No.

809
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,880
Don't be too kind.

810
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,840
Let's go back.

811
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,120
No, no, no.

812
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,040
No, no, no.

813
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,200
Don't go back.

814
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,200
Don't go, you guys.

815
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,640
I've killed ten people.

816
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,720
I can't explain it.

817
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,560
What if you can't explain it to me?

818
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,560
I've been looking for it for a long time.

819
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,600
There's nothing.

820
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,200
Wait.

821
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,600
Maybe these little demons

822
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,600
are resting in the daytime.

823
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,760
They come out at night.

824
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,560
The two soldiers I've killed

825
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,880
are drinking at night.

826
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,240
They were killed on the way.

827
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,000
If you say so,

828
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,040
it's possible.

829
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,360
Sima is full of energy.

830
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,560
Let's come and see the fortune tonight.

831
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,680
You mean you're going to come to the feast

832
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,560
at night?

833
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,160
Yes.

834
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,120
It's not me.

835
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,280
It's us.

836
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,480
Let me tell you.

837
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,960
The world is precious.

838
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,440
I don't have time to go crazy with you.

839
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,640
The story of the old woman.

840
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,200
No.

841
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,240
Master, look at me.

842
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,560
Can I not come here?

843
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:36,800
Mr. Gu.

844
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,040
Go back and pack up.

845
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,240
There's still time to come at night.

846
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,520
Take some time.

847
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,080
And Wu Xie.

848
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,280

Why are there so many years and nights on this ground?

909
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,920
That little guy is dead.

910
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,920
What's that sound?

911
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,920

Run!

914
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,920
Where is the heartless?

915
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,920
Although he is alive,

916
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,360
he will sleep once every 100 years.

917
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,360
After he wakes up,

918
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,360
he will forget all the past 100 years.
