00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Even a fart

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000

Don't get used to it

194
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,300
The sister of your master

195
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,000
Is it your sister

00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,480

I'm satisfied with you.

198
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
Let me go.

199
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,840
Let me go.

200
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,840
Master.

201
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,120
You're back.

202
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
Well, I...

203
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,720
I... I care about my sister.

204
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,280
Do you care about her?

205
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,200
Well...

206
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,280
I'm telling you.

207
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
We're moving out.

208
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,360
Moving out?

209
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,000
No. What are you doing?

210
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,680
Master, Master.

211
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,000
Wait, wait, wait.

212
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,840
Well,

213
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
you want me to move out?

214
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,880
You have to promise me.

215
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
Why are you helping me?

216
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,880
I'm not helping you.

217
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,040
You're not helping me, right?

218
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,280
If I don't move out, I won't leave.

219
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,200
You won't leave, right?

220
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,240
If you don't leave, I'll go to the demon's room

221
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,440
and put you in bed tonight.

222
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,320
Okay.

223
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,280
Then I'll sleep in your bed.

224
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,480
Say it.

225
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,280
I'll say it when I think of it.

226
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,000
It's dangerous.

227
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,960
Don't be too late.

228
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,480
Get out.

229
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,000
Hurry up.

230
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,280
Where are you taking me?

231
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,600
You'll know in a minute.

232
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,600
Let's go.

233
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,880
It's cheaper here.

234
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,560
I don't have a place to live in this village.

235
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,880
I can afford it if I buy more.

236
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,160
Come on.

237
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,800
Why are you taking me here?

238
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,040
I'll pick some clothes for you.

239
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,120
Two guests.

240
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,600
These are all our new clothes.

241
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,080
You can have a look.

242
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,560
This...

243
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,600
I don't want any of these.

244
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,040
Let's go.

245
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,400
Yuya.

246
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,200
What are you doing?

247
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,400
I don't want any clothes.

248
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,080
Yuya.

249
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,200
How many clothes do I need?

250
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,960
You're so thin.

251
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,240
How much is it?

252
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,640
It's too expensive.

253
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,280
I don't want it.

254
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,280
How much is it?

255
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,360
It's only a few hundred yuan.

256
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,160
We can afford it.

257
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,120
Let's go.

258
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,960
I don't need any clothes.

259
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,600
Why do you want to buy me a clothesline?

260
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,920
I won't.

261
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,760
I'll buy you if I make money.

262
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,880
If not, I'll wear a 이거.

263
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
It's only a simple gift.

264
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,400
It's no use.

265
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Why are you dressed like a kid?

266
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,200
Okay. I'll go.

267
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,600
What are you doing?

268
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,680
Listen carefully!

269
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,900
Miss Lin, if you don't want her to buy me a thing,

270
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,720
I'll sit here and ride the bike!

271
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,840
I promise!

272
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,400
I've seen Ning that way.

273
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,200
Please get me.

274
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,280
Nobody can buy me a thing.

275
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,080
Watch your mouth.

276
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,820
Mr. Jiang.

277
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,480
Miss Lin.

278
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Get up.

279
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
If you really want to buy me some,

280
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
then...

281
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
buy me a bracelet.

282
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
What kind of bracelet?

283
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
The one from the store.

284
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
The easiest one.

285
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
No tricks.

286
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
A gold bracelet.

287
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Why do you want a bracelet?

288
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Because...

289
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
my mother has only one.

290
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
In this world,

291
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
no one is more painful than her.

292
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
When I was a child,

293
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
my mother told me that

294
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
when I grew up,

295
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
she would give me the bracelet as a dowry.

296
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
But later,

297
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
she died.

298
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
My father

299
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
gave me a pair of earrings

300
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
and a necklace

301
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
as a dowry.

302
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Don't be sad.

303
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Let's go buy a bracelet now.

304
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Let's go.

305
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Where is this?

306
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
This girl.

307
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
That's right.

308
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
She ran out of the store

309
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
and met Xiao Bai a few days ago.

310
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
She is so annoying.

311
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Stop talking nonsense.

312
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Follow her.

313
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
I'm going to wear a dowry this time.

314
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Then find a wolf king and marry him.

315
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Otherwise,

316
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
the bracelet won't be used as a place to live.

317
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
What are you talking about?

318
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Disgusting.

319
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
In the future,

320
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
if I have a daughter,

321
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
I'll pass this bracelet to her.

322
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
She will be my granddaughter in the future.

323
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Then I'll pass it to her.

324
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Come on.

325
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
You think

326
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
she lives in the private room?

327
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Yes.

328
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Why can't we afford it?

329
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Let's go back and report it.

330
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Yueyue.

331
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
Let's move out and live.

332
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Why?

333
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Look.

334
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
We have money now.

335
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
I want to buy a house.

336
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
What kind of house do you like?

337
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
It's not us.

338
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
It's you who have money.

339
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
I just want to help you manage the money.

340
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
What does it have to do

341
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
with your house?

342
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
I mean I want to buy a house.

343
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Don't you want to help me?

344
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
You know,

345
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
I'm a big man.

346
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
I'm not a big man.

347
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
I'm a big man.

348
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
I don't know

349
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
how to manage the house.

350
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
What if someone is in trouble?

351
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Yes.

352
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Remember.

353
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
If you want to live in this house,

354
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
you need to have a good idea.

355
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Be a northeastern man.

356
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
You need a big window.

357
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
You need to have a good air.

358
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
And,

359
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
you need to have a tree in the yard.

360
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
You can have a tree or a tree.

361
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Yes.

362
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
And,

363
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
you need to have a big kitchen.

364
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
If the kitchen is small,

365
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
it won't be smooth.

366
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Okay.

367
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
It's all yours.

368
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Master.

369
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Master.

370
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
I need to help you.

371
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Hurry up.

372
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Master.

373
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Do you need anything else?

374
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Master.

375
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Master, please.

376
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
Please.

377
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Master.

378
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
The hairpin is here.

379
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
The hairpin is here.

380
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Master.

381
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Please save me.

382
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Mr. Su, this is...

383
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Don't mention it.

384
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Since the last time

385
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
we had a big feast

386
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
in the restaurant,

387
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
we've been

388
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
waiting for three days

389
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
to get this cake.

390
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
This...

391
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
This is the first bite.

392
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
It's so bitter.

393
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Other guests are fine.

394
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
They're fine.

395
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
But Mr. Su,

396
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
shouldn't you come to me?

397
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
I won't be sick.

398
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Master.

399
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
I've got

400
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
several shots of this medicine.

401
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
They said I'm not

402
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
in the stomach.

403
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
There's no problem at all.

404
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
I know.

405
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
I know

406
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
they can't find out

407
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
what it is.

408
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Because

409
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
I'm not sick.

410
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
I'm a heavy shoe.

411
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
I'm sure I'm a heavy shoe.

412
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Those food,

413
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
they say

414
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
they're good things.

415
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
But in my opinion,

416
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
they're all

417
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
bitter,

418
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
stinky,

419
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
and rotten.

420
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
This...

421
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
You don't believe me,

422
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
go and eat.

423
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Yes, Master.

424
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
I'll show you

425
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,600
if I'm telling the truth.

426
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Master.

427
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Master.

428
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Please save my master.

429
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Master.

430
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Master.

431
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Please save me.

432
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
It's been three days.

433
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
If I continue like this,

434
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
even if I'm not sick,

435
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
you must

436
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
spit out all the stomach.

437
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Then I'll try it.

438
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Look again.

439
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
It's okay.

440
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
It's okay.

441
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
It's okay.

442
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
It's okay.

443
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
It's okay.

444
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Wait a minute.

445
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Master.

446
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
You haven't eaten for three days.

447
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
You can't do that.

448
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Come on.

449
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Go and buy something delicious for Master.

450
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
It's the best.

451
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Yes.

452
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Hurry.

453
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Hurry.

454
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Master.

455
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Come on, Master.

456
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
It's all a taste.

457
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
It's all tender.

458
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
It's a good taste.

459
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Come on, try it.

460
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Master Gu,

461
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
eat it.

462
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Let's eat together.

463
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Try it.

464
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Good.

465
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Since Mr. Su is just recovered,

466
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
he should eat some light eggs.

467
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
There's nothing else.

468
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
I'll leave now.

469
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
The hairpin is gone.

470
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
Since the hairpin is here,

471
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Suo Xin

472
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
can help us

473
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
check the house.

474
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
If the shoe is really

475
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
inside the house,

476
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
you're gone.

477
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
What if he comes

478
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
to find our Master?

479
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Yes.

480
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Dried grass and bamboo roots.

481
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Dried grass and bamboo roots.

482
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Dried grass and bamboo roots.

483
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Thank you for treating

484
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
our Master's illness.

485
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
It's a little bit of a joke.

486
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Please don't give up,

487
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Mr. Su.

488
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
Let's have a look.

489
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Let's have a look.

490
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Let's have a look.

491
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Let's have a look.

492
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
What?

493
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Mrs. Su,

494
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
I've read it carefully.

495
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
The house is really

496
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
a little bit small.

497
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
But our Master...

498
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
I can't help you.

499
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
Let go of me.

500
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Let go of me.

501
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Let go of me.

502
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Let go of me.

503
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
What are you doing?

504
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
What are you doing?

505
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Why don't you listen to me?

506
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,600
Mr. Wang,

507
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
have you married your wife?

508
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
No.

509
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Let's go.

510
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
What?

511
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
But you have to understand.

512
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
There is a good life in heaven.

513
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
There is a blessing in everything.

514
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Xu Xian saved Bai Shou.

515
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Mr. Su is here to return the favor.

516
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Listen,

517
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
if you let go of those little animals,

518
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
maybe very soon,

519
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
you will be able to marry

520
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
a fat boy

521
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
and a fat wife.

522
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
No.

523
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Let me turn it over.

524
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
Turn it over.

525
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
You're sick.

526
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
I'm a woman.

527
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
I'm a woman.

528
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
You're a woman.

529
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
You're a woman.

530
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
Let go of me.

531
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
I didn't scold you.

532
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Let go of me.

533
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
You're a woman.

534
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
You're so idle.

535
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
You have nothing else to do.

536
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Nothing else?

537
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Are you feeling better?

538
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Fine.

539
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
I'll tell him about it.

540
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Stop.

541
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Go back to your room.

542
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
If you dare to come out again,

543
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
be careful.

544
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
I'm not polite to you.

545
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Then we...

546
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Madam,

547
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
the goods are here.

548
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
Listen,

549
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
the goods you brought last time

550
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
are dead.

551
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
You can't eat the meat.

552
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
You can't use the skin.

553
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
I'll throw them all away.

554
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Are you sure there's no problem this time?

555
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
No way.

556
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
They're all little animals.

557
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
I can't jump.

558
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
If there's any problem this time,

559
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
there's no next time.

560
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
My husband

561
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
has nothing else to do.

562
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
He can eat fresh food.

563
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,600
I think it's a waste to eat the meat.

564
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
I'll throw those skin away

565
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
and make a catnip,

566
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
a can of skin,

567
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
and so on.

568
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
It's not wasteful.

569
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Madam Su,

570
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
you didn't even let go of the right hand.

571
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
Don't you think it's cruel?

572
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
It's cruel?

573
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
It's just a birth.

574
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,600
What's so cruel about it?

575
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
Besides,

576
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,600
it's so tender and small.

577
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
My husband has paid for it.

578
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Of course, he'll eat the best.

579
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Madam Su,

580
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
do you think so?

581
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Of course.

582
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Of course.

583
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Since that's the case,

584
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,600
I'll take my leave.

585
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Master.

586
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
If your face is bleeding,

587
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
you can't wash it off.

588
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
It's not useful.

589
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Don't wash it off.

590
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
You...

591
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Madam Su,

592
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
don't worry.

593
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
Leave it to me.

594
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
What kind of dog's hair

595
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
do I have to wear?

596
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
I don't even want to mention it.

597
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
No.

598
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
You can't give me a face.

599
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Is there a need for this?

600
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
What do you mean?

601
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
You...

602
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Listen,

603
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,600
I've made the right choice.

604
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
I've seen the house.

605
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
I've done the work.

606
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
I want to move away with Yueya.

607
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
You can take care of it.

608
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Master,

609
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
I found you were hiding from me.

610
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Why are you hiding from Wen Shen?

611
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Are you being smart?

612
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
Just based on your idea of Yueya,

613
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
I'm smart.

614
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
Stop.

615
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
What are you doing?

616
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Master.

617
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Where are you going?

618
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
To the kitchen.

619
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
To Wen Shen.

620
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm going to the kitchen.

621
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,600
I'm going to the kitchen.

622
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
You can't be the only one.

623
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
You can't be the only one.

624
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
You can't be the only one.

625
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
You can't be the only one.

626
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
You can't be the only one.

627
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
I'll do the work.

628
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
I want to stay in this house.

629
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
First, I'll give the kitchen a nice look.

630
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
It's a bit difficult to be in North Korea.

631
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
It's a good idea to have a big window.

632
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,600
It's a good way to use the wind.

633
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
And,

634
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,600
there's a kitchen in the yard.

635
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
And there's a big kitchen.

636
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,600
It's too small to live in.

637
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,600
You're so mysterious.

638
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,600
You're so mysterious.

639
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,600
You're so mysterious.

640
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,600
You're so mysterious.

641
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Here.

642
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Where did you go?

643
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
I was almost out looking for you.

644
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
What's wrong? Are you worried?

645
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
What time is it?

646
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
Do you still have the mood to treat me?

647
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
No, no.

648
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
Look.

649
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
We found the house.

650
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,600
It's the same as you thought.

651
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
Really?

652
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Are you happy?

653
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
I'm not happy.

654
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
It's your house.

655
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
How about you keep it for me?

656
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Mine is yours.

657
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Nonsense.

658
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Yes.

659
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Yue.

660
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
How's the luggage?

661
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
It's almost done.

662
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
Master.

663
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Go.

664
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,160
That's not good.

665
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,000
Come here, where should we go?

666
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,120
Stop him.

667
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,800
Master, don't go.

668
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,760
Get out!

669
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,800
Master...

670
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,440
Don't go!

671
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,200
Master..

672
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,640
Master...

673
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,720
Master, Master!

674
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Fang Xi, you finally come.

675
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,360
You're our master.

676
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,200
Let me see.

677
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,600
Master, what should we do?

678
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,760
Take the cloud.

679
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,760
Beat him!

680
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,000
Amitabha.

681
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,240
Why did you beat my master?

682
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,520
No.

683
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,640
I know that thing can't be eaten.

684
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,720
But I can't bear it.

685
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,160
I'm hungry.

686
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,720
I'm starving to death.

687
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,520
Fang Xi, you must save us.

688
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,440
But your family really doesn't have a family.

689
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,520
Master, Master!

690
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,320
Madam,

691
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,480
the one who came in the other day

692
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,440
died again.

693
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,640
He's still ugly.

694
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,600
When is it?

695
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,120
What do you care?

696
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,880
This...

697
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,320
Hurry up. Follow them.

698
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,320
Yes.

699
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Hurry up.

700
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,720
Hurry up.

701
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Hurry up.

702
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,720
Follow them.

703
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,720
What are you doing?

704
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,720
You're a bandit.

705
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
What are you doing?

706
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,720
Are you a monster?

707
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Master, I'm a bandit.

708
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,720
I'm a hundred-year-old bandit.

709
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
Follow me.

710
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Master, it's you.

711
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Have a seat.

712
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,120
Tell me.

713
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
Is It the monster that you made?

714
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,520
He's talking to the rabbit.

715
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,920
Go, go, go.

716
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,840
Don't drink too much.

717
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,960
No, no, no. I'm weak and can't bear it.

718
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,040
Then tell me.

719
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,760
Master, I just got a hundred years of cultivation.

720
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,400
I can't even do the human form.

721
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,720
How can you be so weak?

722
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,880
Let me ask you.

723
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,000
Are you the one who did these animals' fake death?

724
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,240
Do you think I'm the best?

725
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,720
There are many chances to get revenge.

726
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,040
Join us as soon as possible.

727
00:33:44,040 --> 00:34:09,960
At the

728
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:35,480
The

729
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,480
You can leave.

730
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,480
It's okay.

731
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
You guys let go of those alive animals.

732
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
Why?

733
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,480
They will be dead and will be released.

734
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,480
Why?

735
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,480
My foot!

736
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,480
Are you okay, Brother Jian?

737
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,480
Why are you looking at me?

738
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,480
The French said to let go of these animals.

739
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Let go of them.

740
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
You can't let go of them.

741
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,480
What are you doing?

742
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,480
You think you can be a servant to the old man?

743
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,480
You've been taking away the food and the winter house every month.

744
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,480
They said to let go of these animals.

745
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
They will be dead and will be released.

746
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,480
Shut up!

747
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,480
The French asked you to light the fire.

748
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Do you want to burn it?

749
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,480
Of course not.

750
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,480
You are a man.

751
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,480
Go to the house.

752
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,480
No, I'll tell you that day.

753
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
Don't talk.

754
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,480
Let's go.

755
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,480
Let's go.

756
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,480
Let's go.

757
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
My love.

758
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,480
Don't talk.

759
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
My love.

760
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,480
What's going on?

761
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Tell us in the house.

762
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
It's easy.

763
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Mr. Su was killed and killed.

764
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
He was punished by the mountain.

765
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,480
That's why he is so serious.

766
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,480
You mean I'm being a wild animal?

767
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,480
That's right.

768
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,480
The Golden Monster is not strong.

769
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,480
It can even release the demon.

770
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
If it wasn't for him,

771
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,480
I wouldn't have been able to find out the truth.

772
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,480
What do you plan to do?

773
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,480
Nothing.

774
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,480
From your situation,

775
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,480
the Golden Monster is just a little bit of a small achievement for Mr. Su.

776
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,480
It's not a business.

777
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
As long as Mr. Su

778
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,480
releases all the animals in the house,

779
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,480
he will eat them.

780
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,480
And Mrs. Su

781
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,480
will not be wearing a mask.

782
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,480
The future will be peaceful.

783
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,480
You brought a rabbit in the backyard.

784
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
You have been free for a long time.

785
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,480
You gave us some orders here.

786
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,480
Is the evil spirit gone?

787
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
Yes.

788
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
You are the ones who are in charge of this.

789
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,480
Of course, you have to be in charge of it.

790
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,480
So you really want to be a demon.

791
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,480
You are really quick to come here.

792
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,480
Mr. Su,

793
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,480
I've been in the Wenxie Pavilion for many years.

794
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,480
I'm also a local famous man.

795
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,480
If anyone knows that I'm limited to eating and drinking because of the evil spirit,

796
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,480
I can't stand it.

797
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,480
That's right.

798
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
Our master is so miserable.

799
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,480
I can't swallow this smell.

800
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,480
Let me tell you.

801
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,480
When did you take the evil spirit?

802
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,480
This matter is over.

803
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,480
Otherwise, this gift is not a tree.

804
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Do you sell these money?

805
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
In my opinion,

806
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,480
the evil spirit didn't do anything bad to the shop.

807
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,480
Why not?

808
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,480
He has made our master eat the pig's feet.

809
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,480
I tell you.

810
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,480
You don't agree with this matter today.

811
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,480
You have to agree.

812
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,480
Master.

813
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,480
Just agree.

814
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,480
I agree with what?

815
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,480
You want to avenge them?

816
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
You go to get the demon yourself.

817
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,480
I won't go anyway.

818
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,480
Stop him.

819
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,480
Master, stop him.

820
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,480
Aunt, you are a embroidered pillow.

821
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,480
You are not capable.

822
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
You deliberately take the painting to color us.

823
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,480
That's right.

824
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,480
I am a embroidered pillow.

825
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,480
How do you know?

826
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,480
But the blood of this embroidered pillow is quite useful.

827
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,480
I won't let you go before those silver.

828
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
As long as you stay a little longer,

829
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
we will treat you better.

830
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
Okay.

831
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
You want to write, right?

832
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,480
Come.

833
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
I will draw a deep line for you.

834
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
You are capable of not washing away the blood forever.

835
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
No.

836
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
You two, stop fighting.

837
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,480
This blood is not clean.

838
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
How about this?

839
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,480
You write two more books for him.

840
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,480
It's useful.

841
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,480
It's useful?

842
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,480
Master.

843
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
Master.

844
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,480
Master.

845
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,480
Why are you pulling me?

846
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,480
Are you angry?

847
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,480
Are you angry?

848
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
I am not angry.

849
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,480
I just want to give you some blood.

850
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
Master, you are not intelligent.

851
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,480
You are not intelligent.

852
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Look at my work.

853
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
I helped you to help.

854
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
I helped you to get the wrong person.

855
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
I am sorry.

856
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,480
I am not good at drawing.

857
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
You are the one who can draw.

858
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,480
And I tell you.

859
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,480
I have bought the house.

860
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
I have prepared the house.

861
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
I have packed the luggage.

862
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
I will take Yu'er to the house.

863
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
Don't do that, master.

864
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,480
We are on the other side of the road.

865
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,480
Don't interfere with anyone in the future.

866
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,480
No, I...

867
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,480
You deal with this kind of thing yourself.

868
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
Don't.

869
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,480
Master. Master.

870
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
You are back.

871
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
Master.

872
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,480
I went out to buy something.

873
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,480
I just met him.

874
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
My sister and father's mother are gone.

875
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
They didn't have dinner.

876
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
I brought him back.

877
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Come on.

878
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
Have some buns.

879
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
Yu'er.

880
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,480
We only have one room.

881
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
It's not convenient for more girls.

882
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
How old is she?

883
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,480
She is not in love with me.

884
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,480
Besides,

885
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,480
don't you want to move to a new house?

886
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,480
It's a place to be.

887
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,480
You want to take her with you?

888
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,480
Yes.

889
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,480
Don't stand there.

890
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,480
It's a long time.

891
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
I will go to the house.

892
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,480
I will go to the house.

893
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,480
Go to the house.

894
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Yu'er.

895
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
Take this.

896
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,480
What is this?

897
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,480
This is the protective uniform I got in the temple.

898
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,480
You can wear it on your own.

899
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Yu'er.

900
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Your pouch is so pretty.

901
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,480
It's very long and sharp.

902
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,480
It's very good.

903
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,480
It's not bad.

904
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480
Your hand is so good.

905
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,480
Yu'er.

906
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,480
I must find a way

907
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,480
to drive her away.

908
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,480
Yu'er.

909
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,480
Brother.

910
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,480
Your clothes are dirty.

911
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,480
Go and take a rest.

912
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,800
You wash your clothes.

913
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,800
Okay.

914
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,400
Miss, do you want this dish?

915
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,840
Yes, sir.

916
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,080
Miss, you've been doing this for half a day.

917
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,200
Do you want it?

918
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,000
Yes, sir.

919
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,200
Sir, do you want this?

920
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,800
Sir, do you want this?

921
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,240
Sir.

922
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,040
Sir.

923
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,160
Sir, are you tired?

924
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,440
Let me help you.

925
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,720
You're a man.

926
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,440
You can wash your clothes so cleanly.

927
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,000
You're much stronger than me.

928
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,200
You want to learn?

929
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,360
As long as you don't mind, I'll learn.

930
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,760
I don't mind.

931
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,560
Why should I mind?

932
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,960
I'm more angry.

933
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,720
I'm sorry.

934
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,120
I'm sorry.

935
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,200
I'm sorry.

936
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,280
I'm sorry.

937
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,400
I'm sorry.

938
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,640
I'm sorry.

939
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,960
I'm sorry.

940
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,440
I'm sorry.

941
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,760
I'm sorry.

942
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,880
I'm sorry.

943
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,160
I'm sorry.

944
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,320
I'm sorry.

945
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,520
I'm sorry.

946
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,760
I'm sorry.

947
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,960
I'm sorry.

948
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,400
I'm sorry.

949
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,760
I'm sorry.

950
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,240
I'm sorry.

951
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,560
I'm sorry.

952
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,800
I'm sorry.

953
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,160
I'm sorry.

954
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,360
I'm sorry.

955
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,600
I'm sorry.

956
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,160
I'm sorry.

957
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,360
I'm sorry.

958
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,520
I'm sorry.

959
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,760
I'm sorry.

960
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,360
