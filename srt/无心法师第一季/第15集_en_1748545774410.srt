1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the grass and the shadow

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is full of love and face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if the clouds are floating

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The pain is so hard to describe

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The madness of ice

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Just one day

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You clearly have a life

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In the north side of the lake

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You clearly have a life

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In the north side of the lake

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You clearly have a life

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
In the North Side of the Lake

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,800
Hope you meet better!

29
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:31,260
I

30
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:45,500
witnessed many

31
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,020
From now on, I'll call you Gu Guoqiang.

32
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,180
Not Gu Xuanwu.

33
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,180
Guoqiang is the name of the general.

34
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,420
The general said that as a soldier,

35
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,900
you should have a heart of love.

36
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,660
Do you know what it means to change your name?

37
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,060
Do you know what your previous name means?

38
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,300
What does it mean?

39
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,820
Wang Ba.

40
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,420
You're Wang Ba.

41
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,340
You're still a West-winger.

42
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,940
You don't believe me?

43
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,860
Wang Ba has a snake on him.

44
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,060
It's called Xuanwu.

45
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,940
Go, go, go.

46
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,980
Listen.

47
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,340
My name

48
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,940
was given to Mr. Sun Ming in Wen County.

49
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,620
I even gave him a big sheep.

50
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,300
I knew you'd change your name again.

51
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,740
You've given up that big sheep.

52
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,780
Why are you so angry?

53
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,500
Look.

54
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,940
How's the yard?

55
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,580
Is it a good or bad?

56
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,300
It's all arranged by the general.

57
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,180
It belongs to the general's mansion.

58
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,580
Good.

59
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,340
Yue Qiluo is here.

60
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,500
Why are you here?

61
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,940
Yue Qiluo?

62
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,700
If he comes here,

63
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,980
I'll kill him with him.

64
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,180
Do you know who I am?

65
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,900
Deputy Commander.

66
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,060
The red man of the general.

67
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,740
Enough.

68
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,500
Don't blow it.

69
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,220
Go.

70
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,740
Thank you for your hard work.

71
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:10,780
How's it?

72
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,820
Are you angry?

73
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,420
We'll live in this house.

74
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,660
Sister.

75
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,220
Listen to me.

76
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,780
Throw away these dirty clothes.

77
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,980
It's going to be New Year's Eve soon.

78
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,100
I'll buy you a new one.

79
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,420
A new one.

80
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:27,980
How's it?

81
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,140
Throw it away.

82
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:29,940
Listen to me.

83
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,820
Just pull it.

84
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,540
I don't want it.

85
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,260
If you have the money,

86
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,940
you'd better buy a house and a land.

87
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,900
I want you to be a rich woman.

88
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,100
You can be a mother.

89
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,060
Do you think you're dead?

90
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,860
We've never been in a rich family.

91
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,060
Besides,

92
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,660
we've been living a good life.

93
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,700
What else do you want?

94
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,660
You two

95
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,180
are poor and poor.

96
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,860
You're a fierce and ruthless man.

97
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,900
You'll die if you get married.

98
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,540
The most exciting game in the city of Yule City,

99
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,300
the most exciting game in the city of Yule City,

100
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,700
the horse's horse.

101
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,300
The horse's horse.

102
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,820
The queen of the reward.

103
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,540
The golden city of the treasure.

104
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,540
Even if I'm not rich,

105
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,860
you'd dream of the�

106
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,260
that world would change

107
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,220
even if I keep playingoto.

108
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,460
Parents always listen to their snacks.

109
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,140
I'll be grateful with your bike.

110
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,500
It's crazy.

111
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,380
Spread everything.

112
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,780
You know that

113
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,180
it's not for children and adults

114
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,740
but for your rules.

115
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,420
Got it?

116
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,620
Little won't say no.

117
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,780
Two is a consequence.

118
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,740
And so didn't have alosper senior cook

119
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,420
just served as a suggestion

120
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,060
at theSocial See- basic com.

121
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,960
All of these will also be delivered during the appointment night.

122
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,440
If you haven't seen it in the past two or three days,

123
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,060
what do you think?

124
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,040
For now, I'd like to sweetheart and show you.

125
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,980
Master, be cultured iniao.

126
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,080
I'm attached to you.

127
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,080
I love you.

128
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,800
Bye bye.

129
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,000
Do I look like Chuislub希望 his master?

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,600
Before, the commander has invited me to help you.

131
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,480
But I don't have time to practice Taoism.

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,080
It's hard to win the favor.

133
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,800
So I'm here.

134
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,000
There's a business to discuss with you.

135
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,240
Please enjoy.

136
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,120
Chief,

137
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,920
tell them if you have anything.

138
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,160
Can you clear Yue Qiluo's name?

139
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,360
I can't wait anymore.

140
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,360
Chief,

141
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,440
what's wrong with your time?

142
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,640
Yue Qiluo...

143
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,760
How many times has he killed

144
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,960
and forced you to live here?

145
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,120
He even邊 Layer

146
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,600
in the hot water.

147
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,320
You say, I can do nothing about it.

148
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,080
Tao Tao, you.

149
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,600
Don't be here.

150
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,200
I really have a heart attack.

151
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,480
I'm a useless man.

152
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,400
He ran to Qingyun Temple.

153
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,600
I made it clear.

154
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,200
Who went to Qingyun Temple?

155
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,360
Yue Qiluo.

156
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,240
Where did he go?

157
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
He came to us.

158
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,880
At the end of the year,

159
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,640
the officials of the nearby officials

160
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,640
will come to the Qingyun Temple to pray for the blessing.

161
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,880
But I didn't expect that

162
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Zhang Xianzong came this year.

163
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,400
And

164
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,840
Yue Qiluo also came with him.

165
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:13,920
Who is he?

166
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,440
What a waste.

167
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,320
Good-for-nothing?

168
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,280
I'm Yue Qiluo.

169
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,000
Child of Chu,

170
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,780
you and Wuxing

171
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,860
собирate my matter.

172
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,160
I know.

173
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
But you're still a little bit of a coward.

174
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,240
You have no ability.

175
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,240
I'm afraid to do the same thing as you.

176
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,240
I came here to ask you to give Wu Xin a word.

177
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
You ask.

178
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,240
I heard that they asked Tian Jing's general.

179
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,240
They even picked up a coffin.

180
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Go tell Wu Xin.

181
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Don't think that you can hide for the rest of your life because of this dog-fingered general.

182
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
His and I...

183
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
It's not over yet.

184
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Say something.

185
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
What can I say?

186
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
You should stop Yue Qi Luo.

187
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,240
She'll get mad.

188
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,240
If you want to cure her, you should have a map first.

189
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
You've been talking to me for a long time.

190
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,240
Why don't you fill up the map?

191
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
No!

192
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,240
You remember the map last time?

193
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
I don't understand.

194
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
That's weird.

195
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
You created it by your master.

196
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
No one understands.

197
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,240
No, no, no.

198
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,240
No.

199
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,240
I didn't tell you the truth.

200
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,240
She's not just a magic spell from our sect.

201
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
She also...

202
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
What else?

203
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,240
She also...

204
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
Yue Qi Luo's evil magic.

205
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Yue Qi Luo was really a coward back then.

206
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
No one could touch her.

207
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,240
She couldn't think of a way to poison her.

208
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,240
She found Yue Qi Luo's cave.

209
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,240
She was in danger and she was in a hurry.

210
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,240
She found Yue Qi Luo's magic spell.

211
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,240
She closed the cave and finally stole the crystal water.

212
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,240
She created the magic spell after she was out of the cave.

213
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,240
She sealed Yue Qi Luo.

214
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Yi Xiang.

215
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,240
If we can find Yue Qi Luo's cave

216
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
and find this secret secret mark,

217
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,240
can we make it up?

218
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Please.

219
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,240
I want to ask you to go again.

220
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,240
You have so many disciples.

221
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
Why don't you let me go?

222
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
You're willing to beg for you?

223
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,240
I have a favor to ask.

224
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,240
I have a favor to ask.

225
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Only the sect leader can know about this.

226
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
I can't tell you.

227
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,240
The sect leader will really show his face.

228
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
Wu Qi.

229
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
Listen.

230
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
We're in a mess.

231
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
You found the secret mark and I made up the map.

232
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
You're going to make Yue Qi Luo's cave.

233
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
We can't live without it.

234
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
I'm not going.

235
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
I'm not going back.

236
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240
Why don't I come here to talk about it?

237
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
When did I make you up?

238
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,240
When I made up the map

239
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,240
I was in a mess.

240
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,240
But Sheng Li has a back.

241
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
No.

242
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,240
How would I know?

243
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,240
How would I know where she was?

244
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Moreover, who let her out?

245
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Amitabha.

246
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,240
Taoist priest.

247
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
When you left,

248
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,240
remember to close the door for me.

249
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Wu Xin.

250
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,240
I'll go with you.

251
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Taoist priest.

252
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
One year and nine days.

253
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
You said that.

254
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
You just found the figure.

255
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
You're going to make a death sentence again?

256
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Yue Ya.

257
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
I'm not going to make a death sentence this time.

258
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
The old fox from the town went with me.

259
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
He's going to die?

260
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
You can't go anyway.

261
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
It's been two days.

262
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
You have to have another life.

263
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
How can I live?

264
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,240
It's not dangerous.

265
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
You're not going to make a death sentence.

266
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
I don't care.

267
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
If you dare to go,

268
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,240
I won't go with you.

269
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
It's a decision.

270
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
I can't go.

271
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Is this a death sentence?

272
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
I didn't even listen to the saying.

273
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,240
In another town.

274
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,240
I was in the same mode.

275
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
You want my life?

276
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
I dare to go.

277
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,240
I'll break your legs.

278
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Come.

279
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,920
Why?

280
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,600
Who put the mask on?

281
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,880
Did he?

282
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,400
I forgot to tell you

283
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:45,420
that

284
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,900
aals are like an old men's clothes.

285
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,780
What if he fits down?

286
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,500
No.

287
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,500
Don't you think

288
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,260
most humans

289
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,600
will die if aal bought your precisess?

290
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,560
What do you mean?

291
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,520
You can help me.

292
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,920
Or you can't go.

293
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,520
It's not dangerous.

294
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,920
If it's not dangerous,

295
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,200
we can go with you.

296
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,000
Come on, Wu Xin.

297
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,880
Look.

298
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,480
I prepared these.

299
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,240
Come on.

300
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,520
Look at this.

301
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,600
Chief.

302
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,000
You prepared this.

303
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,480
You can do it.

304
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,400
What do you mean?

305
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,400
My coach,

306
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,080
Chief of the Chief of the Great General.

307
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,200
The positional commander.

308
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,680
Pick one.

309
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,800
I don't like to use guns.

310
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,640
This is the signature of the Group 10.

311
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,680
Then I will use this.

312
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,440
Be careful.

313
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,280
Don't break it.

314
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,240
I know.

315
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,640
Look at this.

316
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,840
These are my master's.

317
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,040
And my Group 10's.

318
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,880
This is broken.

319
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,240
There are two of them.

320
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,240
The key is to save his life.

321
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,960
Chief.

322
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,840
Are you so pessimistic?

323
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,720
What if?

324
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,000
You and the professor Luo have been together for so many times.

325
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,760
Didn't you find any weakness?

326
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,520
When he sealed the seal,

327
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,240
I took a letter from the police.

328
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,520
I think

329
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,960
he has some concern for this.

330
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,040
What's so important there?

331
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,280
Go and put the key in our bedroom room.

332
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,000
The �.

333
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,120
The holier the holier their holier.

334
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,920
The better our danse to our sister.

335
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,960
Why's that?

336
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,400
Nothing.

337
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,920
What's so kind of business?

338
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,920
I have to spend more time.

339
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,280
I'll catch him when I get there.

340
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,600
I can only be a horse driver.

341
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,520
I'm better than a horse.

342
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,520
I spent half a day here.

343
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,800
You said you'd take it away.

344
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,040
Thank you.

345
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,600
You...

346
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,200
What did you talk about?

347
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,120
You talked so late.

348
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,480
I didn't talk about anything.

349
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,000
I heard he's a man of the firstborn.

350
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,360
By the way, Yu.

351
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,200
Make some more pouches.

352
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,400
Put these in.

353
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,360
What's this?

354
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,760
This is a service for the firstborn.

355
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
It's useless to care about it.

356
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,720
Let's not waste time.

357
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,880
After you're done,

358
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,920
you can keep one for yourself.

359
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,080
And one for Mr. Gu.

360
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,720
I see.

361
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,520
Miss Chen,

362
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,120
is the service final?

363
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,240
No, really.

364
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,440
I can do a temporary pack essential in the office.

365
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,840
You go first.

366
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,560
What about you, I...

367
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,640
Don't you work?

368
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,200
No, I'm a bit busy stars.

369
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,240
You two talk.

370
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,280
All right.

371
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,120
You're right.

372
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,600
What do you think of?

373
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,080
You look like a panda.

374
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Qiang.

375
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
I say, Taoist Taoist,

376
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520
if you are afraid,

377
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
let's not go.

378
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,840
No, no, no.

379
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,680
No, no, no.

380
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
We must go.

381
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,840
I'm just

382
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
ready to work.

383
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
Do you have a spare?

384
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,760
One, two, one.

385
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,240
One, two, one.

386
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,200
Go.

387
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Where is Taoist Taoist?

388
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,560
Master Gu.

389
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,400
Let's eat with us this morning.

390
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,120
Good. Good.

391
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,720
I think we can have a chat.

392
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,080
Xiaozhen.

393
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,680
Yes.

394
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,680
Prepare some wine.

395
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,400
Yes.

396
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,520
Master Gu.

397
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,000
Which one do you sing?

398
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,400
No.

399
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,720
You two are going to the mountain to catch a demon.

400
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,160
After the general heard it,

401
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,840
he immediately took the shot.

402
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,280
Let me lead the team.

403
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,120
Protect you two to catch a demon.

404
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,480
Protect a ass.

405
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,760
You go to fight.

406
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,840
Isn't it a mess?

407
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,800
Xiao Bai.

408
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,320
Yes.

409
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,480
Take off the shield.

410
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,000
Yes.

411
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,680
Turn around.

412
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,400
Go.

413
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,040
Master.

414
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,320
Come here.

415
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,880
No.

416
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,120
Do you know anything?

417
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,480
I'm kind of helping you.

418
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,200
Don't be so stubborn.

419
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,800
Did I say you helped?

420
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,000
Did you forget the last time you went to the mountain?

421
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,360
You have such a big crowd.

422
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,480
What if something happens?

423
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,520
How can you explain it?

424
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,320
I think

425
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,480
Master Gu is right.

426
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,760
Think about it.

427
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,600
The hole is not safe.

428
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,520
If there are some external sources in the cave,

429
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,360
it might not be a good thing.

430
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,320
The Taoist master is a wise man.

431
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,520
Let me tell you.

432
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,080
The soldiers sent by the general

433
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
were all picked out.

434
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,720
Do you see the equipment?

435
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,680
It's imported from Germany.

436
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,880
Let me tell you.

437
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,880
The general brought you here.

438
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,840
Don't take it yourself.

439
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,040
Yes.

440
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,840
Look at the general.

441
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,960
We can't take the general's face.

442
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,880
The imperial edict is inappropriate.

443
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Yes.

444
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,120
Fine.

445
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,280
You two can talk about it.

446
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,200
But I'm ugly.

447
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,840
After you go to the cave,

448
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,800
all the people

449
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,200
have to stay in the cave.

450
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,320
No one can do this.

451
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
Master.

452
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,080
Don't worry.

453
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,440
I have a plan.

454
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,800
A plan?

455
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,760
You have to help me

456
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,240
before the spirit goes out.

457
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,040
Don't be so loud.

458
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
You have to be careful.

459
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
Help me find a way

460
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
to get the moon.

461
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,520
You don't take it?

462
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,400
No.

463
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,640
You don't know

464
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,920
what's in the cave.

465
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,920
Yes.

466
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,680
The girl is a liar.

467
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,040
She's on the road.

468
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,640
It's not safe.

469
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,200
Don't worry.

470
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,080
Give me the bag.

471
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,080
Hurry!

472
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,120
I haven't exhausted my mind.

473
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,720
They say it's the응er.

474
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,520
How?

475
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,400
Master told me to come at once.

476
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,320
Otherwise the baby will kill him.

477
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,280
What if they do it,

478
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,360
it'll be a disaster.

479
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,800
All right.

480
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,760
Let's go.

481
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,880
Let's go.

482
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,040
I think it's here.

483
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,920
Let's go.

484
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,680
Let's go.

485
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:55,240
Wu Xin, come here.

486
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,840
Look, it's here.

487
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,440
This is the mark I left.

488
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,240
You're indeed the Taoist Taoist.

489
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,040
Leaving a mark is so different.

490
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,640
It really matches your temper.

491
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,440
Of course.

492
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,240
I'm not a Taoist.

493
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,240
I'm just a Taoist.

494
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,240
I'm just a Taoist.

495
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,240
I'm just a Taoist.

496
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,840
It really matches your temper.

497
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,640
Of course.

498
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,240
Can you dig?

499
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
Dig.

500
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,240
Come.

501
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,640
Be careful.

502
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,840
Don't worry.

503
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,840
Xiao Zheng!

504
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,240
Yes!

505
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,640
Arrange the guards.

506
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,440
Open the two sides and dig.

507
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,240
Be careful.

508
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,440
Yes.

509
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,240
Guys, take back the iron gun.

510
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,640
Dig the hole.

511
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
Yes!

512
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
Be careful.

513
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
Dig.

514
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,240
Squad leader, dig it.

515
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Open the hole.

516
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
Open the hole.

517
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Yes!

518
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,240
It's getting late.

519
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,240
Guys, the Taoist is scared today.

520
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,240
We'll go down tomorrow.

521
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,240
Master Wu Xin is really funny.

522
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,240
I'm a good-for-nothing.

523
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,240
I'm not afraid of anything.

524
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,240
The demon demon is my true nature.

525
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
I said it's getting late.

526
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
I hope we can go back earlier.

527
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,240
Don't let the brothers out there

528
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,240
get in the way, right?

529
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Mr. Hu,

530
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
no matter what happens after we go down,

531
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
don't think about it.

532
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Okay.

533
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,240
Take care.

534
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,240
Let's go.

535
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,240
I'm not coming.

536
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,240
Hurry up.

537
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,240
You're really stupid.

538
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,240
What do you think?

539
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,240
How can I be?

540
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,240
How many years have I been stupid?

541
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240
I've never done this.

542
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
Look.

543
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
The previous craftsman's sword

544
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
is so powerful.

545
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
The current craftsman

546
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,240
can't handle this kind of water.

547
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
Look at the dragon's skin.

548
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,240
Isn't the bear a bit too big?

549
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
Can you hold it?

550
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,240
I'm just a little bit older.

551
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
I'm not older than you.

552
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
I'm not older than you.

553
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,240
I'm not older than you.

554
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,240
What are you talking about?

555
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,240
A ghost.

556
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
Chief,

557
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,240
you lost.

558
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
I know it.

559
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
I lost.

560
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
Go, go, go.

561
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,240
Chief,

562
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
we're far away.

563
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,240
We're 200 years old.

564
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,240
It's absolutely safe.

565
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,240
Why didn't you say anything?

566
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,240
Give it to me.

567
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,240
Chief.

568
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,240
Wu Xin.

569
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Do you think I'm not right?

570
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
If something goes wrong,

571
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
these craftsmen

572
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,240
seem to be far away.

573
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
There's a sound.

574
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,240
What are you doing?

575
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Calm down.

576
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,240
The sound was sent from the stone wall.

577
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,240
What's going on?

578
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240
Let's go back.

579
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,240
What did you think of?

580
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,240
How could you go back there?

581
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,240
I'll eat something.

582
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Chief,

583
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
don't waste time.

584
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
If you waste time,

585
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,240
the things in the stone wall

586
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
will come here.

587
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,240
Let's go.

588
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,240
Let's go.

589
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
Come on.

590
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,240
It's been a while since we've been here.

591
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
There's no cave.

592
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
How about this?

593
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
Leave a few people at the entrance,

594
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,240
and the rest will stay with me

595
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,240
to find a place to camp and camp.

596
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
We'll sleep here tonight.

597
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,240
Yes.

598
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,240
You four stay.

599
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
The rest of you, follow me.

600
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
Yes.

601
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
Come on.

602
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
Hurry up.

603
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
The rest of you, move up.

604
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,240
Hurry up.

605
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,240
Hurry up.

606
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
Hurry up.

607
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,240
Hurry up.

608
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240
Hurry up.

609
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,240
It's been a long time since we've been here.

610
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
Let's go.

611
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,240
Let's go.

612
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
Let's go.

613
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
Let's go.

614
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
Let's go.

615
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
Wait.

616
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,240
I want to check the temperature.

617
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,240
What?

618
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
It's hundreds of degrees.

619
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
What's the temperature now?

620
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
It's still warm.

621
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
No matter what,

622
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,240
they're all here to find me.

623
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
It's a long time ago.

624
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
I can't let them go.

625
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,240
Let me do it.

626
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
Your family is still in front of me.

627
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
I'll take care of them.

628
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,240
I'll go back if I don't take care of them.

629
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,240
Get out of here.

630
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,240
Get out.

631
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,240
This is a quiet place.

632
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,240
These are the remains of the materials.

633
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,240
Where are the rest of them?

634
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,240
Let's go.

635
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,240
Okay.

636
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,240
What are you doing?

637
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
Yueyue.

638
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240
I'm an old lady.

639
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
I told you not to come.

640
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
Why did you come?

641
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
I can't come if you can.

642
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
I told you not to come.

643
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,240
I'm here for your good.

644
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,240
I'm here to help you.

645
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,240
I'm here to help you.

646
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,240
I'm here to help you.

647
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,240
I'm here to help you.

648
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,240
I told you not to come.

649
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
I'm here to help you.

650
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,240
Where did you get the clothes?

651
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
Hurry up.

652
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
Are you leaving?

653
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
No.

654
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,240
I'll leave if you don't want to leave.

655
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
Listen.

656
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
If the pig gets in trouble,

657
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,240
I won't bother you.

658
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,240
There's a ghost here.

659
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
You can't even cry.

660
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,240
Who are you scaring?

661
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,240
I was scared to death.

662
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
You...

663
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,240
Are you afraid of the demon?

664
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
Yue Qiluo is here.

665
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,240
I'm not afraid.

666
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
Don't beat me.

667
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
Don't mention Yue Qiluo.

668
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,240
What?

669
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,240
Are you afraid?

670
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
I'm afraid.

671
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,240
Can I be afraid?

672
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,240
Can I be afraid?

673
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,240
If Yue Qiluo appears in front of me,

674
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,240
I'll spit it out.

675
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
I'll be scared.

676
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,240
I'll beat him to death.

677
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,240
You're a little girl.

678
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
What's wrong?

679
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,240
You're a manager of the Pigeon?

680
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,240
You're not leaving after you iron your heart, are you?

681
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,240
If you don't want to leave,

682
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,240
you can stay here with me.

683
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
Don't bother me.

684
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,240
Go out. Don't go far.

685
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
It's dangerous to live in a corner.

686
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
I can't find you.

687
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Aomex Pujing Entertainment City 94466.

688
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
Com.

689
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,240
The most exciting Pigeon game in the county.

690
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,240
The horse is running.

691
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
The horse imagem is 2.

692
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,240
Award winner,

693
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,240

00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
All-time cheerleader Zhao Cai,

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,240
Award winner in the silk market,

696
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,240
Super high Countryonder

697
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,240
Award winner is right here.

698
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,240
Much chance for revenge.

699
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,240
I'll come and join you now.

700
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
Aomex Pujing Entertainment City 94466.

701
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,340
I'll go to the middle for share

702
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
That damn earthling.

703
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
It's a mess.

704
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
You four.

705
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,240
Take a good look.

706
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,240
No one can enter without my order.

707
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,240
Yes.

708
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,240
He's the vice-president.

709
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,240
He's a little white fox.

710
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,240
He's a good cook.

711
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,240
He's not ordinary white fox.

712
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,240
He's a handsome man.

713
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,240
He's a leader and a leader.

714
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
He's a good cook.

715
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,240
What's so great about him?

716
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,240
He's just a leader.

717
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,240
It's a good business.

718
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,240
He's a good cook.

719
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,240
By the way,

720
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,240
did you see that?

721
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,240
He was a little white fox.

722
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,240
He's a good cook.

723
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,240
He's a good cook.

724
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,240
He's a good cook.

725
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,240
He's a good cook.

726
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,240
Yes.

727
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,240
He's a great cook.

728
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,240
I'm sorry.

729
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
Take it.

730
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,240
I'll go to die.

731
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,240
Why did you say that?

732
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
I'm a good cook.

733
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,240
I'm a good cook.

734
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
I often play around.

735
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
One day,

736
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,240
I came to a strange mountain.

737
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,240
I learned to get rid of the other people's economic methods.

738
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,240
You killed the right person.

739
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,240
So you did it for this?

740
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,240
Why?

741
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
I didn't see it.

742
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,240
Of course you didn't see it.

743
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,240
I met a snake.

744
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,240
It told me that it went through a scary cave.

745
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,240
All the animals were taken by the living.

746
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,240
What?

747
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
There's a man?

748
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,240
All the animals were taken here.

749
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,240
It's a long time ago.

750
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,240
Why did he use so many machines?

751
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,240
I guess.

752
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,240
It's not only a place I've been practicing.

753
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,240
It's also a hospital.

754
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,240
He used these machines to take care of the dead.

755
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,240
He just...

756
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
He's a lunatic.

757
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,240
He's definitely a lunatic.

758
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,240
Why did you ruin it?

759
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,240
He's a senior.

760
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,240
He's the reason why I'm so stupid.

761
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,240
I won't go wrong.

762
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,240
I think it's time to think about it.

763
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,240
How do we get there?

764
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,240
The economy is too strong.

765
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,240
If we get there, we'll be killed.

766
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,240
Chief, you're still a good guy.

767
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
Chief.

768
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,240
Why are you here?

769
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,240
Why are you here?

770
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,240
They didn't treat me as their servant.

771
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,240
They won't suspect me no matter what I do.

772
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,240
Are you lying to me again?

773
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,240
Come on, try it.

774
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,240
I...

775
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,240
Come on.

776
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,240
Chief.

777
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
Chief.

778
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,240
Liu's green mountain is here.

779
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
I'm not going to be killed.

780
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,240
You?

781
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,240
Shut up.

782
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,240
This is my master's secret service.

783
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,240
He's the one who's going to be killed.

784
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240
Chief.

785
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,240
Wu Xin.

786
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,240
My talisman.

787
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
Chief.

788
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
I'm really good at using my master's talisman.

789
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,240
But it's better to use it on the top.

790
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,240
If you don't use it, you'll be killed.

791
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,240
I'll kill you.

792
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,240
Don't talk nonsense.

793
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,240
You're a traitor.

794
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,240
There are two of them.

795
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,240
One is gone.

796
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,240
I won't take it.

797
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,240
What should we do?

798
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,240
Take out the secret service.

799
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,240
I'll wait for you.

800
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,240
I can go there.

801
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,240
What's the secret service?

802
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,240
If I take it out,

803
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,240
you'll be in trouble.

804
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,240
What should we do?

805
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,240
Chief.

806
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,240
I'm going to be a traitor.

807
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,240
But you have to listen to me.

808
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,240
What should we do?

809
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
What's going on?

810
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
Someone broke into the lock-and-match.

811
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,240
What?

812
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:34,240
The current world is only open to the public.

813
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
It's impossible to be a traitor.

814
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,240
It's impossible to be a traitor.

815
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,240
Wuxing.

816
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
It's you again.

817
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,240
I can't bear to kill you.

818
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,240
You've been against it for a long time.

819
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,240
You still want to steal my old house?

820
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,240
You're so rude.

821
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,240
Get out of here.

822
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,240
I won't let you in.

823
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,240
Wuxing.

824
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,240
Wuxing.

825
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,240
Wuxing.

826
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,240
I want to see how capable you are today.

827
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,240
Wuxing.

828
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,240
Wuxing.

829
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,240
I think this place is weird.

830
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,240
Is there a problem?

831
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,240
Don't say that.

832
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,240
I'm in a hurry.

833
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,240
You guys go with me.

834
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,240
I'm in a hurry.

835
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,240
Let's go together.

836
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,240
Let's go.

837
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,240
What are you doing?

838
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,240
Why are you so bad-tempered?

839
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,240
You're a soldier.

840
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,240
What's the difference?

841
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,240
You run so far.

842
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,240
What's the difference?

843
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,240
You never go to the battlefield.

844
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,240
Chief.

845
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,240
Be careful.

846
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,240
Are you ready?

847
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,240
Run!

848
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,240
Stop!

849
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,240
Oh, right.

850
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,240
Run!

851
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,240
Run!

852
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,240
Run!

853
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,240
Run!

854
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,240
Run!

855
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,240
Run!

856
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,240
You're so stupid.

857
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,240
Who are you asking?

858
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,240
I understand.

859
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,240
I just saved you.

860
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,240
Do you need a big sword?

861
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,240
How can I save you with such a big sword?

862
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,240
How can we get out?

863
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,240
You can only overcome the heavy rain.

864
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,240
Let's go.

865
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,240
Overcome the heavy rain.

866
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,240
Overcome the heavy rain.

867
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,240
Let's go back to the village.

868
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,240
Wu Xin.

869
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,240
Wu Xin.

870
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,240
Wu Xin.

871
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,240
Chief.

872
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,240
Wu Xin.

873
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,240
You really want to hit the head?

874
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,240
What are you doing?

875
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:04,240
The future is full of life.

876
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,240
Look.

877
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,240
Is this the talisman?

878
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,240
It's really the same.

879
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,240
Wu Xin.

880
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,240
If you dare to kill me,

881
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,240
don't blame me for being a good man.

882
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,240
I won't.

883
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,240
Stop!

884
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,240
If he gets shot,

885
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,240
he'll be in no time.

886
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,240
Let's go.

887
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,240
Let's go.
