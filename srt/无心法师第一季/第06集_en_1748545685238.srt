00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the greenery

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is shining on my face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if it were a universe

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The life is a dream

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The life is a dream

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One day

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You are clear and mysterious

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the background

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are clear and mysterious

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like a background

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't be afraid

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You let him leave alone

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You should go with him

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You should go with him

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You are quick

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You go with him

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You are quick

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You are quick

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What's going on?

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why are you asleep again?

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I can't wake up because of the appetite

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I guess it's because of the magic on the fingerprint

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So I control it

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and trapped her in a dream.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What?

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Dream?

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Miss! Miss!

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Miss! Miss!

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Miss! Miss!

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Miss! Miss!

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Miss! Miss!

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Miss! Miss!

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Miss, what's wrong?

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What's wrong?

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Where is that star?

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The wolf...

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The wolf is dead!

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The wolf is dead?

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The wolf is dead!

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
How could it be dead?

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Miss! Miss! Miss!

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Miss, wake up!

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Miss!

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's because I met something different in my dream.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yue Qiluo said

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
if I killed the hostage,

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yue Ya Yan would die.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's like I wake up a dreamer.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What should we do now?

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We can't just wait here.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Who knows when she will wake up?

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Master, Yue Qiluo is quite tall.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
When she was in the room, she was out of her mind.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I was so confused.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I couldn't even control my body.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It was so dangerous.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
She was afraid that Yue Qiluo

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
would die.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yue Qiluo is going to kill Yue Ya.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Why would she kill so many hostage?

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
She has to wait for time and experience.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What if there is a flash?

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I suspect that she is afraid of something.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What is it?

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's the talisman she has been wearing for over 100 years.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I was afraid of this when I met her.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So I didn't dare to enter Yue Ya's body.

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I thought of this way.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I can control Yue Ya with my bare hands.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Zhuan Er is so good.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
No.

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Then you should give me a whole piece.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
How many pieces do you have in your family?

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The most exciting game on the line is

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The horse is running.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The horse is running.

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The queen is on the throne.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The cat is on the throne.

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The gold city is in the hands of the queen.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Three wolfs...

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Three wolves...

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The three wolves have died.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
They have died.

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's impossible.

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
How could this be?

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
How could this be a risk?

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You shouldn't have done that.

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You shouldn't have done that.

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But he is dead.

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Your lover is dead.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
How can you still live?

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No!

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The one I love,

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
he won't be born.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He's not like that.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If you live, you'll have a traitor.

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You'll lose everything.

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The one who was born is a coward.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He's not.

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm not either.

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You're not a coward.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You're just a normal person.

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're just looking at him and dying for you.

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You're pretending to be innocent.

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm not.

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm not.

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You killed him.

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's you.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's not me.

147
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's not me.

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's you.

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You killed him.

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You're a murderer.

151
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You're a criminal.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You're a murderer.

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Kill someone.

154
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Kill someone.

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Kill someone.

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Kill someone.

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're dead with him.

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He's dead.

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He's dead.

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
When he was ill,

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
you went to him.

162
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You were hit by his coffin.

163
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You could have gone with him.

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Then,

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
he knew you loved him.

166
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Loved?

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What are you doing?

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm thinking of a way.

169
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Just think about it.

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Don't be so stupid.

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I have a light in my hand.

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What light?

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The one I found on the paper

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
is the magic of the moon.

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But you can't see it.

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The moon was almost awake.

177
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's the light that keeps him sleeping.

178
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm thinking about it.

179
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If the light in the real world

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
can't wake the moon,

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
then go to the dream

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and wake it up in the dream.

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What do you mean?

184
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I mean

185
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
since the light can bring the moon

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
into the dream,

187
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
maybe it can bring other people into the dream.

188
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll try.

189
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Hurry up.

190
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Hurry up.

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Hurry up.

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What are you doing?

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hurry up.

194
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Hurry up.

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Can you do it?

196
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What are you doing?

197
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I guess it's just a fear.

198
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
After all, I'm not an ordinary person.

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You are.

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Maybe it's useful to ordinary people.

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm not an ordinary person.

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm a person with a identity.

203
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Remember to find Yu Yan.

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Tell him he's dreaming.

205
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Tell him to come back.

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What's wrong?

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What's wrong?

208
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What's wrong?

209
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What's wrong?

210
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Hurry up.

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Look.

212
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Look.

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He's still unconscious.

214
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I want to find Yu Yan.

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes.

216
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I want to find Yu Yan.

217
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yu Yan!

218
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yu Yan!

219
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yu Yan!

220
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yu Yan.

221
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yu Yan!

222
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yu Yan!

223
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yueyue!

224
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Yueyue!

225
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Yueyue!

226
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Yueyue!

227
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Miss!

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,800
What is it?

229
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,200
Ran monkey!

230
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
Yue'er.

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Step aside.

232
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,200
Ran monkey.

233
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,000
Wait for me.

234
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,360
I am here to accompany you.

235
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,280
Оöö

236
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,720
Yueyang!

237
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,620
Yueyang!

238
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,120
Yueyang!

239
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,600
Yueyang!

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,520
What's going on?

241
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,840
Yueyang!

242
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,000
Yueyang!

243
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,880
What are you doing?

244
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,000
Third Prince is dead.

245
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm going to accompany him.

246
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
What third prince?

247
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,560
You're dreaming now.

248
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,520
Wake up!

249
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,040
If you don't wake up,

250
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
your brother will die.

251
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,560
Yueyang!

252
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,960
My brother?

253
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,960
Who are you?

254
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,280
I'm Gu Xuanwu.

255
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,120
Where's Master Gu?

256
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,720
Master Gu?

257
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,960
No.

258
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,360
Yueyang, what's wrong?

259
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,680
I'm Yueyang.

260
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,800
No.

261
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,560
You're not Yueyang.

262
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,160
What's your name?

263
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:50,720
No.

264
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,120
No.

265
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,280
I'm Yue Qiluo.

266
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,680
What Yue Qiluo?

267
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,640
What Yue Qiluo?

268
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,120
Yue Qiluo?

269
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
He's Yue Qiluo!

270
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,480
Catch him!

271
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,360
Don't let him run away!

272
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,720
Yes.

273
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,800
My son is a child!

274
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:06,880
Hurry!

275
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,480
Go!

276
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:07,960
Hurry!

277
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,560
No.

278
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,880
Hurry!

279
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,560
Go!

280
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,080
Go!

281
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,320
Get out of the way!

282
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
Move!

283
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,160
He's back.

284
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,520
He's going to wake up.

285
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,440
Yueyang, remember this.

286
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,240
You're not Yue Qiluo,

287
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,960
you're Yueya.

288
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,000
You're dreaming now.

289
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,680
You're going to wake up.

290
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,480
Wake up!

291
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,400
Your brother is waiting for you.

292
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,120
Yueyang!

293
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,120
Yueya!

294
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,680
You're Yueya!

295
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,960
You're not Yue Qiluo!

296
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,920
Remember it!

297
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,200
Wake up!

298
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,280
You're Yueya!

299
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,720
You're not Yueya.

300
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,960
You're not Yueya.

301
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,160
You're not Yueya.

302
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,600
Who are?

303
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,480
Who are you?

304
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,960
Who are you?

305
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,440
I'm파 God.

306
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,640
Take him back!

307
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,040
Go.

308
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,960
You're not Yueya!

309
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,280
You're not Yue Qiluo.

310
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,600
You're not Yueya.

311
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
Who am I?

312
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Who am I?

313
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
Yu Yan. Yu Yan.

314
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Who am I? Who am I?

315
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
Have you entered Lord Gu?

316
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Wake up. Yu Yan.

317
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,120
Yu Yan. Yu Yan. Wake up.

318
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,120
Wake up.

319
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,120
That's all.

320
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,120
Yue Ya thinks she is Yue Qiluo.

321
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,120
Princess Yue Ya's memory is actually Yue Qiluo's.

322
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,120
So it is.

323
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,120
If it is really a memory, it must be over.

324
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,120
If the memory is over, will Yu Ya wake up?

325
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,120
No. Lord Gu.

326
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,120
What Yu Ya is experiencing now is the past of Yue Qiluo.

327
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,120
Have you forgotten what kind of play is Yue Qiluo's?

328
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,120
Play?

329
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,120
He was kept in the coffin for 100 years.

330
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,120
So he has to sleep for 100 years?

331
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,120
And Yue Qiluo is in his hands.

332
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Do you think it is just a simple way to make him sleep?

333
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,120
You said that Yue Ya is in her dream and wants to die.

334
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,120
What I am worried about now is that if she dies in her dream,

335
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,120
she will be saved in the real world.

336
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,120
What's wrong? Yue Ya is not right.

337
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Call the doctor.

338
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
What?

339
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
Yue Ya's breathing and pulse has become weaker.

340
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
Call the doctor.

341
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,120
Hurry up.

342
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
Hurry up.

343
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
You little bitch.

344
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
You are killing people.

345
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
You are lying.

346
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
What are you doing?

347
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
No.

348
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
No.

349
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
Our Miss...

350
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
Are you okay?

351
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
Please.

352
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,120
Please.

353
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
Let Miss off me.

354
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
She is a good person.

355
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
She and her husband are really in love.

356
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Please let her go.

357
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Please.

358
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
Yue Ya, remember.

359
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
You are not Yue Qiluo, you are Yue Ya.

360
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
These are the dream of the village head.

361
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
You will wake up soon.

362
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Wake up.

363
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
Wait for Yue Ya.

364
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,120
Yue Ya.

365
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Yue Ya.

366
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
After I get the money,

367
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
I will treat you to dinner

368
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,120
and help you pay for the inn.

369
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,120
I will treat you to dinner.

370
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,120
How is our family?

371
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,120
It's your family.

372
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,120
I will take care of it.

373
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
Okay.

374
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,120
Take care of it.

375
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
You can say anything.

376
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
Be careful.

377
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
I hate you.

378
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
Yue Ya.

379
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,120
Yue Ya.

380
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
No.

381
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
No.

382
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
No.

383
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
No.

384
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Give the master a revenge.

385
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,120
Go.

386
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Let them go.

387
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
Let them go.

388
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
Let them go.

389
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,120
Let them go.

390
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
Get up.

391
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
Let them go.

392
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Get up.

393
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
What are you doing?

394
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
Let me go.

395
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
Let me go.

396
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
Sister.

397
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
Sister.

398
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Get her up.

399
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
Let me go.

400
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
Get up.

401
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Hurry.

402
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Hurry.

403
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,120
What are you doing?

404
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,120
You are so mean.

405
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
Give her a change.

406
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
Hurry.

407
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,120
Hurry.

408
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
No.

409
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
No.

410
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
Let me go.

411
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
Let me go.

412
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Don't catch me.

413
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
Let me go.

414
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,120
Let me go.

415
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
Let me go.

416
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Sister.

417
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
Let me go.

418
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
Let me go.

419
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
Let me go.

420
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
Let me go.

421
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Let me go.

422
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,120
Let me go.

423
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
Who are you?

424
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
Let me go.

425
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,120
Let me go.

426
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,120
Brother Lei.

427
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Let me go.

428
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Let me go.

429
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Come.

430
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
Take her here.

431
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:14,040
It's your

432
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,480
No.

433
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,220
Will theowness enter this city?

434
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,360
No.

435
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,660
I suppose...

436
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,960
I know what a false sなん can do.

437
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,360
Cheeky dog髪 拿下你。

438
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,240
Your soul descends upon Jiale'n.

439
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,240
A demon girl.

440
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,920
You made my son suffering in vain.

441
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,480
What else do you want to say?

442
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,480
He died because of me.

443
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,440
But I really don't want him to die.

444
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,400
He wanted to die together.

445
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,800
I couldn't stop him.

446
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,480
He died.

447
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,520
I feel sad like you.

448
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,720
Because I love him.

449
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
I once had a problem.

450
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,720
I want to die with him.

451
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,960
Why are you still alive?

452
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,240
Please forgive me.

453
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,160
You can beat my mom or me.

454
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,560
As long as you can be calm.

455
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,640
As long as you are alive, I can't be careful.

456
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,360
Junior sister.

457
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,400
Do you know what's the point of saying these things?

458
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,200
Junior sister.

459
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,640
How could I be your junior sister?

460
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,000
It's true.

461
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,640
You were expelled from the wall.

462
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,440
From now on, you are no longer my junior sister.

463
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,640
I don't understand what you are talking about.

464
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,200
I have a problem with the Duan family.

465
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,440
But you?

466
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,920
Where did you come from?

467
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,480
Why did you arrest us?

468
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,760
You are so stubborn.

469
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,240
You dare to say something to me

470
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,160
when you are dead.

471
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,240
Take your magic.

472
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,520
Do you think you can fool me?

473
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,440
You are so stubborn.

474
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,960
You have killed many lives.

475
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,320
Today, I will punish you with my own hands.

476
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,760
I won't let you harm the human world.

477
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,280
Let go.

478
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,760
Yes.

479
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,000
Junior sister.

480
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,640
Let go of us.

481
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,320
Let go of us.

482
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,880
Junior sister.

483
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Junior sister.

484
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,440
Junior sister.

485
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,480
Let go of me.

486
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,240
Junior sister.

487
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,080
Let go of me.

488
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,720
Junior sister.

489
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,160
How can this maid be punished?

490
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,520
A maid?

491
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,400
She is a person who has lost her magic.

492
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,640
She can be punished anytime.

493
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,200
Yes.

494
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,560
What are you doing?

495
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,360
Let go of me.

496
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,960
Let go of me.

497
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,960
Take her down.

498
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,360
Yes.

499
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,960
No.

500
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,920
Let go of me.

501
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,960
Let go of me.

502
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,400
Let go of me.

503
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,520
Let go of me.

504
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,480
Elder sister.

505
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,120
Dis allegedly found a lady in previous hotel.

506
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,640
No, she is my only mother.

507
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,040
Don't follow her.

508
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,280
Go for it.

509
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,240
Let go.

510
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,520
Let go of me.

511
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,000
Get me out of here.

512
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,200
Get lost.

513
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,880
Yes.

514
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,440
No.

515
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,000
Let go of me.

516
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Help!

517
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Help!

518
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What's the matter? I'm a human!

519
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Let me out! Let me out!

520
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Let me out!

521
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Cheng Cheng, let me out! Let me out!

522
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Let me out!

523
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:35,000
What are you doing?

524
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Why don't you take the pig out? What's going on?

525
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I really can't do anything to you.

526
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
What did you say?

527
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
If Lingmei can't wake up, I'm afraid she can't live.

528
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You Zhong, say it again!

529
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Say it!

530
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Ling, I'm used to it.

531
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
If she can't wake up, I...

532
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You're so old. You're a dog.

533
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
If you can't cure my sister, I'll shoot you.

534
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Gu Ling, please spare me.

535
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Please spare me.

536
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Hurry up and get out of here.

537
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Tell me, don't let me see you in WeChat.

538
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yes, yes.

539
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Give me a hand.

540
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'll take the pig out.

541
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You're so old.

542
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
If you can't cure me, I'll shoot you.

543
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You're so old.

544
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'll take the pig out.

545
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I'll give you a hand.

546
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You're so old.

547
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'll take the pig out.

548
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You're so old.

549
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You're so old.

550
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I'll take the pig out.

551
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Everything is over.

552
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
What else do you have to fight?

553
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
The more I fight, the more painful it is.

554
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Only death is the real solution.

555
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
After death, everything will be over.

556
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
There's no more trouble.

557
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
There's no fear.

558
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
There's no pain.

559
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I'll find someone tomorrow.

560
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I'll find someone to break your broken door.

561
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'll break Yueya's door.

562
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I'll break Yueya's door.

563
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
She wasn't sick.

564
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
How can a doctor treat her?

565
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Then you still want me to find a doctor?

566
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You can't just keep watching.

567
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yue Qiluo said that once the patient is back, Yueya will die.

568
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Now the patient's health is getting weaker.

569
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yueya's pulse is getting weaker.

570
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm afraid that once the light is gone, Yueya will never wake up.

571
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Before, when I burned my blood,

572
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I could still feel pain and a memory of being awake.

573
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But...

574
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What's that?

575
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Every time Yueya wakes up,

576
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
the light will be redone.

577
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yueya will fall into the water again.

578
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
What are you trying to say?

579
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm trying to say that the light on her was strong.

580
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It proves that she's very full of energy.

581
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
That's why she can hold Yueya's body.

582
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yueya!

583
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Who am I?

584
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Did you see Master Gu?

585
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Who am I?

586
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Wake up!

587
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yueya!

588
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Who am I?

589
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
The patient's energy is very weak.

590
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Maybe it's time to let go of YiBo.

591
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
What are you doing?

592
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Calm down! Don't come here!

593
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm not here.

594
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
The patient's energy is very weak.

595
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Maybe I can wake her up.

596
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
She won't be here in a while.

597
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You ruined my sister.

598
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Didn't you?

599
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Are you tired?

600
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Don't force yourself.

601
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
If you're tired, go to sleep.

602
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Death is not scary.

603
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It's just a quiet scene.

604
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Death is the solution.

605
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The patient is back.

606
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Yueya will die.

607
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
But if you don't do anything,

608
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yueya will die.

609
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Let go of me!

610
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Calm down.

611
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
There must be other ways.

612
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You...

613
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Yueya is not breathing.

614
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
She's gone.

615
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
What should we do?

616
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I don't believe I won't let you succeed.

617
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Don't be angry.

618
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Give me back Yueya!

619
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
No!

620
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I can't let her die.

621
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Let her go!

622
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yueya!

623
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Let me go!

624
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Let me go!

625
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yueya!

626
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You're reactivated!

627
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I can't die.

628
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yueya!

629
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yueya!

630
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yueya!

631
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Yueya!

632
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
House.

633
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,920
Why so persistent?

634
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,760
Why did you go to hell?

635
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,440
You traveling the moon to the moon.

636
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,560
and travelled the moon to the moon and to the sky

637
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,360
and you must be locked with this goblet.

638
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,040
No.

639
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,040
I am not a evil dragon.

640
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,960
not me.

641
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You are the one!

642
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yueqin.

643
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,000
Who am I?

644
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,000
You are not Yueqin.

645
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I am.

646
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,000
You are not the same as me.

647
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,000
You see my life now.

648
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,800
Don't you think I am pitiful?

649
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
If you are in the capital,

650
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,800
you can take me home and live with me.

651
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
But now,

652
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,000
you see my life is so miserable.

653
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,000
Don't you think I should have another chance?

654
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,400
I like the man you like.

655
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,600
But he doesn't even look at me.

656
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,000
He is so lucky to have you in the middle.

657
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,400
I can love him for you, too.

658
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,200
Live with him for you.

659
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,000
As long as you are dead,

660
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,400
everything will be over.

661
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I will take you home.

662
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
No.

663
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
No.

664
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,000
What are you still fighting for?

665
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
You are destined to die here.

666
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
No.

667
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,600
Why should I give you a chance?

668
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,200
I will live my life by myself.

669
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,200
By yourself?

670
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,600
You don't even know who you are.

671
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yueyang.

672
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Yueyang.

673
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Yueyang.

674
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
Yueyang.

675
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Yueyang.

676
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Yes.

677
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,800
I am Yueyang.

678
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,400
I am Yueyang.

679
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
Yueyang.

680
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Yueyang.

681
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,400
This is me.

682
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,400
Yueyang.

683
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,600
I will ask you to take the test.

684
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,600
I will return half of your head to me.

685
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,600
Let's go home.

686
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,600
Okay?

687
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,000
I have met him since then.

688
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,000
I finally know

689
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,600
what he is like.

690
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,600
I will not lose

691
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,600
my future grandson.

692
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It's him.

693
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
It's him.

694
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
Yueyang.

695
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Yueyang.

696
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
Yueyang.

697
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
Yueyang.

698
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,600
Untracefully,

699
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,440
am I dreaming of you?

700
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
What?

701
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,800
No.

702
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,600
I love him.

703
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,400
Just like how heמשng did.

704
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,600
Am I dreaming...

705
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,600
Get it together.

706
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,600
is he?

707
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,800
You're finally awake.

708
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,600
You're finally awake.

709
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
You're finally awake.

710
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,080
You're really awake.

711
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
Pheasant.

712
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,040
Yue.

713
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,000
Come and sleep.

714
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,520
I'm not going to sleep.

715
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,440
I'm afraid that I'll wake up

716
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,560
if I sleep.

717
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,760
Don't worry.

718
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,200
I won't wake up.

719
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,840
I'll stay here with you.

720
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,120
I won't bother you.

721
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,160
After you wake up,

722
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,160
we'll go home tomorrow.

723
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
Okay.

724
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,600
I'll go home tomorrow.

725
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Master.

726
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
What's wrong?

727
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
Did you sleep well?

728
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
I just fell asleep.

729
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Mr. Guo.

730
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
Please take care of him for me.

731
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
Okay.

732
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
What's wrong?

733
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
I'm going to do something.

734
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
I'll be back soon.

735
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
No.

736
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Mr. Guo.

737
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Mr. Guo.

738
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Don't be angry.

739
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Listen to me.

740
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
I'm not a person who can't do anything for Tian Xing.

741
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
You're a demon.

742
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
I don't want to come here.

743
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
But.

744
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Don't be anxious and shy.

745
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
I'll be back.

746
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
I'll be back.

747
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
I'm not going to come here.

748
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
I'll be back.

749
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
I'm not going to come here.

750
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
I'll be back.

751
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
I'll be back.

752
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
I'll be back.

753
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
Don't be anxious and shy.

754
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
Don't be anxious and shy.

755
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Don't be anxious and shy.

756
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Or I won't let you go next time.

757
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,600
Tell you the truth.

758
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Dr. Guo.

759
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Dr. Guo.

760
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Dr. Guo.

761
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
Look at you.

762
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,600
You're just a little better.

763
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,600
You get upset about yourself again.

764
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Stop working.

765
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
You have to talk with me.

766
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,600
I can talk with you even if I work.

767
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
Come on.

768
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,440
I'll give it to you.

769
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,600
Fine.

770
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,600
What do you want to talk about?

771
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,640
Master Gu said

772
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
you were searching for death

773
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,720
for Duan San Lang in your dream.

774
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,760
Is that true?

775
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,400
Yes.

776
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,880
But that Duan San Lang

777
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,120
is exactly the same as you.

778
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,800
I saw him die.

779
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,040
I feel...

780
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,000
It's exactly the same as I saw him.

781
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,400
In my dream,

782
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,800
there are all kinds of strange things.

783
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,200
I can't help but think about it.

784
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,960
It's not true.

785
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,000
Give it to me.

786
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,480
No.

787
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,000
Give it to me.

788
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,480
No.

789
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,640
Give it to me.

790
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,160
No.

791
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,800
Give it to me.

792
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,200
No.

793
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,600
You said

794
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,080
there are thoughts and dreams in life.

795
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,640
Is that what you mean?

796
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,240
I won't tell you.

797
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,040
Give it to me.

798
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,880
Give it to me.

799
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,640
I won't.

800
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,160
Give it to me.

801
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,480
No.

802
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:34,920
You won't tell me.

803
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,640
I won't give it to you.

804
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,360
Tell me.

805
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,040
Who is the one

806
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,040
in your diary?

807
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,840
Duan Yan.

808
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,000
Master.

809
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,360
Master.

810
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,560
Open the door, sister.

811
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,480
Master.

812
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,920
Master, don't be like this.

813
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,080
I'm sick.

814
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,520
I have to see him.

815
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,360
Brother.

816
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,840
Brother is here.

817
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,600
Master Gu is here.

818
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,280
Sister.

819
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,800
I brought you some good things.

820
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,640
See if you like it.

821
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,120
See if you like it.

822
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,400
Do you like it?

823
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,480
Do you like it?

824
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,480
I'm not a big deal.

825
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,080
I don't need to waste my time.

826
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
What are you talking about?

827
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,600
Sister is surprised.

828
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,080
Brother bought some things.

829
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,880
What is the cost?

830
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:33,960
By the way,

831
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,520
the other day,

832
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,800
the little monster

833
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,200
didn't get hurt.

834
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:39,880
It's okay.

835
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,000
I came to you this time.

836
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,120
I just want to take you two to the mountain

837
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,440
to soak in hot spring.

838
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,800
Hot spring?

839
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,600
Yes.

840
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,520
That hot spring

841
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,720
is not

842
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,360
the kind of hot spring that burns water.

843
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,960
It's a hot spring

844
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,360
that comes from the ground.

845
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,480
It's a good thing.

846
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,680
There is also a hot spring like that.

847
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,360
Yes.

848
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,440
Can you soak in the cold?

849
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,520
I tell you.

850
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,560
In our family,

851
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,360
those stinky ladies

852
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,600
always ask me to take them

853
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,440
to soak in hot spring.

854
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,280
I don't take them.

855
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,600
I don't take them at all.

856
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,160
Let me tell you.

857
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,480
That can be used

858
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,280
for the beauty of the cold.

859
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,280
That's good.

860
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,120
But the one that is so cold

861
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,800
and so dirty

862
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,040
in the cold is so bad.

863
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,800
I don't want to go.

864
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,920
What's so bad?

865
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,800
Let me tell you.

866
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:30,920
Those are all

867
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,560
one radish and one stem.

868
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,760
They are all wrapped up.

869
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,200
They are the same as

870
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,320
our family.

871
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,000
That's okay.

872
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,560
Come with me.

873
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,200
Sister.

874
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,360
I'll go first.

875
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:53,880
Master.

876
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,640
Wait a minute.

877
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,320
What's wrong?

878
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,080
There is no sound.

879
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,200
It's urgent.

880
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,480
I said

881
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,840
you don't want to take us

882
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,080
to soak in hot spring.

883
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,040
I really want to take you

884
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,920
to soak in hot spring.

885
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,240
You two go with me.

886
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,800
It's delicious.

887
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,000
It's good.

888
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,640
What do you think?

889
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:13,880
No.

890
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:14,800
No.

891
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,280
Master.

892
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,000
Wait a minute.

893
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,360
I really want to soak in hot spring

894
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,640
with you two.

895
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,480
But

896
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,120
there is a little man

897
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,560
who wants to help you two.

898
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,520
I have a friend.

899
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,960
He wants to

900
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,000
buy a warm-up dress on the mountain.

901
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,680
But it's said

902
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,880
it's not clean inside.

903
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,040
I said it's okay.

904
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,440
It doesn't matter if it's not clean.

905
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,400
It's not clean.

906
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,200
Isn't it over?

907
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,280
The main thing is that we have to find the right person.

908
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,120
The right person.

909
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,440
Isn't it just a little thing?

910
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,120
Su's family is the last time.

911
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,520
How can I help you this time?

912
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:49,680
No.

913
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,200
You can say it as you like.

914
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,800
I can't listen to you casually.

915
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,360
What?

916
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,560
Besides,

917
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,640
you can wear a moon-dress

918
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,920
with this dress.

919
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,440
I can wear a few clothes.

920
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,240
It's not just a little thing.

921
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:01,880
Right?

922
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,560
What's the name of this dress?

923
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:06,600
Right.

924
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,120
It's called a bridal armor.

925
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,680
We can still wear a bridal armor.

926
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:12,720
Don't touch me.

927
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,680
Why are you like an old lady?

928
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,720
I was on the mountain last time.

929
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,400
I was on the mountain last time.

930
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,160
I was on the mountain.

931
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,040
Why don't you help me?

932
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,600
Okay.

933
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,280
I said it like this.

934
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,000
Where it goes.

935
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,540
You can do it.

936
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,760
Town Master.

937
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,860
Wu Xin, Yue Yang.

938
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,180
I believe you'll stick to the same order

939
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,360
and rule the world for a long time.

940
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:28,800
The wind carries her on the longest journey

941
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:36,600
I have been following the sunset, but it has not stopped

942
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:44,600
I have been using this warm starlight, and I have asked the flowers in the night

943
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:51,600
I have been wandering around, but I still remember the hometown

944
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,600
The life is a legend, the corner of time

945
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:05,600
She is watching people love and hate

946
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:13,600
Even if time passes by, she forgets and remembers

947
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:20,600
She leaves her memories and repeats the past

948
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:27,600
The life is a legend, the corner of time

949
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:34,600
The life is a legend, the corner of time

950
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:41,600
She is watching people love and hate

951
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:49,600
Even if time passes by, she forgets and remembers

952
00:46:50,600 --> 00:47:00,600
She leaves her memories and repeats the past

953
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,600
What have you done? Where did you go?

954
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,600
What's your name?

955
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,600
Yue Qiluo. Can I come home with you?

956
