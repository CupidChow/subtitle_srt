00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the grass and the shadow

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is full of love and face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if the clouds are floating

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The pain is so hard to describe

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The madness of ice

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Just one day

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You clearly have a life

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In the north side of the lake

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You clearly have a life

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In the north side of the lake

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You clearly have a life

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In the north side of the lake

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You clearly have a life

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The Love by 花花

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How is it?

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Honey

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You have turned the whole army into a fire pit

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You are so shameless

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You are so shameless

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Come on, try to find the old knife

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Come on, come on, come on

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
How is your thing?

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
My thing?

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
See?

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Take it

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Here is my painting service

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Take a look

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I have

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What is this?

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's like a broken stick

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You are so stupid

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This is the handphone I got from my friend in Xiyang

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Look

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Here is the switch

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Push it up

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
See?

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's brighter than the light

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's better to use a stick

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Can you not use a stick for your broken stick?

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Last time, because of your broken stick

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I almost got burned

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Stop it

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's go to get things

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Go

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You don't have to give it to me

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't know

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Wait for me

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Those little guys

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
They are all dead

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The cave is quite far from here

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Who said it's not?

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You said these little monsters

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If they are in the cave

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's better to be in the cave

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I can get some more explosives

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Just a little

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You said you came here

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I can't even burn the whole mountain

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Be careful

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Find him out first

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Chief

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We three are not sleeping

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We are staying here

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I just wanted to get him out of here

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I just wanted to get him out of here

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I just wanted to get him out of here

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Stop

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What's that sound?

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This...

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This is a god

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Whatェ

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Chief

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
No

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Is my facial expression used to look naughty?

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,940
Can I

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,880
Please.

93
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,560
Be more careful next time you shoot.

94
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,120
A little bit.

95
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,120
I didn't hit the monster.

96
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,840
I hit it once.

97
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,720
Yes.

98
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,640
I'm telling you.

99
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,600
Luckily, it's a bird.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,880
I'm telling you.

101
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
I'm telling you.

102
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,880
I'm telling you.

103
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
I'm telling you.

104
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
I'm telling you.

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
I'm telling you.

106
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,880
I'm telling you.

107
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
I'm telling you.

108
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
I'm telling you.

109
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
I'm telling you.

110
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
I'm telling you.

111
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
I'm telling you.

112
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
I'm telling you.

113
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,880
I'm telling you.

114
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
I'm telling you.

115
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
I'm telling you.

116
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
I'm telling you.

117
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,880
I'm telling you.

118
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,880
I'm telling you.

119
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
I'm telling you.

120
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
I'm telling you.

121
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,880
I'm telling you.

122
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
I'm telling you.

123
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,880
I'm telling you.

124
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,880
I'm telling you.

125
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,880
I'm telling you.

126
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,880
I'm telling you.

127
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,880
I'm telling you.

128
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
I'm telling you.

129
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,260
No.

130
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,140
Student.

131
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,140
Wait here.

132
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,140
I'll rest a bit.

133
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,540
ā

134
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,720
Enough!

135
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,060
Who?!

136
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
It's me.

137
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Yueya?

138
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
Why are you here?

139
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,880
I'm worried that you three haven't gone back yet.

140
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,880
No, you're not afraid to come here alone.

141
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,880
I'm not afraid. I always run around in the mountains when I was a kid.

142
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,880
That's not good.

143
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,880
It's hard to be free on the way.

144
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Send Miss Yuan'er back first.

145
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
It's almost dawn.

146
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
I don't think there's anything wrong with this.

147
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Let's go back together.

148
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Let's go.

149
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,880
Dao'er.

150
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
What's that sound?

151
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
Can you stop making noise?

152
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
No, Dao'er.

153
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
This sound.

154
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Where is it?

155
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,880
It's a giant green-legged snake.

156
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,880
You're not even useful in your mouth.

157
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,880
Run!

158
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,880
Run!

159
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
Hurry up!

160
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,880
Run!

161
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,880
Hurry up!

162
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
Run!

163
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,880
This way!

164
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Wait for me!

165
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Run!

166
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
I'm telling you, Wu Xin.

167
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,880
Don't fight me again next time.

168
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,880
Don't fight me!

169
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,880
Don't fight me!

170
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Look, Wu Xin is here.

171
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Why did you come here?

172
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
Why are you gone?

173
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
Hurry up, Wu Xin.

174
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
I'll give you a ride.

175
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,880
How is it?

176
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Did you feel anything?

177
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
No.

178
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
Such a big thing.

179
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,880
Why did you say you didn't feel anything?

180
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Wu Xin, what is this?

181
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Why are there so many years of night on this ground?

182
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Why are they like the nose-to-face?

183
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Last time, Wu Xin came back from the hole.

184
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
This is what's in it.

185
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,880
Oh, right.

186
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Those two soldiers who died on the bone.

187
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
This is what's in it.

188
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,880
Could it be the one in the dark shadow?

189
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Be careful!

190
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
There's something in here.

191
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
What is it?

192
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,880
Let's see if there are any other holes nearby.

193
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Let's seal it here first.

194
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Let's go back to the camp.

195
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Okay.

196
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,880
We were on the hole, but the weather was hot.

197
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,880
We went to the cave.

198
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,880
But we found two silver-gray silver on the hole.

199
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
We were on the hole.

200
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
We were on the hole.

201
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
We were on the hole.

202
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,880
We found two silver-gray silver on the hole.

203
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
Silver-gray silver?

204
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
What kind of silver-gray silver?

205
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
I didn't see it clearly.

206
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
It was too dark.

207
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Did anything unusual happen?

208
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,880
There was nothing unusual.

209
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,880
After the silver-gray silver disappeared,

210
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,880
we found two iron-gray silver on the ground.

211
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
Iron-gray silver?

212
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
Yes.

213
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,880
It must be the smelly woman from Yue Qiluo

214
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
who came to dig the cave.

215
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,880
Don't talk. Did you hear me?

216
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
Yes.

217
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
What is the purpose of this Yue Qiluo

218
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,880
to release the fake bug?

219
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,880
To assassinate Lord Gu?

220
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,880
To mess up the military morale?

221
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,880
Did he also look like a gold mine?

222
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
I think so.

223
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Not at all.

224
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Can you two talk about the truth?

225
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,880
The commander is in a hurry.

226
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Can you talk about the truth?

227
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
I'll think of a way.

228
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Chief.

229
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Do you remember the bucket

230
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,880
with the iron-gray silver on it?

231
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,880
Why do you mention it?

232
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Think about it.

233
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
If Ma Tong didn't use it to remove the evil,

234
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
why did Yue Qiluo

235
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,880
waste the money to put them there?

236
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,880
Why did you come here?

237
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,880
Why did you come here?

238
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,880
Let's talk about the gold mine.

239
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
Let's think of a way.

240
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Lord Gu.

241
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,880
I helped you to think of a way.

242
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Lord Gu.

243
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
The cave is the fake old house.

244
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,880
I can only try to find the gold mine.

245
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
How about this?

246
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
I'll give you the things I need

247
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
as a list.

248
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Tell me as soon as possible.

249
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Say it.

250
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,880
You've got the stars out of me.

251
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,880
I'll take them all off.

252
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
Do you believe me?

253
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
Master.

254
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,880
I've prepared everything you need.

255
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
Black dog blood,

256
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
Luo Pan,

257
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
Black donkey body,

258
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Pig sand,

259
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
Peach wood,

260
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
How about it?

261
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
I need to add one more.

262
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
What?

263
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,880
Tong Ziniang.

264
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
Tong Ziniang?

265
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,880
That's easy.

266
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,880
I'm so big.

267
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
So many people.

268
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,880
I can find ten of them.

269
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Don't be so young.

270
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
You're about thirty.

271
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
What? You're about thirty?

272
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
Can I make you

273
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
a black dog blood?

274
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,880
How about this?

275
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
Find a military water lake for me.

276
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
I'll find a way.

277
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,880
I have something to ask.

278
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
I don't know what to ask.

279
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
I'm not good at it.

280
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Please ask.

281
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Chief, are you Tong Ziniang?

282
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Master, what are you talking about?

283
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
You're a beginner.

284
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
What's this?

285
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
It's called three-star hotel.

286
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,880
Ice and green jade.

287
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Chief, you're not a real man.

288
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,880
You don't have many skills.

289
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Chief, if you're really Tong Ziniang,

290
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
I'll help you.

291
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
I have a chance.

292
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Chief, are you Tong Ziniang?

293
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
Right?

294
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Hurry up.

295
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
Get off.

296
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Get out.

297
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
Get out.

298
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Get out.

299
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
What are you doing?

300
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Is this a question?

301
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Is this a question?

302
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Who's not good at making mistakes?

303
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
You have to make mistakes.

304
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
You're not kidding.

305
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,880
I'm sorry.

307
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,880
I'm still in trouble.

308
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,880
These are the water and snacks sent by Chu Chenzi.

309
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,880
Come, sit down.

310
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,880
Not bad.

311
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
Come.

312
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,880
The old knife is quite weird.

313
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Send the snacks and the bird's nest together.

314
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
What's in the nest?

315
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
Tong Ziniang.

316
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,880
Heah!

317
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Do you한ie?

318
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
Oh right,

319
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
get ready.

320
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,880
I'm going to dine again today.

321
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,280
50% done

322
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,280
How long has he been down?

323
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,740
One hour

324
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,640
What to do if he can't come out collecting Sarah?

325
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,600
Sir, wayWho are you?

326
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,720
Come with me

327
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,880
Okay

328
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,120
Go

329
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,320
Captain

330
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,840
You really don't mythic

331
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,600
What are you talking about?

332
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,800
I'll go first!

333
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,280
Commander!

334
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,760
Are you heartless?

335
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,000
Master!

336
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,600
Give me a hand!

337
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,200
Master!

338
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,560
Come on, be careful!

339
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,080
Be careful!

340
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:26,800
Come on!

341
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,880
Have you eaten anything?

342
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,400
Here!

343
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,000
I found this!

344
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,920
It's disgusting!

345
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,000
Let's go back and talk!

346
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:17,480
Ouyang

347
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
I know what the stone is for.

348
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
This thing is for stone?

349
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
No.

350
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Actually,

351
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
that thing is a kind of stone.

352
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
As long as it smells a little bit of living things,

353
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
it will become a group of enemies.

354
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,480
So those stones are used to cover the smell of air.

355
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
I see.

356
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
So you mean,

357
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
the stone is used to cover the smell of air?

358
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,480
Yes.

359
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,480
So you mean,

360
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,480
the stone is used to cover the smell of air?

361
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
Yes.

362
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,480
Actually, I should have thought about it earlier.

363
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
If it is really a group of enemies,

364
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,480
Yue Qiluo would have destroyed it

365
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
a hundred years ago.

366
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
Why would he stay here?

367
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
If you say so,

368
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,480
it can't be destroyed by the fake bugs.

369
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Look.

370
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
What is this?

371
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,480
Isn't this the age of the cave?

372
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Yes.

373
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
This is the fake bug.

374
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
He is not afraid of my blood.

375
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
He is only afraid of the sun.

376
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
The sun is shining.

377
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
It will become like this.

378
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
The sun is shining.

379
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
That's all?

380
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
How about this?

381
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,480
Let's dig a hole in the ground.

382
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,480
How about the fake bugs?

383
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
No.

384
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
There are too many.

385
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
Unless we make the whole mountain flat,

386
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Mr. Guo,

387
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,480
do you want to continue to die?

388
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
I definitely don't.

389
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
It's all my soldiers.

390
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,480
If these soldiers die at the battlefield,

391
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,480
it's a glory.

392
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,480
What's the point of dying in the mine?

393
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
We can only seal the cave.

394
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,480
Don't let it go.

395
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
How can we explain to the general?

396
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
I don't want to give you a answer.

397
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,480
You can find someone who can solve the mystery soup.

398
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,480
Wu Xin, look.

399
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
There is a…

400
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
What are you looking at?

401
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
This bug has no legs.

402
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
It's really gone.

403
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,520
What are you looking at?

404
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,280
I said this bug has no legs.

405
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,760
Really?

406
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,720
My lord.

407
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,720
I've been playing the dance a few days ago.

408
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,200
It seems that my lord has a problem.

409
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,000
Now it seems that this problem

410
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,680
should be solved by this frame.

411
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,680
How can you say that?

412
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,140
After a聞 of affentlich legitimate

413
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,500
I am sure that

414
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,120
the frame is his mount text.

415
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,440
As long as this is not a lie,

416
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,160
it could cause drinking ash in him.

417
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,980
My lord, I am sorry

418
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,380
That the landslides created by this frame

419
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,760
need to be�нFI to be supposed to earn money.

420
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,360
It's a military position of Commander-in-Chief.

421
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,760
Indeed.

422
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,160
Commander-in-Chief,

423
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,160
I've told you that

424
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,360
the way to the Dragon-Native will be unexpected.

425
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,160
Commander-in-Chief, you don't know that.

426
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,360
The way to the Dragon-Native is about the path of the Ming and the An.

427
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,960
The path is about the money.

428
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,560
The path of the An is about the power to increase the power.

429
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,160
What's the problem?

430
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,960
Don't talk about it.

431
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,960
What's the problem?

432
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,760
Commander-in-Chief,

433
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,960
the dog-head of Zhang Xianzong has long been watching the situation.

434
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,160
If he digs it out one day,

435
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,960
he won't be able to say the reason.

436
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
How dare you!

437
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,960
I'll send a soldier to set the little island on fire.

438
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,560
Commander-in-Chief, Wei Wu and Commander-in-Chief,

439
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,760
are trying to dig the situation.

440
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,960
What's the name?

441
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
What's the name?

442
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,960
It's called the Ming and the An.

443
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,560
Commander-in-Chief, you're so great!

444
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,160
This situation has not only improved the power,

445
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,960
but also increased the power.

446
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,560
Isn't this what Commander-in-Chief said about the Dragon-Native?

447
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,360
Gu Guoqiang,

448
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
I'll give you seven days to set the line.

449
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,160
Take down the little island now.

450
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,560
Yes, Commander-in-Chief.

451
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,360
I'll make it up to you.

452
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,560
Go!

453
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,360
Go away!

454
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,760
Look!

455
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,940
Funny!

456
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,380
Li Huanyuan.

457
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,800
Come back.

458
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,920
It's getting cold.

459
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,200
Why are you not coming back?

460
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,200
I'm waiting for you.

461
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,960
Make a seat.

462
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,800
I'll pour you a cup of water.

463
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,240
What happened to you!

464
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,720
Has Doctor Gu had something bad with you?

465
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,120
No, she is fine.

466
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,320
What can she say?

467
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,720
She's very kind.

468
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,520
Didn't you say

469
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,800
you wanted to tell me something?

470
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
What's wrong?

471
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Yueya,

472
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
let's...

473
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,760
let's go back to Xiao Yuan.

474
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,120
Why?

475
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,360
Isn't it a good place to live?

476
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,960
Xiao Yuan is quiet.

477
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
I want to go back

478
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,160
and talk to you about something.

479
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,760
I'm going back to sell the coffin.

480
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,280
Fine.

481
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,480
I'll go wherever you go.

482
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,600
You asked Zhang Xian Song and Yue Qiluo to run away?

483
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,880
What are you doing?

484
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
I'm angry.

485
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,000
I've lost my mind.

486
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,560
Now you're saying this is a joke.

487
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,840
Tell me the truth now.

488
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,720
No matter what happens in the market,

489
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,120
we must catch them both.

490
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
Yes.

491
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,120
Hurry.

492
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,880
Ha Shi.

493
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,120
Yue Qiluo is really big.

494
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,840
She can't fight with us.

495
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,920
Now the whole Wen County is yours.

496
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,880
They can't do anything

497
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,080
in a short time.

498
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,880
I can't catch them.

499
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,800
I feel bad.

500
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,160
By the way,

501
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,880
I came to tell you that

502
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,360
Yueya and I

503
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,120
are going back to live.

504
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,120
Why?

505
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,200
Is the house not big enough?

506
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,280
Or is the room not much?

507
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Why?

508
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,960
No matter how big the house is,

509
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,200
it's not my own house.

510
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,040
Didn't I tell you?

511
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,680
My house is yours.

512
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,880
My house is yours.

513
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
That's right.

514
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,600
But we're still uncomfortable

515
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,320
with each other.

516
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,960
You two

517
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,520
are so poor.

518
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
Master.

519
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,640
I saw the road.

520
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,480
I was chased by the witness.

521
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,920
If I change my place here,

522
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,080
I'll go to Tianjin.

523
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,240
I won't see you.

524
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,800
You Yuan came to meet you.

525
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,560
Yes.

526
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,080
We have a fate.

527
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,280
We meet each other again and again.

528
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,920
Yes.

529
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,040
It's not easy for us to know each other.

530
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,880
Don't be angry

531
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,320
in the future.

532
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:29,920
Don't worry.

533
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,080
I can't fight with her.

534
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,760
I can't kill her.

535
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,920
She can't beat me either.

536
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,360
What are you doing?

537
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
What are you doing?

538
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
What's wrong?

539
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
What are you doing?

540
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,840
This is for you.

541
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,560
No.

542
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
This is for you.

543
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,560
No.

544
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,720
I didn't mean it.

545
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,360
You're getting more and more dirty.

546
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,800
I'll teach you a lesson.

547
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,960
I'll teach you a lesson.

548
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,040
I'll teach you a lesson.

549
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
I'll teach you a lesson.

550
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
I'm the most lazy one.

551
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,360
I'm out of here.

552
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
What's this?

553
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
I love you.

554
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,960
You said you love her.

555
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,360
Why am I so mean?

556
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,320
Come.

557
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,120
Come.

558
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,640
Come.

559
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,640
Yu'er, Wuxin.

560
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,800
Wait for me.

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,280
It's almost time for you to act.

574
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,120
What are you going to do?

575
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,800
I... I'm not talking.

576
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,240
I'm not Ji.

577
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,840
I'm Bai Liuli.

578
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,560
Ji has a name.

579
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,200
I told you. I'm not Ji.

580
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,640
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

581
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,280
But...

582
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,960
Youjiang.

583
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,960
I'm Jingling.

584
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
I just

585
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,880
came to Wu Xin on an appointment.

586
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,480
I'm currently

587
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,880
in charge of this mother's body.

588
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,840
An appointment?

589
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,400
What appointment?

590
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,480
She doesn't know

591
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,480
anything, right?

592
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,080
How about...

593
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,200
How about you eat first?

594
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,120
I don't know what to do.

595
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,840
She's not dead,

596
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,120
but she'll sleep

597
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,400
every 100 years.

598
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,080
After she wakes up,

599
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,680
she'll forget all the past 100 years.

600
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,640
I'm a little bit anxious with her.

601
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,560
So every time she falls asleep,

602
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,960
I take care of her.

603
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,960
Is what she said

604
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
true?

605
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,440
You're not afraid?

606
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,720
Yata.

607
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,680
I wanted to tell you.

608
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,880
But the last time I went to the police,

609
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,840
Huo Ligu was in a fight.

610
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,480
I didn't find a good time to tell you.

611
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,480
I didn't want to hide it from you.

612
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,040
How long?

613
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,760
How long

614
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,840
will you sleep?

615
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,520
About...

616
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,120
about one month.

617
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,560
After she wakes up,

618
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,040
she'll forget me.

619
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,040
Get out of here!

620
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,240
Get out!

621
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,720
Yueyue, listen to me.

622
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,680
Yueyue, listen to me.

623
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,120
Get out!

624
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,480
Yueyue.

625
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,200
Yueyue.

626
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,920
Get out!

627
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,800
Go! Hurry up!

628
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,520
I won't go!

629
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,760
You're not going, are you?

630
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,960
I'm going!

631
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,760
I'm going.

632
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,040
I'm going.

633
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,640
Yueyue.

634
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,360
Don't stop.

635
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,000
Don't stop, Yueyue.

636
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,920
Don't stop please!

637
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,240
Stop.

638
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,680
Don't smash your abs.

639
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Too hot.

640
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,680
Bye.

641
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,680
Baokang

642
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,680
Pinggong says there's nothing to hide from me

643
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,880
For what basis!

644
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,080
How many days have we been in this?

645
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,440
How many days?

646
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,440
You angry mother!

647
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,640
I've jimagened you

648
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:34,840
I suffered

649
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,640
the entire life for you

650
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,160
But actually

651
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,840
you've forgotten me

652
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,840
in an instant

653
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,680
Master, what are you doing?

654
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,280
Where are you going to learn to be a burden?

655
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,080
I've said it many times. I'm not a chicken.

656
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,680
Yuanhe, this chicken is not a talk of the town.

657
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,480
What are you doing?

658
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,080
I'm trying to open your eyes.

659
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,080
I'm trying to open your eyes.

660
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,080
I'm trying to open your eyes.

661
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,080
I'm trying to open your eyes.

662
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,080
I'm trying to open your eyes.

663
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,280
Open your eyes and look clearly.

664
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,280
You are the chicken.

665
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,680
Bai Liuli, don't think of them.

666
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,280
Why is this chicken becoming a human?

667
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,480
I don't know either.

668
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,280
Just this little thing.

669
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,080
You don't need to put it in your heart.

670
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,280
Little girls have a little temper.

671
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,680
Just persuade them. I'll persuade them.

672
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,680
Don't go.

673
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,080
Don't worry.

674
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,880
It's different from you when you go.

675
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,080
I'm Yueya's brother.

676
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,680
Sister!

677
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,280
Open the door!

678
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,480
I'm your brother.

679
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Gu Boqiang!

680
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,880
Sister, open the door for Brother Jiang!

681
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,480
Sister!

682
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,680
It's open.

683
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,080
Yueya.

684
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,480
Sister!

685
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,080
Sister, listen to me.

686
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,880
I'm not interested in it. Do you know?

687
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
Sister!

688
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,080
Master, you can catch a demon.

689
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,080
It's a girl.

690
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,280
You have to look at me. Look at me.

691
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,680
Sister!

692
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,280
Sister!

693
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
Yue! Yue!

694
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Yue!

695
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,880
It's okay.

696
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,880
It'll be fine in a few days.

697
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,480
It'll be fine in a few days.

698
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
Sister!

699
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,780
Yueya, I really have nothing to hide from you.

700
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,480
Yueya.

701
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,080
Yueya, wait a second.

702
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,080
Take it blue.

703
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:20,280
This time, you can't tear it down.

704
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,240
Yes, first.

705
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,300
It looks pretty, isn't it?

706
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,260
Nothing, I'll just take another time

707
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,420
and send it to Miss Chen Lotsing.

708
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,460
Chen Lotsing,

709
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,760
Are you sick?

710
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,500
Of course.

711
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,120
See there're thousands of people

712
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,420
I got sick.

713
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,940
When believe that?

714
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,000
It really is.

715
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,400
I feel very tired.

716
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,700
I can take care of it.

717
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,980
I'll leave...

718
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,320
...what you said.

719
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,020
Hello, your Majesty.

720
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,180
I'll go out and have a swim.

721
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,420
When you've done your own thing,

722
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,620
I'll come back.

723
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,180
Sister.

724
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:21,820
What's wrong?

725
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,100
Are you still angry?

726
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,860
As long as you're not angry,

727
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,220
you can do whatever you want.

728
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,820
There's a cabinet.

729
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,140
There's a cutting board.

730
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,340
And a frying pan.

731
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,300
As long as you're angry,

732
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,580
you can do whatever you want.

733
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:42,860
After you're angry,

734
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,340
go cook for me.

735
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,340
Do it yourself.

736
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,740
Yuya.

737
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,220
Why do you call me?

738
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,340
Don't you want to forget me?

739
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:16,900
Come here.

740
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,380
Let me see you.

741
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,700
You're right.

742
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,580
You just look at the teacher.

743
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,260
It's not reliable at all.

744
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,620
The society is sure to stop lying to me.

745
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,260
It's only a few days.

746
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,380
Yuya.

747
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,540
I said that

748
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,700
I've helped you.

749
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,420
I didn't do anything to you.

750
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,380
But you can't lie to me.

751
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,180
You're hiding such a big thing.

752
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,740
When do you want to hide it?

753
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,660
You're always like this.

754
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,500
Don't you know who I am?

755
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,220
I'd rather forget myself.

756
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,700
I don't want to forget you.

757
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,100
I won't believe you anymore.

758
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,700
I should have told you earlier.

759
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,900
But I'm afraid of opening the door.

760
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,700
I'm afraid that

761
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,500
you'll be sad

762
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,140
when you know it.

763
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,180
I'm afraid that I'll lose you.

764
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,700
I'm different from others.

765
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,260
I'm short-lived.

766
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,260
But after they're old,

767
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,620
they'll have many memories.

768
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,220
But I...

769
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,060
I've been living in this world for a long time.

770
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,540
But I can only remember the past.

771
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,660
I'm really afraid.

772
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,420
I'm really afraid that I'll forget

773
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,460
everything that happened before us.

774
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,420
I'm also afraid.

775
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,740
I'm also afraid that I'll wake up.

776
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,500
You'll live a lonely life.

777
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,300
And I...

778
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,660
And I'll live a life

779
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,300
without any regrets.

780
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,100
Yueya.

781
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:26,900
It's my fault.

782
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,900
It's my fault.

783
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,100
I hope you can forgive me.

784
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,700
I love you.

785
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,700
Stop!

786
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,700
I said that

787
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,700
I've been living in this world

788
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,700
without any regrets.

789
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,500
After you sleep,

790
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,500
I'll protect you.

791
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,900
Even if you sleep for years, I'll protect you.

792
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,100
I want you to open your eyes.

793
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,700
The first thing you see is me.

794
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,900
I want you to know what happened before us.

795
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,100
I want to live a life with you.

796
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,700
I'm afraid.

797
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,700
I'll live a life without regrets.

798
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,300
I'll live a life without regrets.

799
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,300
I'll live a life without regrets.

800
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,700
I remember

801
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,700
he left his memories

802
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,100
and re-established his life.

803
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,300
He left his memories

804
00:45:54,300 --> 00:46:01,300
and re-established his life.

805
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,700
I'll live a life without regrets.

806
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,700
I'll live a life without regrets.

807
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,700
I'll live a life without regrets.

808
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,700
I'll live a life without regrets.

809
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,700
I'll live a life without regrets.

810
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,700
I'll live a life without regrets.

811
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,700
I'll live a life without regrets.

812
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,700
I'll live a life without regrets.

813
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,700

00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:39,700

815
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:46,700

Life is a legend.

820
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,700
Time is a corner.

821
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,700
He's been watching people

822
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,700
love and hate.

823
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,700
Although time flies,

824
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,500
although he forgets

825
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:30,500
I remember that he left his memories and re-established his life

826
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:37,500
What is the turning point of life?

827
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:45,500
He is close to seeing people love each other and hate each other

828
00:47:45,500 --> 00:48:11,500
He is lost at any time, I remember that he left his memories and re-established his life

829
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,500
The End

830

Wu Xing!

833

Go!

834
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,500
