00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the greenery

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is shining on my face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if it were a universe

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The life is a dream

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The life is a dream

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One day

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You are clear and mysterious

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the background

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are clear and mysterious

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like a background

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The song is a dream

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The song is a dream

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The song is a dream

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The song is a dream

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You recognize me?

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't you recognize me?

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Of course. I've been living in the police station for so long.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Open your eyes.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The first person to see is you.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You look so pretty.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I just want to forget Dongnan.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You've been living in the police station for so long.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I've lived for so many years.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There are not many people in the police station.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You are one of them.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
My little maid is one of them.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Your maid?

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
My maid died to save me.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But I don't want her to die.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I just used her hair and hair to make her a new body.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So that she can keep staying with me.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You really took her away.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But do you know that she has been separated from the world

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
to save you?

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So what?

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I've been living for 100 years.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Isn't it enough?

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Or you can follow me.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I will be nice to you.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Who are you?

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You didn't breathe.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You didn't even dance.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't torture me.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Although I asked you to return the favor,

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm also innocent.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We didn't do anything wrong.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let's not be together anymore.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Really?

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yuya, you saw it.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's not me.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
She didn't come here.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Little fox, get out of here.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Just do it.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Wait a minute.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Take this.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Commander, this is...

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The blood family.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They used foreign cigarettes from the French.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They had to do it for months on the way.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's hard.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You usually send them to the 80s.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You can change some new ones.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Commander, I can't smoke.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
How can you not smoke?

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Go back and learn.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Here, throw it away.

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Little fox, I've eaten the food for you.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You're here to play the white wolf. Get out.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm so stupid. I saw you wrong.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't want to see you again.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't be so shameless. Get away from me.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Who are you? What are you doing here?

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The game is about to start.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The horse is running. The horse is running.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The reward is given to the queen.

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The reward is given to the king.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The reward is given to the king.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The reward is given to the king.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The reward is given to the king.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The reward is given to the king.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The reward is given to the king.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The reward is given to the king.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The reward is given to the king.

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The reward is given to the king.

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The reward is given to the king.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The reward is given to the king.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The reward is given to the king.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I...

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I just walked over.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,840
Come in.

108
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,800
Your Excellency,

109
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,080
you sent another gift.

110
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,840
Your Excellency,

111
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,840
It's not bad to give you something else.

112
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,840
I think Gu Danyuan is really good.

113
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,840
You are brothers who play with you.

114
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
But now you are the master and the servant.

115
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,840
Gu Danyuan is not a good person.

116
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,840
He is just a good thing for you.

117
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,840
If I have such a brother,

118
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,840
I will have to laugh when I fall asleep.

119
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
You have to laugh when you fall asleep.

120
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,840
Why don't you laugh when I laugh?

121
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
Get out.

122
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,840
Get out.

123
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
Get out.

124
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
Yueyue.

125
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
Good Yueya.

126
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
Don't call me.

127
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Don't you like that little liar?

128
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
Go find him.

129
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,840
How can I like him?

130
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
You misunderstand me.

131
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,840
What do you mean?

132
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
You said you wouldn't stay.

133
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
You are so rude today.

134
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,840
You are a bad man.

135
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
Get up.

136
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
I want to work.

137
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
Yueya.

138
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
Are you jealous?

139
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
Jealous?

140
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
What is my jealousy?

141
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
I am not jealous.

142
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
Get out.

143
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
Don't make me work.

144
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
Yueya.

145
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
You misunderstood me.

146
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840
How can I like that little liar?

147
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
He was the one who was jealous of me.

148
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
I am the one who was afraid to run away.

149
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
I was afraid to tell you.

150
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
Do you know who he is?

151
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
How can I know?

152
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
He is Yue Qiluo.

153
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
What?

154
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
Yue Qiluo?

155
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
He died early.

156
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840
And he was locked up in the police.

157
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,840
I don't know what happened.

158
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
But you should be careful.

159
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,840
You were wearing the protective suit with me.

160
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
I was.

161
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
That's good.

162
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
I got the suit from the police.

163
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
Yue Qiluo is a little bit lonely.

164
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
You should wear it.

165
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Do you understand?

166
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,840
How is it?

167
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
It's okay.

168
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
It's really okay.

169
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
It's great.

170
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,840
From vegetable to mixed vegetable to wild taste.

171
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
It's okay.

172
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840
It seems that you are really good.

173
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
It seems that the blood is really useful.

174
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Is it useful?

175
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
We should make the root.

176
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,840
It's a pity that Wu Xin didn't even tell us where to hide.

177
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,840
I don't think he knows.

178
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Most of these are useless.

179
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,840
He is not capable.

180
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,840
But I heard that the Taoism in Qingyun Temple is really capable.

181
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
But the price is high next time.

182
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,840
How about we make a try?

183
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Master, Madam.

184
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
It's bad.

185
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Master, Madam.

186
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,840
What are you so worried about?

187
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,840
The hair stylist told us to let him go.

188
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,840
And he was killed by the same thing.

189
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
What?

190
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,840
Are you blind?

191
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,840
Why didn't you understand it so many times?

192
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
What's going on?

193
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Madam, listen to me.

194
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Last time I saw the hair stylist who was killed by a dead rabbit.

195
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,840
And I mentioned the magic.

196
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,840
Do you think it has something to do with this weird thing?

197
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,840
How did you deal with the dead animals?

198
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Usually, they are all in the small woods outside the city.

199
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,840
But every time they throw it away, they don't see it for a long time.

200
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,840
I guess they are divided into food for the wild dogs.

201
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
So I didn't think much.

202
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,840
After you throw it away, don't leave.

203
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Just stay there and see what happened.

204
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
Yes, I understand.

205
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Master, Master.

206
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
Master.

207
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
Look carefully.

208
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
All the dead animals are alive.

209
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
Please, Madam.

210
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Yes.

211
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,840
Mr. Guo, please come to the master's room.

212
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Let's go.

213
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
What are you doing?

214
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Master, Master.

215
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
I'm sorry.

217
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Master, what are you doing?

218
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
What are you doing?

219
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,840
You are so old and afraid of nothing.

220
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,840
You even ask me?

221
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
We are not that poor.

222
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
We are good at eating and drinking.

223
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,840
You even colluded with the liar Wu Xin to play with us.

224
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
You made me suffer so much.

225
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
You made me lose my face.

226
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
You are so heartless.

227
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Master, you don't know me.

228
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
You don't know me.

229
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
You don't know me.

230
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,840
You are just a mouthful.

231
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,840
I always like to be loyal.

232
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Right?

233
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
I'm good at playing.

234
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,840
That's for the sake of the reputation.

235
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,840
How can I do a lie?

236
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
You really think you are a good doctor?

237
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,840
We all know what you did in the woods yesterday.

238
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
Master.

239
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
Let's go.

240
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
Tell me.

241
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Did you do the tricks?

242
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Why did you hurt us?

243
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
Since you all know,

244
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,840
I have nothing to hide.

245
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,840
But we need to make it clear.

246
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,840
I didn't collude with the liar Wu Xin.

247
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
I don't need it.

248
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
And

249
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,840
I can't do a lie.

250
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,840
I let those little guys go.

251
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
Why did you do that?

252
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,840
Because I was on the way to the heaven.

253
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
You can't eat.

254
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
I also made some tricks.

255
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
You are the one.

256
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,840
How did I do it?

257
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,840
You two killed the mountain.

258
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,840
You killed the stone, the snow and the people.

259
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,840
And you killed the cow.

260
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,840
You are so cruel.

261
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,840
I will take the blame for your achievements.

262
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
Shut up.

263
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,840
You old man.

264
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
What happened to the animals?

265
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,840
We were caught and we were robbed.

266
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
We were in the heaven and earth.

267
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,840
You are in our hands.

268
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,840
How dare you do that?

269
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,840
You don't want us to eat meat?

270
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,840
You want to do justice for the heaven?

271
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
I will show you a trick.

272
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
What are you doing?

273
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Let go of me.

274
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Let go of me.

275
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
Come on.

276
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Let me tell you a name.

277
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,840
This is called Wu Shu Banjiang.

278
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,840
This is called Tiejia Chuan Shan.

279
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,840
It's not just Chuan Shanjia.

280
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
It's a little bit of a trick.

281
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
Come on.

282
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Don't you want to try it?

283
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
I forgot to tell you.

284
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
Mr. Wang.

285
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,840
These dishes are all the dishes you left behind.

286
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,840
That's right.

287
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,840
If you can let go, we can catch them.

288
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,840
As long as we pay the money,

289
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,840
we can handle these things.

290
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
This is the heaven.

291
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
Do you understand?

292
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
Let go of me.

293
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,840
Let go of me.

294
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,840
Isn't this Wen Ya's uncle?

295
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840
Why are you talking nonsense?

296
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,840
If we can't get it,

297
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,840
we will be in trouble.

298
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
Don't move.

299
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,840
Don't worry.

300
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,840
We will go to Qingyun Temple

301
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,840
to see if you are human or demon.

302
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,840
Come on.

303
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Eat.

304
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
What's the sound?

305
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,840
There is no sound.

306
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
There is no sound.

307
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
There is no sound.

308
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
There is no sound.

309
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
There is no sound.

310
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840
It must be the sound from the cabinet.

311
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
There is nothing.

312
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,840
It's the sound from the cabinet.

313
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Madam, what's wrong with you?

314
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,840
Madam, what's wrong with you?

315
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,840
I can't get to Qingyun Temple.

316
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
I will kill you.

317
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
Someone is coming.

318
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
Master.

319
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Master.

320
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
What's wrong?

321
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Please don't do anything.

322
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Yes.

323
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
Master.

324
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
Master.

325
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
Please don't do anything.

326
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,840
I will let you know

327
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,840
what evil is.

328
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,840
Go.

329
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840
Master, why did you leave?

330
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Yes, I will let you know.

331
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,840
Master, you have been here for two days.

332
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,840
You let me die for two days.

333
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,840
Master.

334
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,840
Master.

335
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,840
Master.

336
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,840
Isn't this the dog that Suji raised?

337
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
Yes.

338
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,840
Don't worry.

339
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,840
I will let you know.

340
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,840
Well, I am here.

341
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
Please save my master.

342
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,840
Take it.

343
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,840
Go.

344
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,840
Master.

345
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
Master.

346
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
It's nothing.

347
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
You should go in.

348
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,840
Master.

349
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
Master.

350
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
Master.

351
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Master.

00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,780
Go away.

381
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,900
Let go of me.

382
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,620
Go away.

383
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,500
Go away.

384
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,060
What's going on?

385
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,460
Yueyang.

386
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,220
Why do you see the door?

387
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,780
What's wrong with your face?

388
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,820
Well...

389
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,340
The house was lost by the demon.

390
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,420
It lost its eye.

391
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,860
What I saw just now is a illusion.

392
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,020
I was also...

393
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,140
It fell on the pillar.

394
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,700
Don't waste your energy.

395
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,820
You can't break Zhang Yunfa's law.

396
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,860
What did you say?

397
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,820
Nothing.

398
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,020
Go find Mr. Gu.

399
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,300
No.

400
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:50,740
bunk.

401
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,460
You should not use your face.

402
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,620
The only thing that Solo simple can't do is meet the guest.

403
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,220
5

404
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,500
Mrsらい.

405
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
Why is Mr. Gu like this?

406
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,300
She is noisy and poor

407
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:05,860
but she is very clever.

408
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,380
She is just an old maid of Mr. Gu.

409
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:07,900
Sis.

410
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,780
both of you just like my little maid,

411
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,300
leader Jiao.

412
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,780
Julien,

413
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,440
That's her.

414
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,100
That's herself.

415
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,100
What?

416
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,580
Are you after them?

417
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,360
One moment.

418
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,240
They're either public or מס Army people.

419
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,780
You've got a sharp eye,

420
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,160
but you actually have.

421
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,620
Damn her.

422
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,480
It's much worse than this.

423
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,480
We must hurry and break it.

424
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,480
Otherwise, those two words will be really dangerous.

425
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
Here.

426
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,480
Throw them out.

427
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,480
Let's do it together.

428
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,480
We will succeed.

429
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
We are doomed.

430
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,480
Help!

431
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,480
Help!

432
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,480
Help!

433
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,480
We must hurry and break it.

434
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,480
We must hurry and break it.

435
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
We must hurry and break it.

436
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Help!

437
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,480
These demons are all books.

438
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,480
These lines are all books.

439
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,480
Don't be so impulsive.

440
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,480
You should be better.

441
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Kill!

442
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
Kill!

443
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Bastard!

444
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Kill!

445
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
Kill!

446
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
Kill!

447
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Lie down!

448
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
Kill!

449
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Why are you so quick?

450
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
Come and save me.

451
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
I haven't seen the moon yet.

452
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
Master.

453
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,480
Wait a minute.

454
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Wu Xin, come here.

455
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,480
Wu Xin!

456
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
It's coming.

457
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,480
Hurry up!

458
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
I'm so tired.

459
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
Come here.

460
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,480
Come here.

461
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,480
Why am I lying here?

462
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,480
Master.

463
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,000
Master, are you okay?

464
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,480
Master.

465
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,480
What are you doing?

466
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,320
Doctor, please forgive me.

467
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,520
Get up.

468
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
It's okay.

469
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,320
Are you okay?

470
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,880
Doctor, please forgive me.

471
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,920
Doctor, please forgive me.

472
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,240
Please forgive me.

473
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,120
Doctor, please forgive me.

474
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,120
Please forgive me.

475
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,680
Please forgive me.

476
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,200
Thank you for saving my life.

477
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,600
Thank you, doctor.

478
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,920
Thank you.

479
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
Thank you.

480
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,640
I'll take this Huang Daqian away.

481
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,960
Don't worry.

482
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
As long as you are busy,

483
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,080
and you are kind,

484
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,280
he won't trouble you.

485
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,360
I will.

486
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,040
I won't do it again.

487
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,920
Yes.

488
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,880
We won't be late.

489
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,120
We still need to find the document.

490
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,320
Everyone is not allowed to eat it.

491
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
Yes.

492
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,400
Daqian, are you satisfied with this?

493
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Yes.

494
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,800
Goodbye.

495
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Goodbye.

496
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Goodbye.

497
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Take care.

498
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,200
Daqian, please.

499
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Master, master.

500
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,200
Mr. Gu,

501
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,680
this carriage is going back to my home.

502
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,360
Your private car is over there.

503
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,080
We are not going in the right direction.

504
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
Goodbye.

505
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,160
Master.

506
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,280
Master, come back to my home.

507
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
Okay.

508
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,280
Go.

509
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,680
Master.

510
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,240
Yu Yang, we are here.

511
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
How is it?

512
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Wake up.

513
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,240
The house needs to be in its original state.

514
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,760
First, it needs to be in the north and south of the prime minister.

515
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,320
The windows need to be big and the air needs to be good.

516
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,600
And

517
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,560
there must be a tree in the yard.

518
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,080
The tree and the grape are all right.

519
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
Yes.

520
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,240
And there must be a big kitchen.

521
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,560
The kitchen is small.

522
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,560
It won't be comfortable for days.

523
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,800
It's inside the palace.

524
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,560
Now the young forward is coming.

525
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,000
I just want to name him as Quick Pretext.

526
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,920
He's coming to drink with you daughters.

527
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,480
Look,

528
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,840
you are still in love,

529
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,320
why are you closing the door?

530
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,880
Tr观冱

531
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,120
Where are you?

532
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
I will transfer you

533
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,120
to the corner of time

534
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
and the corner of time

535
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
It's your home

536
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,120
I will borrow it

537
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
Ok, borrow it

538
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
You can say anything

539
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
I will borrow it

540
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
I will forget it

541
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
I remember

542
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
he left his memories

543
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,120
and repeated it

544
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
I will live

545
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
He left his memories

546
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
and repeated it

547
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
He left his memories

548
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Taixuan

549
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
You have a lot of food

550
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
and sleep well

551
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,120
when are you going to leave?

552
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
You don't have to worry about it

553
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
You are free to take care of me

554
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,120
I will take care of you

555
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
You are a good person

556
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,120
This time

557
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,120
I am busy

558
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,400
You helped me a lot.

559
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,320
After all,

560
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,560
if I really hurt people's lives,

561
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,800
it would be a shame.

562
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,480
In the critical moment,

563
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,760
can you help me to make a living?

564
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,920
I will pay for this.

565
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:44,880
How?

566
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,920
Zhen'er,

567
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,000
I can fulfill your wish.

568
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,720
How about it?

569
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,800
Good.

570
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,720
Let Yue'er marry me.

571
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,600
I don't care about stupid things.

572
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,120
Besides,

573
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,520
whether Yue'er marry you or not,

574
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,920
I can't help you.

575
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:12,920
Let's change.

576
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,120
Let's change?

577
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,120
That's the house you left me.

578
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,920
It's a wish for me.

579
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,520
Can you be serious about your life?

580
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
Don't be so serious.

581
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,520
I'm a serious person.

582
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,320
But it's okay.

583
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
I have time.

584
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,520
When will you think about it?

585
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,120
When will I make a living?

586
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
No, I mean you...

587
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,520
Yue'er is so good at making a living.

588
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,920
I have to change.

589
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
Yue'er.

590
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,320
cheers

591
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,120
I'm summary of the first year.

592
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,920
Is she okay?

593
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,320
Miss You add me.

594
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
What makes me angry?

595
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,820
Tell my wife who's off work is breakfast.

596
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:18,740
At vecsetガ

597
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:23,180

What?

601
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,100
You left my home

602
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,920
this is the biggest thing I had ever.

603
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,740
I didn't make it

604
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,440
I'm the one who is listened to .

605
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,460
I really cannot break بَُِ housed roads

606

I am the one who is listen to

607
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,940
I'm the one who is listened to

608
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,980
Give up

609
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,880

610
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,640

open the door

622
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,900
you keep looking for it

623
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,180
put it here

624
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,900

625
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,260
this is my house

626
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,380

627
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:45,980

00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,220
you still are

629
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,220
I... I...

630
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,220
I'm his father.

631
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,220
Han Shanzhang, this is a tea for you.

632
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,220
What is it?

633
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,220
This...

634
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,220
This is...

635
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,220
I...

636
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,220
I...

637
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,220
I'm telling you.

638
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,220
We've lost the bet.

639
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,220
You're his family.

640
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,220
We'll be in trouble if we lose, right?

641
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,220
I don't care.

642
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,220
I'm not a housewife.

643
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,220
Just sell it.

644
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,220
It's hard to hear what he's saying.

645
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:27,220
Besides, you can't lose your temper.

646
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,220
Don't worry.

647
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,220
You really don't want to go back.

648
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,220
Look at him.

649
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,220
Look at his virtue.

650
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,220
He wants to go back.

651
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,220
He wants to go outside.

652
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,220
If I didn't send two children to come here,

653
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,220
we wouldn't be able to see him today.

654
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,220
Don't say that.

655
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,220
You're so capable.

656
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,220
You live in the private house.

657
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,220
You've been with Xiaobai for days.

658
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,220
You...

659
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,220
You're still in the house.

660
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,220
You're so happy.

661
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,220
You don't care about your father or mother.

662
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,220
You're embarrassed to see us.

663
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,220
No, I'm not.

664
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,220
Mother, are you my biological mother?

665
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,220
How old are you?

666
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,220
You're making me an old man for some money.

667
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,220
Do you care about us?

668
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,220
You little girl.

669
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,220
Who gives you such a big temper?

670
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,220
Listen to me.

671
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,220
I've taken your mother away.

672
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,220
I can't even get out of here.

673
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,220
You want to go back today.

674
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,220
You want to go back with me.

675
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,220
I'm tied.

676
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,220
I want to tie you back.

677
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,220
I don't want to go back with you.

678
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,220
Old man, come here.

679
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,220
Hurry up and tie him back.

680
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,220
Stop it.

681
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,220
Don't shout.

682
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,220
Don't shout.

683
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,220
If I say it,

684
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,220
I'll say it.

685
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,220
If I say it,

686
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,220
he'll live a good life.

687
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,220
If he doesn't come back,

688
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,220
I'll say it.

689
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,220
What?

690
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,220
I'll say it.

691
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,220
Forget it.

692
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,220
You bastard.

693
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,220
Just say it.

694
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,220
I'll say it.

695
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,220
You...

696
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,220
Are you trying to bully me?

697
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,220
I can't.

698
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:17,220
I can't give it back today.

699
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,220
I'm sorry.

700
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,220
I'm really dying.

701
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,220
Don't do that.

702
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,220
Don't do that.

703
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,220
You're laughing.

704
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,220
I can't.

705
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,220
I'm sorry.

706
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,220
I can't.

707
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,220
You're so old.

708
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,220
You're so old.

709
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
Don't do that.

710
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,220
I'm sorry.

711
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,220
I'm sorry.

712
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,220
Don't do that.

713
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,220
Stop it.

714
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,220
Just stay there.

715
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,220
I'll leave you alone.

716
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,220
Go back.

717
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,220
Go back.

718
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,220
You beat me.

719
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,220
Mother.

720
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:54,220
I'm so old.

721
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,220
I'm so old.

722
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,220
I can't.

723
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,220
Yu Yan.

724
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,220
Yu Yan.

725
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,220
I'm so old.

726
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,220
You're so old.

727
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,220
You're so old.

728
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,220
You're so old.

729
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,220
Marry your ex-girlfriend to Guancai.

730
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:26,220
Marry your ex-girlfriend to your own son.

731
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,220
How about this?

732
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,220
How's the life?

733
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,220
It's not like that.

734
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,220
She left her mother to Yueya's golden bamboo.

735
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,220
She gave birth to a necklace and earring.

736
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,220
She left it with her.

737
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,220
She left it with her.

738
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,220
Means good-bye.

739
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,220
See you next time.

740
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,220
No.

741
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,880
No.

742
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,220
No.

743
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,220
No.

744
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,220
I'm leaving.

745
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,220
No.

746
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,220
Go.

747
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,220
Go.

748
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,900
Hao Zhang, if I let this witch leave,

749
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,140
it's a great blessing.

750
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,900
Of course, it's a great blessing.

751
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,140
If she can leave, it's my biggest wish.

752
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,500
My god, I'm so ashamed.

753
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,380
No.

754
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:45,800
The

755
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,820
the

756
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,660
she

757
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,780
left

758
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,020
and disappeared.

759
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,220
She leapt back.

760
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,700
Xu 치� heal

761
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,460
his

762
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,660
she won't mind.

763
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,660
You know him very well

764
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,060
so I will run away from home to ask him for something real.

765
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,300
Okay?

766
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,500
If I ask him,

767
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,540
if anymoreắox things will be better

768
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,300
just free a little money in my pocket!

769
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,940
I will go buy a party hardly any more!

770
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,980
I am suddenly worried

771
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,980
and frankly,

772
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,420
the moneyapon will be much better!

773
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:25,700
I'm sure

774
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,900
that he will bring some of your wants

775
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,700
while you take me with him!

776
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,020
What's wrong?

777
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,820
to make the old official get drunk.

778
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,220
No,

779
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,420
I'm just looking at the heart.

780
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,220
Ya Ya.

781
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,420
Well,

782
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,820
this is the dowry you left for your wife.

783
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,620
You haven't married her.

784
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,420
I'll keep it for you for a few years.

785
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,820
I've made those two jewels into a necklace.

786
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,020
Well,

787
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,020
we'll be going back after we're done.

788
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,820
We'll leave after we finish our meal.

789
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,220
Yes, yes, yes.

790
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,020
That's right.

791
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,820
You still have to finish your breakfast.

792
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,020
Or we'll eat...

793
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,020
What do you mean?

794
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,020
Go ahead and eat.

795
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:18,620
I'll go home.

796
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,620
Your father is good at eating.

797
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:20,820
Let's go.

798
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,420
We're leaving.

799
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,220
We're leaving.

800
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:22,620
Let's go.

801
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,020
Brother.

802
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,820
Let's go.

803
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,820
Or I'll get some steamed buns.

804
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,020
You can eat them on your way.

805
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,220
It's okay.

806
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,020
It's okay.

807
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,020
What are you doing?

808
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,020
Go away.

809
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,420
Ma'am,

810
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,020
what are you doing?

811
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,020
I said we'll eat them.

812
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,620
Go away.

813
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,420
You...

814
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,620
You're a piece of cake.

815
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,020
What do you know?

816
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,820
Yes, yes.

817
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,020
What do you mean?

818
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,820
I said we'll go home.

819
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,620
Let's go.

820
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,420
Let's go.

821
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,020
Ya Ya,

822
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,020
don't send me off.

823
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,220
Don't send me off.

824
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,220
Take care of yourself.

825
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,020
Don't send me off.

826
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,420
Old man,

827
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,220
go.

828
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,220
Go.

829
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,220
I'm not worried.

830
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,020
What do you use?

831
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,220
So quick to use?

832
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,820
I'm not afraid of ghosts

833
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,220
when I'm in trouble.

834
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,020
The best person in the world

835
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,220
is the one who has a ghost in his heart.

836
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,020
A little bit of little magic.

837
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,620
The problem is solved.

838
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:46,220
My life is so hard.

839
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:53,220
My life is so hard.

840
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,020
Stop it.

841
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,620
Look who's here.

842
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,820
My bracelet

843
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,220
has become a necklace.

844
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:08,220
It's on your body.

845
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,220
If you dare to bully me again,

846
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,220
I'll marry you, the old man.

847
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,220
Come down and accompany me.

848
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,220
Come on.

849
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,220
Come on.

850
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,220
Help me.

851
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,220
My god.

852
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,220
Don't send me off.

853
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,220
Don't send me off.

854
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,220
Old man,

855
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,220
go.

856
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,220
Yueya,

857
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,220
I'm asking you one last time.

858
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,620
What's your plan?

859
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,220
Look,

860
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,220
you're always living with a man

861
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,820
without knowing anything.

862
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,220
Time is long and the wind is strong.

863
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,220
You're a girl.

864
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,820
It's not a long-term thing.

865
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,420
Dad,

866
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,820
it's okay for me to live with others.

867
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:25,820
They want to say something,

868
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,220
so let them say it.

869
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,820
I'm not afraid of them.

870
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,420
Besides,

871
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,420
since I met him,

872
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,220
I finally know

873
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,020
what it's like to be loved.

874
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,220
I won't lose

875
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,420
my life

876
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,220
even if I marry him.

877
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,820
Wake up.

878
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,820
Dad,

879
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,820
I understand.

880
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,820
Have a good life.

881
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,820
Don't be sad.

882
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,820
You can't stay, right?

883
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,820
You want me to take care of Yueya?

884
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,820
I can't be a good girl.

885
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,820
But as long as I'm with you,

886
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,820
as long as Yueya agrees,

887
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,820
no matter if she marries me,

888
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,820
I'll do my best to protect her

889
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,820
and take care of her for my whole life.

890
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,820
You can go.

891
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,820
I'll send you off.

892
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,820
Yueya.

893
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:04,820
Dad,

894
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,820
we're leaving.

895
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,820
Be careful.

896
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,820
Let's go.

897
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,820
Be careful.

898
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,820
Hurry up.

899
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,820
Let's go.

900
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,820
Are you serious about what you said?

901
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:26,820
Fine.

902
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,820
Listen to me.

903
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,820
You're still laughing?

904
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,820
You're so shameless.

905
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,820
Stop.

906
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,820
Stop.

907
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,820
Stop.

908
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,820
Hello everyone,

00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:57,620

I will never forget you

I will never forget you

921
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,820
I will never forget you

I will never forget you

I will never forget you

929
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,820
I will never forget you

930
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,820
I will never forget you

931
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,820
One more thing

932
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,820
Similarly

933
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,820
There is a��

934
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:32,900
the consequence for losing theク

935
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,920
The only thing not saying it

936
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,780
is it's destiny

937
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,780
We can't have this

938
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,780
in this way

939
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,780
so eager to fly

940
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,420
Come

941
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:12,740
I'll help you.

942
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,620
Xiao Jian.

943
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:14,220
Let me go.

944
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,020
Now, what do you have to say?

945
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,220
Third Master is dead.

946
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,860
I'm so sad for you.

947
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,220
I really like him.

948
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,900
I know he can't take responsibility for his death.

949
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,140
I beg you to forgive me.

950
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,980
You can beat my mother and me.

951
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,220
Let me go, okay?

952
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,420
As long as you're alive,

953
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,780
I won't believe you.

954
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,740
Don't be angry.

955
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:31,780
I'll go.

956
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,780
I'll go.

957
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:33,780
I'll go.

958

Don't be angry.

966
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,780
You're all dead.

967
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,780
You're still a fool.

968
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,780
Stop.

969
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,780
Why are you doing this to me?

970

Let me go.

00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,780
Let me go, all of you.

978
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,780
Send them in.

979
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,780

982
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:20,780
Sang Ruoli!

983
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,780
Stop!
