00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the greenery

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is shining on my face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if it were a universe

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The life is a dream

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The life is a dream

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One day

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You are clear and mysterious

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the background

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are clear and mysterious

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like a background

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No one

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The Dream by 花花

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The Love by 花花

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Please get out first.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I want to be alone for a while.

31
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,120
that's a lie.

32
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,400
Yes.

33
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,860
I'll...

34
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,180
I'll sing a poem.

35
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,000
In the past,

36
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,280
good people

37
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,860
really relaxed

38
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,100
themselves a lot.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But now it seems that you are right.

40
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,200
I am not a stone.

41
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,800
I just want to draw all the things we have.

42
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,000
So, after you wake up, I will tell you one by one.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,400
Maybe you can remember it sooner or later.

44
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,000
Life is a pass.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Time is a corner.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,400
It is quietly watching people love and hate.

47
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,200
Time flies.

48
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,000
Time has forgotten.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:49,200
So, you said that you will tell me after I wake up.

50
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:56,600
I didn't expect that I can only recall it now.

51
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,000
I miss you so much.

52
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,000
I miss you so much.

53
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
I have been away for three days.

54
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
I should have gone to the library.

55
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Wu Xin.

56
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Wu Xin.

57
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,600
If you don't open the door,

58
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,800
I will go to the door to knock you down.

59
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
I will go to the door to knock you down.

60
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,800
I will go to the door to knock you down.

61
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,400
and ask him to open it.

62
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Wu Xin.

63
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,800
This is my wife.

64
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:48,800
My favorite dog meatnotes when I was alive.

65
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,400
If you want to avoid him from trying yours

66
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,320
you can stay behind Human.

67
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,200
Dear sister,

68
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,440
why don't you tell me

69
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,080
that you love your father?

70
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,520
If you love your father.

71
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,200
Since you're all alive,

72
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,160
have your Choose then.

73
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Yueya will scold you for money.

74
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
Take her away.

75
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
Yueya.

76
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Yueya.

77
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:51,160
You know how to read economic torture.

78
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Why aren't you reading it at Song Song Yueya?

79
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:05,600
Where are Sun consequence and he is not?

80
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,640
Where is he?

81
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
He is.

82
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,640
Why didn't you read Song Song Yue?

83
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
But I don't want her to leave.

84
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
What do you want?

85
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
I want to take revenge.

86
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,780
Wait for me.

87
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,860
Gu Ven,

88
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,560
everything will come eventually.

89
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,420
One moreー

90
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,420
If you want to give Yue Qi Luo the revenge,

91
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,420
you must find Yue Qi Luo first.

92
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,420
When I fought with Yue Qi Luo,

93
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,420
I put a spell on him.

94
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,420
Although he ran away,

95
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,420
but my spell will leave a mark on him.

96
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,420
I should be able to recognize his direction.

97
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,420
What's going on?

98
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,420
What's going on?

99
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,420
It's transparent.

100
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,420
This spell will send off the smell.

101
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,780
Enter.

102
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,380
Don't you know?

103
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,180
She specialized in each others' actions and

104
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,780
separated people.

105
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,780
We have all done it on purpose.

106
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:26,580
And for I preparing for his attack,

107
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,580
Can you two stop talking nonsense?

108
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,580
Should we avenge Yueya?

109
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,580
Can you find Yue Qiluo?

110
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,580
Although I can't confirm the exact location,

111
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:44,580
I can feel Yue Qiluo is on the mountain.

112
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,580
It's better not to go there.

113
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,580
What's wrong?

114
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,580
Yue Qiluo is a good man.

115
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,580
He can protect his spirit.

116
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,580
If you destroy his spirit,

117
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,580
he will take another new one.

118
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,580
He can't kill him in the normal way.

119
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,580
But the cave is different.

120
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,580
He can destroy all his spirit energy.

121
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,580
I'll go there to find him.

122
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,580
You said I have so many soldiers.

123
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,580
You don't need to...

124
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,580
I really don't need to.

125
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,580
You know what's wrong with the mountain.

126
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,580
It's too dangerous for you.

127
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,580
I want to avenge Yueya.

128
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,580
So I have to go alone.

129
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,580
I'll go with you.

130
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,580
No need to say.

131
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,580
I've made my decision.

132
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,580
I don't need you to go there.

133
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,580
If you really want to help me,

134
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,580
you can come to me after it's over.

135
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:59,040
Qiluo's kids

136
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,580
H sources

137
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,040
Mi 각

138
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,620
I just need your help and my help for this money.

139
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,740
I accept it.

140
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,580
I beg your pardon.

141
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,140
I only need you to deal with this treacherous thing.

142
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,220
Just give them to me when you get out of here.

143
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,020
After all these years of waiting,

144
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,500
with such rough circumstances andplain trying to deceive,

145
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,100
you could just let them go before you.

146
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,100
Let's go.

147
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,860
Smoking?

148
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,860
Don't look at me!

149
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,860
Get up! Get up!

150
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,860
Qi Lang, don't waste your energy.

151
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,860
I can't control my body anymore.

152
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,860
Can you be more careful?

153
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,860
You can't control your body.

154
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,860
It's because your body is broken and broken.

155
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,860
Did they hurt us like this?

156
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,860
Did they forget about it?

157
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,860
Yue Ya is dead.

158
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,860
Next, it's Wu Xin.

159
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,860
Wu Xin will never die.

160
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,860
I'll take her to you.

161
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,860
Qi Luo, thank you.

162
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,860
What happened to your face?

163
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,860
I don't need to worry about you.

164
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,860
I can't die.

165
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,860
I need to find something important.

166
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,860
It's so stupid to find such an old angel.

167
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,860
I can't even control my teeth.

168
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,860
I should have told you to take me to see the teeth.

169
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,860
Yes.

170
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,860
No.

171
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,860
Qi.

172
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,860
Qi Luo, I'm sorry.

173
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,860
I'm sorry.

174
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,860
I'm sorry.

175
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,860
I'm sorry.

176
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,860
I'm sorry.

177
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,860
I'm sorry.

178
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,860
I'm sorry.

179
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,860
I'm sorry.

180
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,860
I'm sorry.

181
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,860
I'm sorry.

182
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,860
I'm sorry.

183
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,860
I'm sorry.

184
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,860
I'm sorry.

185
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,860
I'm sorry.

186
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,860
I'm sorry.

187
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,860
I'm sorry.

188
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,860
I'm sorry.

189
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,860
I'm sorry.

190
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,860
I'm sorry.

191

00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,260
This dish will harm our stomach.

289

Eat while it's hot.

297
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,300
It's not good to eat when it's cold.

298
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,500
Look at the dish.

You can't find a wife without a meal.

00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,620
Look at the appearance.

00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,700
So handsome.

304
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,420
Just a little bit worse than me.

305
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,620
Even if you look like that dog.

306
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,700
Zhang Er is willing to marry you.

Gu.

310
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,060
Do you know why I don't be a real hero?

311
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,220
I'm on the demon's side.

312
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,460
You don't think about it.

313
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,500
You don't have the heart to kill me.

314
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,540
No.

315
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,100
I want people to stay away from me.

316
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,340
I'm afraid.

317
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,700
What are you talking about?

318
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,100
It's true.

319
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,060
I've been sleeping since last time.

320
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,300
Almost 100 years.

321
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,420
No one has ever been kind to me before.

322
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,860
This time, I met Yueya and you.

323
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,140
I'm alone in this happiness.

324
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,780
And this happiness has been taken away

325
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,420
for less than a year.

326
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,620
Are you doing well now?

327
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,980
You're getting worse.

328
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,660
You're getting better.

329
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,820

332
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,220
I don't care about you at all.

333
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,260
Eat your meal.

00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:15,800
Good

381
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,480
Good

382
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:20,800
Great

383
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,480
Great

384
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,480
Great

385
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,080
Great

386
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,600
Great

387
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:31,840
Well

388
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Your room is upstairs.

389
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
Thank you.

390
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,840
Liu Li, I don't care about you anymore.

391
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,840
You should forget about it.

392
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
Do it yourself.

393
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,840
I know.

394
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
I remember all the good and bad things in you.

395
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
You will become my love.

396
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,840
I don't want to forget Yuan Ya.

397
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,840
When I wake up,

398
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,840
I will find all your memories.

399
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,840
I will say goodbye.

400
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
I don't know how to write.

401
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,840
Just write down our memories.

402
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,840
I will tell you every night after you wake up.

403
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
Maybe you will remember it.

404
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,840
I don't know how to write.

405
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840
I don't know how to write.

406
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,840
I don't know how to write.

407
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,840
I don't know how to write.

408
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,840
I don't know how to write.

409
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,840
I don't know how to write.

410
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,840
I don't know how to write.

411
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,840
I don't know how to write.

412
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,840
I don't know how to write.

413
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,840
I don't know how to write.

414
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,840
I don't know how to write.

415
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,840
How many years have passed?

416
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
I don't know.

417
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,840
You know it all, right?

418
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840
It's the last 100 years.

419
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
You can keep it.

420
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,240
I'm just a few things.

421
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,680
Even if you don't wake up,

422
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,080
you can't find the memory

423
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,840
from these things.

424
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,960
Love and hatred are all over.

425
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,840
Bai Liuli, you don't understand.

426
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,840
Although it's over,

427
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,040
it doesn't mean they didn't happen.

428
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,480
Although the people who went through these things with me

429
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,680
are dead,

430
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,280
but if I still remember them,

431
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,600
they will be alive forever.

432
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,800
Bai Liuli,

433
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
this book

434
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,400
is the most important thing

435
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,560
I've ever written.

436
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,400
It's also the only memory

437
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,400
of me and Yueya.

438
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,800
Please keep it safe for me.

439
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,800
I'll put it in the box.

440
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,000
When I wake up,

441
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,800
I'll read it again.

442
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Do you understand?

443
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,200
Why did I copy the script I Yang Xue drew?

444
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,120
Why did it happen in your국 Zak's at night?

445
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,520
leaf

446
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:31,880
if

447
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,560
�를

448
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,240
Withoutpiano

449
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,320
If you remember

450
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,240
Li Ahyoo deserves it.

451
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,280
Immediately after leaving the company,

452
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,280
I will travel to Beijing.

453
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm in danger.

454
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,400
Jin olan is always here

455
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,200
now

456
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:57,800
I'll carry it

457
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,360
I here

458
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
почти

459
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,120
Isn't she your friend?

460
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,120
Just ask

461
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,640
I don't need to ask

462
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,160
you

463
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,640
Because we had helped a lot

464
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,080
No need

465
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:06,360
Good

466
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,760
I'll send you a whole month

467
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,240
Give you what you want

468
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,120
It means

469
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,600
Do you see

470
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Come on.

471
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,600
Are you okay?

472
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
It's done. Let's go.

473
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,600
You're so loyal to me.

474
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,600
It seems like you're really not coming back.

475
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,600
I'm sorry.

476
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,600
Done.

477
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,800
Let's go inside.

478
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,720
Here's the gift.

479
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,600
What are these?

480
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,600
How can this be?

481
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,960
They suspect you of having no grudge.

482
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,400
You know the truth?

483
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,500
What you said was proper.

484
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,600
You had no grudge.

485
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,600
But I often felt

486
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,600
what I felt.

487
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,320
There's nothing Стasy.

488
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,040
Go to the Ru'er Temple Tidy Dog.

489
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,120
After you finish all the clothes,

490
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,520
I'll send you back home.

491
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,680
Just listen to me.

492
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,080
Boss, try this.

493
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,200
Okay?

494
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,840
It smells good.

495
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,040
Today,

496
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,040
I am the25th who joined you

497
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,600
with Deng Xin Hitters.

498
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,960
It's amazing.

499
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,400
When he was alive, he didn't have a wife.

500
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,920
He left.

501
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,840
I took him away.

502
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,720
Can you buy me one?

503
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,760
No.

504
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,960
Why?

505
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,480
Old Gu, why?

506
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,640
Let's wait for him.

507
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,320
Old Gu, don't go.

508
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,320
Let's go, honey.

509
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,040
Honey, why?

510
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,320
You can buy pearls,

511
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,480
or fake pearls.

512
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,800
You can't buy diamond.

513
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,160
What's the point?

514
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,680
Why don't you spend money?

515
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,560
What's the rule?

516
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,400
Honey, what's wrong with you?

517
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,840
Honey, I'm begging you.

518
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,120
I like this diamond.

519
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,440
Can you buy me one?

520
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,000
Honey, you can't buy me one.

521
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,560
I can give you anything.

522
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,960
I beg you, honey.

523
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,120
Honey.

524
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:18,720
Wuxi.

525
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:20,880
Honey, you're running away.

526
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,720
Wuxi.

527
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,560
Wuxi.

528
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,720
Wuxi.

529
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,200
Get up.

530
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,760
Wuxi.

531
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,160
What's wrong?

532
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,280
You can't see me.

533
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:36,840
Wuxi.

534
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,240
Wuxi.

535
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,240
Wuxi.

536

Wuxi.

538

Wuxi.

539

Wuxi.

540
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,280
Wuxi.

541
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,640
Wuxi.

542
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,480
What are you running?

543
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,640
Wuxi.

544
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,760
Wuxi.

545
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,640
Wuxi.

546
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,200
Wuxi.

547
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,280
Wuxi.

548
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,120
Wuxi.

549
