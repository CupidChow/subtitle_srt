00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the grass and the shadow

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is full of love and face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if the clouds are floating

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The pain is so hard to describe

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The madness of ice

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Just one day

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You clearly have a life

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In the north side of the lake

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You clearly have a life

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In the north side of the lake

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You clearly have a life

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In the north side of the lake

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yu'er, see this, Shifu, so much experience

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This clothes is good, soft and smooth

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
How is it, not bad

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The medicine is big and the hair is wet

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
He has to follow his shape

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Can't compare with Zhu Chenzi

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,120
I can't compare with the words.

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,600
I can compare with the words of 100.

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,520
I haven't been a witness for more than 100 years.

37
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,920
I can't even read the scriptures.

38
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,360
I'm so angry when I hear you talk.

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,360
Go back early.

40
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,160
Don't make troubles.

41
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,960
Do you hear me?

42
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,600
Come to the office later.

43
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
Don't talk to me.

44
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,680
Why?

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,800
Why not?

46
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,880
It's my dignity.

47
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,280
You just want to standards me?

48
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,600
Of course I want to.

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,600
What?!

50
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,440
Nothing special about me!

51
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,480
For this reason,

52
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,600
I have a match with Qi Nanjing

53
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,720
and a big girl!

54
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,280
You don't need to think about it.

55
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,200
You're asking me a question?

56
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,520
in the same manner as I do.

57
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,520
You know,

58
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,800
Qi Nanjing means

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
an unsequalified authority on the export of all living things.

60
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,720
Now,

61
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,400
Good.

62
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,000
What?

63
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,840
Once you let David agony pass to Ctrl and wind,

64
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
it's a Specialyl Sun

65
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,320

This piece of rubbish!

79
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,540

这是

94
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Where did this blood stream come from?

95
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,240
It's not a matter of the war.

96
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,440
We'll talk about it after we've solved it.

97
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
Father.

98
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
Father.

99
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Son, father is here.

100
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Father is here.

101
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
What are you still standing there?

102
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Go eat.

103
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
Young Master, you're not well.

104
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Don't wash the blood on his face these days.

105
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Just wash it off.

106
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
Okay. I know.

107
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
I'll leave now.

108
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,240
Master.

109
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
Master.

110
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
Master.

111
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
I have something to ask you.

112
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,240
Who is it?

113
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Come on.

114
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Uncle.

115
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,240
You go to my study with Master.

116
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,240
I'll be there in a while.

117
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
Yes, uncle.

118
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
Please.

119
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
Please sit down.

120
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
Uncle will be here in a while.

121
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Is it good?

122
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
It's fruit candy and chocolate.

123
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,240
Is it bad for you?

124
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Is it good?

125
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
Uncle.

126
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Uncle.

127
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,240
Master.

128
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,240
My little son has been hungry for the first time in half a month.

129
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
He's a living god.

130
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Amitabha.

131
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
Well.

132
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Yes.

133
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
Master.

134
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Master.

135
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
Well.

136
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,240
I have something to ask you.

137
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Well.

138
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Have you killed a woman recently?

139
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Master.

140
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,240
I'm a woman.

141
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
I'm so bad.

142
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
I'm not good at it.

143
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
I'm angry.

144
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
I'll find someone to do it.

145
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,240
How did you know about it?

146
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
I didn't see it in person.

147
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,240
I heard that you used a rope to bury it in the backyard.

148
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
You bought it for me?

149
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
I have a lot of temper.

150
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
I can't move my temper.

151
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Master.

152
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Did you say that my son has a disease?

153
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Is it related to him?

154
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Amitabha.

155
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Since you have guessed the cause of it,

156
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
why did you ask me?

157
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
When he was alive,

158
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
he was always against me.

159
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
He was a dead ghost.

160
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
He even tried to harm me.

161
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
Fa Shi.

162
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Do you have any idea

163
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
to get rid of him?

164
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
It's not right to be dead today.

165
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
I'll try it tomorrow noon.

166
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Okay.

167
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Back off.

168
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Back off.

169
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Back off.

170
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Back off.

171
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
Back off.

172
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
How can I get rid of him tomorrow?

173
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Tomorrow,

174
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,240
I'll get rid of him

175
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
and do the Fa Shi.

176
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
That's all.

177
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
Don't say that.

178
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
It's easy.

179
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Just give it a try.

180
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
How can I be easy?

181
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
I'll tell you.

182
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
I've seen it in the mansion.

183
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
He's a little bit of a evil.

184
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Everything else is normal.

185
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
I think

186
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,240
he's a little bit like

187
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
a little girl

188
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
who left a mark on him.

189
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
He's a little girl.

190
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,240
He's a thief.

191
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,240
How can he compare to him?

192
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,240
Don't compare him with them.

193
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
Yes.

194
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
I'm wrong.

195
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,240
I'm wrong.

196
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
You're so evil.

197
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Why are you so evil?

198
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,240
Of course I'm more evil.

199
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
I can only trust

200
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
when I'm evil.

201
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Only after he trusts me

202
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,240
can I give you a high rank.

203
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
Fine.

204
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
You're not dead.

205
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,240
I'll listen to you.

206
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
No.

207
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,240
You helped me to get rid of him last time.

208
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,240
You're also so mean to me.

209
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,240
Master Guo.

210
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
This fish is good.

211
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,240
Don't come to this place with me.

212
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
If you dare to be so mean to me again,

213
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
you'll be dead.

214
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,240
You can hear your mom's scream in the yard.

215
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Listen.

216
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
If you live with him in the future,

217
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
you'll be the most skinny one.

218
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,240
This old man is so stubborn.

219
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
How can you talk?

220
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,240
He doesn't dare.

221
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,240
He wants to.

222
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
I'm so stubborn.

223
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
I dare not.

224
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
I'm going to marry him.

225
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
You have five wives, right?

226
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
One hundred wives.

227
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
I tried everything.

228
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,240
I tried everything.

229
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
You two wait for me.

230
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
I'll marry a big family

231
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
and show you the show.

232
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
Fine.

233
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
I'll drink and play tricks.

234
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,240
Find the show.

235
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
When I become the commander,

236
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,240
you'll have to come to me

237
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,240
to find the show.

238
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
Master Guo.

239
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
I'm telling you.

240
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,240
Find a big family and show me the show.

241
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
Leave us.

242
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,240
We can live a long life.

243
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
I'll marry a big family and show you the show.

244
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
You two can't leave me.

245
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
Come on.

246
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
Drink.

247
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
I'll drink to death.

248
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
Wait for me here.

249
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Don't go.

250
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
Yes.

251
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
Well.

252
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
Have we enough time?

253
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,240
I also talked to you in the background.

254
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
Whatever.

255
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,240
I'll drink to death.

256
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
I do not want to see trás.

257
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240
You know she's important.

258
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,940
You...

259
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:48,940
The

260
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,220
I'll give you the inteτί

261
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,400
guarantee to you even you begin to be dead!

262
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,400
If you don't suspect me,

263
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,860
I'll cut you into pieces.

264
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,360
Woou coming up!

265
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,160
You're so出來,

266
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,120
how dare you?

267
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,160
Martial welling,

268
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,280
let's get out of here!

269
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,560
I live with everyone!

270
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,160
One!

271
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,600
разделated!

272
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,100
A love letter is hoping to suit us!

273
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,540
China,

274
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,840
would changeucido!!

275
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,280
You broke the noodles for show!

276
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,740
Want to be with me?

277
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,740
What is the matter with Shi'er?

278
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,740
She turned her body into a Jiuyi Tai.

279
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,740
Why is her hand all wet?

280
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,740
How could this happen?

281
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,740
Shi'er wanted to kill Xiao Shao but she didn't.

282
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,740
She turned into a Jiuyi Tai.

283
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,740
I'm afraid the women in the lake are in danger.

284
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,740
She's in danger.

285
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,740
Okay.

286
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,740
She's so dirty.

287
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,740
Why did she move into a building?

288
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,740
How could she live in there?

289
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,740
You don't know where she is.

290
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,740
Jiuyi Tai is in trouble.

291
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,740
Didn't she call us yesterday?

292
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,740
She disappeared last night.

293
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,740
I heard that Shi'er was killed by the Jiuyi Tai.

294
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,740
You two are in a relationship.

295
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,740
If this guy hears this,

296
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,740
it's not a big deal.

297
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,740
Shi'er is a Tai.

298
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,740
She's been saved long ago.

299
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,740
Is she really a ghost?

300
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,740
You've been looking for so many Taoists.

301
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,740
Why do you think you're here to investigate?

302
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,740
So,

303
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
Young Master Xiao's illness is...

304
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,740
Get out of here!

305
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,740
You're so ungrateful!

306
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,740
Get out of here!

307
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,740
You're so noisy.

308
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,740
Do you have any rules?

309
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,740
Come on, son.

310
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,740
Young Master Xiao,

311
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,740
what are you doing?

312
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,740
Sister,

313
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,740
I just want to help her.

314
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,740
You bastards.

315
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,740
You can't get your son out.

316
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,740
You're always thinking about hurting my son.

317
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,740
Let me tell you.

318
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,740
I'm in this house today.

319
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,740
You want to have a romantic life?

320
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,740
Go to your dream.

321
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,740
Hello.

322
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,740
Why...

323
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,740
You have grown more social now!

324
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,660
It's getting bigger and bigger.

325
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,300
It's not your fault.

326
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,340
No.

327
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,820
I've never seen a so hard to cut off.

328
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,900
It seems that we'll stay here tonight.

329
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,300
Let's go to the inn to fetch the moon.

330
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,260
Here?

331
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,740
There's a demon here.

332
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,940
There's a moon-like path in the inn.

333
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,260
Let's go.

334
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,420
Master.

335
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,100
Commander.

336
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,020
Let's go.

337
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,540
This is the assistant of the French.

338
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,060
He's here to protect the female court.

339
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,340
Okay.

340
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,620
Thank you.

341
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,340
Thank you.

342
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,140
French.

343
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,860
Do you want to send a army to guard?

344
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,380
No, Master.

345
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,580
Send ten old soldiers from the battlefield.

346
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,940
The more the better.

347
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,820
Do you hear me?

348
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,340
Do as the French say.

349
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:55,980
Yes.

350
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,700
Mr. Gu.

351
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,940
You go back to the study with the commander.

352
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:04,940
I'll be there in a minute.

353
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,620
Okay.

354
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,060
Commander.

355
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:07,780
Please.

356
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,220
Master.

357
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,260
Thank you.

358
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,340
Yue.

359
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,540
Send these clothes to Mrs. Mei.

360
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,420
And tell them to leave this building.

361
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,420
Give it to me.

362
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,660
Wait.

363
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,420
You keep this one.

364
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:39,980
I remember.

365
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,020
Be careful.

366
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,220
What's going on?

367
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,220
Speak.

368
00:19:59,380 --> 00:19:59,860
Yes.

369
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,700
I was in the Jiu Yi Ta room yesterday.

370
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,020
What did Jiu Yi Ta do last night?

371
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,180
He...

372
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:10,740
He...

373
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,460
He went to see...

374
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:11,940
What?

375
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,660
Who did he see?

376
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:14,700
Speak.

377
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,940
Who did he see?

378
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,140
He...

379
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,700
He saw a man.

380
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,220
I didn't mean to lie.

381
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:20,700
But...

382
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,420
Jiu Yi Ta told me.

383
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,460
If I had been in trouble,

384
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,580
he would have...

385
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,140
He would have sold me to the sheep.

386
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,060
I...

387
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,380
Get up and pack up.

388
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,740
Then you can see...

389
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,300
what the man looked like.

390
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,860
Jiu Yi Ta just let me wait in the back.

391
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:45,940
Then...

392
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,980
I never saw him again.

393
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,620
It's okay.

394
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,780
You can leave now.

395
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:51,860
Yes.

396
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,740
Yes.

397
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,220
You can't do this.

398
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,140
You're a man.

399
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,660
If you die,

400
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,900
I'll kill you.

401
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,060
Commander.

402
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,420
This uniform...

403
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,260
is more precious than the body.

404
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,380
Mr. Gu.

405
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,620
You stay here with him.

406
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,820
Take care of him.

407
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,660
I'll go out and see.

408
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,540
Okay.

409
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,180
Thank you.

410
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,740
I'd like to Spain.

411
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,540
Yes!

412
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,100
Well.

413
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,380
No need to worry.

414
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,580
No need to worry.

415
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,860
I'll still be your commander.

416
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,260
What are you doing?

417
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,900
Go home.

418
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,020
No need to be worried.

419
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,620
Anshun has a vaccine.

420
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,740
Don't see the doctor.

421
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,500
Hello...

422
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,500
well...

423
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,660
It's rare to meet you.

424
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,780
Then accompany me to the wedding.

425
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,500
See you later.

426
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,180
Yes.

427
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,460
You are here.

428
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,220
Xiang Guo.

429
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,060
Have a drink.

430
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,620
Have some water.

431
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,260
Two bottles of water.

432
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,060
Is there any?

433
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,940
Have a drink.

434
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,500
Thank you.

435
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,300
I made it.

436
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:13,660
No need.

437
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,620
Have a taste.

438
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,420
Come on, have a taste.

439
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,380
No need.

440
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,340
What are you arguing about?

441
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,220
Don't you know that Young Master is resting?

442
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,380
Who is this girl?

443
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,220
She is the fairy-tale that Young Master invited.

444
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,340
Is she that young?

445
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,900
Is she the eldest madam?

446
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,780
Here.

447
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,380
This is for you.

448
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,220
What are you doing?

449
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,700
What is it?

450
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,980
It's a blood talisman.

451
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,980
It's for the peace of the world.

452
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,460
You can't go out.

453
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,100
What are you doing?

454
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,140
Don't touch me.

455
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,620
What are you doing?

456
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,100
Let go of me.

457
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,620
You...

458
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,700
Madam.

459
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,420
Xiang Guo.

460
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,260
What's wrong?

461
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,660
She wants to go out.

462
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,740
My son is hungry.

463
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,460
I will go get him some food.

464
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,380
There are so many food inside.

465
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,500
She wants to go out and get some.

466
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,340
Those ungrateful people.

467
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,660
My son doesn't eat.

468
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,660
He only eats lamb biscuits and chocolate.

469
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,220
Madam.

470
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,540
Just a little thing.

471
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,820
Do you need to find a way to go there yourself?

472
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,060
I will get it right away.

473
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,340
You go back to your room first.

474
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,940
Young Master won't find you later.

475
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,060
It's time to make trouble.

476
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,420
Then get some more candies.

477
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:21,980
I got it.

478
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,340
A gift for your security.

479
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,820
Xing Guo.

480
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,220
It's so sad about you.

481
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,940
It's nothing.

482
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,300
Fine then.

483
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,180
Or any instructions.

484
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,300
Do your haggardly business.

485
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

486
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

487
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

488
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

489
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

490
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

491
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

492
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

493
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

494
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

495
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

496
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

497
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

498
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

499
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

500
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,620
I'll go to the temple to see the young master.

501
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

502
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

503
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,620
I'll go to the temple to see the doctor.

504
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,620
Did you lost the temper?

505
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,620
Don't tell me you like me.

506
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,620
Didn't you say

507
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,620
that you love me wholeheartedly?

508
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,620
Show me your heart.

509
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,620
Give me a look.

510
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,620
I believe you.

511
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,620
I'm sorry.

512
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,620
I'm sorry.

513
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,620
It's all your fault.

514
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,620
Let me go.

515
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,620
Please.

516
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,620
I'm sorry.

517
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,620
I...

518
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,620
The King of the City

519
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,620
Episode 12

520
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,620
Master.

521
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,620
The 12th Aunt

522
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,620
has a grudge with this Deputy Chief.

523
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,620
That good-for-nothing.

524
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,620
That time Deputy Chief

525
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,620
took someone to arrest her.

526
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,620
Because of the arrest,

527
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,620
she was forced to be the Deputy Chief.

528
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,620
I see.

529
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,620
So you're here to avenge my husband.

530
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,620
I don't think so.

531
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,620
Yueya, how are you doing?

532
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,620
The Grand Madam is going out.

533
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,620
She's been persuaded by Deputy Chief.

534
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,620
Deputy Chief, she's been here?

535
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,620
Yes.

536
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,620
The Grand Madam asked her to go get food.

537
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,620
But she's been gone for an hour.

538
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,620
She's not back yet.

539
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,620
There's something I should tell you.

540
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,620
What is it?

541
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,620
That Deputy Chief looks so happy.

542
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,620
He's not a good person.

543
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,620
Xinwu, don't blame me for being too much.

544
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,620
You'd better not

545
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,620
fight him.

546
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,620
Yes, he's not a good person.

547
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,620
He's

548
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,620
sleeping with the ungrateful Madam.

549
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,620
The Grand Master doesn't care?

550
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,620
He's the red man by the Grand Master.

551
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,620
The Grand Madam is going to support him.

552
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,620
If anyone offend him,

553
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,620
what if he gets caught?

554
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,620
He'll be killed.

555
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,620
So it's like this.

556
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,620
What did you think?

557
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,620
The 12th and 1st Taekang is always out of the woods.

558
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,620
They'll come out and make trouble.

559
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,620
They'll suddenly disappear.

560
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,620
It's like...

561
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,620
It's like the late Huang Da Xian from Su's family.

562
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,620
Chief, you have to do it.

563
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,620
So great.

564
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,620
You're Gu Xuan Wu.

565
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,620
Yes.

566
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,620
So clever.

567
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,620
You can do it with me.

568
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,620
I'll be the one to do it.

569
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,620
I'll be the one to do it.

570
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,620
Chief.

571
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,620
What's the matter?

572
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,620
What's the matter?

573
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,620
It's nothing.

574
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,620
I've been with the Grand Master for a night.

575
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,620
How are you?

576
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,620
I'm not sure.

577
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,620
If everyone can be safe tonight,

578
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,620
I'll find the 12th and 1st Taekang as soon as possible.

579
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,620
Master, thank you for your hard work.

580
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,620
Young Master.

581
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,620
Young Master.

582
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,620
Young Master.

583
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,620
Young Master.

584
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,620
What are you doing?

585
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,620
It's not fun in the house.

586
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,620
I want to make a sword and knife.

587
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,620
My little grandchild.

588
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,620
Young Master.

589
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,620
Be careful.

590
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,620
Let me go.

591
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,620
Let me go.

592
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,620
Young Master.

593
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,620
He's been lying down for half a month.

594
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,620
Why is he suddenly dancing?

595
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,620
Young Master.

596
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,620
My little grandchild.

597
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,620
You...

598
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,620
Be careful.

599
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,620
Come back.

600
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,620
Let's go.

601
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,620
Let's go.

602
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,620
My son.

603
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,620
Young Master.

604
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,620
Be careful.

605
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,620
Be careful.

606
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,620
Young Master.

607
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,620
Madam.

608
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,620
Madam, are you all right?

609
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,620
Son.

610
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,620
Let's go.

611
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,620
What's wrong?

612
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,620
Don't come here.

613
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,620
Don't come here.

614
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,620
What's wrong?

615
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,620
Where's my son?

616
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,620
Don't come here.

617
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,620
Let's go.

618
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,620
Let's go.

619
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,620
Let's go.

620
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,620
Young Master.

621
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,620
Young Master.

622
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,620
What are you doing?

623
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,620
Let's go.

624
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,620
Let's go.

625
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,620
Yes.

626
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,620
Young Master.

627
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,620
Wait.

628
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,620
Yes.

629
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,620
Here.

630
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,620
You are indeed a demon.

631
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,620
And you have a knife.

632
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,620
Otherwise, you would have died earlier.

633
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,620
You can't be bothered.

634
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,620
You've already suffered such a serious injury.

635
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,620
You can't escape.

636
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,620
Why do you have to know this?

637
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,620
Why do you have to know this?

638
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,620
Don't kill my son.

639
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,620
Take your hand off me.

640
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,620
Don't move.

641
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,620
One more step forward.

642
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,620
I'll kill him.

643
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,620
You won't kill him.

644
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,620
If you want to kill him,

645
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,620
you should have killed him.

646
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,620
According to your plan,

647
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,620
if you want to kill Wugu,

648
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,620
this man has changed.

649
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,620
You took away Young Master.

650
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,620
Isn't it just to threaten him?

651
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,620
For the sake of the General of Weixie,

652
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,620
he is already here.

653
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,620
If you have anything to say,

654
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,620
you can talk to him.

655
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,620
You, a man of faith.

656
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,620
I have been in the mountains for a long time.

657
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,620
Sometimes, I have been hurt by this man of faith.

658
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,620
You may not be able to follow the rules of the tribe

659
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,620
and be with him.

660
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,620
Later, I finally married into the Shuan Manor

661
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,620
and became his wife.

662
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,620
It was because of me that

663
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,620
the Great Madam hated me.

664
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,620
That woman of hatred,

665
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,620
she couldn't stop the General from taking the wife.

666
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,620
She just wanted to kill all the women

667
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,620
who were in her hands.

668
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,620
Who would dare to listen to her?

669
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,620
Who would she kill?

670
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,620
The Great Madam killed you.

671
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,620
There are still many people who are still alive.

672
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,620
They killed you.

673
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,620
There are also the Grand Madam and the Deputy Chief.

674
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,620
They killed me.

675
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,620
I was so heartless.

676
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,620
I didn't even have the smile

677
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,620
to face the people who were in their hearts.

678
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,620
So, I have to let them know

679
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,620
that I am not a good person.

680
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,620
The Grand Madam clearly stole the people.

681
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,620
She even took all the crimes

682
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,620
and took them all to my head.

683
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,620
You made me come back to burn the body.

684
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,620
You punished me to let her

685
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,620
dig a tunnel in the night.

686
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,620
I burned the body with the bottle.

687
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,620
Why is the hand full of the jade?

688
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,620
And Deputy Chief.

689
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,620
He wanted to seduce me.

690
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,620
I refused him.

691
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,620
So, he was heartless.

692
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,620
He kept stealing the crime

693
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,620
that I needed.

694
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,620
Zen love is undeniable.

695
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,140
Unfortunately,

696
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,620
she has also been locked up in this basement.

697
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,620
Can you show me just how long you live?

698
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,620
A long time has passed.

699
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,620
I call the police.

700
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,620
The mayor of City of Huangjin

701
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,620
has his own fate.

702
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,620
I just dreamed of him in the dormitory.

703
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,620
He is now in the dream.

704
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,620
He is so selfish.

705
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,620
Mom, help me.

706
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,620
Mom, help me.

707
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,620
So handsome.

708
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,620
You old bitch.

709
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,620
You are already an old pig.

710
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,620
Let's go. Don't leave.

711
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,620
Don't save me.

712
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,620
Don't save me.

713
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,620
No.

714
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,620
No.

715
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,620
Go to hell.

716
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,620
I am the one who killed my people.

717
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,620
I never thought of hurting innocent people.

718
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,620
Then why did you kill Young Master?

719
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,620
He almost got you killed.

720
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,620
I hope he can change his mind.

721
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,620
I hope he can regret it.

722
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,620
I have been through so many hardships.

723
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,620
I am just afraid that he will believe me.

724
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,620
At least listen to my explanation.

725
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,620
But I didn't expect that he would betray me today.

726
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,620
He is so selfish.

727
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,620
He is so selfish.

728
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,620
He is so selfish.

729
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,620
Actually, I regret it.

730
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,620
I just can't think of it anymore.

731
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,620
What did you say?

732
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,620
The woman I love most is afraid of me.

733
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,620
I am crazy.

734
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,620
I dare not think. I dare not ask.

735
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,620
I even dare not look at your eyes.

736
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,620
I am just afraid that everything will be over soon.

737
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,620
I am wrong today.

738
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,620
If I could calm down,

739
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,620
the procurator won't lie to me.

740
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,620
You won't suffer so much.

741
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,620
I regret it.

742
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,620
I am wrong.

743
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,620
Forgive me.

744
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,620
I am really wrong.

745
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,620
Don't be afraid, son. Good boy.

746
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,620
The matter between us

747
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,620
has to end soon.

748
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,620
Uncle.

749
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,620
Uncle.

750
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,620
You have to believe me.

751
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,620
I really love you.

752
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,620
I believe you.

753
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,620
Then, can we start over?

754
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,620
We can start over.

755
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,620
Okay. Let's start over.

756
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,620
We are like before.

757
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,620
You drive me to the sunset.

758
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,620
I will sing a song for you.

759
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,620
Okay?

760
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,620
Uncle.

761
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,620
Do you hear me?

762
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,620
I heard it.

763
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,620
Actually,

764
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,620
I always have something to give you.

765
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,620
What is it?

766
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,620
Hua Chun, let go of him.

767
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,620
You lie to me.

768
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,620
You all lie to me.

769
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,620
I am not doing it.

770
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,620
Let me kill him.

771
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,620
What are you doing?

772
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,620
He is so many.

773
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,620
We can't let him go.

774
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,620
You can't kill him.

775
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,620
He loves me.

776
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,620
I love him, too.

777
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,620
But what is it to be sincere?

778
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,620
He nearly killed my only son.

779
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,620
He is guilty of his death.

780
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,620
Kill him and let him be killed.

781
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,620
You can't kill him.

782
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,620
What should we do?

783
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,620
I will come to the kitchen

784
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,620
and let him live.

785
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,420
What?

786
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:50,980
Liya.

787
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,260
Take this.

788
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,500
Go to the Land of Xijiao

789
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,540
and find a friend who is my old friend.

790
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,500
Her name is Da Bai.

791
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,060
Da Bai?

792
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,900
Bring her back to see me before noon.

793
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,020
Otherwise, it won't be long.

794
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,100
Burn her in the box of the body.

795
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,340
She will come out.

796
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,180
Okay.

797
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,060
Master.

798
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,220
Don't worry.

799
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,860
You will be safe.

800
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:12,940
Go.

801
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:13,740
Let's go.

802
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,620
Okay.

803
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,060
The Land of Xijiao

804
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,340
Where is Wu Xin?

805
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,660
Since you want to see me,

806
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,300
why didn't you come in person?

807
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,780
You are...

808
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,220
Da Bai?

809
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,380
How do you know her name?

810
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,740
Wu Xin asked me to come to you.

811
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,180
She can't get out of here.

812
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,380
Who are you?

813
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,700
I am her wife.

814
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,380
I haven't seen you for 50 years.

815
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,540
If I don't die,

816
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,060
I will be in trouble.

817
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,980
I like you.

818
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,180
You are a light-hearted girl.

819
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,540
I have something to ask you.

820
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,980
Is it for Wu Xin or you?

821
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,780
For Wu Xin?

822
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,900
Although I am not a good husband,

823
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,780
but...

824
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,660
Wu Xin is my lover.

825
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,540
She asked you to come to me.

826
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,620
She has never forgotten you.

827
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,580
I will do it.

828
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,980
Old lover?

829
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,580
She still loves you.

830
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,260
Da Bai brought you here.

831
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:28,740
There.

832
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,460
What's wrong?

833
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,580
Leave me alone.

834
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,780
Just go with her.

835
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:37,740
Yue Ya.

836
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,340
Yue Ya.

837
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,860
What did you say to her?

838
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,580
I just said some honest things.

839
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,780
What honest things?

840
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,020
Forget it.

841
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,100
Let's talk about it.

842
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,460
I will find you later.

843
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,060
Come.

844
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,100
You've worked hard.

845
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,900
I really have to take the money.

846
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,860
Thank you.

847
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,700
I came to the mansion because of you.

848
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,700
It's not because I want to get rid of you.

849
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,260
But because this Gu Xuanwu brother

850
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,940
is a bit far from me.

851
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,820
He asked me to come here.

852
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,740
Since I've got rid of you,

853
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,460
I'll leave now.

854
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,260
Zhenzhen,

855
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,900
what are you talking about?

856
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,700
How can you have no money?

857
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,660
I've always thought...

858
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,740
Good.

859
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,180
If you really want to take revenge on me,

860
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,460
you can leave the money to save the poor.

861
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,420
It's the same.

862
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,180
Amitabha.

863
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:17,660
Master.

864
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,940
Master is not a polite person.

865
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,580
He said he wouldn't ask for money.

866
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,340
He wouldn't ask for money.

867
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,580
Gao Sang.

868
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,100
I haven't seen you for a long time.

869
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,340
It's good to have no money.

870
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,380
Yes.

871
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,140
You're a great man.

872
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,660
You've been a man for a thousand years.

873
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,300
You can't expect such a great man.

874
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:54,900
How is it?

875
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,020
Did you lose your battle?

876
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,180
No.

877
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,660
I've been a man for a thousand years.

878
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,100
I'm not a man.

879
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,500
You're a bad girl.

880
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,540
You said you didn't listen to me.

881
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,580
You're suffering now.

882
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,500
If I hadn't changed you,

883
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,780
you would have been a bad man.

884
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:24,220
You've been a man for hundreds of years.

885
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,820
You've lost your face.

886
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,580
You didn't think about the past.

887
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,460
You're still talking.

888
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,140
At least I didn't get beaten up by others.

889
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,580
My lover Wu Xin

890
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,460
is not like that stinky man.

891
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:47,940
He's cold and hot.

892
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,100
He's nice to me.

893
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,780
Nothing else?

894
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,340
Little girl.

895
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,740
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

896
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,460
Wu Xin doesn't seem to be that honest.

897
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,260
That guy

898
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,300
has a secret to tell.

899
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:06,540
What secret?

900
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,020
His secret is...

901
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,260
What secret?

902
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,940
What is it?

903
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,660
Come back with me.

904
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:28,900
Yueya.

905
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,540
What's wrong?

906
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:32,940
Get out.

907
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,420
Go find your lover.

908
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:35,380
No.

909
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,860
I don't have a lover.

910
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,220
You still say no?

911
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,500
That white man.

912
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,740
He's a good man.

913
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,740
He's not a bad guy.

914
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:43,980
Go find him.

915
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,580
Yueya.

916
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,820
That white man is not...

917
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,260
You don't have to tell me.

918
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:50,180
It's none of my business.

919
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,020
Yueya.

920
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,340
You've been a man for hundreds of years.

921
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,980
We've been friends for a while.

922
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,660
But we've been together for two months.

923
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,780
I can't live with him.

924
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,020
Hundreds of years?

925
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:09,900
Only 50 years ago.

926
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,580
He asked me to help him.

927
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,740
But I've never seen him before.

928
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,780
How could I like him?

929
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:20,900
Yueya.

930
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,700
You're my wife.

931
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,860
You're my love.

932
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,580
You've said that to all women.

933
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:28,780
I...

934
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,580
I don't have any other woman.

935
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,740
Not now.

936
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,340
Hundreds of years later.

937
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,660
You won't die anyway.

938
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,380
Does it hurt?

939
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:49,500
Yes.

940
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,380
Then you don't say.

941
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,660
I'm afraid you'll be unhappy.

942
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,100
I'm afraid.

943
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,420
When I get old.

944
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:05,980
You can't leave me.

945
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,420
Yueya.

946
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,460
I'm afraid you'll leave me.

947
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,860
I'm afraid you'll be unhappy.

948
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,860
I'm afraid you'll be unhappy.

949
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,860
I'm afraid you'll be unhappy.

950
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,860
I'm afraid you'll be unhappy.

951
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,860
I'm afraid you'll be unhappy.
