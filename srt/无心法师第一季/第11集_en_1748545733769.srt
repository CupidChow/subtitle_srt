00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the grass and the shadow

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is full of love and face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if the clouds are floating

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The pain is so hard to describe

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The madness of ice

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Just one day

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You clearly have a life

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In the north side of the lake

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You clearly have a life

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In the north side of the lake

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You clearly have a life

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
In the north side of the lake

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You clearly have a life

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
In the north side of the lake

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You clearly have a life

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Little sister

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Look at me

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm hungry

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Go back with me

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll give you a good meal

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Come on

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Good morning, sir

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Mr. Gu, you are not in good shape

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What is not in good shape

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm getting scolded a lot

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm getting scolded

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm getting scolded

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's go

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's go

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's go

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Why are you driving

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll go

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Are you blind?

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Stop

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm here to pay you

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You are on the right track

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You are so busy

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll go

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I said

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You are not in good shape

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You are so stubborn

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Do you know who was the one who made the dirty car?

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Stubborn?

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Who are you saying that I'm stubborn?

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I want to ask you

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You can't even walk on my legs

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Come here

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I thought you were looking at your eyes

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
To make a fool of yourself

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You are looking at your head

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
To make a fool of yourself

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Now I found that

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You can make a fool of yourself

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
with this mouth

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Even the current president

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
has seen the channel

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He will respect the true life

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You are so ignorant

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
How dare you talk in front of me

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
True

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The first lady in the palace of the palace

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yu Le Cheng 9994466

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Tom

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The most exciting game on the line

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The horse is running

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The horse is running

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The queen of the reward

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,500
Japanese treasure Yellow Gold City

84
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
赵采猫

85
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,720
The rich and the wealthy

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,940
Well-balanced

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,560
lling

88
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Is that possible?

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The skin on my head

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,240
You come over here

91
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,660
OK Consider math

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Since there is nothing wrong with the cars

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Leave a would to us

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,240
Or else, I can't pay

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,880
I can't afford a car

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,640
I'll drive you home. Come here.

97
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
Come back.

98
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,160
I'll drive you home.

99
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,960
Sir,

100
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,760
don't let others get in the way.

101
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,760
What's the reason for this man?

102
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,320
He's the leader of the Qing Yun Temple.

103
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,920
He's the first-in-command.

104
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,600
Even the current president

105
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,120
wants to banish him.

106
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,520
The people can't afford to get in the way.

107
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
So,

108
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,080
it's a coincidence.

109
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,360
Xiao Xiaoqi,

110
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,400
we'll meet him later.

111
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
I'm not going.

112
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,440
He's the leader of the Qing Yun Temple.

113
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
He's not going to see anyone.

114
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,000
Why would I go to see him?

115
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,400
Xiao Zhang is Xiao Zhang.

116
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,360
But he's not a bad guy.

117
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,640
Why?

118
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,080
Think about it.

119
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,240
He's so arrogant.

120
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,800
It means he's capable.

121
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,080
If he wants to deal with Yue Jiluo,

122
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,840
we'll have to depend on him.

123
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
Let's go.

124
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,240
Sir!

125
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,600
Sir, please follow me.

126
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,760
He's a hip guy.

127
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:56,600
He's

128
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,400
so fast.

129
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,000
Master, let's go.

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,520
Look, there's a good car and a good house.

131
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,840
The Taoist Master must not be a good person.

132
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,440
How can a poor man have so much money?

133
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,360
Maybe, it's all just a trick.

134
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,880
Let me tell you.

135
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,840
We have a person to beg for help.

136
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,120
Don't talk nonsense.

137
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,280
You don't believe me?

138
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,840
After you enter the sect, you can take care of your mouth.

139
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,880
The three masters, please wait here.

140
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
I'll inform them.

141
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,360
Do you come for someone?

142
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:32,560
Then you have to come...

143
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,000
when it comes to sedition?

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,160
Why is your face so ugly?

145
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,960
It's nothing.

146
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,680
Why are you making your face ugly?

147
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,760
Shut up!

148
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,200
Mr. Tianshu!

149
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Quickly clean...

150
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,560
and sweep!

151
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,240
I've cleaned it!

152
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,800
Beg God, sorry.

153
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,360
ward.

154
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,640
Do you want a clean 같은데?

155
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,600
I hate bald Sham Guard!

156
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,840
He's only to bring about sadness to everyожne죠?

157
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,840
Master, please come in.

158
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Master, they are here.

159
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Master, please calm down.

160
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,840
I'll go clean it up.

161
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,880
Please, step on my side.

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,520
Come and sit here.

163
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,240
My lord and my lord.

164
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,160
Exactly.

165
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,440
Phi thank you.

166
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:27,120
I'm afraid the

167
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,040
people say that

168
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,320
they are still

169
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,880
nośćful

170
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,760
I don't want it

171
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,480
And you

172
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,960
are in a tight place

173
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,160
Come

174
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,040
Are you talking to you but

175
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,400
The dragon

176
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
I'll give you a bow.

177
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
What bow?

178
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,440
Forget it.

179
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
I'm sorry for what I did.

180
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
If I hadn't been in a hurry,

181
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
I wouldn't have been in your shoes.

182
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,440
I wouldn't have been in my car.

183
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
I just bought a new car.

184
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
I'm very happy.

185
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
I hope you can take care of me.

186
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Take a look.

187
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Take a look.

188
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,440
Lord Zhang Wen is indeed a weak and weak person.

189
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,440
He's so angry.

190
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Yes.

191
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
A weak and weak person.

192
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
He's so angry.

193
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,440
What are you doing?

194
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
What are you doing?

195
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Let me help you wipe your shoes.

196
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
No need.

197
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
No need.

198
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Lord Zhang Wen is kind and kind.

199
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
He's very enthusiastic.

200
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
Enough.

201
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Stop.

202
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
Let's have a cup of tea.

203
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
We can't have a long time.

204
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Go.

205
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Go.

206
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Go.

207
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Yes, master.

208
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
We're here today.

209
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,440
We have something to ask.

210
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
Say it.

211
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,440
I wonder if you know these two talismans.

212
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
I don't know them.

213
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Really?

214
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Of course.

215
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
Really?

216
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
I'm a Qingyun Master.

217
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
I'm lying to you.

218
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
I'm lying to you.

219
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
What do you mean?

220
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
But the master of this talisman,

221
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Mr. Bai Wenliu,

222
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,440
told me that you sold it to him.

223
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
I don't know Mr. Bai.

224
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
This talisman

225
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
was brought down from a coffin.

226
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,440
This coffin was hidden

227
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
in a secret room at the bottom.

228
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
I don't know if you know it.

229
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
I don't understand what you're talking about.

230
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
That's a pity.

231
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
I was going to tell you

232
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
that my secret agent

233
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
was trying to inform you.

234
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,440
Actually, it's not a big deal.

235
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,440
The demon who was the master of this talisman

236
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
escaped now.

237
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
He's in trouble.

238
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Who are you?

239
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
I don't care who I am.

240
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
What matters is that

241
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
the demon

242
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
has nothing to do with you.

243
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,440
If I'm not mistaken,

244
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
the person in the coffin

245
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
must be a little girl.

246
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
Yes, she's 16 or 17 years old.

247
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
I'm a little girl.

248
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
I'm not a girl.

249
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
I'm just a little girl.

250
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,440
I'm not a girl.

251
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
Don't you think

252
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,440
you're hiding in the house all day?

253
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,440
It's a past.

254
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
Master is not here now.

255
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
Who else can protect you?

256
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
What the hell are you doing?

257
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,440
You're not idle at all.

258
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Master almost lost his life yesterday.

259
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
What are you hiding?

260
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,440
You can fool others

261
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
but you can't fool me.

262
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,440
You're so pitiful.

263
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,440
You're a real bitch.

264
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
You're so cunning.

265
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,440
Master is a man.

266
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
He's a man.

267
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
It seems that

268
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
he's a man who's been beaten up.

269
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
So he's a man who's been killed by his father.

270
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,440
You don't know that.

271
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
He's a man who's been killed by his father.

272
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
What a pity.

273
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Actually,

274
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,440
he should be my uncle.

275
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
Uncle?

276
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Uncle?

277
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
A little girl.

278
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,440
How could she be your uncle?

279
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,440
It's a long story.

280
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
My uncle was a chicken wing.

281
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,440
After my grand uncle was killed,

282
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,440
he was brought to the temple to raise people.

283
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
My grand uncle was clever

284
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
and decided to take him as his disciple.

285
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
My grand uncles

286
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
loved him so much.

287
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,440
But his talent didn't work on the right path.

288
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,440
Instead, he was obsessed with the evil magic.

289
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
He was trying to practice the magic that never dies.

290
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,440
He was finally expelled from the sect.

291
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
I didn't expect that after being expelled,

292
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
he would become a family member.

293
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,440
He finally became a evil tree.

294
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,440
What kind of evil tree?

295
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
The evil tree he practiced

296
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
was to take someone's body.

297
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
Whoever he took from him,

298
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,440
he would become one of them.

299
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,440
He seemed to be happy about this.

300
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
The innocent people who killed him

301
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
were getting more and more.

302
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
That means

303
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
your uncle took the body of Yue Qiluo.

304
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
That's right.

305
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Since he is so big,

306
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
why can't he be the master

307
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
even if he likes someone?

308
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
And he is still in love?

309
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
Love?

310
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,440
You must have seen it on the online magazine.

311
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
The online magazine

312
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
is just a story

313
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,440
that ordinary people

314
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,440
are interested in after the meal.

315
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
What's going on?

316
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
He took the body of the Yue family

317
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
and became a woman.

318
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
He became a woman.

319
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
He also wanted to be a man

320
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,440
and find a young man

321
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
to play the wind and snow.

322
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
That's Duan Sanlao?

323
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
That's right.

324
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
It's him.

325
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
It's a pity that he is a magical man.

326
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
But I don't know

327
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
if there is a sect

328
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
that protects him.

329
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
Since he chose the Yue family

330
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,440
as his first wife,

331
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
he shouldn't have found

332
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
a man like him.

333
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Qiluo.

334
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
I'm sorry.

335
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,440
I can't see you again.

336
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
What do you mean?

337
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
My parents don't agree with us

338
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
to stay out of this.

339
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
They said that we shouldn't

340
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
be a couple

341
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
and continue to fight.

342
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
They only want to get our family back.

343
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
I thought about it.

344
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
It's true.

345
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,440
While we are not together,

346
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,440
let's break up.

347
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Break up?

348
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,440
You are so late to teach me.

349
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
You are talking about this to me?

350
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,440
I'm sorry.

351
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
I didn't deserve you.

352
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
That's all.

353
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
You are a mortal.

354
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
What do you think?

355
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,440
I admire you.

356
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
How dare you

357
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
say that you broke up with me?

358
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
I don't understand.

359
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,440
I don't know

360
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,440
how to explain it.

361
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,440
But I know

362
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
that you are not a woman.

363
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
You are a woman.

364
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
I don't know

365
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,440
if you are a woman.

366
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,440
I don't know.

367
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
I'm sorry.

368
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,440
I'm sorry.

369
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
I'm sorry.

370
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
I'm sorry.

371
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Even if the day

372
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
really breaks,

373
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
I will be tired.

374
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,440
Are you still leaving?

375
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,440
No.

376
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,440
No matter where you are, I will follow you.

377
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,240
Moreover, he is a good man.

378
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,240
Before the moon rises, he has already changed to the five or six evil spirits.

379
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,440
But this is not the most cruel place to be.

380
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,440
What is it?

381
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
Who are you talking about?

382
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,840
Who are you talking about?

383
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,840
People arebusily participating in the exploration.

384
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,040
His own health is not dis LT Everything.

385
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,040
For his future, I'm sorry, I cannot afford the dog community power.

386
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,640
In this world, most people with the right stars and tears,

387
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,640
can sacrifice a person who can know his poor soul clearly.

388
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,480
Yum!

389
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,760
Whoever wants to challenge the muscles,

390
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,440
it's going to be NOTCH,

391
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,480
but Bai Xiaobai.

392
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,640
OK.

393
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,480
I'II challenge you!

394
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,040
I think I dreamed of his past.

395
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,240
Don't let him harm me and make me pay.

396
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,000
I think he's evil because he's unfair to him.

397
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
He wants to revenge.

398
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,040
So it's all fake.

399
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,080
He's only suspicious.

400
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,720
He's shameless.

401
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,320
How many people did he kill?

402
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,080
Other people's life is not life.

403
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,800
His life is life.

404
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,800
In his eyes, other people's life is not life.

405
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,120
But he's a good fighter.

406
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,560
Even his family has a son.

407
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,040
He's still...

408
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,560
a good man.

409
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,960
Qi Luo, I love you.

410
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,720
I won't leave you forever.

411
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,240
I'll always be with you.

412
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,960
The attributes of Heaven Cloud secret hearings are too much.

413
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,520
It's indeed!!!!

414
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,640
All right.

415
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,520
I'm tired, too.

416
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,000
Let's go.

417
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,240
I will go to the temple to see the god.

418
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
I will go to the temple to see the god.

419
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,240
I will go to the temple to see the god.

420
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,240
I will go to the temple to see the god.

421
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,240
I will go to the temple to see the god.

422
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
I will go to the temple to see the god.

423
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,240
I will go to the temple to see the god.

424
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
I will go to the temple to see the god.

425
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
I will go to the temple to see the god.

426
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
I will go to the temple to see the god.

427
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,240
I will go to the temple to see the god.

428
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
I will go to the temple to see the god.

429
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
I will go to the temple to see the god.

430
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
I will go to the temple to see the god.

Qingyun Temple can't do anything about it.

441
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,540
So my master

442
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,820
set up a formation

443
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,380
to lead the elders to set up the formation

444
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,060
and seal it under the top.

445
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,020
It's been a hundred years.

446
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,860
I didn't expect

447
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,220
he would finally escape.

448
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,100
By the way,

449
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,300
how did he escape?

450
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,420
How did he break the formation?

451
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,740
No, he...

452
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,740
I broke it.

453
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,340
What?

454
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,660
Is it enough?

455
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,980
Come in.

456
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,660
Are you afraid of me now?

457
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,180
I'm not.

458
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,740
I'm not afraid now.

459
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,340
I won't be afraid in the future.

460
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:39,980
Good.

461
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,980
Good.

462
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,580
Are you willing to help me do something?

463
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,980
What is it? Tell me.

464
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,340
I want to move to the house of Gu Xunwu.

465
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,380
I can't wait for you to come in

466
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,180
and give me a cool wave.

467
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,340
I can't help but kill them.

468
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,740
The house belongs to me.

469
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,700
I've lived here for more than a hundred years.

470
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,860
I'll do it now.

471
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,340
I'll clean up here.

472
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,380
Don't worry.

473
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,380
He's your senior in Qingyun Temple.

474
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,900
You can't do anything about it.

475
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,340
He's the head of Qingyun Temple.

476
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,660
He should be responsible for this.

477
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,180
He should be cleaned up.

478
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,740
I'm cleaned up?

479
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,660
He's been buried and buried a hundred years ago.

480
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,860
What does it have to do with us?

481
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,340
Let me tell you.

482
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,180
You're not the one who let him out.

483
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,900
Don't think about it.

484
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,820
I'm not.

485
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,420
I'm not.

486
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,420
I'm not.

487
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,420
I'm not.

488
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,420
I'm not.

489
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,420
I'm not.

490
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,420
I'm not.

491
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,420
I'm not.

492
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,420
I'm not.

493
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,340
Don't try to scare me.

494
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,340
No way.

495
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,540
But he's not our senior.

496
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,420
He's your senior.

497
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,420
Yes.

498
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,980
He's a mess.

499
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,300
He's not our face.

500
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,700
He's your face.

501
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,300
Nonsense.

502
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,220
You don't know?

503
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,500
He's married.

504
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
He's not a big wife.

505
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,620
He's not a wine-grower.

506
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,340
He's a rich man.

507
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,180
Let me tell you.

508
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,180
He has nothing to do with Qingying.

509
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,340
Who's the rich man?

510
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,580
You can't say that.

511
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,340
As the saying goes,

512
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,180
one day, you'll be a rich man.

513
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,420
Moreover,

514
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,660
he's a senior in your master's family.

515
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,140
Master.

516
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,580
How about this?

517
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,180
Look at this senior.

518
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,780
He doesn't want to help us.

519
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,940
Let's go first.

520
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,660
Okay.

521
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,460
Let's go down the mountain to find someone to talk to.

522
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,140
The chief of Qingyun Temple, Chu Chenzi,

523
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,540
is a good man.

524
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,620
He's a senior in the master's family.

525
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,060
He's a mess.

526
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,780
Yes.

527
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,860
He's a rich man.

528
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,940
He's not a big wife.

529
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,060
He's not a wine-grower.

530
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,940
Let's go.

531
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,940
Let's go.

532
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,580
Stop.

533
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,740
The chief is so thoughtful.

534
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,420
Come on.

535
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,820
Come on.

536
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,420
I don't want to help you.

537
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,220
You really don't have the ability.

538
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,860
You're not as good as my master's.

539
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,180
If you let me catch you,

540
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,660
I'll be dead.

541
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,980
I'm sorry, master.

542
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,460
Because,

543
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,580
I was propriox

544
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,980
to rob a contracting me.

545
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,100
Please pick up the digit.

546
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,780
Alright.

547
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,180
The steward has said

548
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,300
She knew the position.

549
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,260
Are you restaurant chief of Qingyun Temple?

550
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,980
Why don't you give her the money?

551
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,300
Xiao Yu?

552
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,760
I asked for a taxi with no affection

553
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,940
to go purchase Arauma.

554
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,020
Her fingers,

555
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,700
it's beautiful.

556
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,700
But you can't,

557
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,700
If you say something, you'll think it's about the blood relationship, right?

558
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700
What about you?

559
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,700
Master Guo, forget it.

560
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,700
Let's not make her suffer.

561
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,700
Of course not.

562
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,700
Let's go down the mountain to find Yueqiel.

563
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,700
Sect Leader, let her come and save you.

564
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,700
We should not worry about your family's situation.

565
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,700
We'll deal with her ourselves.

566
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,700
After we go down the mountain,

567
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,700
let them have a good chat.

568
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,700
Let's go.

569
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,700
No, no, no.

570
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,700
Talk to each other.

571
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,700
Talk to each other.

572
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,700
How?

573
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,700
Look, I'm not good at magic,

574
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,700
but I can draw this picture.

575
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,700
Is there a picture in this secret room?

576
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,700
Yes, that's right.

577
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,700
If you draw this picture,

578
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,700
I'll give you the magic.

579
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,700
Get up.

580
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,700
Don't, don't, don't.

581
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,700
Talk to each other.

582
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,700
You don't know that Yueqiel can't seal this picture.

583
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,700
So we must draw this picture.

584
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,700
If we draw this picture, we can make it.

585
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,700
We'll talk about it later.

586
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,700
Okay.

587
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,700
Okay, I'll go again.

588
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,700
But it's dangerous this time.

589
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,700
They can't go with me.

590
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,700
Okay, no problem.

591
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,700
I have more rooms here.

592
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,700
You can stay here.

593
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,700
It's good to live here.

594
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,700
That's good.

595
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,700
I'll go back to the secret room.

596
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,700
Okay.

597
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,700
I'll go back to the secret room.

598
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,700
Okay.

599
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,700
Okay.

600
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700
Okay.

601
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,700
Okay.

602
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,700
Okay.

603
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,700
Okay.

604
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,700
Okay.

605
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,700
Okay.

606
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,700
Okay.

607
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,700
Okay.

608
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,700
Okay.

609
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,700
Okay.

610
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,700
Okay.

611
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,700
Okay.

612
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,700
What's wrong?

613
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,700
Are you angry?

614
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,700
Yes.

615
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,700
I am angry.

616
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,700
Why?

617
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,980
Why did you make the decision for me?

618
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,180
I'm not staying here.

619
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,300
Where are you going?

620
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,140
I'll go there.

621
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,660
I'm your man.

622
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,460
I won't make the decision for you.

623
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,380
Who will make the decision for you?

624
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,420
Hao Yueyue, listen to me.

625
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,500
I want you and Master Guo to stay here.

626
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,500
I have my reason.

627
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
You're so stubborn.

628
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,100
What about Qi Yi?

629
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,180
I want to go to the capital.

630
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,500
Can't you help me?

631
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,300
Do you know how to get water?

632
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,900
I can wait for you outside.

633
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,620
What if I meet Yue Jilong?

634
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,620
It's too late to hide now.

635
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,340
Let's send him off.

636
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,940
And Qi Er.

637
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,940
Although he's not a child,

638
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,100
he's still a child.

639
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,540
But Qing Yunguan is also a good place.

640
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,740
Yue Jilong can't find him here after a while.

641
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,740
Even if he finds him here,

642
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,740
he won't be able to go to the capital.

643
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,740
I'll leave you and Master Guo here to keep him safe.

644
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,740
I'll be safe and sound.

645
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,740
Pei Pei Pei.

646
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,540
You're so impolite.

647
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,940
You're saying you're afraid of the road.

648
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,140
Okay, okay.

649
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:25,940
I'm afraid of the road.

650
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,140
I'm afraid of the road.

651
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,140
Forget it.

652
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,540
I can't say it.

653
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,940
But you have to promise me.

654
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,540
If you're careful, you can't be forced.

655
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,940
I swear.

656
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,340
I won't force you.

657
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,740
Go back early.

658
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,140
Let's end this matter.

659
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,540
Let's go home early.

660
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,140
Otherwise, no one will know the chicken in the yard.

661
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:55,940
Good wife.

662
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,340
You haven't married yet.

663
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,740
You know to eat.

664
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,540
No, no.

665
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:52,380

666
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,140
Whatтересy big thing?

667
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,860
Don't worry.

668
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,660
Here, take this.

669
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,100
What's this?

670
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,140
You took a matter notice

671
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:29,700
to me,

672
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,180
Yueyang.

673
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,260
Tell me.

674
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,500
What have you promised me?

675
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,420
Be careful.

676
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,620
Never shoot.

677
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,780
Go back early.

678
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,220
Don't miss the opportunity.

679
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,100
Don't worry.

680
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,780
I will go back early.

681
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,140
Never miss the opportunity.

682
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,180
I will come back to see you.

683
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,620
Brother Guo.

684
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,620
I will leave Yueyang to you.

685
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,940
Yueyang is my sister.

686
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,580
I can't even eat her.

687
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,220
Be careful on the way.

688
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,340
Take this.

689
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,620
You will be hungry.

690
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,460
Take care.

691
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,300
Go back.

692
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,620
Don't be hungry.

693
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,620
I will come back to see you.

694
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,020
I will come back.

695
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,740
Yueqing will come back to see me.

696
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,860
But you have to promise me.

697
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,660
Be careful.

698
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,820
Never shoot.

699
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,700
No.

700
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,980
Since we have the capital,

701
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,660
the future will be more difficult.

702
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,060
Master is not a fool.

703
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,900

Master is not a fool.

718
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,820

Master is not a fool.

732
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,140
Master is not a fool.

733
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,140
Master is not a fool.

734

Yue Qinshu.

You can't find my name!

797
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,100
Weren't you too angry?

00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,280
I don't know what was wrong

00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,700
but everything is important

800
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,540
I can't be more careful

801
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,420
the戰 mobile world

802
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,620

808
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:13,900

00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,160

810
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,160
You're the one.

811
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,160
Let me out!

812
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,160
Where is Gu Xuanwu?

813
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,160
Don't waste your time.

814
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,160
Xiao Yuan, please come to see me!

815
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,160
Jin Koujin has already told you that you're going to use Iron Zhaofeng.

816
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,160
Wu Xin still won't tell me about Gu Xuanwu's whereabouts.

817
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,160
Gu Xuanwu? Who cares about him?

818
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,160
I wanted Wu Xin.

819
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,160
She wants to see you.

820
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,160
It's really not easy.

821
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,160
She finally has the time to see me.

822
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,160
I've been following the sunset

823
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,160
but it didn't stop.

824
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,160
I've been using this warm starlight

825
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,160
to ask the flowers in the night.

826
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,160
I've been wandering around

827
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,160
and still remember the hometown.

828
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,160
The life is a legend.

829
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:17,160
The corner of time

830
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:24,160
is closely looking at people's love and hate.

831
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,160
Although time has passed

832
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,160
although he has forgotten, I still remember

833
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,160
the memories he left

834
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,160
and the memories he had with him.

835
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,160
The life is a legend.

836
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,160
The corner of time

837
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:53,160
is closely looking at people's love and hate.

838
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:57,160
Although time has passed

839
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,160
although he has forgotten, I still remember

840
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:08,160
the memories he had with him.

841
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,160
The memories he had with him

842
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:19,160
are still alive.

843
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,160
Song Tian?

844
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,160
Ji Luo.

845
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,160
You're really dead, aren't you?

846
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,160
I am Wu Xin.
