00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the grass and the shadow

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is full of love and face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if the clouds are floating

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The pain is so hard to describe

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The madness of ice

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Just one day

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You clearly have a life

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In the north side of the lake

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You clearly have a life

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In the north side of the lake

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You clearly have a life

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In the north side of the lake

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Stop!

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Stop! Do you hear me?

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why are you the only one left?

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Where are the others?

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm talking to you.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yue Qiluo?

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You stinky nanny.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yue Qiluo?

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Why is it like this?

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This way.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Forget it.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This way.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's from nowadays!

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yuya! Yuya!

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm here!

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yuya!

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What are you doing?

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If he gets killed, he'll be in a hurry.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't kill him!

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Deputy Chief!

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What's wrong with you?

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yuya!

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yuya!

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yuya!

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Are you okay?

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What can I do?

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What's this?

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
A box!

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Where did you put the box I gave you?

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's on me.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I have it here.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Remember, you send one by yourself.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Then you won't be revived.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And, take the body's body down.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Burn them all.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes!

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yuya!

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Leave it to me.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Hurry up and hide.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Be careful.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Second, reward the queen, reward Huang Jingcheng, reward the cat, reward the shipwrecker, and so on.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Super high compensation rate, reward the judges more and more.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Give more opportunities, hurry up and join.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Amen, fresh and pure, Yu Lecheng 994466, come.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yuya!

73
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yuya!

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yuya!

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yuya!

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yuya!

77
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yuya!

78
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yuya!

79
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What are you doing?

80
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What's that?

81
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Is this the end of your uncle's group?

82
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Find me a place.

83
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't think.

84
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Your uncle's group?

85
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Chief, this is not the place where your uncle's group lives.

86
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Wu Jin, can you be more serious?

87
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Hurry up and find me.

88
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll go there.

89
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You go find your uncle's group.

90
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Xing.

91
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Xing.

92
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why is this a well?

93
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Chief.

94
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Chief, what are you thinking about?

95
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Look.

96
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Is this the well?

97
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Right?

98
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It turns out that it's really the same.

99
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's the same?

100
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yuya.

101
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Wu Xing, you're too stubborn.

102
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You forced me to die.

103
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Don't blame me for being cruel.

104
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I finally found it.

105
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Come on, let's go back to the well.

106
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Let's go back to the well.

107
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Chief, you're not there.

108
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Chief, are you okay?

109
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Chief, are you okay?

110
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Chief.

111
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Chief.

112
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Chief, please move forward.

113
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Chief.

114
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Chief.

115
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Chief.

116
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Chief.

117
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Chief.

118
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Chief.

119
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I finally know why Uncle Lian Shi's group

120
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
asked you to come back.

121
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You can't go out if you come back.

122
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Let's go.

123
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Chief.

124
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Are you okay?

125
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm fine. I'm fine.

126
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There's nothing to eat in here.

127
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yue Qiluo's hometown is in Biku.

128
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There's nothing in this house.

129
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
There's nothing to eat outside.

130
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
She wants to take a bath.

131
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
She wants to take a bath.

132
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Chief.

133
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Chief.

134
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We can't stay here for long.

135
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Let's find a way to leave here.

136
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Come on, look.

137
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This is the palace.

138
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Chief.

139
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Chief.

140
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
There's a hole here.

141
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Don't look.

142
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Chief Ma.

143
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Chief, one can do nothing 不僅體力不行

144
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and I don't mind you slab University.

145
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Take care of yourself.

146
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Help me.

147
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm not suitable for you.

148
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Help me.

149
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Bu Man.

150
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You must have been a thief before.

151
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Why is there a door here?

152
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Why is there nothing here?

153
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Nothing.

154
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
No hands.

155
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What should I do?

156
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Director.

157
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Try the box.

158
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Can we beat him?

159
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Wu Xin, you're not in the mood.

160
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
How can I beat him?

161
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Don't be so careless.

162
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I can beat him.

163
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I can't beat him.

164
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I can't hurt myself.

165
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Do you have the book?

166
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
My grandfather's book is almost gone.

167
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I can draw it myself.

168
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Then you can write it here.

169
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'll write it.

170
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Then you can draw it here.

171
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll draw more.

172
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What? You can write it yourself.

173
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll write it.

174
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Are you crazy?

175
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
After you draw it,

176
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
you can put it on your head.

177
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Don't breathe.

178
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'll put it on my head.

179
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'll beat it.

180
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Are you crazy?

181
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Are you crazy?

182
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's too risky.

183
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's not risky.

184
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We can only wait here.

185
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm afraid that my book

186
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
will be ruined.

187
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's okay.

188
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You're not in the Xizhen.

189
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You can make a move.

190
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
My master drew it.

191
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
My book

192
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
is a little bit worse than him.

193
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Even a wooden pot

194
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
can't be used

195
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
when you draw it.

196
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
If I keep it in mind,

197
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
it's not a problem.

198
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
If the master

199
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
has the knowledge,

200
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I guess he'll have to cry.

201
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'll draw more.

202
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'll draw two more.

203
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Hurry up.

204
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You remember it.

205
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I remember it.

206
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Hurry up.

207
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'll start in one, two, three.

208
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Ready?

209
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
One, two, three.

210
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Wait.

211
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Wait.

212
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What are you waiting for?

213
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Are you ready?

214
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Here I come.

215
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Wait.

216
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Ready?

217
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
One, two, three.

218
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Go.

219
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Go.

220
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Go.

221
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Hurry up.

222
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Hurry up.

223
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Hurry up.

224
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Are you okay?

225
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Get up.

226
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Are you okay?

227
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Look.

228
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Go.

229
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Go.

230
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Go.

231
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Chief,

232
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
bring me the light.

233
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Chief,

234
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
there's a pile of stones

235
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
in the ground.

236
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Why is there a stone here?

237
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Chief,

238
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
this is not your master's room, is it?

239
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Your master's room

240
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
is worth a dozen or so.

241
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
If you're so serious,

242
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
you can't even draw a stone.

243
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
If you're so serious,

246
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
you can't even draw a stone.

247
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
First,

248
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
you don't want to let anything in you.

249
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Second,

250
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
you don't want to let anything outside you.

251
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Stand still.

252
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Hurry up.

253
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
There's a stone.

254
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Go.

255
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Go.

256
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Hurry up.

257
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
God.

258
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Are you okay?

259
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Don't touch me.

260
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Qi Luo,

261
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
are you okay?

262
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm so defeated.

263
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Qi Luo,

264
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
you...

265
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You go out first.

266
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I want to be alone.

267
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yu Ya.

268
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yu Ya.

269
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Wu Xin,

270
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
why is she still here?

271
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Is something wrong?

272
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It's okay.

273
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
She's free to go.

274
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
She'll be fine.

275
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
No need.

276
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Deputy Chief,

277
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
all the steps are done.

278
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You're so beautiful.

279
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Go.

280
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Arrange the books for your brothers.

281
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes, hurry up.

282
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Remember,

283
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
don't be messy.

284
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm going to the cave now.

285
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'll take Wu Xin.

286
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Don't worry.

287
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'll take her back.

288
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Okay.

289
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You're awake.

290
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You're so big.

291
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You're still here.

292
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You're so clumsy.

293
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You can't hold it.

294
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Why don't you hold it?

295
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That's not right.

296
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
She's your uncle.

297
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm here to take care of you.

298
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You're your uncle.

299
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Did you hear that?

300
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Don't scare me.

301
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Come here.

302
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What are you doing?

303
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Listen.

304
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Hurry up.

305
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Hurry up.

306
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Hurry up.

307
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Hurry up.

308
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Hurry up.

309
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Go.

310
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Hurry up.

311
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Hurry up.

312
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Hurry up.

313
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Go.

314
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Hurry up.

315
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Hurry up.

316
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Hurry up.

317
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Sir.

318
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Are you okay?

319
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Be careful.

320
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Are you okay?

321
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I need to take a bath.

322
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I need to take a bath.

323
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Master!

324
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Master!

325
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Are you okay?

326
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Hurry up!

327
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Lock the door.

328
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Brothers!

329
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Lock the door!

330
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yes!

331
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Hurry up!

332
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Have you found the secret room?

333
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Don't talk so much.

334
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
This is not the place to stay.

335
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Let's talk about it in detail.

336
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Okay.

337
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Hurry up!

338
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Lock the door!

339
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yes!

340
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I'll notify you.

341
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Okay.

342
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I told you.

343
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I want to be alone.

344
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Come in.

345
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Master.

346
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,600
You called us all here to be with Miss Yue?

347
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:50,800
AND

348
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,920
You, hurry!

349
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,700
Brother taper.

350
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,000
Write!

351
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,700
Write!

352
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Why are you so anxious?

353
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Is it because of you?

354
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I usually go to the lake with the wind.

355
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'll show you the real world.

356
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
What will I do?

357
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Lin Moqi, I ask you.

358
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You have the magic of the wind and the moon.

359
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Do you have any good fortune?

360
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Don't worry.

361
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
There are three ancient books.

362
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
There is no problem.

363
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
But I'm really good at it.

364
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
What do you think?

365
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Can you combine the magic tree with the soul town

366
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
with the demon demon?

367
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
The Taoist is so good.

368
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm so proud of it.

369
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You should spend more time on your cultivation.

370
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And less time on your fishing.

371
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Qingxu, you don't have to be proud.

372
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Director, what's in your glass bottle?

373
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You don't know it, right?

374
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
This is my new magic.

375
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Give me a hug.

376
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Why do you use it?

377
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Give me a hug.

378
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Director, give me this.

379
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Why do you want it?

380
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Give me a wife.

381
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Okay.

382
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
How is it?

383
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It's quite comfortable.

384
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
What about this dress?

385
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Stop.

386
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Okay.

387
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Burn it.

388
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Burn it.

389
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm sure Yueya will help me wash this dress.

390
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Moqi, you ask her.

391
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Okay, okay.

392
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Okay.

393
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You two wash it.

394
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Wash it quickly and wait for me.

395
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It smells like a baby.

396
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I'll burn it.

397
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'll burn it.

398
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'll wash it clean.

399
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's a big melon.

400
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
What's that?

401
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yueya.

402
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Master.

403
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Where's Yueya?

404
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yueya went to the night market.

405
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I'll show you something.

406
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
What are you doing here?

407
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Stone.

408
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
What stone?

409
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Great gold mine.

410
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Where did you get it?

411
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Come, let's talk here.

412
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
This is from the drawer you and your cousin made.

413
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Tell me.

414
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
What's going on in the cave?

415
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It's...

416
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It's the cave.

417
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It was burned by us.

418
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Burned?

419
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yes.

420
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
There must be a trap in the cave.

421
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's a trap.

422
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's a trap.

423
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It's a trap.

424
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's a trap.

425
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
There must be a trap in the cave.

426
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
A trap?

427
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You think so?

428
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
You two burnt the cave.

429
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And you can get it out of the clothes.

430
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
There must be a trap.

431
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That's it.

432
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You want to dig a trap?

433
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Don't be silly.

434
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I can't dig a trap like this.

435
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I know it well.

436
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I can't help it.

437
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I tell you.

438
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I want to use this.

439
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Change the ice boat.

440
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Do you think I want to stay with him?

441
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
No way.

442
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I tell you.

443
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I want to use his strength.

444
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Change my own power.

445
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
What crime is it now?

446
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
The crime of gun-drying.

447
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I use the gun to shoot a piece of land.

448
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I can be a general.

449
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Who wants to be his deputy commander?

450
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Listen to me.

451
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Even if there is a trap,

452
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
it must be reliable.

453
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I know it well.

454
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I know it well.

455
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I just said I was a good man.

456
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Look.

457
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I can't help it.

458
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I came out of the trap.

459
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Commander, you are a good man.

460
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
You are a good man.

461
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's not a big deal.

462
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Well.

463
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Go to the trap tomorrow.

464
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Take someone to dig.

465
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
OK.

466
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Commander.

467
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Good.

468
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
But the Wen County is very close.

469
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Zhang Xianzong is the dog.

470
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
He is a strong man.

471
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
He is a good man.

472
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I think you are the leader now.

473
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
When you go to the trap tomorrow,

474
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
you bring a soldier to dig.

475
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I am afraid that Zhang Xianzong

476
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
will let his mother go.

477
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Thank you, commander.

478
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Commander Gu.

479
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It's time.

480
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I am Commander Gu now.

481
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Manager.

482
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Commander Gu.

483
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It's raining.

484
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I think it's a magical scene.

485
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Commander Gu.

486
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
What are you talking about?

487
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You two don't know.

488
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You two meet each other.

489
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I am...

490
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Come.

491
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
What do you want?

492
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
What do you want?

493
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
You two are my lucky stars.

494
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
You are the leader now.

495
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You even change your mouth.

496
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
What do you mean?

497
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Well.

498
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I am not in a hurry.

499
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Well.

500
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I will hold a wedding for you two.

501
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
OK.

502
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I tell you.

503
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I have planned to get married this time.

504
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
If I hadn't been

505
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
called a butt in front of Yue Qinluo,

506
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I would have been in a hurry.

507
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But we have to think about one thing.

508
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Tell me.

509
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
OK or not?

510
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
OK or not?

511
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I am young and beautiful.

512
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I don't care if I am with you.

513
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I am telling you now.

514
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I am not.

515
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yue'er.

516
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Get a man.

517
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Get a man.

518
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yue'er.

519
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yue'er.

520
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
OK.

521
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You two are old friends.

522
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Don't be so ridiculous.

523
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yue'er.

524
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I am planning to be happy for you.

525
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I am not done with you.

526
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
What do you mean?

527
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I will take you to the street tomorrow.

528
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I will buy some wedding jewelry.

529
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
How about it?

530
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
OK.

531
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Mr. Gu.

532
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Please.

533
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Get the stuff ready.

534
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
OK.

535
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
How is it?

536
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Is it beautiful?

537
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
What are you doing?

538
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Why are you so excited?

539
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Hurry up.

540
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
How about you?

541
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Mr. Gu.

542
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
How is it?

543
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
What?

544
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Take it all.

545
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
All of it is the most expensive.

546
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
OK.

547
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
OK.

548
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Come out.

549
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You don't need to wear wedding dress.

550
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
All of it is the most expensive.

551
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
OK.

552
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

553
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's OK.

554
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Boss.

555
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It's the most expensive.

556
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Mr. Gu.

557
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
How about this flower?

558
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Good.

559
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It's the most expensive.

560
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Are you crazy?

561
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You don't even look at it.

562
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
What is the most expensive?

563
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Do you think you are a petty person?

564
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
What is this called?

565
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
It's called a rich and rich thing.

566
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
You can't just go with the expensive.

567
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
No need.

568
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You two will get married only once in your life.

569
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
The wedding is very interesting.

570
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
If you get married,

571
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
you will be in trouble, right?

572
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I don't care.

573
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You can't choose the most expensive.

574
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You are so stubborn.

575
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
OK.

576
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It's all up to you.

577
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Mr. Gu.

578
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Look at this.

579
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
No need to look at it.

580
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It's the most expensive.

581

Thank you.

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,400
Thank you.

612
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:15,960

00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,600
My brother.

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,200
Come on.

615

Cheers.

619
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,240
Okay.

620
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,880
I have to go.

621
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,360
Cheers.

622
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,040
Right.

623
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,200
Cheers.

624
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,720
How is he?

625
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:50,000
The tremendously ascבת

626
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,060
Your stability seems Philippines.

627
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,920
What's the matter?

628
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,000
My neck hurts.

629
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,140
Let me massage it.

630
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,640
So many people.

631
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,980
For no reason even afraid to take off my hair.

632
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,980
I want to go back.

633
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,800
Didn't we unconsciously get married?

634
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,400
Let's keep this special place until the end.

635
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I want to ask you something.

636
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Today, my brother and sister are getting married.

637
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Are you happy?

638
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Yes.

639
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I, Gu Guoqiang, have been

eating and thinking for the rest of my life.

641
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It's people, demons, gods, I've seen it all.

642
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
If you ask the world who's the best for me and who's the closest to me,

643
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
they're the two.

644
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
So they're getting married today.

645
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I'm happy.

646
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
My old Gu is happy.

647
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
He's happy to be in love.

648
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Come, drink.

649
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Cheers.

650
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Cheers.

651
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Mr. Gu,

652
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
don't drink anymore.

653
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Brother,

654
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
in this life,

655
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
it's not easy to find a pebble.

656
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
My old Gu is happy.

657
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Some people can't find one in their life.

658
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
But I, Gu Guoqiang,

659
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
find two.

660
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
So I swear,

661
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I swear I'll treat them well.

662
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'll give them what I want.

663
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I'll give them what I eat.

664
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
In this life, I'll make them have a good life.

665
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
A good life.

666
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Come, Gu Guoqiang, drink.

667
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Brother,

668
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
sister,

669
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
good sister,

670
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I'm happy to meet you two.

671
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
My old Gu

672
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
is worth it in this life.

673
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So you're happy.

674
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I'm happy too.

675
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You're here today.

676
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I'm happy to be in love.

677
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I'm happy.

678
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Come, let's drink.

679
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Come, drink together.

680
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Come, let's drink.

681
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000

683
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Come, drink.

684
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Let me drink.

685
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Come,

686
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I'm happy.

687
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'm happy.

688
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Come, let's drink.

689
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I'm happy.

690
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
You two,

691
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I'm happier than you two.

692
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I'm happier.

693
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I'm not happy.

694
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
It's a coincidence.

695
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I need to drink.

696
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I'll open this.

697
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I'll drink.

698
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
My brother,

699
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I should call you brother or brother.

700
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
You can call me anything.

701
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Okay, when I'm in the big bed,

702
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I'll let you be the most famous hair stylist in the world.

703
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
You've been doing this for a whole day.

704
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Why are you still so big?

705
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Sister, you dare to call me brother?

706
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
If you don't want to be called brother, just be honest.

707
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It's okay.

708
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
By the way, you like that one.

709
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
You're just a little bit drunk, right?

710
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I'll buy you a pair of change.

711
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I don't want that.

712
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
If you don't like it,

713
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I'll give you a chance.

714
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
How about the 20-dollar 80-dollar

715
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
big-bottom ring?

716
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Okay, go to sleep.

717
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I can't sleep.

718
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Go to sleep.

719
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000

00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I'm not sleepy at all.

I'm not sleepy at all.

00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I'm not sleepy at all.

774
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I'm not sleepy at all.

775
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000

The End

780
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Episode 17

781
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Give me a body for a while.

782
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Yes.

783
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I'll go with you.

784
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
No need.

785
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I've accumulated the price of 100 years for this.

786
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And you ruined it.

787
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Did you get hurt?

788
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
If my poor health was damaged,

789
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
it would be a sin.

790
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I must get Yuya here.

791
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I'm a blind girl.

792
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I've been to the Wens and Tianjin other than the old house.

793
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,400
How about we go to Beiping?

794
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,000
Wu Xuan, I'm going to dig the well.

795
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,560
Then wait and see the good play.

796
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,400
There are evil things inside.

797
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,800
Who digs, who dies.
