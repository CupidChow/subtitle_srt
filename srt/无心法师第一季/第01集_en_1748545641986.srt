00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the greenery

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is shining on my face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if it were a universe

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The life is a dream

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The life is a dream

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One day

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You are clear and mysterious

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the background

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are clear and mysterious

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like a background

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You are clear and mysterious

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Like a background

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You are clear and mysterious

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Like a background

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You are clear and mysterious

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Like a background

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You are clear and mysterious

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Like a background

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Like a background

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Like a background

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You may follow through, no violence

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,500
A refreshing wind

38
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,000
The air is so clear

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,400
This is the wating river

40
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,560
Seems to be running on five

41
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,120
Finally

42
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,040
F rock

43
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,320
Beifall

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,200
Run!

45
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,680
Go for it!

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

The first game of the season is the first game.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The first game of the season is the second game.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The first game of the season.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The first game of the season is the first game,

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
the first game of the season.

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The first game of the season is the first game.

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The second game of the season is the first game.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The first game of the season is the first game.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The first game of the season is the first game.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,800
liksom

74
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,240
Cuddle

75
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,220
screenshot

76
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,640
are you joking

77
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:58,740
若

78
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,460
cut

79
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,500
rest assured

80
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,140
Miss.

81
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,060
Don't come here.

82
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,900
You're sleeping.

83
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,860
What are you doing?

84
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,460
You're going to be killed and you're going to be killed?

85
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,700
Miss.

86
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,220
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,500
I didn't mean it.

88
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,100
You said you didn't mean it.

89
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,500
Why should I believe you?

90
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,420
I didn't mean it.

91
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,740
I'm just too hungry.

92
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,340
I can't bear to smell your half-baked head.

93
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,500
Even if you're hungry,

94
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,740
what do you mean by hiding under the tree?

95
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,940
It's easy to be cold.

96
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,340
It's cold even in the winter in the wild.

97
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,120
This trouble is really poor.

98
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,700
A drink.

99
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,740
Miss, your leg is too big.

100
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,740
Miss, it's not worth it.

101
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,940
You said it's not your fault.

102
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,940
What are you doing?

103
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,940
Nothing.

104
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,540
Miss, have you been in any trouble lately?

105
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,540
What trouble?

106
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,540
Yes, and so on.

107
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,940
Yes, you are the one who got in trouble.

108
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,940
Miss, my name is Wu Xin.

109
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,940
I'm not a bad person.

110
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,940
Look, it's late.

111
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,340
You can't stay here for a long time.

112
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,940
How about I take you out?

113
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,940
I'm not a bad person.

114
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,940
I'm going to repay your kindness.

115
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
Fine.

116
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,940
But, I've told you.

117
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,940
I'll go to the front line.

118
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,940
We can go there.

119
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,940
Okay.

120
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,000
Miss, we don't want to get ahead of you.

121
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,160
We need to work more diligently.

122
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,440
How may I, Miss Hei?

123
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,740
Miss Hei's supposed to contribute.

124
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,040
Miss Hei is very serious about me.

125
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,940
She doesn't know I'll take her back.

126
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,840
She is更 feeble if she doesn't contribute.

127
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,120
Things can start now.

128
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,080
Don't worry.

129
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,960
Don't worry.

130
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,840
Don't worry.

131
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,800
Don't worry.

132
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,520
All right.

133
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,400
Don't worry.

134
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,440
Don't worry.

135
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,560
Just go.

136
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,680
Don't follow me.

137
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,800
Why are you following me?

138
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,960
There are no ways.

139
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,040
I'll leave when you get home.

140
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,720
I'll take it as a gift.

141
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,560
This is my home.

142
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,680
I'll call the police.

143
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,720
I'll call the police.

144
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,840
I'll call the police.

145
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,880
I'll call the police.

146
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll call the police.

147
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,680
I'm calling the police.

148
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,040
Let's go.

149
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,800
Who are you?

150
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,160
You are hiding at our door.

151
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,960
Is it Si Benda or Taofan?

152
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,400
Why are you talking like that?

153
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,640
Why?

154
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,760
Let's go.

155
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,520
If you want to eat,

156
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,720
go to your mother.

157
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,680
We don't have...

158
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,440
Take a look.

159
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,400
I'll call you if you want to eat.

160
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,200
Hang on.

161
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,600
Nanny.

162
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,720
Don't follow me.

163
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
I'm not going home to do some illegal things.

164
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Do you really have to bully me like this?

165
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
I'm really worried about you.

167
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
How about I help you find a inn first?

168
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
You stay here first.

169
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
Inn?

170
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
You came here because of the wind?

171
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
I thought I could find a living body before it got dark.

172
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
But I found you halfway through the road.

173
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
I broke the wall.

174
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
Who wants me here?

175
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
It's all my fault.

177
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
I don't even know where Xia Duan Fan is.

178
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
How can I live here?

179
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
I have a way.

180
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
Trust me.

181
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
When I get the money,

182
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
I'll treat you to dinner

183
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
and pay you for the inn.

184
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
I have to go.

185
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Why are you here?

186
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
I've already told you.

187
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
I'm going to buy you some food.

188
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
I'll buy you dinner.

189
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
Don't worry.

190
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
Let me buy you dinner.

191
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
I'm here for you.

192
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
I'm here for you.

193
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,720
I'm here for you.

194
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
You're engaged?

195
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
I'm here for you.

196
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
I'm here for you.

197
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
I'm here for you.

198
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
I'm here for you.

199
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
I'm here for you.

200
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,920
Who is it?

201
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,320
The hair stylist.

202
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,320
Who are you looking for?

203
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,080
Your family has a shoe.

204
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,880
Many people have died recently.

205
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,240
Master, master.

206
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,240
How did you know that my family has a shoe?

207
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,480
Don't care about how I know.

208
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,040
I'll ask you.

209
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,200
Is your family's shoe a area?

210
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,400
Or not?

211
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,800
Master, to be honest,

212
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,880
this house is not mine.

213
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,680
I live here to look for a house.

214
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
Can you please go to the shoe?

215
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,840
My family is the owner.

216
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,400
How about this?

217
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
My family's owner is not far away.

218
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,800
I'll go back to the house.

219
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,400
Wait for me here.

220
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Okay.

221
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,440
It's not going to happen in the daytime.

222
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,680
But it's late at night.

223
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,720
You just wait there.

224
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,040
Don't go inside.

225
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,240
Why?

226
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,320
This house is not clean.

227
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,760
Even I

228
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,120
dare not stay inside when it's dark.

229
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,240
It's the same outside.

230
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,120
Wait for me.

231
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,400
I'll go back soon.

232
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,440
I'll go back soon.

233
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,040
Wait.

234
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,480
Wait.

235
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,080
Let's sit here.

236
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,960
We've been together for so long.

237
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,840
I don't know your name.

238
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,640
My name is Yueya.

239
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,320
Yueya.

240
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,600
Thank you for saving me.

241
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,040
Yueya.

242
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,000
Thank you for saving me.

243
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,400
I'm just a half-wit.

244
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Don't hang it on your mouth.

245
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,720
There's wind.

246
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,000
There's wind.

247
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,720
When did it start?

248
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,200
I don't know.

249
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,480
I want to go down.

250
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,400
I can see you.

251
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,400
吗

252
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Don't know how is he fear

253
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Wait like this

254
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Your legs are quite serious

255
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Do you know to take the ambulance

256
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Let's go in

257
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Be careful

258
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Let's go over there.

259
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
Come. Sit down.

260
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
What are you looking at?

261
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,400
I'm going to find something to help you pack your wounds.

262
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Wait here for me. Don't go anywhere.

263
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,400
I'm going to find something to help you pack your wounds.

264
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
It's snowing.

265
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
I need to find some water first.

266
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
I'll tell you when I'm done.

267
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
I need to find something to help you pack your wounds.

268
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Yue Lan, run!

269
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,400
What was that? Was it a hairpin?

270
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
How could it move by itself?

271
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Don't stay here. Let's leave here.

272
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,400
Come, sit down. I'll help you pack your wounds.

273
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,400
What is that? Is it a monster?

274
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
I think it's real.

275
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
What monster? Run!

276
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
You little monk, you really want to get out of the fire?

277
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Yue Lan!

278
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
Don't worry. I can help you pack your wounds.

279
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
What?

280
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
I mean, you can put your heart in your stomach.

281
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
I said I can help you pack your wounds.

282
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Come, sit down. I'll help you pack your wounds.

283
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
It might hurt a little. Please wait a bit.

284
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,400
1

285
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,400
I remember there is some东方ovic setup in front of us.

286
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
What for?

287
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
I don't know on the document.

288
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,000
We? Of course we are fine.

289
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,400
Without this golden steel ring, we can't live a life like this.

290
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,800
I think you should take us to see your master.

291
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,400
Let's go.

292
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,200
Okay. Please.

293
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Everyone, the front door is here.

294
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,200
Who are your master? Why are there so many war dogs?

295
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,800
Our master is Master Gu.

296
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,400
Master Gu? Who is Master Gu?

297
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,000
Even Master Gu doesn't know.

298
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,400
He is the one who gave the order to Wen Xian.

299
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,800
Wen Xian is the one who gave the order.

300
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Master Gu came and took him away.

301
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,200
He took the gold plate.

302
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,000
I've seen a lot of people in the past two years.

303
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
They are all the people who don't want to be called Master Gu.

304
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,400
Didn't you tell him that Master Gu is a commander?

305
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,200
That's the King of Qiubai. Don't bother him.

306
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,400
Whether he is Qiubai or King of Qiubai,

307
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,000
I am not afraid of him. I am afraid of him.

308
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,600
You are a monk.

309
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,600
I told you that I would invite you to the banquet.

310
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,400
Don't go in.

311
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,800
The order of the Tianjin銀 line.

312
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
This way, please.

313
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,000
It's delicious.

314
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Master, have a drink.

315
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,600
Master, the food is here.

316
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Let them come over.

317
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Come.

318
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,600
Come. Please come inside.

319
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Let's go.

320
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The food is here.

321
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Master, what's your name?

322
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
I am Wu Xin.

323
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Wu Xin?

324
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
You look good.

325
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
But look at your clothes.

326
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,800
Why are you so messy?

327
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,400
You are so messy.

328
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
Look at your sleeves.

329
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
What's going on?

330
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
No.

331
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
If we jump into the mountain,

332
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
we will fall into the meat.

333
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Master, what did you say?

334
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
No, no.

335
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,400
I mean, you look so beautiful.

336
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
Why do you become a monk?

337
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Isn't it a pity?

338
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
You are just a man.

339
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
What's the pity?

340
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
This is...

341
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
This is my sister.

342
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Beautiful.

343
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
So beautiful.

344
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
Master, so beautiful.

345
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Aren't we beautiful?

346
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Yes.

347
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
We are beautiful.

348
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Beautiful.

349
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,400
But we are different.

350
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Come.

351
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,400
You two, go back and rest.

352
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Master, why do you still have a sister?

353
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
It's hard to live in the world.

354
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
You should give your sister a meal.

355
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,400
So you haven't had dinner yet?

356
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
No.

357
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
If you don't mind,

358
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,400
how about I deal with you tonight?

359
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,400
You are a monk.

360
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Why do you have to be so modest?

361
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Fine.

362
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Come, sister.

363
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Sit.

364
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
Master, sit.

365
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
Thank you.

366
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
Eat.

367
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Don't be polite.

368
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Eat.

369
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
You are welcome.

370
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Come.

371
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Master, we are not polite.

372
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
Don't be polite.

373
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Eat.

374
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Master.

375
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
You are monks.

376
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Aren't you jealous?

377
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
I am not jealous.

378
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400
Master.

379
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,400
These two are so capable.

380
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,400
Master said that the monk's heart is broken.

381
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Look, they have nothing to do.

382
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Nothing?

383
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Nothing?

384
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Nothing?

385
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Master.

386
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,400
You just met the evil spirit in the yard, right?

387
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,400
Yes.

388
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Then why didn't you get rid of it?

389
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
It's a surprise.

390
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
But it's too sudden.

391
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
I didn't get the chance to see it.

392
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Second,

393
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
he is a evil spirit after all.

394
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
It's not easy to get rid of him.

395
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
And,

396
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
this is your house.

397
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
I didn't get the chance to see it.

398
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
How dare I get rid of it?

399
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Master, what a coincidence.

400
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,400
We have lived here for so long.

401
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
We didn't even touch a single ear.

402
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
You are so bold.

403
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
You got it.

404
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
You are so good.

405
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
You are so generous.

406
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
You are more important.

407
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Even if I see you,

408
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,400
I am afraid that you will be angry.

409
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
It's normal for you to be angry.

410
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
I am a farmer.

411
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,400
But you have not grown enough.

412
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Then Singapore.

413
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Are you kidding me?

414
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Come on.

415
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
We can go home.

416
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
You know nothing at all,

417
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
I have nothing to say.

418
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
And you don't know about it?

419
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
I can't believe it.

420
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
In fact,

421
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
it's a lie.

422
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
What if

423
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Tomorrow, you follow me to your house.

424
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,400
I will show you my ability.

425
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:40,400
So, you just have to manage the food and accommodation?

426
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
That's fine.

427
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
How about now?

428
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
I'm not afraid anyway.

429
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
Tomorrow is tomorrow.

430
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
I have something to do tonight.

431
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
I'm in the guest room.

432
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,400
I'll take you to your room and have a good rest.

433
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
You can talk tomorrow.

434
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Sit down.

435
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
I'm afraid.

436
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Remember, you follow me.

437
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
I'll follow you.

438
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
Master.

439
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
What are you doing?

440
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Let's start.

441
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Don't let me find you any magic tricks.

442
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
I don't have time.

443
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,400
I don't need any magic tricks.

444
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,400
Wait for me behind you.

445
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
I'm not afraid of you.

446
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,400
I'm afraid of you.

447
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Just say it.

448
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,400
You've killed three people in this house.

449
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Where's the first person?

450
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Here.

451
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Where's the second person?

452
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Here.

453
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,400
Go.

454
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Am I right?

455
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,400
If no one tells you the news,

456
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,400
you're really a good man.

457
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,400
Where's the third person?

458
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,400
The third person is behind you.

459
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,400
The third person is here.

460
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Right.

461
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
These three people are in a bad state.

462
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
They must have committed a lot of crimes.

463
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Yes.

464
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
When I first saw these four people,

465
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
I thought they were all dead.

466
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,400
I thought they were all dead.

467
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
I thought they were all dead.

468
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
I thought they were all dead.

469
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
I thought they were all dead.

470
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,400
I thought they were all dead.

471
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,400
When I first saw these four people,

472
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,400
I didn't know what they were doing to them.

473
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
They were so scary.

474
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Let's go back.

475
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Don't worry.

476
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Let's go back.

477
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
I'll be back.

478
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
How is it?

479
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
I've taken a look.

480
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,400
I'll talk to you when I get back.

481
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Hello?

482
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Master.

483
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Have some tea.

484
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
Yu Yan, you drink too.

485
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Master.

486
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,400
I didn't get the chance to see it yesterday.

487
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
I've seen it clearly today.

488
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
I should know what it is.

489
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Is it a ghost?

490
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Yes.

491
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,400
Is it a demon?

492
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
Yes.

493
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
No.

494
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,400
What does it mean?

495
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Actually, I don't know.

496
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,400
You don't know what you're doing here?

497
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,400
Why are you so anxious?

498
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
Anyway,

499
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
I can help you get rid of it.

500
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
You don't even know what it is.

501
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
How can you get rid of it?

502
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
It's a broken area.

503
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
It's only natural.

504
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
It's not natural.

505
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
What?

506
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
I just want to know if it's delicious.

507
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,400
I don't care if it's a powder.

508
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
That's what it means.

509
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
Right.

510
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
Right.

511
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
In my opinion,

512
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
whether it's a demon or a ghost,

513
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
in my opinion,

514
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,400
it's a group of energy that shouldn't be in this world.

515
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
Since it shouldn't exist,

516
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
I'll help you get rid of it.

517
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Energy?

518
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Master,

519
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
how can this energy kill people?

520
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,400
This person is actually a group of energy.

521
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,400
The reason why he's sick is

522
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,400
because this energy can't last forever.

523
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
This is the heaven.

524
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
If you want to last forever,

525
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
you have to follow the heaven's path.

526
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
You have to follow the heaven's path.

527
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
That's why he's so weak.

528
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,400
How strong is he?

529
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
He's a grandma.

530
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400
I'm a murderer.

531
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,400
I know this kind of martial arts.

532
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
How can he

533
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
harm anyone at this time?

534
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,400
We have to get rid of him.

535
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,400
That's right.

536
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
I'm going to do it tonight.

537
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Fine.

538
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,400
I'll do it tonight.

539
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Master,

540
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
do you still need anything?

541
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
I don't need anything.

542
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
It's just a big attack.

543
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
It's a black hole.

544
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,400
Hurry up and join the Aom Shimp Golden Entertainment Center 94466.

545
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Come.

546
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
No problem.

547
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
It's not a big deal.

548
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,400
But

549
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,400
you need a great man

550
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
to get out of this evil.

551
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Master, you're a great person.

552
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
You're a great killer.

553
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
You're a great man.

554
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
It's your turn.

555
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,400
No.

556
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
This...

557
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
Master,

558
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,400
aren't you a great man?

559
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
He saw me.

560
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
He was afraid of me.

561
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
Then look at me.

562
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
I'm a great man.

563
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,400
I'm a great man.

564
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
No.

565
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
No.

566
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
You're not a great man.

567
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
No.

568
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Are you

569
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
afraid of me?

570
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
I'm afraid.

571
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,400
You're kidding me.

572
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
I've never seen you before.

573
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
I'm not afraid of the sky or the earth.

574
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
I'm afraid of this.

575
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,400
So I said

576
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
you should go out yourself.

577
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,400
Go.

578
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
Bring me the knife.

579
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,400
Yes.

580
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Big.

581
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Big.

582
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Open.

583
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
My family is a disciple of the Buddha.

584
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,400
My father passed me this knife.

585
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,400
The pig I killed,

586
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,400
the rat I killed,

587
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
the person I killed,

588
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
there are two or three ten of them.

589
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
How is it, master?

590
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,400
It's a big deal.

591
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Today, I'll take this knife

592
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
and go to the temple with master.

593
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
I'll give you this.

594
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
I'll give you this.

595
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
I'll help you to kill them.

596
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
Come on.

597
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Oh,

598
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
I need to borrow your study.

599
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
What?

600
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,400
You want master Gu to be the shadow,

601
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Zhao Yawen.

602
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
Is something wrong?

603
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
Don't worry.

604
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
I have my own fault.

605
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
Do you know

606
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
why I let him go with me?

607
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Why?

608
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
I want him to know

609
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
how great this Yawen is.

610
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
The more powerful this Yawen is,

611
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
the more he will be willing to pay for it.

612
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,400
What are you drawing?

613
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,400
I don't know what I'm drawing.

614
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
I'll draw it anyway.

615
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
I'll draw it.

616
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
I'll draw it.

617
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,400
I'll draw it.

618
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Draw it?

619
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
You can draw it?

620
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
You're so mean.

621
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
Last night,

622
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
I really didn't know

623
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
where to put my feet.

624
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Okay, okay.

625
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Don't draw it.

626
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,400
Hurry up.

627
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
We're under master Gu's nose.

628
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
How can we leave?

629
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Don't worry.

630
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
I'll return to the temple tonight.

631
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
I'll go with you.

632
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,400
No matter what,

633
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
it's all my fault.

634
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
If it weren't for my half-head,

635
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
you wouldn't be so smart.

636
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,400
It's a strange thing to encounter with a monster.

637
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
I was so confused.

638
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
I didn't stop you.

639
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
I have my own responsibility.

640
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
I can't let you take risks.

641
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
But that person...

642
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
I really have no ability.

643
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,400
But I have the strength to do it.

644
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
I can't let you take risks.

645
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
I can't let you take risks.

646
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
But that person...

647
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
I have the strength to do it.

648
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,400
I might be able to help you tonight.

649
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,400
This is good.

650
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
If you really want to go with me,

651
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
I'll help you with these two.

652
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Yuya,

653
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
you're such a good girl.

654
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
I know you.

655
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
You're my lucky charm.

656
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Yuya,

657
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
hold that machine.

658
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Yuya,

659
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
hold that machine.

660
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Yuya,

661
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
hold that machine.

662
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
Yuya,

663
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
hold that machine.

664
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
Yuya,

665
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
hold that machine.

666
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Yuya,

667
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
hold that machine.

668
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
Yuya,

669
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
hold that machine.

670
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Yuya,

671
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
hold that machine.

672
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Yuya,

673
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
hold that machine.

674
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
Yuya,

675
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
hold that machine.

676
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Yuya,

677
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
hold that machine.

678
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
Yuya,

679
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
hold that machine.

680
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Yuya,

681
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
hold that machine.

682
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Yuya,

683
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
hold that machine.

684
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Yuya,

685
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
hold that machine.

686
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Hold that machine.

687
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Yuya,

688
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
what are you doing?

689
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
What are you doing?

690
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
What's the big deal?

691
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Come over here.

692
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
By landing.

693
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,880
If you see anything dirty,

694
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,600
use the blood of a dog.

695
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,720
If the blood of a dog is useless,

696
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,040
remove the red rope on the body.

697
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,680
It can also help you to resist for a while.

698
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,560
Master.

699
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,640
What about me?

700
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,120
Master Gu.

701
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,120
The blood of your family

702
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,120
is not for you to go out yourself.

703
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,200
If you go out in the circle,

704
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,600
who will drink the blood?

705
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,480
Could you

706
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,440
be scared by the people Gu?

707
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,400
It's impossible for him.

708
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,480
Jinxiu,

709
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,400
help me.

710
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,480
Master.

711
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,960
Where are you going?

712
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,000
I'll go to shoo him in the face.

713
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,880
Whoever sees me

714
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,160
If you want to get out?

715
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,960
Then I'll send you home.

716
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,720
Alright then.

717
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,840
Be good.

718
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,880
Bye.

719
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,400
ran

720
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,120
ayap

721
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,880
You think you're in front of me then I'm afraid of you

722
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,880
When the magic was first cast, your mother was still in your old belly!

723
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,280
Wu Xin, are you okay?

724
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,280
Are you okay?

725
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,880
I'm fine. Don't worry!

726
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,880
Yue Ya, hurry and go inside!

727
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,880
Yue Ya, help!

728
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,880
No!

729
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,880
You're stupid! Don't kill me!

730
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,880
I'm fine.

731
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,880
You're still saying you're fine? Let me see.

732
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,880
Let me see.

733
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,880
I said I'm fine.

734
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,880
You're right.

735
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,880
He... He fell down.

736
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,880
This is his house.

737
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,880
He's waiting outside. He must be going home.

738
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,880
Then, let's put the alarm on.

739
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,880
It's useless.

740
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,880
I can't hide from him for a few hours.

741
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,880
Why did he run away?

742
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,880
I did it on purpose.

743
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,880
How scary is he to be alone?

744
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,880
The more we fight, the better.

745
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,880
Why are there so many westerners?

746
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,880
No.

747
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,880
Does it hurt?

748
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,880
I'm fine.

749
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,880
I'm fine.

750
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,880
The alive one

751
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,880
The memory of leaving him

752
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,880
The alive one

753
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,880
The alive one

754
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,880
Hello, everyone. I'm Han Dongjue.

755
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,880
I'm a martial arts master.

756
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,880
I'm a martial arts master.

757
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,880
I think he's not human.

758
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,880
Because he's not.

759
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,880
He's a very important person.

760
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,880
But he's been alive for hundreds of years.

761
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,880
Or even thousands of years.

762
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,880
He might have seen too many things.

763
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,880
So he has too many weaknesses.

764
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,880
So even if he encounters some things,

765
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,880
he won't have too many appearances.

766
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,880
He's always looking in the eyes.

767
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,880
And he's always thinking about his heart.

768
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,880
He has a special character.

769
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,880
Like a person who doesn't die.

770
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,880
He's really special.

771
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,880
Because he's a newbie.

772
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,880
He's from a newbie.

773
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,880
They are all people who don't die.

774
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,880
And they are just foreign soldiers.

775
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,880
But they have their own special features.

776
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,880
Yueya.

777
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,880
I think Yueya is a more traditional woman.

778
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,880
She has a special relationship with Wu Xin.

779
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,880
She wants to live with Wu Xin.

780
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,880
She may not be able to eat anything.

781
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,880
But she has a special character.

782
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,880
I usually like to be humble.

783
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,880
I usually don't have a heart.

784
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,880
Or I just have a lot of things to be humble.

785
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,880
But in the crew,

786
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,880
I'm not in a good condition.

787
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,880
I might have some special items.

788
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,880
And some coins.

789
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,880
And some wooden boxes.

790
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,880
And some tools.

791
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,880
And some tools.

792
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,880
I feel like I have this magic with me.

793
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,880
I think I'm a Wu Xin now.

794
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,880
I can see the blood in my eyes.

795
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,880
Yes.

796
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,880
I hope that everyone can see Wu Xin.

797
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,880
I will bring you a different kind of magic.

798
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,880
Thank you.
