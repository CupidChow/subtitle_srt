00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the greenery

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is shining on my face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if it were a universe

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The life is a dream

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The life is a dream

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One day

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You are clear and mysterious

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the background

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are clear and mysterious

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like a background

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You suddenly appeared

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You are clear and mysterious

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Like a background

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You suddenly appeared

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You are clear and mysterious

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Like a background

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You suddenly appeared

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You are clear and mysterious

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Like a background

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You suddenly appeared

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You are clear and mysterious

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Like a background

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You suddenly appeared

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You are clear and mysterious

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm scared

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Then don't look

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Come on, I'll practice

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hurry up, I can't eat lunch this afternoon

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hurry up, I can't eat lunch this afternoon

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Anyway, I've missed so many days

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I can't eat, I can't eat this meal

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You are a few days ago, I didn't cook for you

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I dare not

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You still say you dare not

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You are a little heart

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't even have a heart

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Where is the heart

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You said I was a little heart

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I remember

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I remember the pain and love

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I remember everything

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yu'er

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
As long as you are by my side

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
After I wake up

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I will remember everything

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay, I won't say it

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's go home now

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's go

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What are you doing?

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Come on, run down

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hurry up

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We can go home like this

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let's go

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Come on, you guys

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Come on, you guys

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Come on

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You guys

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You can't even catch a few chickens, right?

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You are still waiting for me to go home

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Hurry up

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You can't catch chickens

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Hurry up

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Stop

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yu'er

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You two are together

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We are good together

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We have a meal together

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Stop it

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Clean up here

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We have a meal together

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We have a meal together

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Hurry up

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You are so selfish

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You are a stubborn dog

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You are so stubborn

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You are so stubborn

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You want to eat well

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You are so stupid

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Get out

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yu'er

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yu'er

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yu'er

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Get out

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't be angry

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Get out

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Get out

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Get out

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Get out

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Get out

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yu'er

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I can't come here next time

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Listen to me

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yu'er

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Get out

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yu'er

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yu'er

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yu'er is so mean

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yu'er

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You are the one who called me

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Stop talking nonsense

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Call my grandma

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Gu Xuanwu often leaves Wenxian

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
to Wu Xin's house

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He doesn't have many people

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You go to Wu Xin's house to guard

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and tell me what you have to do

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What's wrong with you?

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I have a bad tooth

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's all my fault

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I can't let you rest for so long

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I even hide from this bad devil

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I can't even be a doctor

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Don't talk nonsense

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
When you kill Gu Xuanwu

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
you won't eat me

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Keep them at the door

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You two, stay here

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yueya

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Master

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Come

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You are not afraid of Yueya?

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What are you afraid of?

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's easy to deal with the old ladies

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I am a little chicken

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I am happy and happy

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You are not happy?

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You two, drink less

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Master

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Come

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Drink more

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's all

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why do you drink?

151
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This is yangjiu

152
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Good wine

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let me tell you

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
When you and Yu'er were having a fight

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
you were worried about me

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I was worried about you

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Now you are fine

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You are fine

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's nothing

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's just a big show

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Come, drink one

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You are not guilty

163
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
By the way

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Zhang Xianzong hasn't caught you yet

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You didn't do anything

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You are a leader

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You are not guilty

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Are you not afraid of anything?

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What is Zhang Xianzong?

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Liu Xianzong? Li Xianzong?

171
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I have money

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Someone has a gun

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Can I be afraid of him?

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You don't know

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Wenxian is almost like a iron

176
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Zhang Xianzong

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
How dare he come here?

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I will kill him

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Come, drink

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Little Chun

181
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Little Chun

182
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Little Chun

183
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I miss you

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Drink

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Hurry up

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Wake up

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I am not leaving

188
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I am sleeping here

189
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I am sleeping here

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No one can touch me

191
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I am not asking

192
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He can't sleep on my back

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You agree?

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I still disagree

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Little Chun

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's go

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Take your leader back

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Ok

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You guys go

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Listen to me

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We go back

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Stand there

203
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Go

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Where are you going?

205
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Where are you going?

206
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Where are you going?

207
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Go back to the private room

208
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't make trouble

209
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I will stay here

210
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I will stay here

211
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I will stay here

212
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You are sleeping here

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You are not going?

214
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You are not going?

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
How about this?

216
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You two

217
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Send him to the guest room in the west room

218
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The food there is meat

219
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't worry

220
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Come on

221
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Come on

222
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The waiting room is open

223
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The table is also open

224
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I will take him down

225
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Wait

226
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Wait

227
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Come on

228
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Be careful

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You two

230
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You two have a rest

231
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
We will stay with you

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What?

233
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The leader is not going back?

234
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's all muddle-headed

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He is not going back

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I think the leader

237
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
is just here

238
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Okay

239
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You two watch first

240
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I will come to change you later

241
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Commander

242
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Gu Xie Wu's at the house of Wuxin

243
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
He committed a sin

244
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
When he was sleeping there

245
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He was near to him

246
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He committed a sin

247
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes

248
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You stay here

249
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Take care of the girl

250
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't worry about her

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Let her rest well

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yes

254
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,740
Don't usury them!

255
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,480
Wu Xie!

256
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,880
Yue Rang!

257
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,120
Wu Xie! Yue Rang!

258
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,400
Wu Xun, Yue'TS

259
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,520
Wu Xun, you can go

260
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Hurry up!

261
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Come with me!

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Let's go!

263
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Hurry up!

264
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Be careful!

265
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Wu Xin!

266
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Wu Xin!

267
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Wu Xin!

268
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Go!

269
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Wu Xin!

270
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Lv Yang!

271
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Lv Yang!

272
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Wu Xin!

273
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Master!

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
How is it?

275
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Hurry up!

276
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'll carry you!

277
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Hurry up!

278
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Lv Yang!

279
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Hurry up!

280
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Be careful!

281
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Be careful!

282
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm in pain!

283
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Your wife is dead!

284
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Don't talk nonsense!

285
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
After we get the Huenwen County!

286
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
After Huenwen County, you'll be fine!

287
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm not afraid of you anymore!

288
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Wu Xin, are you really that good at singing dog songs?

289
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm fine.

290
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm just afraid that

291
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
after you hit Zhang Xianzong's box,

292
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yuexi Luo Hui will take revenge on you.

293
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
We must be more careful in the future.

294
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You two,

295
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
stop talking nonsense!

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You two are my lucky stars!

297
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
After we get to the Huenwen County,

298
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll make sure that we can eat and drink well!

299
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'll take care of you two!

300
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Besides,

301
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
we finally can live together!

302
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Be careful!

303
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Be careful!

304
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Be careful!

305
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Be careful!

306
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Go!

307
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You all go out.

308
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yes.

309
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Go!

310
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Why didn't you tell me that you're going to kill Gu Xuanwu?

311
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I want to help you.

312
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I want to help you

313
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
to kill them.

314
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Qi Luo,

315
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
men

316
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
should protect the woman they love.

317
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Unfortunately,

318
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm too weak

319
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
for you.

320
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I didn't help you anything.

321
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Now,

322
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm looking for you

323
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
to take care of you.

324
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yuchun!

325
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You can't die.

326
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yuchun!

327
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Qi Luo,

328
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
am I dead?

329
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yes.

330
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Then,

331
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
why?

332
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I left your spirit

333
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
in your body.

334
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Although you still have consciousness,

335
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
but this body is dead.

336
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
To maintain your body,

337
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I have to help you to deal with it.

338
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm going to kill you.

339
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm going to kill you.

340
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Qi Luo,

341
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
am I like the one you have in the future?

342
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No, you're not.

343
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The only thing that matters is a piece of paper.

344
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
There's only one-legged spirit in my body.

345
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm not smart or smart.

346
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm just a puppet.

347
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You're still different from them.

348
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Don't worry.

349
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'll protect your spirit.

350
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
If you can't use this body anymore,

351
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'll find you a new one.

352
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Then,

353
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
you can stay with me forever.

354
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Qi Luo, you're so hardworking.

355
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm not worthy of it.

356
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's not you who's worthy of it.

357
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Do you know why I'm keeping you?

358
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Because I want to give you a chance

359
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
to revenge on yourself.

360
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Li Yueya took away the one I love,

361
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and killed my love.

362
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
He must die.

363
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Let's find a place to rest for a while.

364
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
After we've recovered,

365
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
we'll find another chance.

366
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Qi Luo,

367
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
you're too tired.

368
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'll find something for you.

369
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'll keep it in my body.

370
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Ghost.

371
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Ghost!

372
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Don't come any closer.

373
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Don't.

374
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Don't look for me.

375
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Don't hurt me.

376
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Don't hurt me.

377
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Don't hurt me.

378
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Don't hurt me.

379
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Be careful.

380
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Thank you.

381
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Don't tear the plate.

382
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You two,

383
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
make sure it's stable.

384
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yes.

385
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Be careful up there.

386
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Master,

387
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
thanks to Bai Luoli's help,

388
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
we're safe now.

389
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Or else,

390
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
we'll be in trouble.

391
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Does he know we're here?

392
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Don't worry.

393
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
He'll know.

394
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You said you're in a small room,

395
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
and you have to stay with us.

396
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You're making trouble.

397
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yuan,

398
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
you don't understand.

399
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What's this?

400
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It's called

401
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
the multi-tasking autumn.

402
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
We live together.

403
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's easy to fall and defend.

404
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
What's this?

405
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's called

406
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
the force of a stone.

407
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The force of a horse.

408
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Don't worry.

409
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm strong.

410
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I won't let my master

411
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
get half a gun.

412
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Master.

413
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Chief.

414
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What's the matter?

415
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
We caught Zhang Xianzong.

416
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
He's not a good guy.

417
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Where is he?

418
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I didn't say.

419
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Chief,

420
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
he seems crazy.

421
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Crazy?

422
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's just the beginning.

423
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Let's go.

424
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Let's go.

425
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Go.

426
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Let's go.

427
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Go.

428
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
No.

429
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Don't run.

430
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Open the door.

431
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
No.

432
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
No.

433
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Don't run.

434
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Don't run.

435
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Don't run.

436
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Don't run.

437
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Uncle.

438
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Where's Zhang Xianzong?

439
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Zhang Xianzong...

440
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,800
I'm dead

441
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,880
Get out of here

442
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,560
Don't you dare to hurt me

443
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,480
I'm dead

444
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,680
Get out of here

445
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,200
Get up

446
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,840
Uncle

447
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,160
Where is Zhang Qianzong?

448
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,040
Where is he?

449
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,560
Uncle

450
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,080
Get out

451
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,640
Uncle, get out

452
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:35,920
Brother

453
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,280
fascinating

454
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,360
Yes

455
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,000
How could I say

456
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,200
What's in herles?

457
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,860
If it is in herles

458
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,660
Why did she kill herself?

459
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,580
When Yu Wuyang attacks us

460
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,260
Did you see it clearly when Zhang Jianzong was here?

461
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,540
He was a murderer.

462
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,940
I think he was a murderer.

463
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,940
But it's not that simple to see him.

464
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,140
If he really said so,

465
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,100
I must have done something to Zhang Jianzong.

466
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,540
No.

467
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,620
I have to find a way out.

468
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,620
If I don't find a way out,

469
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,420
that little demon will do something to me.

470
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,220
Captain.

471
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,100
Find Zhang Jianzong and Yuexu to find a way out.

472
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,700
I want to see him.

473
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,260
I want to see him to death.

474
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:51,900
Yes.

475
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:52,860
Hurry.

476
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,580
What are you doing?

477
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,540
You are so noisy.

478
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,060
Is it true?

479
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,940
What are you doing?

480
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,580
What are you doing?

481
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,260
I don't know.

482
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,820
I don't know.

483
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,460
I have a plan.

484
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,140
Look. Look.

485
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,780
Look.

486
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,460
Don't shoot.

487
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,220
You must.

488
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:02,780
Let me go.

489
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,500
Let me go.

490
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,340
Captain.

491
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,260
I can't find him.

492
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,340
Keep looking.

493
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,820
Yes.

494
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,340
Hurry.

495
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:43,360
The

496
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,820
Captain, how's the painting.

497
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,020
I am looking for you.

498
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,980
And now you are here for the Larsen.

499
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,460
I have to make it a reconstruction.

500
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,540
It would take three months.

501
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,060
Three days?

502
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,100
Wu Xin, you know it well.

503
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,580
I have so many things to do here. I have to do it.

504
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,380
I want to go back to the garden.

505
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,980
Three days.

506
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,180
You've been living here for hundreds of years. Can you please be more reasonable?

507
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,980
Nine months.

508
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,180
A half month.

509
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,380
Nine months.

510
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,780
Stop mentioning nine months. I'll tell you nine months.

511
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,980
Three days.

512
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,180
Nine months.

513
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,380
You see, I won't die of nine months.

514
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,780
Okay.

515
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,580
It's really good.

516
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,580
Xiao Sigalous.

517
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,480
Remove the dead one.

518
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,180
Unseemly.

519
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,900
Xiao Sigalous.

520
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,140
Xiao Sigalous..

521
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,740
Xiao Sigalous!

522
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,580
You're taking a bath.

523
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,700
Let me take a bath.

524
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,100
You...

525
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,820
Come on.

526
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,580
Don't change the map.

527
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,340
I'm not taking a bath.

528
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,780
Anyway, I'm going to take a bath today.

529
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,180
I'll take a bath.

530
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,100
No.

531
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,020
Go.

532
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,900
Go.

533
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:23,620
Pour,

534
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,980
the empress dowager yogi killed you in such a way.

535
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,100
I definitely help you punish demon to bug me.

536
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,700
You take a bath first.

537
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,060
Captain, did you catch him?

538
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,340
No.

539
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,260
It's strange.

540
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,540
Why haven't they come out for so long?

541
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,580
Did the wild dog eat the wild dog?

542
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,740
It's possible.

543
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,820
It's possible.

544
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,460
Why didn't you catch him?

545
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,260
The commander sent a telegram.

546
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:13,940
Let me see.

547
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,740
Captain, did you catch him?

548
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,540
No.

549
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,740
Why didn't you catch him?

550
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,740
I didn't catch him.

551
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,740
Why didn't you catch him?

552
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
I didn't catch him.

553
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,740
Why didn't you catch him?

554
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,740
I didn't catch him.

555
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,740
Why didn't you catch him?

556
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,740
I didn't catch him.

557
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,740
Why didn't you catch him?

558
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,740
I didn't catch him.

559
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,740
Why didn't you catch him?

560
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,740
I didn't catch him.

561
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
Why didn't you catch him?

562
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,740
I didn't catch him.

563
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,740
Why didn't you catch him?

564
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
I didn't catch him.

565
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,740
Why didn't you catch him?

566
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,740
I didn't catch him.

567
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,740
Why didn't you catch him?

568
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,740
I didn't catch him.

569
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,740
Why didn't you catch him?

570
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,740
I didn't catch him.

571
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,740
Why didn't you catch him?

572
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,740
I didn't catch him.

573
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,740
It's...

574
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,860
Looks like Chief Ready for fighting.

575
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,740
You are a piece of cake.

576
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,740
You are so modest.

577
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,740
I came here to celebrate for you.

578
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,740
If not for you,

579
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,740
why would I come here?

580
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,740
Yes.

581
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,740
Sir, please.

582
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,740
What's wrong?

583
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,740
Take a look.

584
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,740
Go, take a look.

585
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,740
Son, I'll take you to see.

586
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,740
No.

587
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,740
Let's go.

588
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,740
You are a good boy.

589
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
I didn't see it wrong.

590
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,740
Sir, how about the house?

591
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,740
It's a little old.

592
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,740
Good.

593
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,740
What do you think?

594
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,740
There are Jake.

595
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,740
It's like the skin in it.

596
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,740
In Japanese,

597
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:42,180
it sounds

598
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,940
like a piece of foam.

599
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,660
You've never seen him before.

600
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,100
Why should I see him?

601
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,740
I have a little daughter-in-law

602
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,740
who is a beauty.

603
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,420
Who would like to see her old man?

604
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,100
Disgusting.

605
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,460
Besides,

606
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,540
I still have to learn the technique of the pillow.

607
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,260
When the moon rises and sets,

608
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,660
I can use it to heal him completely.

609
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,580
Fine. I'll do your work.

610
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,540
Okay.

611
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,820
Eat fruits. I want to eat fruits.

612
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,020
What fruits?

613
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,140
You just let him eat fruits.

614
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,100
Little Wu, don't listen to him.

615
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,980
A man and a husband should eat meat.

616
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:25,780
Understand?

617
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:29,940
Here.

618
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,340
Sir, let's have a drink.

619
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,260
When did you come here?

620
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,300
It's all given by others.

621
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:38,980
The boss has left.

622
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,900
Take away all the food.

623
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,460
Today is a great day.

624
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,660
You two should have a drink.

625
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,460
Come, have a drink.

626
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,620
Okay.

627
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,140
Sir, how is it?

628
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,060
Is it good?

629
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,740
Yes.

630
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,820
Dad, I'm sleepy.

631
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,940
I'm not eating.

632
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,380
Good boy.

633
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,660
Drink this bowl of soup.

634
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,580
Dad, I'm really sleepy.

635
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,460
I'm not eating.

636
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,300
What? Are you really sleepy?

637
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,420
Then have a good rest.

638
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,340
Good boy. Go.

639
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,620
Little Wu, take him to sleep.

640
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,380
Come.

641
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,220
Even if I have the ability to be big,

642
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,900
I can't bear to leave this kid alone.

643
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,660
Sir, I'll go to you.

644
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:31,980
The most exciting game on the line is

645
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,380
The horse is running.

646
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,980
The horse is running.

647
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,420
The reward queen,

648
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,220
The treasure golden city,

649
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,260
The rich cat,

650
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,700
The reward captain,

651
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,140
The superior compensation rate,

652
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,140
The reward frequency is higher.

653
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,060
The reward chance is high.

654
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,340
Hurry up and join.

655
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,060
The most exciting game on the line is

656
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,220
You put the music there.

657
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,220
Let's listen to the music while drinking.

658
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,380
It's fun.

659
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,540
Interesting.

660
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,580
Wait for me.

661
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,380
Okay.

662
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,220
Sir, listen to the music.

663
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,420
Oh, toss ball.

664
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,700
incorrigible.

665
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,060
I believe back in the old class that

666
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,620
everyone is leading their faith.

667
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,380
It's lovely.

668
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,380
Very。

669
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,500
Look up,

670
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,700
good afternoon.

671
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,660
Jianli,

672
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,500
IR is over there.

673
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,140
Someone is here.

674
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,100
Who's this?

675
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,300
I have to write a letter.

676
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,300
What is this?

677
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,860
It's a pillow.

678
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,100
I can't write a letter.

679
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,900
I just drew our things.

680
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,220
So when you wake up,

681
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,020
I'll tell you every night.

682
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,020
Maybe you can remember it sooner.

683
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,500
Take them out.

684
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,220
Get away, now.

685
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,220
Take them all off.

686
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,260
Yes, minister.

687
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,940
Do as you see fit.

688
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,820
Oppason the capital.

689
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,900
hiking…

690
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,140
Onezha, Onezha, do you want to go?

691
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,620
Yes

692
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:18,260
Are you

693
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,860
twists the hand

694
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,860
Young Master!

695
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,860
Young Master!

696
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,860
Young Master!

697
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,860
Wu Si!

698
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,860
Young Master!

699
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,860
My son!

700
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,860
Master!

701
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,860
Master!

702
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,860
Master! Open the door!

703
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,860
What's wrong?

704
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,860
The General is in a serious condition.

705
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,860
He's biting the General's mouth and won't let go.

706
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,860
He wants you to go with him.

707
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,860
What's the rush?

708
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,860
You're afraid I can't deal with him?

709
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,860
I have an explanation for Yue'ai.

710
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,860
Li Li, I'm going out.

711
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,860
I'll be right back.

712
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,860
You must protect Yue'ai.

713
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,860
Here.

714
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,860
If you have any questions, run.

715
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,860
I'll ask him to hide behind you.

716
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,860
You're also going to stay in the hospital?

717
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,860
Alright, Master. Don't be so reckless.

718
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,860
Hurry up!

719
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,860
Young Master!

720
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,860
Young Master!

721
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,860
Young Master!

722
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,860
Here comes the hairpin!

723
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,860
Hairpin?

724
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,860
Hairpin?

725
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,860
Young Master!

726
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,860
Young Master!

727
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,860
Young Master!

728
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,860
Hairpin?

729
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,860
Save my son!

730
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,860
Alright.

731
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,860
Let's go.

732
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,860
Son, what's wrong with you?

733
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,860
Don't worry, Young Master.

734
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,860
Young Master is too young.

735
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,860
He may have a fever.

736
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,860
I'll find some soldiers tonight.

737
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,860
I'll go with him.

738
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,860
Tomorrow,

739
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,860
I'll transfer him to Xiangyang's room.

740
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,860
He'll be fine.

741
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,860
I'll definitely get the answer to the hairpin.

742
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,860
I'll do my best.

743
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,860
I won't say anything else.

744
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,860
There must be a trap in the future.

745
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,860
味桃

746
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,860
You two are still reluctant to bare your yaping.

747
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,960
reinstalled,

748
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,320
Let's go out and have a look.

749
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,200
needles.

750
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,940
needles.

751
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,500
Bai Liuli.

752
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,060
You even fell asleep.

753
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,660
What am I afraid of?

754
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,940
I'm scared myself.

755
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,940
Bai Liuli.

756
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,940
Bai Liuli, come out and save me.

757
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,940
Don't come over.

758
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,940
Don't come over.

759
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,940
Save you?

760
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,940
No one is here to save you today.

761
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,940
Zhang Xianzong,

762
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,940
you've got a chance to get out.

763
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,940
Go ahead.

764
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,940
Don't come over.

765
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,940
Don't come over.

766
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,940
Don't come over.

767
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,940
Don't come over.

768
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,940
Don't come over.

769
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,940
Don't come over.

770
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,940
Don't come over.

771
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,940
Zhang Xianzong.

772
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,940
Don't come over.

773
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,940
Don't come over.

774
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,940
Don't come over.

775
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,940
What's wrong with the shark?

776
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,940
He's trying to escape.

777
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,940
Don't come over.

778
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,940
He's trying to escape.

779
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,940
What are you waiting for?

780
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,940
Shoot him.

781
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,940
Shoot him.

782
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,940
Shoot him to death.

783
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,940
Don't come over.

784
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,940
What's wrong with him?

785
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,940
Yue Qilong.

786
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,940
What's wrong?

787
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,940
Don't know.

788
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,940
Yueyang.

789
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,940
Yueyang.

790
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,940
Yueyang.

791
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:02,940
Yueyang.

792
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,940
Wake up.

793
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,940
Go, save me!

794
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,940
Go.

795
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,940
Baylor Mi.

796
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,940
Where's Yueyang?

797
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,220
What do you mean?

798
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:41,900
It is real.

799
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:48,580
Yuyang.

800
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,580
Wu Xinxian.

801
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,500
It'd be great if you could rest in peace.

802
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,500
I can take Zhang Xingzi with me.

803
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,220
I won't beg you to avenge me.

804
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,500
If you can't get over them,

805
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,140
how far will you be?

806
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,860
How far will you be?

807
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,300
Good daughter-in-law,

808
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,300
I know.

809
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,300
Sister,

810
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,500
listen to me.

811
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,900
Stop talking.

812
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,300
I'll find the doctor for you.

813
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,500
I'll find the best doctor for you.

814
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,500
It's useless.

815
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:54,300
You've always been good to me.

816
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,300
If I'm gone,

817
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,300
I'll take good care of him.

818
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,300
Brother, promise me.

819
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,300
I'll give him a thin mouth.

820
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,300
Yu'er.

821
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,300
Yu'er.

822
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,300
Why is it so dark in the room?

823
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,300
It's so dark.

824
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,300
I want to see you again.

825
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,300
I'm here.

826
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,300
I'm here.

827
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:54,300
We've been together for more than a year.

828
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,300
I'm alone with you.

829
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,300
What should I do?

830
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,300
Wu Xie,

831
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:13,300
I haven't had enough with you.

832
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,300
Why are you so stubborn?

833
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,300
I haven't had enough with you.

834
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,300
Why?

835
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,300
I'm not here.

836
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:33,300
You should live well.

837
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:50,300
My brother...

838
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,300
Yuya.

839
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,300
Yuya.

840
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,300
Why did you become a princess?

841
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,300
Yuya.

842
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,300
Why did you become a princess?

843
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,300
Why did you become a princess?

844
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,300
Yuya.

845
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,300
Yuya.

846
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,300
Yuya.

847
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,300
Yuya.

848
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,300
The bridge of time.

849
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:23,300
It's so close to see people love each other.

850
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,300
It's so close to see people love each other.

851
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,300
It's so close to see people love each other.

852
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,300
It's so close to see people love each other.

853
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,300
I remember that she left her memory.

854
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,300
I remember that she left her memory.

855
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,300
She left her memory.

856
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,300
She lived her life.

857
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,300
She left her memory.

858
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,300
She lived her life.

859
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,300
She lived her life.

860
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,300
I want to revenge.

861
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,300
The moon is on the top of the pillar.

862
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,300
I can't control my body.

863
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,300
Wu Xin's body will never die.

864
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,300
I'll take it and give it to you.

865
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,300
I want you to show me your body.

866
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,300
Wu Xin.

867
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,300
Wu Xin.

868
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,300
Let's go to hell.
