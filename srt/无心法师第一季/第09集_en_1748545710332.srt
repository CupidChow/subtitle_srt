The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the greenery

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is shining on my face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if it were a universe

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The life is a dream

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The life is a dream

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One day

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You are clear and mysterious

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the background

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are clear and mysterious

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like a background

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You are clear and mysterious

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Like a background

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You are clear and mysterious

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Like a background

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The Love by 花花

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Mom!

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Mom!

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Mom!

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Mom!

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why is there no one?

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Run!

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Run!

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Run!

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What's wrong? Why are you fighting?

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't be afraid. Let's hide and talk.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Brother, what happened here?

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The company's men are fighting.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The company's men?

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Don't you know?

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The soldiers are in the army. Who is in charge?

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Si Liu.

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Say it.

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I still haven't found the company's men.

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
My men are useless.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What's wrong?

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
upon addition

52
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The Y Chickeneness Center 994466 calm

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You seem to be a bit brave

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Keep going. Such an fragrant person must be stacks시다

55
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,600
Sher

56
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
Sher

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,900
The

58
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,200
Big

59
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:38,840
bie

60
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,240
Don't be afraid

61
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Spare me

62
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,480
What's wrong with him?

63
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
Why can't you ask him?

64
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,680
What's the problem?

65
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,720
Don't worry about the problem.

66
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,520
The famous actress knows that

67
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
you are not good at her.

68
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,080
If you don't mention her,

69
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,920
we won't ask her.

70
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,600
You can see it.

71
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,600
What?

72
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
I'm blind.

73
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,080
Why do you listen to me?

74
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,600
I'm doing this for your good.

75
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,800
I should do it for you.

76
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,960
Commander.

77
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,800
Master.

78
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,120
Master is back.

79
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,800
Master, let's go to eat.

80
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,400
Have a seat, Master.

81
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,960
Today's kitchen is your favorite.

82
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,800
Have a seat.

83
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,040
Master, have some wine.

84
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
Master, come and eat.

85
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,680
Did Miss Yue eat?

86
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:03,960
Yes.

87
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Miss Yue is always in the room.

88
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,480
We don't know what she's doing.

89
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,160
Go to the kitchen.

90
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,400
Let her cook something to eat.

91
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,640
Send her to the room.

92
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:16,960
This...

93
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,560
Now.

94
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,400
Okay.

95
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,520
Master.

96
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,640
I'll send some delicious food

97
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,440
to Miss Yue.

98
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,040
Master, why do you need this?

99
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,400
You just took the wild duck.

100
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,400
In the future,

101
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,080
we'll eat a table of food.

102
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,800
We'll send it to you.

103
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,640
This family

104
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,120
can't be called by you.

105
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,000
Zhu'er, send my food to the room.

106
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,760
Yes.

107
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,840
My Bernadette,

108
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,040
Good!

109
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,800
Thank you so much, Miss Yue.

110
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,800
Miss Yue.

111
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,280
Miss Yue.

112
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,720
Miss Yue.

113
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,360
Master made me

114
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,920
give you some food.

115
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,000
Strange.

116
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:15,720
Even death has its

117
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,720
own predicting sheet.

118
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,320
Never accelerate!

119
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,300
You're just leaving

120
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,380
Just pretending

121
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,400
Forget it

122
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,180
Wu Xie

123
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,160
Is it you?

124
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,500
If you Stomp out

125
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,840
I'llHAp you to perception

126
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,640
Maybe I cannot be like this anymore

127
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,040
Just go

128
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,120
Right

129
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,220
She's just a habit

130
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,860
Nobody was a burden for you.

131
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:36,660
I will push you further and you will still make it on your own.

132
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,180
Are you cold?

133
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,100
I am chill.

134
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,220
Go!

135
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,220
Go!

136
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,220
Go!

137
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,220
Go!

138
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,220
Go!

139
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,220
Go!

140
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,220
Go!

141
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,220
Go!

142
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,220
Yu'an, are you okay?

143
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,220
I'm fine.

144
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,220
Wait for me here.

145
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,220
Wu Xie!

146
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,220
Yuan Qilong, what do you want?

147
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,220
What's wrong?

148
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,220
They keep looking at you.

149
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,220
Can't I come and see you?

150
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,220
How do I know you're looking at me?

151
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,220
You're not even able to live with your heart.

152
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,220
I thought the world was the most special place

153
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,220
for me to be alone.

154
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,220
So you're even more attractive.

155
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,220
Tell me, what exactly are you?

156
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,220
Do you want to know?

157
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,220
Come here.

158
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,220
I'll tell you.

159
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,220
Actually, I am...

160
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,220
You can't beat me.

161
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,220
If you have anything, you can come to me.

162
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,220
Don't hurt Yu'an.

163
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,220
He's not willing to be with you.

164
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,220
Why are you pestering him?

165
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,220
I'm not pestering him.

166
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,220
He's pestering you.

167
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,220
He's just a coward.

168
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,220
How can he be with you?

169
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,220
I'm helping you.

170
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,220
It's none of your business.

171
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,220
I don't care about his business.

172
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,220
But is it your business?

173
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,220
I'm sure of it.

174
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,220
Ever since I've been in this beautiful area,

175
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,220
I've always wanted to experience the love of a man and a woman.

176
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,220
But I've never found the right person to choose from.

177
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,220
Ever since that time, you saved me from the police.

178
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,220
I...

179
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,220
Amitabha.

180
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,220
Even if Yu'an is not here,

181
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,220
I won't like you as a monster.

182
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,220
I'm a monster?

183
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,220
Then you're a monster.

184
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,220
We're a team of heaven and hell.

185
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,220
You're so pretty.

186
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,220
You saved me.

187
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,220
I can't find the right person to choose from.

188
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,220
I think you're too surprised to have a bad brain.

189
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,220
No matter how I tell you,

190
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,220
I won't like you.

191
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,220
Who do you like?

192
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
Yueya?

193
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,220
I think you're the one who's got the problem.

194
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,220
I don't like a pretty lady like me.

195
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,220
I have to like a rude and filial girl.

196
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,220
Actually,

197
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,220
I like a rude and filial girl.

198
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,220
You're rich.

199
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,220
You're a lowly girl.

200
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,220
I'm rich.

201
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,220
I'm a lowly girl.

202
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,220
What's wrong?

203
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,220
Fine.

204
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,220
I'll cut off the meat and meat on Yueya's body.

205
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,220
I'll take them all to feed the wild dogs.

206
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,220
Then I'll leave the bones and the price.

207
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,220
You don't like him?

208
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,220
I don't want to hear your nonsense.

209
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,220
I warn you.

210
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,220
I warn you again.

211
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,220
If you dare to approach Yueya again,

212
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,220
I'll...

213
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,220
What do you want?

214
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,220
You want to kill me?

215
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,220
Then let's see if you're capable of doing this.

216
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,220
Yue Qilong!

217
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,220
Mr. Yun.

218
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,220
Practicing his magic j09

219
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,220
Yueya!

220
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,220
Stop the beating!

221
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,060
Stop fighting.

222
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,380
Stop fighting.

223
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,260
I, Master Gu.

224
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,380
Master Gu.

225
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,340
Why are you here?

226
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,620
What's wrong with your face?

227
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,820
What's wrong with my face?

228
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,580
I'm afraid that I'll be recognized by others.

229
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,100
I'll be taken by the Wen County.

230
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,140
Right.

231
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,820
I forgot.

232
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,860
What? You forgot?

233
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,900
I'm always thinking about you.

234
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,540
Can you think about me?

235
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,620
Can you add some more?

236
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,500
There's one more thing that's more meaningful than you.

237
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,020
It's the bastard who's acting like a bastard.

238
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,540
Why are you scolding him?

239
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,860
He's a traitor.

240
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,500
How can I treat him?

241
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,340
I'm a thief.

242
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,780
How can he treat me?

243
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,540
I'm teaching him with my heart.

244
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,340
How can he teach me?

245
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,220
I'm living in Gu Xiaowu's house.

246
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,740
It's like a street-trip.

247
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,580
East and west.

248
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,300
West and east.

249
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,740
Who am I?

250
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,340
I'm Master Gu.

251
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,660
Is this the day that Master Gu lives?

252
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,820
I just came out today.

253
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,380
Where's Master?

254
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,020
He's caught a monster.

255
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,140
Monster?

256
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,540
Do you have food?

257
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,800
plataforma

258
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,840
Miss Yue.

259
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,540
Did you sleep well?

260
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,820
I'm going to sleep.

261
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,820
I gave you food when I was late.

262
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,780
I heard you weren't here.

263
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,860
It's okay.

264
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,340
I feel a little uncomfortable.

265
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,620
I went out to get some medicine.

266
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,940
Do you want to see a doctor?

267
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,020
No, thanks.

268
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,100
Pass it.

269
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,660
You should put it somewhere.

270
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,780
I will recognize it here.

271
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:19,940
Enough.

272
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,700
You have become bold, donuts.

273
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,900
Don't know what beautiful soup he ate.

274
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,420
You are still쿡ing him.

275
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,100
Go and listen carefully.

276
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,860
doesn't move a Ramen.

277
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,980
No matter where he goes.

278
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,340
He's telling me all the details.

279
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,180
Yes sir.

280
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,580
Yuji Luo.

281
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,380
No, thank you.

282
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,540
Xiaohu.

283
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,820
Don't worry.

284
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,440
I'll...

285
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,700
I'll send the letter for you.

286
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
Why didn't you come in?

287
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,700
What are you doing outside the door?

288
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,700
I'm hurt.

289
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,700
You're hurt?

290
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,700
Let me see.

291
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,700
Don't come over.

292
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,700
What are you doing?

293
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
You're hurt, don't let me see you.

294
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
You want to kill me, right?

295
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,700
Don't be afraid.

296
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,700
What am I afraid of?

297
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,700
You want to get into my head?

298
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,700
Where's my head?

299
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Yuanyang.

300
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,700
Yuanyang.

301
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,700
Yuanyang.

302
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,700
Yuanyang.

303
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,700
Didn't I see it wrong?

304
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,700
No, no, no.

305
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
How can my head be half a block?

306
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,700
Yuanyang.

307
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Don't be afraid.

308
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,700
Even if I'm a ghost,

309
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
I won't hurt you.

310
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
I just got killed

311
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,700
by Yue Qiluo

312
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,700
by the fire.

313
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
But don't worry.

314
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,700
I won't be hurt.

315
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,700
But don't worry.

316
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
I won't be hurt.

317
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,700
I'll be like

318
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,700
the mother of the original.

319
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,700
There's someone else.

320
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,700
The one who was shot by the bullet.

321
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,700
He's still alive.

322
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,700
I'm afraid of...

323
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,700
I'm afraid of...

324
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,700
I'm afraid of...

325
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,700
I remember it.

326
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,700
No wonder

327
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,700
this dress is so familiar.

328
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,700
It was the person

329
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,700
who was shot by me

330
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,700
that night.

331
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,700
What?

332
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,700
You don't know.

333
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,700
It was a wild animal.

334
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,700
It must have broken down.

335
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,700
It must be a ghost

336
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,700
if he's not dead.

337
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,700
Ghost.

338
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,700
Yuanyang.

339
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,700
Listen to me.

340
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,700
Yuanyang, don't come over.

341
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,700
You...

342
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
You're a ghost.

343
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,700
Yuanyang.

344
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,700
Don't worry.

345
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,700
I'll go back

346
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,700
and find out.

347
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,700
If he's really dead

348
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,700
or alive,

349
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,700
I'll kill him.

350
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,700
Anyway,

351
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,700
I'll take care of

352
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,700
you.

353
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,700
I don't need you.

354
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,700
I'll ask him myself.

355
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,700
I'll kill him.

356
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Wu Xin.

357
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
I want you to tell me the truth.

358
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,700
What are you?

359
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
I...

360
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,700
I don't know

361
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
what this is.

362
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,700
I don't know

363
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,700
where I came from.

364
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,700
I only know

365
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
I've lived in this world for a long time.

366
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,700
I look like a person,

367
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,700
but I can't be a person.

368
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,700
Because I don't have a heart.

369
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,700
I won't be old.

370
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,700
I won't die.

371
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,700
I'll grow up

372
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,700
if I die.

373
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,700
I won't live long.

374
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,700
I'll grow

375
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,700
like I used to.

376
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,700
And...

377
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,700
And...

378
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,700
I can't have a child.

379
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,700
I know.

380
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,700
I know you want to have a son.

381
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,700
When you bought the bamboo in the golden shop,

382
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,700
you said

383
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,700
you want to give the bamboo to your daughter

384
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,700
and grandson.

385
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,700
I know

386
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,700
I...

387
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,700
But I...

388
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,700
You are

389
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,700
the old lady of the long life.

390
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,700
Yu.

391
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,700
Yu.

392
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,700
Don't go.

393
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,700
Yu.

394
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,700
Forget it.

395
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,700
Don't be afraid.

396
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,700
I know I'm a monster.

397
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,700
You're afraid of me.

398
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
I'll leave.

399
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
Where are you going?

400
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,700
I'm going to the market.

401
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,700
I'll buy you some food.

402
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,700
I'll cook you some noodles.

403
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,700
Why are you lying to me?

404
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,700
I'm so stupid.

405
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,700
I don't even know

406
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,700
you're stupid.

407
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,700
What?

408
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,700
Marry her?

409
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,700
Wait.

410
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,700
Aren't you siblings?

411
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,700
You're too much.

412
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,700
Shut up.

413
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,700
I see.

414
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,700
She can't have a child.

415
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,700
She can't have a child.

416
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,700
Is this a lie?

417
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,700
You two are siblings.

418
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,700
You're a liar.

419
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,700
No.

420
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,700
Yueya.

421
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,700
You have to listen to me.

422
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,700
Although you're not old,

423
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
you can grow up.

424
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,700
But

425
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,700
if you grow up,

426
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,700
you'll be a monster.

427
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,700
You can't live with monsters for the rest of your life.

428
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,700
Yue, you...

429
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Wu Xin.

430
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,700
Wu Xin.

431
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,700
Wu Xin.

432
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,700
I'm here.

433
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,700
Wu Xin.

434
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,700
Are you there?

435
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,700
Yes.

436
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,700
Yueya.

437
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,700
If you don't like me

438
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,700
and hate me,

439
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,700
I'll leave now.

440
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
I'll cook you some noodles.

441
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,700
Eat some.

442
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,700
I'll eat some.

443
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,700
I'll eat some.

444
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,700
I'll eat some.

445
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,700
Yueya.

446
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
I'm sorry.

447
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,700
Yueya.

448
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,700
I'm sorry.

449
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,700
If that's not enough,

450
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,700
I'll make you one more bowl.

451
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,700
I'll make you one more bowl.

452
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,700
I'll make you one more bowl.

453
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,700
Yueya.

454
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,700
Don't say anything.

455
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,700
Last night,

456
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,700
I thought about it for a while.

457
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
I finally understand now.

458
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,700
I'm sorry.

459
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,700
I'm sorry.

460
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,700
I'm sorry.

461
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,700
I'm sorry.

462
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,700
I'm sorry.

463
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,700
I'm sorry.

464
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,700
I'm sorry.

465
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,700
No matter what you are,

466
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,700
even now,

467
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,700
you're here to save me.

468
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,700
So,

469
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,700
I'll take care of you

470
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,700
for a day or three,

471
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,700
just like before.

472
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,700
Yueya.

473
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,700
Yueya.

474
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Yueya.

475
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,700
Yueya.

476
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,700
Yueya.

477
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,700
Yueya.

478
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,700
Yueya.

479
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,700
Yueya.

480
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,700
Yueya, you're trying to kidnap me?

481
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,700
There are three big people in the yard.

482
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,420
I think I'm not going to be killed by him.

483
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,020
I'm going to be killed by the door.

484
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,700
Wait, Yun.

485
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,380
Tell me something.

486
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,540
How about this?

487
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,220
I'll tell you a joke.

488
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,020
There were two brothers.

489
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,340
One was called Xi Xi.

490
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,700
The other was called Ha Ha Ha.

491
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,060
One day,

492
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,900
Ha Ha Ha's brother died.

493
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,980
Xi Xi went to the tomb to see Ha Ha Ha.

494
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,980
Guess what Xi Xi said first?

495
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,980
Why did you die?

496
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,020
Wait, Yue.

497
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,100
Don't blame me for being ugly.

498
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,340
If the half face of the master can grow back,

499
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,860
it's okay.

500
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,020
If the half face doesn't grow back,

501
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,300
you'll have to find a way out.

502
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,940
I'll feed the master.

503
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,380
You go and do it.

504
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,420
Take it.

505
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,100
Master.

506
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,860
You're not old anymore.

507
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,060
You're still hungry?

508
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,140
You're not young yet.

509
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,660
You know how to throw a face.

510
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,620
You have half of your face left.

511
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,700
Why are you throwing it?

512
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,940
Save it.

513
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,500
I'll go and feed the master.

514
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,220
I'll go and feed the master.

515
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,820
I'll go and feed the master.

516
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,500
I'll go and feed the master.

517
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,900
I'll go and feed the master.

518
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,140
You...

519
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,260

What do you mean?

571
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,220
Last night, he ran out to meet the Buddha.

572
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,220
He must have wanted to kill Zhu'er.

573
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,220
So he killed two people and killed two people!

00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,220
Master!

578
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,220
Shut up!

579
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,220
Master!

580
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,220
The Buddha

581
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,220
It's you.

582
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,220
What's the matter?

583
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,220
Where did you go last night?

584
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,220
I'm not feeling well these days.

585
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,220
I went to buy some medicine yesterday.

586
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,220
Have you seen Zhu'er?

587
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,220
Zhu'er?

588
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,220
Who is Zhu'er?

589
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,220
Take care of yourself.

590
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,220
Take care of yourself.

591
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,220
Master, what did he say?

592
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,220
He is a bitch.

593
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,220
If you don't talk to him,

594
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,220
he won't tell the truth.

595
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,220
Enough!

596
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,220
Master!

597
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,220
You don't have to find out.

598
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,220
I'll return the money to Miss Yue.

599
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,220
Master, take care.

600
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,220
You don't have to come here personally.

601
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,220
You can ask the servants to do it.

602
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,220
You are too quick-witted.

603
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,220
You are not good at color.

604
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,220
I'll buy you some new ones.

605
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,220
Okay.

606
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,220
It's all yours.

607
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,220
Pick whatever you want.

608
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,220
You can buy whatever you like.

609
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,220
You are so beautiful.

610
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,220
Miss Yue, this one looks good.

611
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,220
There are more than ten of them.

612
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,220
This one is much better than the old one.

613
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,220
Why are you waiting?

614
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,220
What's the matter with her?

615
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,220
She is so big.

616
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,220
I heard she is a new son.

617
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,220
No wonder she is so good-looking.

618
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,220
Master, take care.

619
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,220
Don't be so mean.

620
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,220
Come on.

621
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,220
Get out of the way.

622
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,220
Don't be so sad.

623
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,220
I'm not sad either.

624
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,220
I'm not in the mood to live.

625
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,220
I went to Wen County.

626
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,220
If you are so lucky,

627
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,220
just go to the front and say it.

628
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,220
Go to your mother!

629
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,220
What are you doing?

630
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,220
It's obviously Zhang Xianzong and Jiang Choubao.

631
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,220
Why are you doing this to me?

632
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,220
Guess who I met in Wen County

633
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,220
with Zhang Xianzong.

634
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,220
Who did you meet?

635
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,220
What does it have to do with me?

636
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,220
Yue Qiruo.

637
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,220
Who?

638
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,220
He is Zhang Xianzong's wife.

639
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,220
Yue Qiruo.

640
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,220
Yue.

641
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,220
I'm not looking for you.

642
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,220
I'm the one you are looking for.

643
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,220
Fine.

644
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,220
Let's just do it together.

645
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,220
I miss you so much.

646
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,220
Suddenly...

647
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,220
What is he?

648
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,220
He is a man.

649
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,220
He is a man.

650
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,220
I'm sorry.

651
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,220
But I'm too lazy to deal with him.

652
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,220
You are a man.

653
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,220
You think you are helping me?

654
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,220
You are just trying to lower my status.

655
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,220
I'll see you get up.

656
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,220
Get out.

657
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,220
Send him away.

658
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,220
I'll get you out of here.

659
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,220
Don't fight.

660
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,220
Don't fight.

661
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,220
Don't fight.

662
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,220
Let's go.

663
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,220
Let's go.

664
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,220
Let's go.

665
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:37,220
The wind carries her on the longest journey.

666
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:45,220
I've been following the evening sun, but it hasn't stopped.

667
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:53,220
I've been using this warm starlight, and I've heard the words in the night.

668
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:59,220
I'm wandering around, but I still remember the hometown.

669
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:06,220
Life is a legend, and time is a corner.

670
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:14,220
She's watching people, love and hate.

671
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:22,220
Even if time passes, she forgets the past.

672
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:29,220
She's leaving her memories and repeating their lives.

673
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:36,220
Life is a legend, and time is a corner.

674
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:44,220
She's watching people, love and hate.

675
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:50,220
Even if time passes, she forgets the past.

676
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:58,220
She's leaving her memories and repeating their lives.

677
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:09,220
She's leaving her memories and repeating their lives.

678
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,220
Episode 1

679
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,220
Master, this is the Chuchu Mountain.

680
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:29,220
I have three gold coins.

681
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,220
They're hidden in the Chuchu Mountain.

682
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:34,220
If you help me find the gold, I'll help you kill the man.

683
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,220
I don't know how this guy came here.

684
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:42,220
But I found out that I've buried him in the warehouse.

685
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,220
Come on.

686
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,220
Go.

687
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,220
Shoot.
