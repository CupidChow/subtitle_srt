00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the greenery

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is shining on my face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if it were a universe

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The life is a dream

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The life is a dream

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One day

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You are clear and mysterious

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the background

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are clear and mysterious

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like a background

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You are clear and mysterious

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Like a background

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The Day by 花花

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The Love by 花花

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Wu Xin

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Wu Xin

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yu Yan

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,760
I...

34
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,280
I...

35
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,480
Are you still afraid of me?

36
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm not afraid of you.

37
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,480
I'm angry.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yueya.

39
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
I'm angry.

41
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,560
Because you lied to me.

42
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,640
If you're sincere to me,

43
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,920
you shouldn't have kept your true identity from me.

44
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
Actually...

45
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,800
Actually, I'm afraid you can't accept it.

46
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
Remember.

47
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,920
Since I've hurt you,

48
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,480
I won't change my mind.

49
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,040
But you're a fool.

50
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,960
I won't stop you

51
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,200
from becoming a fool.

52
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,200
Yueya, I'm not good.

53
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,880
It's all my fault.

54
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,520
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,240
It's okay.

56
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,840
It's okay.

57
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,880
Don't keep it from me anymore.

58
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
Do you hear me?

59
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,920
Another화라�廿我

60
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,480
To reward the poor,

61
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,480
to pay more,

62
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,480
to join the Aomeng Fairy Pujing Entertainment Center 94466.

63
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
Come.

64
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
You

65
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
are doing this for my daughter.

66
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
I

67
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,480
am doing this for the world.

68
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
I am doing this to avenge my father.

69
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,480
I am doing this for the world.

70
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
I am doing this for the world.

71
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,480
I am doing this for the world.

72
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,480
I am doing this for the world.

73
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,480
I am doing this for the world.

74
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,480
I am doing this for the world.

75
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,480
I am doing this for the world.

76
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,480
I am doing this for the world.

77
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,480
I am doing this for the world.

78
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,480
I am doing this for the world.

79
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
I am doing this for the world.

80
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,480
I am doing this for the world.

81
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
I am doing this for the world.

82
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
I am doing this for the world.

83
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,480
I am doing this for the world.

84
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
I am doing this for the world.

85
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,480
Come.

86
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Come.

87
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
I am eating.

88
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Here you are, Yueyan.

89
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Master.

90
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
Come, master.

91
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Let's have a drink today.

92
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
Cheers.

93
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,480
After one drink.

94
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,480
Let's have a meal.

95
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
He is a head of the head.

96
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
You should be his.

97
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
How about this?

98
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
I will drink first.

99
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
You can drink it.

100
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Yueyan took care of you for half a month.

101
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
You can eat and drink.

102
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
You can drink and drink.

103
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,480
When will you leave?

104
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Master.

105
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,480
You are so smart.

106
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,480
You are so smart.

107
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Look at your eyes.

108
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
You are so smart.

109
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,480
You are so smart.

110
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Master.

111
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Actually, I came here this time.

112
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,480
I want to discuss something with you.

113
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
Yueyan.

114
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
You are so smart.

115
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Can you make a few dishes?

116
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
Go.

117
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Let's make some dishes.

118
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
Go.

119
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
I have money, master.

120
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
No.

121
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Then?

122
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Then I have to go to Dongshan.

123
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,480
I have to pay for the soldiers.

124
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
I have to pay for the transportation.

125
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
I can't do anything without money.

126
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Then?

127
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
Then.

128
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Then I have to take the money.

129
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Then you go.

130
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
I won't give it to you.

131
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Can I do it alone?

132
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
If I can do it alone,

133
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
I will beg you here.

134
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,480
I will teach you a lesson.

135
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,480
I have three golds.

136
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Master.

137
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
No.

138
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,480
When I was digging in the woods last year,

139
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
I found three golds.

140
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
I hid them in the mountain.

141
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,480
If you dare to dig with me,

142
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
I will not lose you.

143
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
How about it?

144
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
Don't blame me for being disobedient.

145
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,480
You are a devil.

146
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,480
What else can you do?

147
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,480
You only think about yourself.

148
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
You are old.

149
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,480
You have to think about Yueya.

150
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,480
After you think about Yueya,

151
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
can you give them some money?

152
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Right?

153
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,480
You have to tell me.

154
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,480
A general is a great achievement.

155
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,480
I am not a general yet.

156
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
I can't play.

157
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,480
I can't play, but I can't go.

158
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Master.

159
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Listen to me.

160
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
I don't care what you are.

161
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
If this is done,

162
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,480
I will not be able to save your wealth.

163
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Don't be mad.

164
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,480
We can't live without you.

165
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
No.

166
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Yueya.

167
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,480
You have misunderstood me.

168
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,480
Who can't go with money?

169
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Listen to me.

170
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Don't play with your mom.

171
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
She is just recovered.

172
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,480
Don't let her go out.

173
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Don't think about it.

174
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
Here.

175
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
I want to help you.

176
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Someone is not allowed to go.

177
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
Master, can you go out?

178
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,480
We are old men.

179
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
We can't put Hua Yuquan

180
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
in this old woman's body.

181
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,480
You said I am a eunuch.

182
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Master.

183
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,480
You are not fighting with me.

184
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Listen to me.

185
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
I don't trust anyone.

186
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
I trust you.

187
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
I?

188
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,480
Except the god of makeup,

189
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
I can't do anything else.

190
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
I have to talk to him.

191
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,480
You have to go.

192
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,480
If you don't, you have to go.

193
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,480
My head is just recovered.

194
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
I can't stand it.

195
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,480
The wind blows.

196
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
It's weird.

197
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
It hurts.

198
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,480
You are threatening me, right?

199
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Okay.

200
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,480
I will stay here today.

201
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,480
I will tell you.

202
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
When will you come with me?

203
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,480
When will I leave?

204
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
When will I break your legs?

205
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
When will I leave?

206
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
I will stay here.

207
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,480
I will stay here.

208
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
I will stay here.

209
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
Why are you so shameless?

210
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,480
As an successful eunuch,

211
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,480
I have a saying.

212
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,480
You have to be shameless.

213
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,480
I have never seen you so shameless.

214
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,480
Master, I beg you.

215
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
Just go with me.

216
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
I am telling you.

217
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,480
If you go back to Wen County with me,

218
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,480
it's not just about gold.

219
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
What?

220
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,480
If you help me get the gold back,

221
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,480
I will help you kill Yue Qiluo.

222
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,480
If you are the only one to fight,

223
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,480
you are not his opponent.

224
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
But Zhang Xianzong and Yue Qiluo

225
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,480
are the same.

226
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,480
I have to kill him.

227
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
If you help me,

228
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
I will kill Yue Qiluo

229
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,480
with a knife.

230
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,480
What do you think?

231
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,480
I agree.

232
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
Okay.

233
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
I agree.

234
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
I agree.

235
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,480
I will go with you tomorrow.

236
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
I will buy you some food.

237
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
Wait.

238
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Yue Qiluo,

239
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
bring two British dishes.

240
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
It's not enough.

241
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Hurry up.

242
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
You agree?

243
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
You are a master of the island.

244
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
You are not a master of the island?

245
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
The people in the village

246
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,480
are always chasing after the wildflowers.

247
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
It's not like that.

248
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
They are all dangerous.

249
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
You have to go to the toilet.

250
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
You are still angry?

251
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
I am.

252
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,480
You are still angry?

253
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
Here.

254
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
Actually,

255
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
I have my own idea.

256
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
The first thing is

257
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
after we help him,

258
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
we will be close to him.

259
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
We will live our own life.

260
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
The second thing is

261
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,480
we will live long and rich life.

262
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
We can't live with money.

263
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,480
Do you agree?

264
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
I don't care.

265
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,480
I have to go with you.

266
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,480
The island is so tired.

267
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
I want you to stay at home.

268
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,480
I am not afraid of being tired.

269
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,480
I am afraid that

270
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
you will come back.

271
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,480
You are not afraid of being a master of the island.

272
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
Okay.

273
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
I agree.

274
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
You go to the island with us.

275
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Go.

276
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,480
It's so strange.

277
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,480
I can grow up by myself.

278
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
Gu Xuanwu?

279
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,480
I want to be with you in the East.

280
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,480
I can do it without money.

281
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
I have three gold coins.

282
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,480
I hide them.

283
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
I hide them in the mountain.

284
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
If you help me find the gold,

285
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
I will kill you.

286
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,480
Master.

287
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
This is the mountain.

288
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Give me the knife.

289
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
Go.

290
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,480
Go.

291
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,480
Go.

292
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
Master Gu.

293
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480
What?

294
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,480
You didn't take the road.

295
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,480
I haven't arrived yet.

296
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
Don't worry.

297
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,480
I tell you.

298
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,480
I know the road.

299
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
I have been running here since I was a kid.

300
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
I tell you.

301
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,480
I close my eyes.

302
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,480
I can find the house.

303
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
Go.

304
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Go.

305
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
Master.

306
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
Come.

307
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
Yueyang.

308
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
Master.

309
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
What's wrong?

310
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
Nothing.

311
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,480
You haven't arrived yet.

312
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
I hide things.

313
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Can you hide them?

314
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
The more I hide, the safer I am.

315
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,480
You can't even find the safe.

316
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,480
Do you think it's safe?

317
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
I think it's safe.

318
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Do you think

319
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,480
it's not safe here?

320
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
Master.

321
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Why are you so suspicious?

322
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
I remember.

323
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,480
You are the old eunuch.

324
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
Listen.

325
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Why is the forest so quiet?

326
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,480
The sound of the birds chirping just now

327
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
didn't stop.

328
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
Why are you so desperate now?

329
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Master.

330
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Don't be so suspicious.

331
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
You will arrive soon.

332
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
Find the gold.

333
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
Let's go home and sleep.

334
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
Go.

335
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,480
Be careful.

336
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,480
This is a very steep mountain.

337
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
I am telling you.

338
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,480
But

339
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,480
you can't find the map with this.

340
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,480
I will tell you this.

341
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
This is a pervert.

342
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
It's not a single wood.

343
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
If you don't have the power to make a map,

344
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,480
you can't even dig a wood.

345
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
We are here.

346
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
We are here.

347
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
We are here.

348
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
We are here.

349
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
We are here.

350
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
We are here.

351
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
We are here.

352
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
We are here.

353
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
We are here.

354
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
We are here.

355
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
We are here.

356
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,480
Master.

357
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
We are here.

358
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
How is it?

359
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,480
You are so generous.

360
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,480
You can find a map with whatever you want.

361
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
You will get the gold.

362
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
I am not that stupid.

363
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
How can I get the gold with whatever I want?

364
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,480
Master.

365
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
Give me a hand.

366
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
Master.

367
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
I don't know how this cave came from.

368
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
But after I found it,

369
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
I took it as a treasure.

370
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
I said

371
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
there won't be any snake in this cave.

372
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,480
It's impossible.

373
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,480
If there is a snake,

374
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,480
I will skin it

375
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,480
and make a bag for Sister Yuan.

376
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,480
I don't want it.

377
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,480
All right.

378
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
I will go to the head-up first.

379
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
Just in case.

380
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
You can leave the cave

381
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,480
and let Yueya go.

382
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,480
It's safe.

383
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
All right.

384
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
Take care.

385
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Yueya.

386
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,480
Why are you still here?

387
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
You dare not to go down?

388
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,480
Go down first.

389
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
I will take you down.

390
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Come on, Yueya.

391
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Jump down.

392
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,480
I will take you down.

393
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,480
Sister.

394
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,480
You look so strong.

395
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,480
I didn't expect you to be so gentle.

396
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
Go.

397
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
Hurry up.

398
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Or you will be in a hurry.

399
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,480
Go with your brother.

400
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Sister.

401
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
Look at your little hand.

402
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,480
It's white, tender and smooth.

403
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,480
There are so many mosquitoes in this cave.

404
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Don't be in a hurry.

405
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
Hurry up.

406
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,480
There are a few mosquitoes.

407
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
Sister, hurry up.

408
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
I said, Mr. Gu.

409
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,480
There will be wild beasts in this cave.

410
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
But they are the old snakes in the forest.

411
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
I see the traces on the rock.

412
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
They are not like the people.

413
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,480
What's wrong with the master?

414
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
Why are you so strong?

415
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
What's wrong with you?

416
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,480
I will be fat later.

417
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
Sister.

418
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
You have to be careful.

419
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
What if you marry a soft-hearted man?

420
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Who said soft-hearted man?

421
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,480
What are you doing?

422
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Gui Zi.

423
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
You...

424
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
You should hold your hands first.

425
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,480
I will go and talk to your master.

426
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
I will be back soon.

427
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Master, mother.

428
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,480
Master.

429
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Save me.

430
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
What are you doing?

431
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Master.

432
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
Save me.

433
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Master.

434
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
Save me.

435
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Master.

436
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
Hurry up.

437
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
Go back to the cave.

438
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,480
Hurry up.

439
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
This way.

440
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
Hurry up.

441
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Mother.

442
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
Someone is closing the cave.

443
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
Hurry up.

444
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,480
What's that?

445
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,480
Sister, hold it for me.

446
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
Yes.

447
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Hurry up.

448
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
There is something in the cave.

449
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
Push it again.

450
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
Hurry up.

451
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
Hurry up.

452
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
Hurry up.

453
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Brother.

454
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Hurry up.

455
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
Sister.

456
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,480
Hurry up.

457
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
Let's go.

458
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
Hurry up.

459
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
Brother.

460
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
Hurry up.

461
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Hurry up.

462
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
Hurry up!

463
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
Hurry up!

464
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Master Gong, give me your hand!

465
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
Don't run away. Hurry up!

466
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
Master, I'm already tired of this.

467
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Hurry up! Master is here!

468
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,480
Hurry up!

469
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Hurry up!

470
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,480
What's wrong?

471
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
This guy...

472
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
Didn't you just pass by?

473
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
He...

474
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
What are you doing?

475
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,480
Why are you waiting for death? Hurry up!

476
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
Let's go.

477
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
Why are you back again?

478
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,480
Are you back from the ghost?

479
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,480
This is not a ghost.

480
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,480
This is the ghost town on the street.

481
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,480
We've been fighting in the ghost town.

482
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,480
Good.

483
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,480
You stinky girl.

484
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
You're in a team with me, right?

485
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
Good.

486
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,480
I'm going to be your partner today.

487
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,480
I'll eat you up when you come out.

488
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,480
Hurry up!

489
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,480
Give me the light!

490
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,480
What's wrong with you?

491
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,480
You...

492
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
Come with me.

493
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,480
I'll kill you if you come here.

494
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,480
I'll kill you if you come here.

495
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,480
Master, hurry up!

496
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,480
I can't hold it any longer.

497
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,480
Come on!

498
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,480
I'm coming!

499
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
Hurry up!

500
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,480
Master, go to the fire brigade.

501
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,480
If the fire brigade is not destroyed, they won't come here.

502
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,480
Yueyang, take this.

503
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,480
If the fire brigade comes here,

504
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,480
we'll have to fight them in the flesh.

505
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
Don't worry. I have the strength.

506
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
Besides, I have the tiger's horn.

507
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480
Master, I'm asking you.

508
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,480
Did you just drop the gun when you killed the guy?

509
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
Let go of me!

510
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
I won't do it again!

511
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
How did you know that?

512
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,480
Even when we were on the mountain,

513
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
he was so scared that he fell down.

514
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
You took my risk, but you still took Yueyang's risk.

515
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
I'm telling you.

516
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,480
The three-spin sword doesn't matter to you.

517
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,480
To me, it's my life!

518
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
I'm telling you.

519
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
I won't think that three-spin sword

520
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,480
will be in the blood of the Yangtian Sword!

521
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
Enough!

522
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,480
You're fighting again.

523
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
I have to find a way!

524
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,480
He's from your building!

525
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,480
Let him get out of here!

526
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Fine.

527
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
I'll think of a way.

528
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,480
This way.

529
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,480
I'll go to the fire brigade.

530
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
I'll go to the fire brigade.

531
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
I'll go to the fire brigade.

532
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
I'll think of a way.

533
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,480
Isn't this little demon

534
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
coming out to the fire brigade at night?

535
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,480
I'll stay here and wait!

536
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,480
I'll see if you dare to come out in the daytime!

537
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
You're so stupid.

538
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,480
What is this way?

539
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,480
Say something.

540
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
If you don't say anything,

541
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
I'll go to you.

542
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,480
Fine.

543
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,480
Don't be too mean.

544
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,480
Don't be like him.

545
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
I know

546
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
that you're worried about me.

547
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
Hey!

548
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,480
Are you blind?

549
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
Your master is in the field.

550
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
You can't catch a cold.

551
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Why don't you give him your clothes?

552
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
You two love each other, right?

553
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
You don't take me as a person, right?

554
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
Give it to me!

555
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,480
Who can help me?

556
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
Who can?

557
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
Yes!

558
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Are you fine?

559
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
I know where Gu Xuan Wu is.

560
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
How do you know?

561
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
Who told you that?

562
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
She's in Zhutou Mountain.

563
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
If you don't believe me,

564
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Then I'll just pretend I didn't say anything.

565
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Wait.

566
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
I believe you.

567
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
Little bitch.

568
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,480
Master, don't sleep. Wake up.

569
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
It's dawn. Get up.

570
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
Wake up.

571
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
Why are you still sleeping?

572
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
It's dawn. The hostage is gone.

573
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,480
I'm running away.

574
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
You think it's great?

575
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,480
Why are there so many things in this house?

576
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
I told her that the weather is bright.

577
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
I told her to extinguish the fire.

578
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
She didn't extinguish it.

579
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
She said you were the one who made it.

580
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,480
You can really do your own thing.

581
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
You're heartless and heartless.

582
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
These four weeks are monsters.

583
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
You can sleep well.

584
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,480
It's already three days. You're not up yet.

585
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
If you're not up, I'll have to go to the tea house.

586
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
No need.

587
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,480
Anyway, the old man doesn't need clothes.

588
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
He doesn't need pants.

589
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
Take it off.

590
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,480
Burn it.

591
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,480
No, that's not good.

592
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Master, you have to get up.

593
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Get up. Get up.

594
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
It's dawn. Don't sleep.

595
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,480
Get up.

596
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,480
We have to get out of the cave.

597
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,480
Take out the gold bars.

598
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
Yu Yan and I didn't sleep at all.

599
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,480
You said you were sleeping all the time.

600
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,480
You don't care about me.

601
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,480
You can't care about Yu Yan.

602
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
That's right. You're right.

603
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
Go home now.

604
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
Let Yu Yan rest.

605
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
Come on. Let's go.

606
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,480
It's so colorful.

607
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Wait.

608
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
Give me the knife.

609
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
Give me the knife.

610
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,480
Master.

611
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,480
It's so high.

612
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
It's really high.

613
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Give me the pen.

614
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,480
The first letter is a good one.

615
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
I'll get going now.

616
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
Let's go.

617
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
I'll go.

618
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
Let's go.

619
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,480
Yu Yan.

620
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Is this the head of the pig?

621
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Yes.

622
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,480
Get up.

623
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
Let's go.

624
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
You're here.

625
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,480
How is it?

626
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
This is where I hide my gold.

627
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
Come on.

628
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,480
The reward is more and more.

629
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
You can get more rewards.

630
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
Come on.

631
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,480
Come on.

632
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,480
Look.

633
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
Master Gu.

634
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
The box looks cheap.

635
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,480
Of course.

636
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,480
It's so expensive.

637
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,480
I tell you.

638
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,480
The money is in the bank.

639
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,480
It's all for the emperor.

640
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
Come on.

641
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
How is it?

642
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,480
Master, come on.

643
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Yu Yan.

644
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,480
Yu Yan, what are you wearing?

645
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
This is good.

646
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Come on.

647
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Master.

648
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
Wu Xie.

649
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,480
Zhang Xie.

650
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
Long time no see.

651
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Commander.

652
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,480
I'll go to you.

653
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,480
You're a useless bastard.

654
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
But I still take you as my brother.

655
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,480
Do you have a problem with your head?

656
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,480
Do you have any brothers in Luan Chi?

657
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,480
You've told me that you're the king of the city.

658
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Guards.

659
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Yes.

660
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,480
Take him down.

661
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
Yes.

662
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,480
Yes.

663
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
Fire.

664
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
Run.

665
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,480
Yu Yan, run.

666
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,480
Yu Yan.

667
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
Yu Yan, hurry up.

668
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Don't let go of my hand.

669
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
Yu Yan.

670
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,480
Yu Yan.

671
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,480
Hold on tight.

672
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,480
Don't let go of my hand.

673
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,480
Hold on tight.

674
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
Yu Yan.

675
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Go.

676
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,480
My gold medal.

677
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,480
My gold medal.

678
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,480
Don't talk.

679
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
Go.

680
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,480
Who are you?

681
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,480
Don't move.

682
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,480
Yu Yan, give me your hand.

683
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,480
Master.

684
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,480
Master, what are you doing?

685
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
Don't move.

686
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
I'm going to kill you.

687
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,480
Go.

688
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,480
Go.

689
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
Master.

690
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Master.

691
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
Hurry up.

692
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,480
Hurry up.

693
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,480
Wait.

694
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
Isn't this the place just now?

695
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
How did this get into the hole?

696
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,480
I really underestimated the moon.

697
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,480
Remember the rose-dried plum tree yesterday?

698
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,480
Yes.

699
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
I remember.

700
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
I remember.

701
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,480
I remember.

702
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
I remember.

703
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
I really underestimated the moon.

704
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,480
Remember the rose-dried plum tree yesterday?

705
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
What should we do?

706
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
We can't just wait here and die.

707
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
What's wrong?

708
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,480
I can see the dead's power

709
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,480
after the dead is dead.

710
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
But now,

711
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
I can't see anything.

712
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
What time is it now?

713
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,480
There's still time to study this.

714
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,480
Then...

715
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,480
You didn't die when you didn't see it.

716
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
But if I didn't die,

717
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,480
where did the blood come from?

718
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Zhang Xian Cong's soldiers

719
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
didn't come out at all.

720
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,480
They were all blown up.

721
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,480
They were all taken away.

722
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
I'm afraid that

723
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,480
they will be killed.

724
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
I'm afraid that

725
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
they will be killed.

726
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,480
I'm afraid that

727
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,480
the dead's power

728
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,480
will be destroyed.

729
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,480
They didn't even have

730
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
any bones left.

731
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,480
But...

732
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,480
If they didn't die,

733
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,480
they wouldn't have died.

734
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,480
This isn't the moon's high-level ghost.

735
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,480
It's fine without it.

736
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
What is the truth

737
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,480
in this cave?

738
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,480
I thought it was a ghost.

739
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,480
You still want to die?

740
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,480
You should think of a way.

741
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,480
I don't have a way.

742
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,480
If I had a way,

743
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,480
I would have died long ago.

744
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,480
I have a way.

745
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,480
But I don't know

746
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,480
whether it's useful or not.

747
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
You tell me.

748
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
Okay.

749
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
Our hometown said that

750
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
it's hard to meet a ghost.

751
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,480
It's good to be a fool.

752
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,480
Bird?

753
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
I didn't drink water

754
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,480
from yesterday to now.

755
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,480
Where did you get the bird?

756
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,480
You get the bird.

757
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,480
I didn't get it either.

758
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
Yu Han.

759
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
A stray cat.

760
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,480
No.

761
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,480
I've been in the ghost's house for a long time.

762
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,480
I don't have a heart to play with stray cats.

763
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,480
Except for a stray cat,

764
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,480
there is another way.

765
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,480
It's to walk on the road.

766
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
The more you walk, the better.

767
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,480
I heard that you can find a way.

768
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,480
You are the ugliest.

769
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Okay.

770
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,480
I'll scold them.

771
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,480
Who is the ghost?

772
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
I can't scold him.

773
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
Let's go.

774
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,480
Zhang Xianzong, you bastard.

775
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,480
I'll kill you if you get the bird.

776
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,480
I'll kill you.

777
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,480
It's really useful.

778
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,480
I'll kill you.

779
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,480
I'll kill you.

780
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,480
I'll kill you.

781
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,480
I'll kill you.

782
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
I'll kill you.

783
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
I'll kill you.

784
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,480
I'll kill you.

785
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,480
You always thought that

786
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
I was a coward.

787
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,480
You probably even realized

788
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:10,480
Endure me.

789
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,480
Here.

790
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,480
Drink some water.

791
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,480
Hey,

792
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,480
show me your wound.

793
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,680
I'm sorry.

794
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,800
My brother is finally back.

795
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,080
My dirty face is almost like a cat.

796
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,280
Let me tell you.

797
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,720
You two

798
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,480
really have to thank me.

799
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,320
How about I come back?

800
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,280
Yes, yes.

801
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,600
Thank you, sir.

802
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,200
You two take a shower.

803
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,360
You look dirty.

804
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,360
I'll boil water for you

805
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,400
and make some food.

806
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,280
No.

807
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,360
I'll drink some more.

808
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,320
No.

809
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,240
Yue Jinluo is not out for a day.

810
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,080
We won't have a peaceful day.

811
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,040
What?

812
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,400
By the way, Yueya.

813
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,000
Show me your Huangfu.

814
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,300
You...

815
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,800
You made this.

816
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,840
But from Qingyuan.

817
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,880
You is a Buddha.

818
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,120
And You gave me an——

819
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:57,920
The truth...

820
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,440
is a very strange requirement.

821
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,920
ico

822
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,100
Yue, follow me

823
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,660
where are you going?

824
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,520
hey, lady

825
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,240
wake up

826
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,460
no, its because of some sleep

827
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,800
sleep?

828
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,300
what are you doing

829
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,960
take care of things

830
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,000
go

831
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,960
don't mess with me

832
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,400
I'm tired of you.

833
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,120
My dear,

834
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,120
Yue Qiluo knows where my home is.

835
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,800
He may come to me anytime.

836
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,240
We need to pack up.

837
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,880
It's a safe place.

838
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,120
Where?

839
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,520
Qingyun Temple.

840
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,840
The wind carries her on the longest journey.

841
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,320
I've been following the evening sun,

842
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,680
but it hasn't stopped.

843
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,800
I've been using the warm starlight

844
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,640
to ask the flowers in the night.

845
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,240
I've been wandering around,

846
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,360
but I still remember the hometown.

847
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,680
I live my life in a opposite.

848
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,500
Every moment has passed.

849
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,140
Yet they're Graphic,

850
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,020
Both love and hate are gone.

851
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,480
It's as if time flew by.

852
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,520
I've not forgotten,

853
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,880
most of them,

854
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,080
her memory has gone.

855
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:59,660
I breath again,

856
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:07,660
What is the turning point of life?

857
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:14,660
He is watching people love each other and hate each other

858
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:20,660
Although time passes by, although he has forgotten

859
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:26,660
I remember he left his memories and repeated them

860
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:29,660
The alive one

861
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:35,660
After leaving his memories, he repeated them

862
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:40,660
The alive one

863
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,660
Episode 1

864
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,660
He is the leader of the famous Qingming Temple

865
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,660
Greetings, Lord of the Sect

866
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:05,660
The demon that the current leader of this talisman is in trouble

867
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,660
The Qingming Temple is on the top

868
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,660
Why is a little girl your uncle's group?

869
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:15,660
My Taishi group is clever and determined to break the law

870
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,660
But his talent is not in the right way

871
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,660
The Qingming Temple is a secret witch's evil sect

872
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:25,660
It should be my uncle's group

873
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:29,660
The words of the demon that the current leader of this talisman is not in the right way
