00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Love by 花花

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
花花

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
花花

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my arms

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In your eyes

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where is the spring breeze and the spring breeze

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where is the greenery

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moonlight is shining on my face

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The lake is full of the lake

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Two people's life

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The whole night is bright

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After so many years

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As if it were a universe

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The corner of the wall

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let us hold hands

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This life is a dream

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This world is greedy

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The life is a dream

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The life is a dream

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One day

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You suddenly appeared

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You are clear and mysterious

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the background

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are clear and mysterious

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like a background

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
One day

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You suddenly appeared

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You are clear and mysterious

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Like a background

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You suddenly appeared

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You suddenly appeared

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You suddenly appeared

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You suddenly appeared

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You are clear and mysterious

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Like a background

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You suddenly appeared

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You are clear and mysterious

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Like a background

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're clear and mysterious

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Like a background

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You're clear and mysterious

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Like a background

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,320
I won't believe it!

44
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,080
Don't be angry.

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,080
You are dead.

46
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,320
You are still alive.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,680
Do it.

48
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,680
Why are you doing this to me?

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,480
Let me go!

50
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,040
Let me go!

51
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,480
Help!

52
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,560
Let me go!

53
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
Let me go!

54
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,560
Why are you doing this to me?

55
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,000
Let me go!

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,720
Let me go!

57
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,320
Get in the room!

58
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,000
Go!

59
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,440
Let me go!

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,720
Let me go!

61
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,000
Let me go!

62
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,440
Let me go!

63
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
You may leave now.

64
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,240
You two just stay.

65
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,680
Da Qing, where are you going to go?

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,760
The place is too small.

67
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,360
I can't afford to go.

68
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,280
I'm going to the heaven to hit the horse.

69
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,360
Say more books.

70
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,120
Meet more people.

71
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,400
Have a good time.

72
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,800
Haocheng.

73
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,120
Girl.

74
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,120
The green mountains are not changing.

75
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,120
The road is long and the water is flowing.

76
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,520
We will meet again in the garden.

77
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,080
Please.

78
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,080
Let's go, master.

79
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:23,400
Please give in.

80
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,400
I'm leaving.

81
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,680
You can light a temple.

82
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,200
Don't give up.

83
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,520
Uncle!

84
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,680
Is this the house?

85
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,960
Come on, let's go.

86
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,760
Uncle!

87
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,640
Excuse me, Mr. Su moved away.

88
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,160
Yes.

89
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,680
The old man and the wife were in a hurry to go to Tianjin.

90
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,640
So they asked me to take this house out of the house.

91
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,680
Tianjin?

92
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,200
Yes.

93
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,280
Uncle!

94
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,520
Uncle!

95
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
It's Tianjin again.

96
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,200
What a coincidence.

97
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,840
Take it.

98
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,640
Uncle!

99
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,200
Here you are.

100
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,600
Thanks.

101
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,560
How nice this is.

102
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,360
Bye.

103
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,400
Your food is at home.

104
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,240
Thank you, you got it.

105
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,800
Goodbye.

106
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:22,920
Goodbye.

107
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,240
Goodbye.

108
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:38,040
Major,

109
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,580
I would love them to pit me to death,

110
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,940
Give in.

111
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,860
Slap and cap.

112
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,620
Change clothes.

113
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,820
What?

114
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,780
Go shopping with me.

115
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,580
Ok.

116
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,580
This is good.

117
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,780
Which one is good?

118
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,580
Both are good.

119
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,580
I like which one to buy.

120
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,980
How about we have money?

121
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,980
How about I tie this up for you?

122
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,980
If you have money, you can burn it.

123
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,580
You are so lucky.

124
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,980
I tell you, I have money.

125
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,980
No one wants to buy it.

126
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,580
Yueyue,

127
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,180
I'll buy you some rouge.

128
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,380
What's so good about it?

129
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,580
I don't know.

130
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,580
I'll go.

131
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,180
Wait for me.

132
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,660
takie

133
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,380
I want you be like how you used to be.

134
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,780
Go to hell for me.

135
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,380
What are you doing?

136
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,380
What's going on?

137
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,340
Waiting for you.

138
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,820
Yueyue!

139
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,580
Which way is it?

140
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,180
Yueyue.

141
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,180
Old Gu.

142
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,020
Old Gu is better.

143
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,260
Young Mistress.

144
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:37,940
Young Mistress.

145
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,580
Miss, you can't sleep. It's getting late.

146
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,220
Get up.

147
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
Come.

148
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
Where am I?

149
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,580
Miss, what's wrong?

150
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,460
Miss?

151
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,260
What?

152
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,140
Miss, you're so confused.

153
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,540
You're Yue Qiluo.

154
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,340
You're Yue Qiluo.

155
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,740
Yue Qiluo.

156
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,180
Wipe your face.

157
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,700
Wake up.

158
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,700
We're going out.

159
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,380
We're going to see Miss's third wife.

160
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,780
Third wife?

161
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,700
You're Yue Qiluo.

162
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,740
Your lover is Duan Sanlang.

163
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,700
Duan Sanlang?

164
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,980
Miss, what are you thinking?

165
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,980
Let's go.

166
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,020
Let's go.

167
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,260
Yes.

168
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,420
Can't we wait for her?

169
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,580
I'll help you to get dressed.

170
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,420
Which one do you want to wear?

171
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,580
Sanlang.

172
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,220
Get dressed.

173
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,020
Yue.

174
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,220
Wake up.

175
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,020
I'm your brother.

176
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,820
Miss.

177
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,620
Yue.

178
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,620
Miss, wake up.

179
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,300
I'm your brother.

180
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,380
What's going on?

181
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,620
He can't wake up.

182
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,100
I don't know.

183
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,820
I talked to him last night.

184
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,060
After we got dressed,

185
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,900
he turned into this.

186
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,220
Don't scare me.

187
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,620
Yue.

188
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,020
Miss.

189
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,620
Commander.

190
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,700
Commander.

191
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,740
What's wrong?

192
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,540
Report to commander.

193
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,220
The doctor is here.

194
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:34,700
Hurry.

195
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,380
Get the doctor here.

196
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,380
Yes.

197
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,420
Doctor.

198
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,140
Hurry.

199
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,700
Look how I can't wake up.

200
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,940
Doctor.

201
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,820
Commander.

202
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,940
What's wrong with my sister?

203
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,660
She's not sick.

204
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,460
What do you mean?

205
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,700
She's just sleeping.

206
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,100
If you dare to play tricks here,

207
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,220
I'll shoot you.

208
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,980
Commander.

209
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,740
Calm down.

210
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,940
How can I dare?

211
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,700
She's really sleeping.

212
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,700
Kill you.

213
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,900
I'm rough.

214
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,380
Hot.

215
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,500
Do you really think

216
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,420
your effort is nothing?

217
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,740
You're so good.

218
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,860
Don't be scared.

219
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,860
I'm OK.

220
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,740
Doctor.

221
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,940
Never come back for too long.

222
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,620
Take care.

223
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,980
It's a small gift.

224
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,240
Marry me.

225
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,600
What are you doing?

226
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,600
You are...

227
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,940
My lady,

228
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,360
you are all in the pure jazz.

229
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,100
Why haven't you woken up?

230
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,980
Take the lamp and take a look.

231
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,980
Look carefully.

232
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,980
Xilu, did you see clearly?

233
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,980
What?

234
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,980
How can I have money?

235
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,980
Or I'll take all the charcoal.

236
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,980
Who am I?

237
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,980
Xilu, look.

238
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,980
Look, it's so beautiful over there.

239
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,980
Look over there.

240
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,980
Xilu, look.

241
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,980
Xilu, look.

242
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,980
He is a third-in-law.

243
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,980
Your favorite third-in-law.

244
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,980
Your third-in-law.

245
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,980
You are...

246
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,980
a third-in-law.

247
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,980
Go, go, go. Get out of here.

248
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,980
He is the first-in-law of the WeChat.

249
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,980
Stop making fun of me.

250
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,980
I'll see you later.

251
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,980
Get out of here.

252
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,980
Master,

253
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,980
why don't you

254
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,980
ask Dr. Yang for me?

255
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,980
I'm talking to you.

256
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,980
Answer me.

257
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,980
What are you doing?

258
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,980
I know you two are close,

259
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,980
but you can't just

260
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,980
forget about time.

261
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,980
Hurry up, Miss.

262
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,980
We've been out for too long.

263
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,980
Master, this is...

264
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,980
What are you looking at?

265
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,980
Say something.

266
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,980
Hurry up.

267
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,980
We've been out for too long.

268
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,980
Miss, what's wrong?

269
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,980
Take a rest over there.

270
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,980
Have a rest.

271
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,980
Miss, what's wrong?

272
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,980
Are you headache or headache?

273
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,980
Don't scare me.

274
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,980
I'm fine.

275
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,980
Miss, what's wrong?

276
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,980
Are you headache or headache?

277
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,980
Don't scare me.

278
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,980
Miss,

279
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,980
no.

280
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,980
Miss,

281
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,980
no.

282
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,980
Miss,

283
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,980
no.

284
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,980
Miss,

285
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,980
no.

286
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,980
Miss,

287
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,980
no.

288
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,980
Miss,

289
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,980
no.

290
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,980
Miss,

291
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,980
no.

292
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,980
Miss,

293
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,980
no.

294
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,980
No.

295
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,980
It's not right to marry.

296
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,980
Yu Yan.

297
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,980
Yu Yan.

298
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,980
Yu Yan.

299
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
Miss,

300
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980
what's wrong?

301
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,980
Are you headache or headache?

302
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,980
Don't scare me.

303
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
Miss.

304
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,980
I'm fine.

305
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,980
I just had a heart attack.

306
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,980
Miss,

307
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,980
what's wrong with you today?

308
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,980
I'm fine.

309
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,980
Maybe I'm too tired recently.

310
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
Let's continue.

311
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,980
Come on.

312
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,980
Come on.

313
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,980
Miss.

314
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,980
Miss,

315
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,980
no.

316
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,980
Hurry up.

317
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,980
What's up?

318
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,980
She is vãoing.

319
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,980
What's up again?

320
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,980
Miss,

321
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,500
please forgive me

322
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,580
for taking my father to prison of uploads yesterday.

323
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,980
Big Vega,

324
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,980
can you please please forgive me for today?

325
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,980
I'm OK.

326
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,980
I don't want my father to be implement for nothing.

327
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,980
Miss,

328
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,560
if you give to Miss,

329
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,760
would you like to?

330
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,000
Go away if you feel sleepy,

331
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,360
and don't return home.

332
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,120
A maid who's abandoned

333
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,320
herInns is gone.

334
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,960
What about

335
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,760
the Red Alright, if you ask us to effortlessly

336
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,200
to live in thetu .

337
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,500
My poor tip,

338
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,180
have you ever told yourself

339
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,260
nothing,

340
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,040
today you can't just

341
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,700
wash this bitch'llbud off.

342
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,740
Just see

343
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,200
if you can get out the door.

344
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,880
Don't hit him.

345
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,920
Don't hit him.

346
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,040
What are you doing?

347
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
Don't hit him.

348
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,760
It's not his fault.

349
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,840
I wanted to steal it myself.

350
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,160
What did you say?

351
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Father.

352
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
Mother.

353
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
I have something to tell you.

354
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
I have a lover.

355
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,200
I ran away to see him.

356
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

357
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
I just...

358
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
I just didn't want to.

359
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Father.

360
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Mother.

361
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
We are sincere.

362
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Please help us.

363
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Why?

364
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
I am a unfilial daughter.

365
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
God.

366
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Who is that?

367
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
The one who broke the family.

368
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Who?

369
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
The one who broke the family?

370
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
The one who broke the family?

371
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
The one who broke the family?

372
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
You are even with his son?

373
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
I don't want to see you.

374
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
The one who broke the family is a good man.

375
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Father.

376
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Our family has nothing to do with the school.

377
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
You know I won't agree to this.

378
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
You are not a fool who can't protect the wrongs.

379
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
You even gave him a birthday party.

380
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
You are not filial.

381
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
You are just a big man.

382
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Fine.

383
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Since you are so shameless,

384
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
don't make us lose our family.

385
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Master.

386
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Close him up.

387
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
Yes.

388
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
No one can let me out without my order.

389
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Father.

390
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Please help us.

391
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Father.

392
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Mother.

393
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
Please help us.

394
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Father.

395
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Please help us.

396
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Please help us.

397
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Answer me.

398
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
I will kill you.

399
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Please help us.

400
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
What is this?

401
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
You can't touch him.

402
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
I don't know.

403
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,200
But I am afraid that the cat will hurt Yueya.

404
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
What should we do?

405
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Let's let him sleep here.

406
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
It's not a matter.

407
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,200
I think this has something to do with Yue Qiluo.

408
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Who?

409
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Yue Qiluo.

410
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,200
Yue Qiluo?

411
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
That person is in the police station.

412
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Yue Qiluo...

413
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Master.

414
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Yue Qiluo was locked up in the coffin.

415
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
She was buried in the police station?

416
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
She has been out for a while.

417
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
And...

418
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
She was still in the room for a night.

419
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,200
I didn't know her origin was from the mountain.

420
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
So I didn't know her origin.

421
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,200
I just drove her away.

422
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
I was afraid that you would be scared.

423
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
So I didn't tell you.

424
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
When Yueya was on the street,

425
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
I saw her in the crowd.

426
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
She was looking at me.

427
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
And she was smiling at me.

428
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,200
I knew it.

429
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,200
I should have taken a bag and made her go crazy.

430
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,200
Master, why are you so stupid?

431
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
She has been in the police for 180 years.

432
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
She has been out for a long time.

433
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
She is not a monster.

434
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Tell me.

435
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
What's her secret?

436
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Look at her.

437
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
I'll tell you my experience.

438
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
What's her secret?

439
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
She is a strong and strong woman.

440
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
She is a strong woman.

441
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
She has nothing to do with the mountain.

442
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
I'll go find her.

443
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Ask her clearly.

444
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
Where are you going?

445
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
You should be more careful.

446
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Go with me.

447
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Find her as soon as possible.

448
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
Okay.

449
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
A girl of 16 or 17 years old.

450
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
She is not tall.

451
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
She looks young.

452
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
She has a big and white eye.

453
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
She is pretty.

454
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
But she is a little bit timid.

455
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
She is very attractive.

456
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
She can recognize her by her eyes.

457
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
You go there.

458
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Stand up.

459
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
What are they doing?

460
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Go.

461
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
I'll go with you.

462
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Go.

463
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Go.

464
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Go.

465
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Go.

466
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Zili.

467
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,200
Did you find him?

468
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
Not yet.

469
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Go on.

470
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Yes.

471
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
Why hasn't he found her?

472
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
That's right.

473
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
What are you doing?

474
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,200
Go to her house and find her!

475
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
That is my house!

476
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,200
It's not her house!

477
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
It's not her house!

478
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
You guys, over there!

479
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Yes!

480
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
You guys, follow me!

481
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Shiyu, follow me!

482
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Yes!

483
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
Shiyu, follow me!

484
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Shiyu, follow me!

485
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
Miss!

486
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Li Jiuan, are you okay?

487
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
That's great!

488
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

489
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
What do you mean?

490
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

491
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Thank you, thank you!

492
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
Why?

493
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
When I was angry with you,

494
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
I only had one breath left.

495
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
I was thrown into the house and died.

496
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
You saved me, Miss.

497
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,200
You thought I was the one who saved you?

498
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
You were so lucky to come here.

499
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
You didn't have to be angry with me anymore.

500
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
Look at my new body.

501
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
It's very good.

502
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
You don't have to worry about it.

503
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
Help me find a new one.

504
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
What do you mean?

505
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Miss, what's wrong with you?

506
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
You're so stupid.

507
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
I haven't eaten for days.

508
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
You didn't eat what others gave you.

509
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,200
I gave you two at least.

510
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
I don't know if you're worried about me.

511
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
What's wrong?

512
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
Nothing.

513
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
Did something happen to you?

514
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Nothing.

515
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Tell me.

516
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
What's wrong with you?

517
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,200
Miss.

518
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
Tell me.

519
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Tell me.

520
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Tell me.

521
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,200
Tell me.

522
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Tell me.

523
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Master.

524
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,200
He sent someone to take Mr. Duan into his mansion.

525
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
He beat him up.

526
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,200
Then he went to the room.

527
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,200
What?

528
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
When did this happen?

529
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
Yesterday.

530
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
How is he now?

531
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
Not good.

532
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,200
Miss, what are you doing?

533
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
I have to see him.

534
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
I have to see him.

535
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Someone is in the room.

536
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
You can't get out.

537
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
And if Master and Madam find out,

538
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
they'll punish you.

539
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,200
What should we do?

540
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Third Master.

541
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Miss, don't worry.

542
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
I have a way.

543
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,200
Get out of here.

544
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Get out.

545
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Don't you hear me?

546
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Get out of here.

547
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
I don't want to see you.

548
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Get out of here.

549
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
Get out.

550
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Get out.

551
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Get out.

552
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
Get out of here.

553
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Do you hear me?

554
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Get out.

555
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,200
I don't want to see you.

556
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Get out.

557
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Get out of here.

558
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Get out.

559
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
Get out.

560
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
Third Master.

561
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
Third Master.

562
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Third Master.

563
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Qi Luo.

564
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Qi Luo.

565
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Third Master.

566
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
Qi Luo.

567
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
It's all my fault.

568
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
I'm sorry.

569
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
No.

570
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Qi Luo.

571
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
There is a place where you are.

572
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
No matter how hard it is,

573
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
I can bear it.

574
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Third Master.

575
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Let's go.

576
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Where are we going?

577
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
We're going to Si Ben.

578
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
Since this family doesn't admit you,

579
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
I don't want this family anymore.

580
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Okay.

581
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Okay.

582
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Qi Luo.

583
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
Let's go.

584
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
Don't move.

585
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
Stand up.

586
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Don't let me.

587
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Don't move.

588
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Stand up.

589
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Don't kill me!

590
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
Don't kill me!

591
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
You brat!

592
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
Stop talking nonsense!

593
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
I'll stand up!

594
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
You brat!

595
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
You're still trying to kill me

596
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
in my house?

597
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
I didn't expect that your weapon is quite heavy.

598
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
How could you do that to me?

599
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:30,200
The most exciting game on the line is

600
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Ma Jiang Hu Le, Ma Jiang Hu Le 2,

601
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,200

00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,200

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
The Queen of the Rage,

604
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
The Queen of the Rage,

605
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
The Queen of the Rage,

606
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
The Queen of the Rage,

607
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,200
The Queen of the Rage,

608
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
The Queen of the Rage,

609
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,200
The Queen of the Rage,

00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
The Queen of the Rage,

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
The Queen of the Rage,

614
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
The Queen of the Rage,

615
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
The Queen of the Rage,

616
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
The Queen of the Rage,

617
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
The Queen of the Rage,

618
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
The Queen of the Rage,

619
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
The Queen of the Rage,

620
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
The Queen of the Rage,

621
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
The Queen of the Rage,

622
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200

00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
The Queen of the Rage,

626
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
The Queen of the Rage,

627
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
The Queen of Rage,

628
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
The Queen of the Rage,

629
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
The Queen of Rage,

630
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
The Queen of the Rage,

631
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Queen of the Rage,

632
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Queen of the Rage,

633
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Queen of the Rage,

634
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Quick.

635
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
You lost a bet

636
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
but then your idea is in vain.

637
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
Want to pile yourself together?

638
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,200
What're you doing?

639
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Uncle,

640
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,200
Go back to chop sticks

641
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
when you know it will count,

642
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
and stoop high.

643
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,700
Your anger is nothing

644
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,200
against yours.

645
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,040
You're so generous.

646
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,720
You're right.

647
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,880
I'm the one who's in Yueya's body.

648
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,480
But it's all for you.

649
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,760
What do you want?

650
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,200
I want to help you.

651
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,920
By the way,

652
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,880
tell you what,

653
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,360
you can't let Yueya's body go to waste.

654
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,880
If the body is destroyed,

655
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,440
he won't be able to survive.

656
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,360
You're talking nonsense.

657
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,480
Arrest him!

658
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,200
Come here! Arrest him!

659
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,120
Get back!

660
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:53,600
Your majesty!

661
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,280
Go back!

662
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,360
Go back!

663
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,520
Go back!

664
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,520
Go back!

665
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
Hurry!

666
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,720
Go!

667
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,560
Hurry!

668
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,560
Go.

669
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,240
Hurry!

670
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,520
Hurry!

671
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,960
The enemy makes a fire!

672
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,000
Go back!

673
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,680
Let's go.

674
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,560
Let's go.

675
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,120
Come on.

676
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,120
Sun Ling.

677
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,640
Sun Ling.

678
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,320
Sun Ling.

679
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,920
Sun Ling.

680
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,080
for the 만들.

681
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,400
Seize them all.

682
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,760
Stage 3

683
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,240
Attack!

684
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,880
Hurry up.

685
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,880
Hurry up.

686
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,320
They should be far away.

687
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,280
They are nearby.

688
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,720
Everyone is looking for them.

689
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Okay.

690
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
This way.

691
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,560
Go over there and have a look.

692
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,720
We must find Miss.

693
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,160
Cailang, hurry up.

694
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,360
My family is chasing us.

695
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,360
Hurry up.

696
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Hurry up.

697
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
Cailang.

698
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,720
Cailang.

699
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Hurry up.

700
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Hurry up.

701
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,880
Cailang, I can't run anymore.

702
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,240
I really can't run anymore.

703
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
But I'll carry you.

704
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
No.

705
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,080
Cailang.

706
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,480
We really can't escape.

707
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,200
I don't believe it.

708
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,120
Hurry up.

709
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,120
Hurry up.

710
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,680
Cailang.

711
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,680
Cailang.

712
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,640
I've lived for twenty years.

713
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,600
You're the only one I can't bear to live.

714
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,240
Song Nian, we should be more than that.

715
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,240
Hurry up.

716
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,720
No.

717
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,040
You're a weak woman.

718
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,440
How far can you run away from me?

719
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
I'll try.

720
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
Hurry up.

721
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
No.

722
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,160
Cailang, I'm too strong.

723
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,720
Even if I can run away,

724
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,960
I can't live for long.

725
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,520
What nonsense are you talking about?

726
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,680
Cailang, we can't live together.

727
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,160
But we can die together.

728
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,800
What?

729
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,960
Cailang, I can break through the fire

730
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,960
and never lose my heart.

731
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
What about you?

732
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,560
Are you willing to die with me?

733
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,720
Cailang, why did you say that?

734
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,840
I love you, but...

735
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,240
I've decided.

736
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,120
I'm going to end my life here today.

737
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,720
I won't avoid you.

738
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,200
But if you have me,

739
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,760
just go with me.

740
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,720
Cailang.

741
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
Cailang.

742
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Cailang.

743
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,320
Yueyang.

744
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
What's wrong?

745
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
Cailang.

746
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
Cailang.

747
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,120
Why is she awake?

748
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,520
Meizha.

749
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,120
Yueyang, wake up.

750
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,520
Cailang.

751
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,520
Yueyang, wake up.

752
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
Cailang, don't leave me.

753
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
Cailang.

754
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,720
What are you doing?

755
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,920
You can't do this.

756
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,320
Cailang, you can't do this.

757
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
Cailang.

758
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,320
You can't do this.

759
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,920
I have to break through the fire.

760
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,920
There's nothing left to die.

761
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,320
Cailang, you can't do this.

762
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,920
Cailang.

763
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,920
Meizha, wake up.

764
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,120
Cailang.

765
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,120
Cailang.

766
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
Cailang.

767
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,120
Cailang.

768
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,120
Cailang.

769
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,120
Cailang.

770
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,120
Yueyang.

771
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,120
Cailang.

772
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
Cailang.

773
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
Cailang.

774
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,920
Cailang.

775
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,120
No one can see me.

776
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,120
Yueyang.

777
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,120
Nian debts.

778
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,920
No one.

779
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:56,820
Cailang, Fanzhou,

780
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,720
Z Ing's tomb.

781
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
Only you called.

782
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,720
No one came.

783
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,320
heit

784
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,760
Salao! Salao!

785
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,520
Salao!

786
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,480
Salao!

787
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,560
Salao!

788
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,680
Salao!

789
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,320
Salao!

790
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,520
Salao is dead.

791
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,400
What do you mean by living?

792
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,320
He said

793
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,800
if you have him in your heart,

794
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,120
you should go with him.

795
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,840
Do you love him?

796
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,240
I love him.

797
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,840
Then why do you still want to let him go alone?

798
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,600
The cold and cold air on the way to the imperial court,

799
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,800
shouldn't you go to accompany him?

800
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
Come.

801
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,080
Hurry up.

802
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,160
He's waiting for you.

803
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,600
Hurry up.

804
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,600
He's waiting for you.

805
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,800
He's waiting for you.

806
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,800
He's waiting for you.

807
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,680
What are you hesitating about?

808
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,880
Do you want to hurt him?

809
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,800
You must go with him.

810
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,080
Because he's dead because of you.

811
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,240
Why are you so cruel?

812
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,080
Let him leave alone.

813
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,800
You should go with him.

814
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,560
You should go with him.

815
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,560
Hurry up.

816
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,320
You should go with him.

817
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,240
Hurry up.

818
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,240
You should go with him.

819
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,360
Hurry up.

820
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,220
这个时候的活着

821
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,380
想走离开他的回忆后

822
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,260
rigalan幻一定会重复

823
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,860
一个活着

824
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,340
supplement

825
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,860
The reason why Yu ya can not wake up

826
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,660
It's because of the magic on the hostage

827
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,220
that it's trapped in a dream.

828
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,220
If Yue Ya is in the real life,

829
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,220
she can't wake up in her dream.

830
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,020
No.

831
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,820
Don't touch me.

832
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,540
Yue Ya!

833
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,140
Who am I?

834
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,020
Who am I?

835
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:26,980
Who are you?

836
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,060
If she dies in her dream,

837
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,860
then Yue Ya will be in the real life.

838
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:31,860
Yue Qiang,

839
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,180
give me Yue Ya!

840
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,940
Fire!

841
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,660
You wouldn't even look at it?

842
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,540
익 rebound

843
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,180
If you're dead

844
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,740
what are you supposed to lose?

845
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,300
Take a look!
