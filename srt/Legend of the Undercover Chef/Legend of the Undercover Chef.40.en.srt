1
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,439
I'm done here.

2
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,719
Hurry up.

3
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,520
Hurry up!

4
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,280
How is it?

5
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,000
Are you listening to anything?

6
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,360
Don't talk.

7
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,639
Don't talk.

8
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,680
Two of them.

9
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,479
Both of them are martial arts masters.

10
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,840
Here they come.

11
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,759
Here they come.

12
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:27,639
Here they come.

13
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,199
Stand up.

14
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,960
Your Eldest Brother and I

15
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,639
xiaoqin.

16
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,840
What are you doing all day?

17
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,759
Prepare to attack.

18
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,400
Hold on.

19
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,439
Try fair means before resorting to force

20
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,120
there's no need to lecture them.

21
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,879
What do you know?

22
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,360
There is only one trick to avoid.

23
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,599
Let them be captured first,

24
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,240
and then...

25
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,000
You people in the house,

26
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,720
you're surrounded!

27
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,439
Drop your weapons!

28
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,399
And surrender.

29
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,800
Otherwise,

30
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,240
we won't be easy on you.

31
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,079
Brothers!

32
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,360
Prepare to attack.

33
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,920
Hold on.

34
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,560
The gate is open.

35
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,800
There must be a trick inside.

36
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,600
Eunuch Cao,

37
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,360
I have a plan.

38
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,759
We can use poisonous smoke.

39
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,759
What smoke?

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,439
Seven Star Begonia Cigarette?

41
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:45,160
This is the formula that I captured from foreign lands

42
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,319
that I captured from foreign states.

43
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,480
The smoke is extremely poisonous.

44
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,360
Smell it,

45
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,519
you may vomit,

46
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,480
or you'll lose your fighting ability.

47
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,800
Release Smoke!

48
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,120
Smoke!

49
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,600
Look at that!

50
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,600
What is this thing?

51
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,680
It's not good.

52
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,279
It's the poisonous smoke of Seven Star Begonia!

53
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,240
Hurry.

54
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,720
Get in the room.

55
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,680
Hurry.

56
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,360
Run!

57
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:25,720
Xiaorou, hurry up!

58
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,399
Come on! Hurry up!

59
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,199
Come on! Hurry up!

60
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:27,720
Come on!

61
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,279
Hurry.

62
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,040
Xiaorou,

63
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,000
find the fabric strips

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,360
you usually make clothes.

65
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,079
Find it for me.

66
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,879
Honey,

67
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,560
what kind of poison did you say?

68
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,839
Seven Star Begonia?

69
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,360
My master once said that

70
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,639
those poisoned

71
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,920
most likely, they'll lose their martial arts skills

72
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,959
and the worst is

73
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,000
his life may be threatened.

74
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,199
Hurry.

75
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,160
Use this piece of cloth

76
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,600
with this rag.

77
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:47,720
Xiaorou.

78
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,240
Come on. Hurry up.

79
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,199
Come on! Hurry up!

80
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,560
Honey, hurry up!

81
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,959
There's no water.

82
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,240
Let's do it this way.

83
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,199
Come on. Hurry up.

84
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,319
Give it to me.

85
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,240
Sister-in-law.

86
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,759
What's the problem?

87
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:07,759
Me?

88
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,240
I'm still a yellow guy.

89
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,600
Xiaorou and I haven't got married yet.

90
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,480
What should I do?

91
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,000
Second Brother.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,240
When can you stop talking?

93
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,759
There's no chance down there, is there?

94
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,879
Cover your mouth.

95
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,279
Where did you get the water?

96
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,160
Go on. Don't ask.

97
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,040
Thank you, brother.

98
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,680
What is the smell?

99
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,360
Use it quickly.

100
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,319
Don't waste it.

101
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,759
Dezhu.

102
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,040
I remember now.

103
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,519
The nemesis of Seven Star Begonia is Xuejian Plant.

104
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,560
In my room.

105
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,160
Go get it.

106
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,879
Sister-in-law.

107
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,639
Since the antidote is in your room,

108
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,720
why don't we just go to your room?

109
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,560
Why are we here then?

110
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,439
That's right, honey.

111
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,040
Why do you come to this room?

112
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,480
What's the use of talking about it now?

113
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,360
I'll go fetch it.

114
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,920
Hold on.

115
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,959
How can I let you go

116
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,000
such a dangerous thing.

117
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,879
Let's go to Dezhu.

118
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,720
You are both humans!

119
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,839
I'm not a human. Why?

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,360
We can't be too selfish.

121
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,399
Jade Man, go with me.

122
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,000
Alright.

123
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,959
The wind rustling, the water is cold.

124
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,079
The warrior is gone and never returns.

125
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,600
Why are you making poems at this time?

126
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,240
I told you to get the antidote.

127
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,160
You made it look like a smile in the underworld?

128
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,000
Go on.

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,439
Mr. Jade.

130
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,399
You don't know Xuejian Grass?

131
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,040
Let me go instead.

132
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,920
Honey,

133
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,120
If you want to go, let's go together.

134
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,240
If we die, we'll die together.

135
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,240
-Go. -Let's go.

136
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,079
Sister-in-law.

137
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,199
They two

138
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,759
they're like a pair of desperate lovebirds.

139
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:37,839
That's not good.

140
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,639
It's back.

141
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,560
What's going on?

142
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,279
Let's count how many we still have.

143
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,000
Father.

144
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,360
Half of the staff are reduced.

145
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:03,759
(The Jade Queen) Jade.

146
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,480
Dezhu.

147
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,240
Open the door.

148
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,120
Sister.

149
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,680
Help Eldest Brother.

150
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,600
Sister.

151
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,399
I found

152
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,160
the smoke outside is gone.

153
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:17,879
Yes

154
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,240
now the wind is blowing in their direction.

155
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,240
What happened to my Eldest Brother?

156
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,720
Your Eldest Brother left in a hurry.

157
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,480
He hit the doorframe.

158
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,079
She was knocked out.

159
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,680
Didn't he have Iron Head Power?

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,199
What's the use of Iron Head Skills?

161
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,319
He didn't use his martial arts back then.

162
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,120
Come on.

163
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,799
Chew the antidote.

164
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,159
Rou,

165
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,519
see the grass in snow,

166
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,639
prince Yu,

167
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,159
dezhu.

168
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,639
This is nux-vomica.

169
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,440
This is Sichuan Wu.

170
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,720
You two light it

171
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,679
and throw it into the front yard.

172
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,600
With the poisonous smoke of Seven Star Begonia,

173
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,519
will form two more poisonous gases.

174
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,879
Let them try

175
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,919
the smell of the poisonous smoke.

176
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,200
What happened?

177
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,120
Eunuch Qiu,

178
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,200
this must be the smoke from the Que Blade Gate.

179
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,559
Quick!

180
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,480
Let's count how many we still have.

181
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,840
Father.

182
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,519
We still have five men left.

183
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,879
What?

184
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
I suspected that you were an undercover agent

185
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,120
are you an undercover?

186
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,240
Eunuch Cao, calm down.

187
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,159
Alright!

188
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,039
I'll meet you in person.

189
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,919
Eunuch!

190
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,559
Help

191
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,200
there's a booby trap.

192
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,480
What happened to you two?

193
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,360
Eunuch,

194
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,759
we don't know what the poison is either.

195
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
I suddenly feel that

196
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
I'm so scared.

197
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,919
Eunuch, please calm down.

198
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,600
We are not imitating you.

199
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,480
Trash!

200
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,879
Traitor Cao!

201
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,600
We have taken down your subordinates.

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,279
Give yourselves up!

203
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,399
All of you

204
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,720
you overreached yourself.

205
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,879
Stupid eunuch!

206
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,879
Meeting the four of us today

207
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,559
Is your birthday,

208
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,440
the anniversary of your death.

209
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,799
Death anniversary?

210
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,120
As a few ignorant young people,

211
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,080
you think you can stop

212
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,080
don't try to hold back the cart

213
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,399
don't do anything like that.

214
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:16,639
Traitor Cao,

215
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,960
give me your life!

216
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,000
Second Brother,

217
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,600
the Cao thief is highly skilled in martial arts.

218
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,039
Don't act rashly.

219
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,840
What are you afraid of?

220
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,279
We can fight him together.

221
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,320
We'll fight with him.

222
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,360
Eldest Brother.

223
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,879
Junior Brother.

224
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,279
You great traitor!

225
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,480
I'll fight you!

226
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:08,639
Stop!

227
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,879
Father.

228
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,440
Father, don't come out.

229
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,320
What does she wear?

230
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:31,840
I'm really grateful

231
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,519
the new Chief of Que Blade Sect.

232
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,600
Master Ximen is here.

233
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,879
The scapegoat.

234
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,120
This is the cook.

235
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,200
This dress really suits you.

236
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,799
You know what?

237
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,559
Your good days are over.

238
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,559
My brother Ximen Changhai

239
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,360
has gone to the capital with your father-in-law

240
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,080
to report you.

241
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,320
Alright.

242
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:06,360
That is thoughtful of you.

243
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,080
Can we discuss about it?

244
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,240
We're familiar with the past.

245
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,679
You know I am a good cook.

246
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,720
I don't know how to fight.

247
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,600
Right?

248
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,440
Well, we had drinks in a group together.

249
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,200
Can you discuss about it?

250
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,360
Should we use military tactics?

251
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,159
Or military?

252
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,679
How to fight an article?

253
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,799
How to fight?

254
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:24,919
And physical fighting.

255
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:25,879
Don't use force.

256
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,360
I'll use three moves first.

257
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,440
We can talk when it's done.

258
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,720
Alright.

259
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,159
What if it is martial arts?

260
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,759
That would be different.

261
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,840
I'll use five moves

262
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,039
and then you're done

263
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,480
here are ten tricks.

264
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,679
I won't move.

265
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,799
Come here.

266
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,080
He is a real martial artist.

267
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:50,519
Don't move.

268
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,159
What kind of weapon is this?

269
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,759
Hero Ximen.

270
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,320
You're finally out.

271
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,799
I thought you were scared

272
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:55,679
you were so frightened that you have committed suicide in the room.

273
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,559
Today,

274
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,559
I'll deal with you first

275
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,440
and then I'll kill your brother.

276
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,879
Good always prevails over evil.

277
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,919
Good guys live longer than bad guys.

278
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Alright.

279
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,600
Why not try it?

280
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,679
Why don't you work hard?

281
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,600
I only used 10% of my martial arts ability,

282
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,360
you won't be able to handle it.

283
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,840
I can see that.

284
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,279
You're not the Ximen Changhai at all.

285
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,399
You are the chef, Ximen Changzai.

286
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,519
And want to kill with the knife?

287
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,000
This knife

288
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,600
has never killed anyone,

289
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,519
only animals.

290
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,159
Come.

291
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,000
I'll give you a chance.

292
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,440
Who...

293
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Who exactly are you?

294
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,480
Brother.

295
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,799
You played me in the past.

296
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,879
Today, I'll play you.

297
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:37,399
Take Eunuch Wang to the capital through the path.

298
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,759
I'll send someone to protect you.

299
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,879
Go after them!

300
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,200
You can't escape!

301
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,679
Stop!

302
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,120
-Stop right there! -Stop!

303
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,840
Stop!

304
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,080
Stop right there!

305
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:02,799
Stop.

306
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:06,759
Stop!

307
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,559
Stop!

308
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:10,799
Stop!

309
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,279
Hurry.

310
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:20,880
What's wrong?

311
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,559
It hit me.

312
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,480
How come you're weaker than me?

313
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,200
Stand up.

314
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,079
Can you stand up?

315
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:16,759
Cauliflower?

316
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,759
Heroine Gongsun.

317
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,240
Why are you here?

318
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:23,039
I heard Eunuch Cao led the troops to attack the Quedao Sect.

319
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,680
I knew you would be in danger.

320
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,880
And hurried here.

321
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,160
Are you alright, Changhai?

322
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,880
I'm alright.

323
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:29,839
A letter from a pigeon of Jade Man.

324
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,000
He told me to meet you.

325
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,359
Great.

326
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,319
The hero never showed up.

327
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,240
Who are you?

328
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:38,519
I was sent by your brother

329
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,920
to be with you and protect you.

330
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,079
That...

331
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,680
Why are you covering your face?

332
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,559
Take it off.

333
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,240
Let me see who you really are.

334
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,400
Mother!

335
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,200
You're the matchmaker?

336
00:18:58,759 --> 00:18:59,319
Then you...

337
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:03,079
You are a part-time matchmaker?

338
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,240
Was arranged by your brother.

339
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,559
Who has been lying to me.

340
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,119
Is there no such thing?

341
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,039
Listen to your brother.

342
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,519
You're really Changhai's brother.

343
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,880
How many times have I told you

344
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,680
even if I told you?

345
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:17,720
Where is Changhai?

346
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,759
I need to find him.

347
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,880
Don't look for him now.

348
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,240
Find him a place first.

349
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,359
To the capital as soon as possible.

350
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,559
This is a big deal.

351
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:24,920
Right.

352
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,359
I'm scared.

353
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,000
Don't be scared.

354
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,880
I'm right here.

355
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,920
You're talking and you're calling me

356
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm really scared.

357
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,519
You should have

358
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,160
hurry up.

359
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,000
See him off.

360
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,720
Come on.

361
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,279
Don't be scared.

362
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,279
Our group at the West Gate Changhai

363
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,480
reported to His Majesty when they reached the capital,

364
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,359
his Majesty was so furious.

365
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,279
Eunuch Cao was put in prison.

366
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,640
His hawks and dogs

367
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,200
when the trees fall, his hangers-on disperse.

368
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,440
And in order to uphold justice,

369
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,680
for their heroic deeds against Eunuch Cao

370
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,720
made them famous all over the world.

371
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,400
Everyone praised them

372
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,559
a red heart of complete dedication

373
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,079
outstanding figures

374
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,200
but this

375
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,119
It's not that simple.

376
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,440
For the rest,

377
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,440
new troubles may come to them.

378
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,480
Bottle gourd?

379
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,160
Bottle gourd.

380
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:13,839
Bottle gourd?

381
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,599
Take the blame.

382
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,160
Take the blame.

383
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,200
Don't be scared.

384
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,839
To avenge you.

385
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,000
Little brother,

386
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,079
you've never taken care of the family

387
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,240
you've never taken care of our family.

388
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,319
I've always

389
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,359
with you.

390
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,920
But today I understand.

391
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,960
You are right.

392
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,599
Without everyone,

393
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:52,839
without everyone.

394
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,799
As for me,

395
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,799
no martial arts.

396
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,839
He won't be

397
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:02,839
I won't be a warrior like you.

398
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,519
But I'm proud to have you as a brother.

399
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,160
Are you a hero?

400
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,160
It has nothing to do with martial arts.

401
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,039
As long as you care about the country,

402
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,400
for the state and the people

403
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,720
you are already a hero.

404
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,559
I remember you once said that

405
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,839
If a room is full of darkness,

406
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,039
we need a flame to illuminate it.

407
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,039
In the future,

408
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,759
I...

409
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,920
This is the flame.
