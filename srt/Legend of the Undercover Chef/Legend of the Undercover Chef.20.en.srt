1
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,560
You two

2
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,800
have been married for so long,

3
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,840
why don't you have children?

4
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,750
Mother,

5
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,870
you don't want to have children.

6
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,240
Am I not a martial artist?

7
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,030
I've learned a little

8
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,560
In martial arts,

9
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,590
after that,

10
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,680
what's the rush?

11
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,430
I'm old.

13
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,430
For what?

14
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,360
I just want grandchildren.

15
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,190
You two can't satisfy me

16
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,680
can't satisfy me with this?

17
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,310
What's the point of living?

18
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,120
I'll dig a hole and bury myself.

19
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,000
Mother, don't say those angry words.

20
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,840
I...

21
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,910
Is it not good for me to do this?

22
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,750
Why are you choking my son?

23
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,080
I agree with him.

24
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,910
Just tell him if you agree.

25
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,710
When he said that?

26
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,240
No, mother, she didn't pinch me.

27
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,400
She is helping me with my clothes.

28
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,680
Her clothes become thinner.

29
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,590
Enough. Enough.

30
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,800
Stop poking me.

31
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,400
Yes

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,310
son,

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,000
keep your words.

34
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,120
What?

35
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,310
They want kids?

36
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,630
Keep your promise.

37
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,910
I'll mention this

38
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,430
on the agenda...

39
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,430
The agenda.

40
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,080
Alright?

41
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,840
Alright.

42
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,960
These two days,

43
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,000
you two should work harder.

44
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,750
I will supervise you two.

45
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,800
Honey, listen to me.

46
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,680
Don't be angry before going to bed.

47
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,030
When it comes to sleep.

48
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,080
And liver.

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,590
Can you

50
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,840
stop nagging me.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,280
Your mother has been nagging

52
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,630
by my ears today.

53
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,000
You are getting callous.

54
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,240
Lower your voice.

55
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,400
She can't.

56
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,080
Think about it.

57
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,240
She'll be back in a few days.

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,800
Can you tolerate it for a few more days?

59
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
How can I?

60
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,910
Tell me the truth.

61
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,870
You have to learn

62
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,470
the three obediences and the four virtues

63
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,190
what? I'm not virtuous enough?

64
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,150
You even teach me.

65
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,840
What?

66
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,120
There are three types of unfilial piety.

67
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,680
The best is the worst without an heir.

68
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,360
I was the only one who had the baby.

69
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,000
It's useless to blame me.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,190
Who can I blame then?

71
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,960
You know what?

72
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,280
Hurry up.

73
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,910
I'm trying to

74
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,000
the whole time.

75
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,560
What are you talking about?

76
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,070
What are you talking about?

77
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,360
I told you to

78
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,040
hurry up.

79
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,600
To send your mother home.

80
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,160
She just came here,

81
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,600
so I have to find a chance?

82
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,720
Stop.

83
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,430
Go to bed.

84
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,430
Show me some quilt.

85
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:02,950
Hao Meng!

86
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,750
Hao Meng!

87
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,390
Did you hear her? She's screaming.

88
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,120
Who, who is calling?

89
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,800
Cat fight?

90
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,240
Go out and chase it away.

91
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,510
Come on, it pinched it.

92
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,870
Choke one to death.

93
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,680
My arm is numb.

94
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,160
Don't move. I just fell asleep.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I will ask you to shout.

96
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,310
My goodness!

97
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,070
What cat?

98
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,310
No.

99
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:41,830
Who is it?

100
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,360
Lower your voice.

101
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,870
It's you, Auntie.

102
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,270
Why are you still meowing

103
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,830
why are you meowing a cat?

104
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,000
I have something to do.

105
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,120
What is it?

106
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,070
Worries?

107
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,560
What worries?

108
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,270
You can let me know.

109
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,510
I can help you.

110
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,800
I need your help.

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What's wrong with you?

112
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,360
Do you think I can sleep

113
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,870
I can still sleep.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,510
I heard that on a full moon night,

115
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,870
there's someone who turns into the werewolf.

116
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,720
There's also someone who can turn into a cat.

117
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,070
Meow.

118
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,040
Meow.

119
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,800
Meow.

120
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,560
Oh, my God.

121
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,480
Mother.

122
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,950
Is your waist better?

123
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,430
Not at all.

124
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,160
Jade Man is so ruthless.

125
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,720
Come on.

126
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,600
You too.

127
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,190
Why are you lying under the window?

128
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,160
Jade sees you as an assassin.

129
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,630
How could you not hurt your hands?

130
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,070
Mother is also worried

131
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,480
a child too?

132
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,630
No matter how worried you are about giving birth,

133
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,310
you can't just sit there and listen.

134
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,510
Even Madam Ye is picking on you.

135
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,720
What?

136
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,750
Blame me.

137
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,720
Fault me.

138
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,120
No matter you.

139
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,430
She can't even bear children.

140
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,750
Who are you picking?

141
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,240
Lower your voice.

142
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,480
If they can't have children,

143
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,600
for not having a baby.

144
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,000
What if it's something wrong with me?

145
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,510
You are my son.

146
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,480
What's wrong with you?

147
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,240
I gave birth to you.

148
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
You are healthy.

149
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,480
There must be something wrong with her.

150
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,830
No, fire her.

151
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,480
Lower your voice.

152
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,870
What's your temper?

153
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,040
You know that.

154
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,120
Can we do well after the rest?

155
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,190
Son,

156
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,830
how about we take a concubine?

157
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,560
Stop.

158
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,000
You are full of men.

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,480
Even though you may still be hungry,

160
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,430
my master is still single.

161
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,630
And I can't

162
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,240
what do you think?

163
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,360
That's good.

164
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,600
She can have a son.

165
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,430
What nonsense are you talking about, mother?

166
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,360
Son.

167
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,360
Stay out of this matter.

168
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,920
I'll arrange it for you.

169
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,720
Aunty.

170
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,800
Auntie, what's the matter?

171
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,030
Let me ask you something.

172
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,120
When will your father come back?

173
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,510
My father

174
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,910
I don't know.

175
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,360
How can I help you?

176
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,150
I have something to do with it.

177
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,480
Then tell me.

178
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,390
Then listen to me.

179
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,790
I don't want to

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,080
I want to form a marriage alliance

181
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,960
marry your father.

182
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,200
Connection through marriage?

183
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,440
My father can do that.

184
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,360
But you already

185
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,870
don't you have a wife?

186
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,600
What are you thinking?

187
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,550
I can't explain it to you.

188
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,240
Let me ask you this.

189
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,240
How is your Eldest Brother?

190
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,240
My Eldest Brother

191
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,270
he is a good person.

192
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,720
What about your sister-in-law?

193
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,080
They are so well.

194
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,630
We are close.

195
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,870
That's good.

196
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,000
Are you willing

197
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,750
to be their family?

198
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,870
Family?

199
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,550
We are a family.

200
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,910
Do you agree with it?

201
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,550
If you agree,

202
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,840
I will go back to make arrangements.

203
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,550
What?

204
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,150
Why would I agree?

205
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,000
She's already

206
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,480
I've talked to her for so long

207
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,840
after talking to her for long.

208
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,510
I mean...

209
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,480
It means that

210
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,600
your Eldest Brother and sister-in-law

211
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,750
over all these years,

212
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,480
they never had a child.

213
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:39,870
Your sister-in-law

214
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,600
there must be something wrong with her.

215
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,960
I think

216
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,320
and treats your Eldest Brother very well.

217
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,750
To your Eldest Brother

218
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,000
your Eldest Brother.

219
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,670
What?

220
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,720
Be your eldest brother's concubine?

221
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,720
I'll be his concubine.

222
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,120
Auntie,

223
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,870
what are you thinking?

224
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,480
How can I be a concubine

225
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,910
be my eldest brother's concubine?

226
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,790
If someone hears about it,

227
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,870
will I be able to behave myself?

228
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,600
It's fine not to be his concubine.

229
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,790
I will ask him to divorce his wife.

230
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,600
You will do the most

231
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,150
oK?

232
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,960
You call the shots.

233
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,150
As long as you can give me a grandchild,

234
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,080
whatever you say,

235
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,360
I will listen to you, okay?

236
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,870
Madam, are you muddled?

237
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,320
How can you do this?

238
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,670
I'm not stupid.

239
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,200
Don't look down on your Eldest Brother.

240
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,150
After your father dies,

241
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,270
your senior will still be the Chief.

242
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,600
You will be the wife of Sect Leader.

243
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,480
You have crossed the line

244
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,670
I'll never talk to you again.

245
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,790
Look at her.

246
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,510
Whatever.

247
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,550
Don't be anxious.

248
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,390
He has no manners.

249
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,510
You two...

250
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,030
So early?

251
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,720
Fourth Mother,

252
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,750
close the door.

253
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Senior, sit here.

254
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,360
We're waiting for you.

255
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,910
Something happened, Uncle.

256
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,150
Before your mother is awake,

257
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,360
I want to discuss something with you.

258
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,390
It's not a short time that your mother

259
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,790
for a long time.

260
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,240
Don't you think

261
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,720
It's time to go back?

262
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,510
What? Is my mother in trouble?

263
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,360
Eldest Brother,

264
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,000
you'd better send your mother back.

265
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,870
Your mother should let me be your concubine

266
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,030
she wants me to be your concubine.

267
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,150
What?

268
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,320
Be your concubine.

269
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,510
Making Xiaorou your concubine?

270
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,550
Your mother has gone too far.

271
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,750
Did you not tell your mother

272
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,960
the relationship between Xiaorou and me?

273
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,390
We are like the other

274
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,630
have mutual affinity

275
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,720
the boy and girl are innocent playmates

276
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,840
happy couple

277
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,480
what are you doing?

278
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,000
Xiaorou.

279
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,600
Did you hear it wrong?

280
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,550
Does my mother

281
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,000
to cook?

282
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,960
What dishes?

283
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,670
Yesterday...

284
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,200
I went to the toilet.

285
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,960
Your mother...

286
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Is squatting inside.

287
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,080
I can't hold it any longer.

288
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,720
Auntie, please.

289
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,600
Can you hurry up?

290
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,120
Your mother is getting stubborn.

291
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,960
You told me to hurry up.

292
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,910
Then I was going to hurry up.

293
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,960
I should have been slower.

294
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Then I stayed inside

295
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,120
he waited for four hours before he came out.

296
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:00,960
Take a guess.

297
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,910
What happened after that?

298
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,120
What happened?

299
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,550
I've changed my pants.

300
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,030
Do you hear me?

301
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,360
Let's see what people say.

302
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,320
I can't

303
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,600
get along with your mother?

304
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,550
I didn't agree when I came here.

305
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,000
Dezhu, this is too exaggerated.

306
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,200
Four hours?

307
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,390
Four hours is not enough.

308
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,150
It should take at least six hours.

309
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,320
What?

310
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,630
Come on.

311
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,790
Brother Jiang, do you have something

312
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,240
you have something to say?

313
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,630
Aunty, right?

314
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,790
I don't know either

315
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,360
she has this habit.

316
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,150
She stayed up all night

317
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
meow like a cat.

318
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,000
Meow, meow.

319
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,600
Luckily there's a basket next to it.

320
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,000
So I skated over there.

321
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,480
If it is the ax,

322
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,120
I become the murderer of your mother.

323
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,030
You still have to seek revenge from me.

324
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,080
Me?

325
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,670
I won't talk about it anymore.

326
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,120
I feel uncomfortable anyway.

327
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,150
I'll hurry up then

328
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,150
to send my mother down the mountain.

329
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,510
Everyone,

330
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm so sorry.

331
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,550
Sorry.

332
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,510
On behalf of my mother,

333
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,600
on behalf of my mother.

334
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
What are you talking about?

335
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,480
I won't leave.

336
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,360
Mother.

337
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,390
You've been out for days.

338
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,960
If you don't miss my father,

339
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,360
my father misses you as well.

340
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,320
He misses me?

341
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,670
Oh, my goodness!

342
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,790
I've been sick of your dad for so many years.

343
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,240
Being apart from your dad for a while,

344
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:21,790
I think

345
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,600
It's good.

346
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,550
Son.

347
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,080
Something's wrong.

348
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,320
Are you asking me to leave?

349
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
Or is it because of your uncle?

350
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,120
Why would I kick you out?

351
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,790
What do you mean?

352
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,510
You're welcome to be here

353
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,440
I just think that my father

354
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,790
no one will look after him at home.

355
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,360
I don't think so either.

356
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,960
Son, I'm telling you,

357
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,750
what good friends

358
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,150
better than your father.

359
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,200
I won't go.

360
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,240
We'll celebrate the Spring Festival here.

361
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,750
What are you looking at?

362
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,270
I won't go.

363
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:51,910
It's the Spring Festival.

364
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,910
I can't tell you any more.

365
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,440
Then what do you have?

366
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,080
Eldest Brother, sit down.

367
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,480
What's the use of sitting?

368
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,200
Just sit down when I tell you to.

369
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,630
Eldest Brother, let me ask you something.

370
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,960
What's the last name

371
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,670
what's your surname?

372
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,600
Our surname is Zhang.

373
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,790
Our surname is Zhang.

374
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,270
Look how old you are.

375
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,270
And three of you.

376
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
Have an idea.

377
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,150
It's not only

378
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,960
It's easy

379
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,960
and handy.

380
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,120
Then tell me.

381
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,270
The way you keep acting

382
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,200
you're so greedy.

383
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,510
Tell you what.

384
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,720
Knock your mother out

385
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
when she's sleeping.

386
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,440
And put her in a sack

387
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,750
and send her back.

388
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,200
She has to come back after she wakes up.

389
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,480
After he wakes up,

390
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,200
and then

391
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,080
and then choke her.

392
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,240
Put them in a sack

393
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,360
and send them back.

394
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,550
Repeating this for three times,

395
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,150
your mother

396
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,960
and never come back again.

397
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,840
What about

398
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,870
let me ask you this.

399
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,200
Before you played that trick,

400
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,390
you asked my mother's surname

401
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,270
and my sisters.

402
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,390
What does it have to do with this?

403
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,320
Not at all.

404
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,480
I was just asking.

405
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,600
Your Highness,

406
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,080
you have many ideas.

407
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,670
Please give me some advice.

408
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,600
Eldest Brother,

409
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,000
I have an idea.

410
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,150
What?

411
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,270
However,

412
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,750
over the performance.

413
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,720
Don't be like him.

414
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,790
To pinch my mother.

415
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,030
To pinch my mother.

416
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,750
Don't you have any tactics?

417
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,790
How about this?

418
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,000
Mother.

419
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,480
Just be gentle with her.

420
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,000
Death to the old, birth to the new.

421
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,670
Mother, my limbs got old.

422
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,910
She got up for practice in the morning.

423
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,600
You can knock all of the towers down.

424
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,080
You can't.

425
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,240
Son.

426
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,000
What's wrong?

427
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,390
Did your wife bully you again?

428
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,670
It's not that.

429
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,630
Why do you have such a long face?

430
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,000
How's the old neighbor

431
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,390
zhai Bald.

432
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,120
A letter delivered by a flying pigeon.

433
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,080
What did they say?

434
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,910
He said my father has a foot.

435
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,390
So be it.

436
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,870
When your feet were old,

437
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,440
to eat some pig's trotters.

438
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,080
Don't worry.

439
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,670
Yes

440
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,000
I said it's unnecessary.

441
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,030
The book to fly.

442
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,630
My father was too...

443
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,600
What are you doing

444
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,870
enter Widow Wang's house.

445
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,600
I sprained my ankle.

446
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,790
What? Widow Wang?

447
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,600
Maybe it's boring to stay at home.

448
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,960
Just chatting with Widow Wang.

449
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Over the wall.

450
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,720
My foot hurt.

451
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,960
It's OK. Widow Wang takes good care of

452
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,670
that's good.

453
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,000
Your father

454
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,480
Is a dodgy old

455
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,480
I once suspected that

456
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,960
I thought they were having an affair.

457
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,350
No wonder that when I climbed the mountain,

458
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,720
he supports me that much.

459
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,110
Stop that! Don't make assumptions.

460
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,880
Also,

461
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,680
he's so old.

462
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,350
How about turning a blind eye to it?

463
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,240
Bullshit!

464
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,830
How can I stand for this?

465
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
I have to go home right now.

466
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,680
Mother.

467
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,960
Stay here for a few more days.

468
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,160
I haven't stayed with you enough.

469
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,000
What should I stay?

470
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,110
The backyard is on fire.

471
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,070
I'm still waiting.

472
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,960
Go home?

473
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,720
My father would be in a miserable state.

474
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,480
Seven two.

475
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,400
Seven. Three.

476
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,880
Seven. Four.

477
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,310
Seven. Five.

478
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,590
Seven. Six.

479
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,200
Seven. Seven.

480
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,720
Seven. Eight.

481
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,550
Seven and nine.

482
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,350
Master,

483
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,510
you're out of isolation training.

484
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,070
Where is your uncle?

485
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,590
Uncle has gone down the mountain.

486
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,680
What tricks

487
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,790
during your retreat?

488
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,830
Teach us.

489
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,830
All tricks.

490
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,110
What should I do next?

491
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,880
Don't they say

492
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,030
teach your disciples to starve to death.

493
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,510
When my master taught me,

494
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,200
he didn't teach me the last trick.

495
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,440
Till now I don't know.

496
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,720
What is it?

497
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,160
Fried sweet potatoes.

498
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,200
No matter what I do, I can't.

499
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,920
These sweet potatoes are...

500
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
It's Kung Fu.

501
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,240
Of course, Kung Fu.

502
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,720
There's no certain amount of time...

503
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,070
You don't even know how to heat them.

504
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,110
Are these potatoes?

505
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,270
Just like the sweet potatoes that are cut into cubes,

506
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,550
when the heat gets wrong,

507
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,550
why don't I try to

508
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,720
It'll become burnt.

509
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,440
Master,

510
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,920
we are talking about martial arts.

511
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,750
You are talking about cooking skills, right?

512
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,480
They all

513
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,440
connected.

514
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,510
But a metaphor.

515
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,400
Do you know

516
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,110
a tiger.

517
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,200
Of the tiger.

518
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,270
Do you know who it is?

519
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,510
It's the tiger's master.

520
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,240
It's mother

521
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,110
Its father.

522
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,110
His Lord.

523
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,720
That it's useless.

524
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
What does it have to do with your generation?

525
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,680
Tiger's master is a cat.

526
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,640
A tiger?

527
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,440
Why you can't catch up with the cat?

528
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,000
He didn't learn the last trick.

529
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,720
Climb the tree!

530
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
They climbed up the tree after scratching.

531
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,000
Tigers can only watch

532
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,830
master, I understand.

533
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,550
Don't worry.

534
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,790
Teach us your trick.

535
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,720
Even if you teach us

536
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,270
we won't eat you.

537
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,720
Come on.

538
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,070
In all ages.

539
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,960
How many disciples have tricked their masters?

540
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,640
Master is right.

541
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,720
Like the disciple of Master Guo of the Guo family,

542
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,920
In the past.

543
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,240
Not to mention the others,

544
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,070
It will be our turn.

545
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,400
Master,

546
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,350
we wouldn't trap you.

547
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,400
Stop talking about it.

548
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,830
I won't teach you.

549
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,590
I won't.

550
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,510
I don't have a husband.

551
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,310
What am I teaching?

552
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,400
I can't catch you.

553
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,310
Where are you going?

554
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,200
You can run fast.

555
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,240
I'm fast.

556
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,110
Where to go?

557
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:56,680
Hao Meng,

558
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,920
why are you yelling instead of going to bed?

559
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,720
Sleep.

560
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,110
It's New Year! Kill a pig!

561
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,310
Kill a pig! Don't run! Kill the pig!

562
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,830
Are you hugging a pig?

563
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,920
Put your arms around me?

564
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,240
You think I'm a pig.

565
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,030
Stand up.

566
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:10,550
Move over there.

567
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,070
Honey, don't arch me.

568
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,510
Try to poach you?

569
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,640
Next time?

570
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,750
And I will beat you!

571
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,750
Why are you still awake?

572
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,920
Who do you regard as a pig?

573
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,830
Have some water.

574
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,960
You haven't practiced martial arts for years.

575
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,960
Why did you pick it up?

576
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,790
What do you think?

577
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,750
Someone already treats me like a pig.

578
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,440
If I don't practice more,

579
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,720
If I don't want to be bullied?

580
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,440
You see that?

581
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,750
Don't pick on the evil.

582
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,790
I was dreaming, right?

583
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,920
I've made up my mind.

584
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,160
From today on,

585
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,480
you'll be my target.

586
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,830
Take your iron head

587
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,200
catch my meteor hammer.

588
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,350
Are you ready?

589
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,640
Look at the hammer.

590
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,310
What are you doing?

591
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,110
My mother said that

592
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,070
when you see a shooting star, you must make a wish.

593
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,750
Two hundred and four two five.

594
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,070
Two hundred and six and two hundred

595
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,550
two hundred...

596
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,200
Stop fanning me.

597
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,030
You fed me with information.

598
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,310
You must be tired.

599
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,030
Nonsense.

600
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,880
He has been practicing for days.

601
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,310
It's not effective to lose weight.

602
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,680
Honey, if you listen to me,

603
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,000
If you want to lose weight,

604
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,310
that's fine.

605
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,640
Don't practice it.

606
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,160
After training, your arms

607
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,350
be like the stick on the tree.

608
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,960
The more you practice, the stronger you are.

609
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,000
You can actually practice.

610
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,200
What Lady Heart Sutra is about?

611
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,640
Women

612
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,110
Instead of fighting and killing all the time.

613
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,200
What's the use of that thing?

614
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,590
What?

615
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,960
I'm not feminine at all.

616
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,830
It tastes the boss.

617
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,350
Yes, feminine.

618
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,440
Honey, I'm afraid you might get tired.

619
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,640
Honey,

620
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,310
you know what?

621
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,960
You should show your professionalism.

622
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,920
You are a professional dispensing skill.

623
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,750
Just make some slimming tea

624
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,830
with some diet tea?

625
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,440
She must have suffered a lot.

626
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,160
Why didn't I think of that?

627
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,110
Right?

628
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,240
Come on.

629
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,830
Take this.

630
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,400
Oh, dear!

631
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,960
Let me just say a few words.

632
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
You just want to

633
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,440
you want to lose your wife?
