1
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,200
After we go up the mountain,

2
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,599
follow my orders.

3
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:01,959
Got it?

4
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,560
Alright, Senior Brother.

5
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,319
Brother.

6
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,799
It's so early. Where are you going?

7
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,040
I'll answer that question.

8
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,280
Master wants to build a shelter on the mountain.

9
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,639
Let's go send some wood.

10
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,159
My father needs a dog?

11
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,080
Master lives in...

12
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,199
Yes, Master lives in.

13
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,159
After Aunt Li Rong passed away,

14
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,280
master was scared.

15
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,280
Master was scared.

16
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,120
That Aunt Li Rong would come back and kill her.

17
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,520
We'll go to the mountain

18
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,479
build a shelter first.

19
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,840
For a few days.

20
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,800
Why can't Aunt Lirong understand this?

21
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,639
In the face of love,

22
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,520
hard work.

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,840
Not to be worth a hair

24
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,520
get out of here.

25
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,560
-Let's go. -Okay.

26
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,639
Take the thick one.

27
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,840
Let Youngest Brother take the thin one.

28
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,560
I mean to let my younger brother

29
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,599
to exercise.

30
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,439
You take this.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,560
This.

32
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,240
Hurry up.

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,400
Hold it!

34
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,919
Senior, I can carry it.

35
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,719
I'll take it, it's okay.

36
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,080
Hey.

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,759
Give it to me.

38
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,159
Your tiny physique

39
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,360
match that thick?

40
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,960
Didn't you make this for me?

41
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,199
Now you don't deserve it.

42
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,639
Come on.

43
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,639
You take this as well.

44
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,479
So he should take it.

45
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,439
You take it.

46
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,280
Hey.

47
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,599
Take them.

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,240
It should be balanced.

49
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,520
Otherwise they'll lose weight.

50
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,240
Here you are.

51
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,400
You're too biased.

52
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,159
Junior Brother,

53
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,800
what are you doing?

54
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,560
Let go of me.

55
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:12,960
It's stuck on.

56
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,039
What are you doing?

57
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,360
Hit me with your rod.

58
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,240
What the hell is this?

59
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,879
Come on.

60
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:22,960
Got to go, Senior Sister.

61
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,599
Hey.

62
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,719
Be careful.

63
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,280
This is enough.

64
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,599
This is good.

65
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,800
Brother-in-law.

66
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,560
What are you watching?

67
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,879
Just watch there.

68
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
What's that for?

69
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,680
What are you doing?

70
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,080
What are you doing?

71
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,360
Hey.

72
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,759
Why don't you make a look?

73
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,400
How is the mission accomplished?

74
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,319
Brother.

75
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,120
I've written down

76
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,240
recently.

77
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,199
Look at this.

78
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,080
So detailed.

79
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,560
Donkey's.

80
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,319
Work.

81
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,160
What's that?

82
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,959
Donkey's timetable

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,399
and the time for geese to lay eggs.

84
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,199
Why do you remember animals?

85
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,079
You're spotting people.

86
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,560
I can't see them.

87
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
Come closer.

88
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,600
Come closer. Won't she see you?

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,920
Take this.

90
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,959
Foreign things?

91
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,759
Binoculars.

92
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,720
Brother-in-law, why are you in the outer room?

93
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,240
I won't.

94
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,199
It's the other way around.

95
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,879
In this way?

96
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,600
Right.

97
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,519
I put it in front of you.

98
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,439
The big teeth

99
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,240
are they this long?

100
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Is this fun?

101
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,439
Baby.

102
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,680
My sweetheart.

103
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,680
It's like that.

104
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,759
What are you doing?

105
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,319
Get down to business.

106
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,079
Do something serious with it.

107
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,800
This is good.

108
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,480
Don't throw it away.

109
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,399
Don't worry.

110
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,360
Junior Brother,

111
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,560
are you reading?

112
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,519
Senior Sister.

113
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,040
It was cold early in the morning and the night.

114
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,680
I brought you a quilt.

115
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,360
I've been traveling around

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,120
I have been displaced

117
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,439
and no fixed abode.

118
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,879
I've never been covered so well in this life.

119
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,399
Senior Sister,

120
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,279
thank you.

121
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,759
You're welcome.

122
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,920
Let me know

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,079
please let me know.

124
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,160
I'll leave now.

125
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,439
Goodbye, Senior Sister.

126
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,120
Although it's cold,

127
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,160
the quilt is warm.

128
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,680
Senior is here.

129
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,480
This is the flower head flower I bought for Xiaorou.

130
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,040
Why is this in your hand?

131
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,639
Brother.

132
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,600
I picked this up just now.

133
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,439
Right here.

134
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,519
That's...

135
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,240
That's it?

136
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,600
You are good at picking it.

137
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,279
No, Senior Brother.

138
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,199
Why are you saying that?

139
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,720
I...

140
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,439
Do you dare to cover me up?

141
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,079
This quilt was

142
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,959
was sent by my senior sister.

143
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,800
It's so sweet of you

144
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,120
she has taken good care of me.

145
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,279
And she is very handy

146
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,560
have clever hands and good sense

147
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,800
look at the exquisitely embroidered peony.

148
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,959
These are Chinese roses.

149
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,399
Peony.

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,879
Peony,

151
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,240
peony?

152
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
I embroidered that.

153
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,480
Chinese roses.

154
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,160
If I guess it right,

155
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,199
that you are someone who doesn't follow the rules.

156
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,799
Hey.

157
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,840
Why do you give that kid the quilt

158
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,639
to that kid?

159
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,519
It's cool recently.

160
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,320
He didn't have the quilt cover.

161
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,639
The blanket was too busy

162
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,840
so I covered him up.

163
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,120
Do you know why I gave you a quilt?

164
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,759
That's why I covered you up.

165
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,279
I want to give you my whole life.

166
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,000
What are you talking about, Second Brother?

167
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,279
I've always treated you as my own brother.

168
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,919
You think too much.

169
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,440
You were not like this before.

170
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,879
You were not like this before.

171
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,879
You gradually alienated me.

172
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,879
And ignored me.

173
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,799
Are you in love with him?

174
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,559
Aren't you handsome?

175
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,279
What are you talking about, Second Brother?

176
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,799
Are you taking this seriously?

177
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,679
Lower your voice.

178
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,679
But it won't be heard by others.

179
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,559
Do you know that

180
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,000
In order to make this quilt for you,

181
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,559
I went to store Liu

182
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,960
and bought some good fabric.

183
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,080
To embroider this little flower for you,

184
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,960
to embroider this little flower for you.

185
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,799
More than 40 needle holes were pricked.

186
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
It's my heart.

187
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,799
Don't play that trick.

188
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,840
I will make it up to you.

189
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:56,039
I don't want it.

190
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,639
You know what I'm embroidering?

191
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,960
What?

192
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,759
Peony.

193
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,960
Peony?

194
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,159
But that guy

195
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,799
and said Chinese roses.

196
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:11,200
He doesn't know the meaning of this flower at all.

197
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,440
Brother, I...

198
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,159
I don't know either.

199
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,480
Why don't you take it back?

200
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,440
No, I won't.

201
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,480
Xiaorou.

202
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,279
This quilt

203
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,440
Is made by me myself.

204
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,360
You don't have to cover it with my hand.

205
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,360
But I won't allow others to cover it.

206
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,600
I hope

207
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,919
In your room forever.

208
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,399
And this one.

209
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,440
Senior Brother.

210
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
I don't want it anymore.

211
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,639
Take it back.

212
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,080
Senior!

213
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,559
That's outrageous!

214
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,360
That's absurd!

215
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,039
This is outrageous!

216
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:01,840
Dezhu.

217
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,039
What are you doing?

218
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,200
I really feel sorry for him.

219
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,279
This is a millennium old tree.

220
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,720
Why are you venting your anger on this?

221
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,679
It's a waste.

222
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
You're successful now.

223
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,840
And got into a fight with the tree.

224
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,799
Are you the winner?

225
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,519
Even if you win,

226
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,279
what can you do?

227
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,919
Cut the crap.

228
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,399
Why are you still lingering

229
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,679
why are you still wasting time?

230
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,039
You really have to

231
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:38,919
hold on.

232
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,120
This 70-degree knife

233
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,919
It hurts a little.

234
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,240
Doesn't it hurt?

235
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,080
Why isn't it hurt?

236
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,240
Compared with the hurt in my heart,

237
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,879
It's nothing.

238
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:05,840
Why is that?

239
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,159
The wound is deep.

240
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,279
Enough.

241
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,799
Look at yourself.

242
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,799
Brother.

243
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,759
Sister-in-law.

244
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,159
Let me ask you something.

245
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,639
If you are Xiaorou,

246
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,159
which one would you like?

247
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,480
Or Jiang Yulang?

248
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,600
Jiang Yulang?

249
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,360
He...

250
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,720
What's so good about him?

251
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,240
That's Dezhu.

252
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,480
Even Jade Man

253
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,960
she's a descendant of a prominent family.

254
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,919
In the hearts of women,

255
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,759
from this point,

256
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:53,759
If I don't win by half.

257
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,279
In addition,

258
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,519
xiaorou is the daughter

259
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,840
she's the daughter of the Sect Leader.

260
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:58,799
They two

261
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,200
are actually well-matched

262
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,679
you are what?

263
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,720
It's all my fault,

264
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,159
I'd stop burning paper for them.

265
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,960
Dezhu,

266
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,840
have you made up your mind?

267
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,399
Not figured it out?

268
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,480
Why don't you have salt?

269
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,360
Dragon born dragon born phoenix born phoenix.

270
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,919
A mouse child knows how to make holes.

271
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,159
Just accept it.

272
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,679
You can't defeat Yu Lang.

273
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,919
She's a descendant of a prominent family.

274
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,519
Does he say he's the descendant of a famous family?

275
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,120
I'd even say I was the descendant of a good family.

276
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,679
Who are you?

277
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,000
Of Zhao Yun.

278
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,919
Have you finished?

279
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,279
When you finished?

280
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,240
No, I wasn't.

281
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,720
Does anyone believe that thing?

282
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,000
I will.

283
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,879
What's the use of that?

284
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,559
That is too big.

285
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,360
Can Xiaorou believe it?

286
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,639
How about Zhao Zilong?

287
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,080
Not alone?

288
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,360
Is it a test?

289
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,559
Where's Zhao Benshan?

290
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:06,360
Zhao Benshan?

291
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,240
Who's Zhao Benshan?

292
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,200
I don't even know him.

293
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,399
You can't recognize him?

294
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,679
Can Xiaorou know her?

295
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,440
Why are you becoming a minority?

296
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,679
Find a good guy.

297
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,840
About the same.

298
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,639
Zhao is the only one left.

299
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,759
Zhao.

300
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,519
Zhao what?

301
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,200
In my opinion,

302
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,279
but you still want to move to a famous family.

303
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,440
Say it out?

304
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,360
Xiaorou will be frightened.

305
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:35,080
I can find the information.

306
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,879
Let me handle this.

307
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,559
Younger Brother.

308
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,000
Have some water.

309
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,519
Thanks.

310
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:02,720
Hey.

311
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,440
Everybody is here

312
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,240
second Brother, why did you come to us?

313
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,440
No more Second Brother.

314
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,559
Call me

315
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,399
master Zhao, right?

316
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,080
This

317
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,679
I'm also very excited.

318
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,519
Just now,

319
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:19,559
I accidentally found

320
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,759
on the genealogy of our Zhao family.

321
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,639
It frightens me

322
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,679
you scared me.

323
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,960
I didn't expect that our Zhao family

324
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,080
Is a distinguished family.

325
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,399
You're going to be a high-ranking official.

326
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,240
Do you want to say something?

327
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,279
You really hid it well.

328
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,360
It never occurred to me.

329
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,240
I've never heard of

330
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,600
you have a genealogical tree?

331
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,080
I just found it.

332
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,159
Have a look.

333
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,559
After reading it,

334
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,679
don't spread rumors.

335
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,279
Keep a low profile?

336
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,919
That's too low-key.

337
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,759
Right.

338
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,000
From Zhao Deliang.

339
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,399
Zhao Dedong,

340
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,919
zhao Dezhu.

341
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,240
Those two are my brothers.

342
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,440
Zhao Yi.

343
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,799
Zhao Two.

344
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,279
Zhao San.

345
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,159
These three

346
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,679
are my uncle.

347
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,080
He's my father's generation.

348
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,000
According to

349
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,720
by these numbers.

350
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,120
Your father.

351
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,879
Brothers.

352
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,120
Four.

353
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,519
If I'm right,

354
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,840
your father's name is Zhao Si.

355
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,320
You're wrong.

356
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,759
Fifth of Zhao.

357
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,840
Where's Zhao Si?

358
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:38,960
He died young.

359
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,480
Is it well folded?

360
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,639
You guessed wrong.

361
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,080
Turn back.

362
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,000
Turn back to the root.

363
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,159
Prime Minister Zhao Gao.

364
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,639
You didn't expect this, right?

365
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,039
To see me?

366
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,679
You scared?

367
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,519
Zhao Gao,

368
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:03,159
Is the work

369
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,079
you have a great background.

370
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,480
You've hidden your talent all along.

371
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
Hold on.

372
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,440
Yes

373
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
qin Dynasty.

374
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,799
The Prime Minister, Zhao Gao.

375
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,799
It's confirmed?

376
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,880
Really?

377
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,160
That's right.

378
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,200
Right.

379
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,000
According to my understanding,

380
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,079
according to The History of Qin Shi Huang,

381
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:31,839
that Zhao Gao

382
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,799
he started his business as a eunuch.

383
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,359
Eunuch

384
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,359
you must be mistaken.

385
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,279
How could you be a eunuch?

386
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,440
If it's an eunuch,

387
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,839
he was made the prime minister first,

388
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,000
and then I was a eunuch.

389
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,920
You may check it out.

390
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,519
How did you do that?

391
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,000
I only guessed.

392
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:56,880
Just randomly investigate.

393
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,519
So terrible to be uneducated.

394
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,240
Younger Brother

395
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,440
you're awesome.

396
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,759
You're the descendant of a eunuch.

397
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:26,680
The matter just now

398
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,720
It's indeed Ling Xiao's fault.

399
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:30,960
Careless!

400
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,960
Who else could Old Zhao have?

401
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,240
Please stop.

402
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,519
It's so embarrassing.

403
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,880
I was thinking for Dezhu.

404
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,359
He won't blame me.

405
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,599
Look at that.

406
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,720
He wasn't angry.

407
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:53,039
That's Dezhu.

408
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,960
Sister-in-law knows

409
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,039
you don't know girls enough.

410
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,799
If you want to chase a girl,

411
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,359
you need to use the methods.

412
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,720
You have to find a way

413
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,160
to cater to her.

414
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,880
Satisfy her?

415
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,799
And cater to their pleasure.

416
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,119
She will feel happy

417
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,319
won't that be the end?

418
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Father.

419
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
Father.

420
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,359
Your room is too remote.

421
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,400
Besides, it's so shabby.

422
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,200
How come people live here?

423
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,319
Come back with me.

424
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:25,880
Can you?

425
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,799
Why not?

426
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,839
Why not?

427
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:29,839
Father.

428
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:32,079
So you can leave the sect's business too?

429
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,440
What can I do?

430
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,200
What can I do?

431
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,279
What?

432
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,000
Then my Second Brother

433
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,799
staying at home all day

434
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,920
not even practicing martial arts.

435
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,039
Keeps following me every day.

436
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:39,960
Don't you care about him?

437
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,799
Your second brother

438
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,599
hasn't fought well since childhood.

439
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,359
I wonder how you've raised him.

440
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,000
What should I do now?

441
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,839
What should I do now?

442
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,880
And spouting nonsense to us?

443
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,119
She's having

444
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,240
that would be a bad thing.

445
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,160
Are you sure you won't go back?

446
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,880
Why would I go back?

447
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,079
You can't go back.

448
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,079
Our sect

449
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,720
Isn't that Auntie Gongsun here?

450
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,119
She's not here.

451
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,599
I'm wondering why.

452
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:07,559
Pestering her.

453
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,400
Why does she...

454
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,880
- What's going on? - Get there.

455
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,480
What on earth happened?

456
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,319
What's the matter with you?

457
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:15,440
Aunt Gongsun was here before.

458
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,960
You two quarreled every time she came here.

459
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,839
It's Aunty Gongsun who got mad

460
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,720
she got mad and ran away.

461
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,400
Why did you run away this time?

462
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,960
She's scary.

463
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,960
Father.

464
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,039
How did you become so timid now?

465
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:29,319
The Tenth Elder of Sect surrounded us.

466
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,599
But you were never so scared.

467
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,400
You were still playing chess calmly in the room.

468
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,680
You are watching an old lady

469
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,839
to frighten you like this? Why?

470
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,440
I'm running out of time.

471
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,599
I am not possessed anymore.

472
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,720
Nothing now?

473
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,279
Keep this a secret.

474
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,799
Don't let her know I'm here.

475
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,359
They're coming.

476
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,640
They'll put me on the tree.

477
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,720
Didn't you see that?

478
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,319
She just wanted to take me down.

479
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:49,720
I might lose my virginity.

480
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,240
That's right.

481
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,880
Aunty Gongsun is so annoying.

482
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,039
She's so annoying.

483
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,319
Alright, Father.

484
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,160
Stay here for a couple of days and cool down, okay?

485
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:58,160
Alright.

486
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,440
Enough.

487
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,559
Dad, stop peeling potatoes.

488
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,640
Stop cooking.

489
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,839
I'll bring you food later in the evening.

490
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:03,319
Then I'll bring it.

491
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,359
I'll personally prepare some food.

492
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,079
I'm leaving, Dad.

493
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:06,359
Alright.

494
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,480
Take care of yourself.

495
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,160
Alright.

496
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,680
You'd better be careful.

497
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,960
Keep it a secret?

498
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,079
What do you put on a broken fan when eating?

499
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,920
I'm trying to lose weight.

500
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,559
Eat.

501
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,480
Xiaorou,

502
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,480
why are you watching?

503
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,680
You two eat first.

504
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,839
Let me look for a while.

505
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:36,079
This is the latest comic strip.

506
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,200
They're beautiful.

507
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,799
Does that earn you food?

508
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,440
You don't know.

509
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,880
Master Yang here

510
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,880
Is so charming.

511
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,359
Especially the part with Little Dragon Girl.

512
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:49,880
Brother.

513
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,200
Before you go, dress up.

514
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,720
You will be more handsome than Yang Guo.

515
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,359
Senior Sister,

516
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,519
that's too much.

517
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,799
I'm not comparable with others.

518
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,799
Your Second Brother looks handsome too.

519
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:05,519
Junior Sister,

520
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,920
you like Yang Guo, right?

521
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:09,799
That's right.

522
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,440
Alright.

523
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:34,279
Who is this?

524
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,759
He's Yang Guo.

525
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,640
This is so cool.

526
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,279
So handsome that I cried.

527
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,519
I couldn't recognize myself.

528
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,200
So Yang Guo and I

529
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,079
I only needed two strips of cloth.

530
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:50,920
He has grey hair.

531
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:51,920
Honey,

532
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,920
how can you make such a good cook?

533
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,119
Stop crying.

534
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,599
Stop crying.

535
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:58,640
Coward.

536
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,039
She fascinated herself

537
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,559
and cried with joy.

538
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,079
Alright.

539
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,440
That's good.

540
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,839
I got it this time.

541
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,480
That's not right.

542
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,200
Sister-in-law.

543
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,519
What's wrong?

544
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,480
What's wrong?

545
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,599
Yang Guo has one arm.

546
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,839
We two...

547
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,000
Honey, leave it to me.

548
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,960
Sit, brother.

549
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,599
Give me that!

550
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,279
Stop!

551
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,680
What are you doing?

552
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,319
Forcing you to call on me.

553
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:37,880
By the way,

554
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,640
give him some anesthetic.

555
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:40,559
It's fine, Sister-in-law.

556
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:41,599
I can handle this.

557
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,799
Are you two Biao?

558
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,880
You can hide your arms.

559
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,319
Why didn't I think of that?

560
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,079
That's right.

561
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,319
Aunty.

562
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:54,720
Aunty.

563
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,640
My son.

564
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,880
It's me.

565
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,920
Aunty,

566
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,799
If you were to die,

567
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,519
I'll stay with you.

568
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,200
I promise you that

569
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,039
I won't let you be alone.

570
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,880
Instead of being busy

571
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,799
and fight hard,

572
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:28,599
how about we just

573
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:30,599
a quiet,

574
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,799
quietly and quietly.

575
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,559
Aunty.

576
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,440
My son.

577
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,640
Aunty,

578
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,640
over the past sixteen years,

579
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,200
I've been searching for you,

580
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,079
to find you.

581
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,359
I'm so happy that

582
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,440
I won't be so lonely.

583
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,960
Brother Diao,

584
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,960
where are you?

585
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,319
Where are you?

586
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,079
Come out!

587
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,799
First Brother.

588
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,599
Second Brother.

589
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,079
What are you doing?

590
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,720
Can one of you be human?

591
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,440
Scram!

592
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,559
This...

593
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,039
Xiaorou.

594
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:30,160
What a kid.

595
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,960
Isn't it

596
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,680
to make you happy, right?

597
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,400
My sculpture was a failure?

598
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,279
The silly statue.

599
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
Silly statue.

600
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:03,279
Honey, what are these fillings?

601
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,200
Just eat it.

602
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,720
Younger Brother.

603
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:05,839
Eat more.

604
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,880
The dumplings made by sister-in-law are delicious.

605
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,720
Thank you, Senior Sister.

606
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:10,480
Eat that.

607
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,559
Why are you making such a fuss?

608
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,400
Dezhu.

609
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,839
Eat dumplings with vinegar,

610
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,920
not jealous?

611
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,079
I'm jealous sometimes.

612
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:27,000
I feel nauseated.

613
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,319
Let me eat.

614
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,599
I will take it myself.

615
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,640
What are you doing?

616
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:41,839
It's not good?

617
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
I'm full now.

618
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,640
That's great!

619
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:47,519
My father has not eaten yet.

620
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,000
I'll take the dumplings to him.

621
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,240
Hey.

622
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,440
Please eat more.

623
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,119
That's enough, Senior.

624
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,160
Please have more.

625
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,559
As long as my father has a few.

626
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,319
Take some for Master.

627
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,200
Not the half plate.

628
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,880
Can my master eat this half of dumplings?

629
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,759
Pick up more.

630
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,079
Younger Brother, I'm leaving.

631
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,559
Senior brother, here.

632
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,720
Have more.

633
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,640
It's tasty.

634
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,160
Come on.

635
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,880
What is this?

636
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,680
You're really something.

637
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,759
You're so scheming.

638
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,359
Brother.

639
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,200
Why do I not understand

640
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,200
what you said.

641
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:33,960
No, I can't.

642
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:36,920
I'll let you know then.

643
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,279
Brother.

644
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,640
What do you mean?

645
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
What do I mean?

646
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:48,519
I want to have a fight with you.

647
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,079
Enough.

648
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,400
I'm right here.

649
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:51,119
What war?

650
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:51,720
Shut up!

651
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,519
Control him.

652
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,480
Dezhu.

653
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,519
Master said not to fight.

654
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:02,599
You know what, Dezhu?

655
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,559
Wars are wars.

656
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,960
This is a restaurant.

657
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,039
Don't you

658
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:10,319
go to Chick Rock?

659
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,119
If you go there,

660
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,039
you are a real man!

661
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,559
If you don't dare to go,

662
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,960
you're a woman!

663
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,000
I will call you

664
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,000
I'll call you Youngest Sister.

665
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,559
If that's the case,

666
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,519
brother.

667
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:36,160
I'll play with you.

668
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,039
Come on.

669
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:40,519
Dezhu.

670
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,200
Learn from each other. Okay.

671
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,319
You can't use the black hand, you hear me?

672
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,119
These two kids

673
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:51,599
they are doing it because of a girl.

674
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,039
Why are you so ambitious?

675
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,240
Let's go and have a look.

676
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:00,880
What are we going to see if I'm not full?

677
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,640
All you care about is eating.

678
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,079
Come on.

679
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,200
Come on.

680
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,160
Right here.

681
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,279
Brother.

682
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,480
I think

683
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,160
jade Man, you have great ability

684
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,920
why did you two fight?

685
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,279
Stop looking around, Dezhu.

686
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,240
Who's that?

687
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,680
He fell off the tree.

688
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,319
Hurry and pick him up.

689
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,720
And killed your second brother.

690
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,440
Who are you?

691
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,119
I really can't help.

692
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,440
I have dumplings in my hands.

693
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,200
All you care about is eating.

694
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:53,799
Moral pillar.

695
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:55,480
Moral pillar!

696
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,240
Moral pillar.
