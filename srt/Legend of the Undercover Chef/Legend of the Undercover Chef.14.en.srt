1
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,680
Brother.

2
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,070
The ones I find for you

3
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,590
all are top martial arts masters.

4
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,590
This

5
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,400
the strong man of Luosha Kingdom.

6
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,310
This

7
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,710
the Mongolian wrestling king.

8
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,800
This is

9
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,190
the No. 1 martial arts master in Tibet.

10
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,280
What's their price?

11
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,710
50 taels of silver per person is enough.

12
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,120
That's too expensive.

13
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,630
Can't you give them a discount?

14
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,960
It's useless to bargain with them.

15
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,710
This is a foreigner.

16
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,080
Can't understand what you're saying?

17
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,870
Just give me the money.

18
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,680
They're in charge.

19
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,750
If I communicate with them,

20
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,310
they're the only ones who can help us.

21
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,560
Hold on.

22
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,120
Who are you?

23
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,630
This is

24
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,960
japanese ninja.

25
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
Kametian Ichiro

26
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
what's up?

27
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,870
I heard that you

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,030
Is hiring experts.

29
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,280
I'd like to help

30
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,150
a helping hand

31
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,520
how much is it?

32
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,910
I don't want money.

33
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,590
Then Brother-in-law drive him out.

34
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,430
This is not business.

35
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,590
But this must be a swindler.

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,080
Any trick you have?

37
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,310
He's awesome.

38
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Can you show

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,710
your true colors?

40
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,590
It's you!

41
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,910
Master Gao,

42
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,190
sorry for the embarrassment.

43
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,030
Move to the side.

44
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,840
Que Blade Sect is here.

45
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,360
Pull over.

46
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,960
Move to the side!

47
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,840
Pull back now!

48
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,520
Back off!

49
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,430
Why are you shouting?

50
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,310
Hero Ximen.

51
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,560
Hero Ximen, do you still know me?

52
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,000
No signature.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,750
Chase him away.

54
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,520
This is Jiang Weigang.

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,630
The leader of Heavenly Sword Sect.

56
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,470
Jiang Weigang,

57
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,520
I've never heard of him.

58
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,360
Don't you remember?

59
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,910
You and Gongsun Lirong were back then,

60
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,630
you should do whatever you want.

61
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,150
Keep to the side.

62
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,120
Move it!

63
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,910
Move to the side!

64
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,520
Leave now!

65
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,120
Master!

66
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,630
Master.

67
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,870
Hurry. Get up.

68
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,480
What's up

69
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,360
father.

70
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,160
The stool is not strong

71
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,830
what's with the quality?

72
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,510
What's with these people?

73
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,720
Master.

74
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,000
They are from Emei Sect.

75
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,830
Master.

76
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,310
They are the Lonely Sect.

77
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,120
Consisting of 108 women,

78
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,240
for every woman,

79
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,800
with a few lives.

80
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,360
Were their husbands.

81
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,120
I heard their master

82
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,950
he's very shocked.

83
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,430
More than 20 husbands.

84
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,510
Stay away from loneliness.

85
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,560
And cherish life.

86
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,680
Stay away from them.

87
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,600
Stay away.

88
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,190
Father.

89
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,360
What are they doing, Dezhu?

90
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,040
I forgot it.

91
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,390
Oh, I forgot about it.

92
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,120
Please.

93
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,120
I'm alright.

94
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,630
My life is tough.

95
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,120
Let me do it.

96
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,750
Younger Brother.

97
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,120
Look at that.

98
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,190
Look at that guy.

99
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,390
The whole time.

100
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,480
That's the clan master of Huilong Sect.

101
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,750
Meng yellow millet.

102
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,040
I heard that he can sleep for half a year.

103
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,560
His martial arts skills are unfathomable.

104
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,120
People call her

105
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,160
guandong.

106
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,720
Sleepy Dragon.

107
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,160
Sleepy Dragon?

108
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,390
He can beat Tyrannosaurus Rex.

109
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,800
Scare him to death.

110
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,120
Come here.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,160
This sword

112
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,750
Is my favorite one.

113
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,630
I'll give it to you today.

114
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,870
Thank you, Master.

115
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,310
Since when?

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,680
It's already one hour late.

117
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,390
They said that

118
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,270
a mysterious person

119
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,950
a mysterious person is coming.

120
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,680
It should be waiting for him.

121
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,310
Heroes from all over the world

122
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,310
gathered in Liaodong

123
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,040
to make friends with martial arts.

124
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,870
Through all eternity

125
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,120
sound travels far.

126
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,360
Guandong's first

127
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,120
the Sword Debate in Changbai Mountain.

128
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,560
It is here

129
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,720
Is held here.

130
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,750
Welcome all of you

131
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,240
to your presence.

132
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,830
As the saying goes,

133
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,800
two happy events come one after the other

134
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,070
today, we

135
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,190

136
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,950
a special guest.

137
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,160
Let's welcome

138
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,270
eunuch Cao, director of East Factory

139
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,950
eunuch Cao!

140
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,190
Eunuch Cao,

141
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,430
thousands of miles

142
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,830
from the capital to Liaodong.

143
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,720
He's also taking time

144
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,390
to hold such a grand contest

145
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,190
for Guandong Martial Art Circle.

146
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,040
This is

147
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,070
the honor

148
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,480
please give your applause

149
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,310
to our beloved

150
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,040
eunuch Cao!

151
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,720
Eunuch Cao!

152
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,040
Eunuch Cao,

153
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,560
you too...

154
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,510
To him?

155
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,000
No need.

156
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,310
We're just

157
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,430
so I came here to watch the fun.

158
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,430
Today we

159
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,680
of Guandong martial arts circles today.

160
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,480
Eunuch Cao,

161
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,870
how concise

162
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,800
straight talk from an honest man

163
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,560
good point.

164
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,000
Then,

165
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,680
then

166
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,680
It has started!

167
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,920
Let's do this.

168
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,920
This time,

169
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,750
we will use

170
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,120
elimination.

171
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,830
There's a token

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,430
will have a token.

173
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,480
The one

174
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,270
who snatches the opponent's token

175
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,390
will be promoted

176
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,510
next round

177
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,750
the loser

178
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,310
will be eliminated directly.

179
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,560
The one

180
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,830
the one who wins

181
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,950
will be

182
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,190
the current

183
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,480
guandong Alliance's Chief

184
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,040
the enemy is invisible.

185
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,950
Don't injure him.

186
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:27,950
Next,

187
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,870
In order of grouping,

188
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,800
the first round.

189
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,870
First round,

190
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,720
chopsticks competition.

191
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,510
Qingcheng School.

192
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,750
Great.

193
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,080
The competition starts now.

194
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,840
The two contestants

195
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,080
very cool.

196
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,510
Qingcheng School took the lead.

197
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,270
As the saying goes,

198
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,000
every inch is long,

199
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,790
every inch is strong,

200
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,670
short,

201
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,750
and dangerous.

202
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,910
Look at that.

203
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,870
The athlete of Chopsticks

204
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,870
won the token,

205
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,080
Is like getting things out of pocket.

206
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,270
For the first round,

207
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,120
chopsticks won!

208
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,840
Who is our first battle?

209
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,000
The first battle is

210
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,320
ten Thousand Horses Hall of Liaodong.

211
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,910
They're quite well known.

212
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,440
Just wait and see.

213
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,080

Battle.

216
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,510
Thunderclap Hall!

217
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,720
Alright.

218
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,360
Alright.

219
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
The two competitors

220
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,510
the weapons

221
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,790
were all

222
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,440
to the west of the city.

223
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,320
Pockmarked Wang's blacksmith shop.

224
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,120
For twenty years.

225
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,240
Of originality.

226
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,320
Neither the old nor the young will be cheated

227
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,960
the game has been decided

228
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,510
before the result was known.

229
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,200
Thunderclap Hall!

230
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,670
Won!

231
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,200
Alright.

232
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,000
Aren't we playing "catch the chicken"?

233
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,910
Alright.

234
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,240
The third round

235
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,600
the Que Blade Sect

236
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,630
fight

237
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,630
haisha Gang.

238
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,390
How about

239
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,440
who?

240
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,200
Who is going?

241
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,790
Master.

242
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,150
Haisha Gang?

243
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,440
I have fought with them before.

244
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,360
For this round,

245
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,120
I will do it.

246
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,440
Come on.

247
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,510
Dezhu, cheer for me!

248
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,510
Good for you, Dezhu.

249
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,030
Players from Que Blade School have good posture.

250
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:39,870
Why are you so pleased?

251
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,840
Are you gonna fight or not?

252
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,480
You've died for four times just now.

253
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,790
Watch your tongue out when you talk big.

254
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,390
You won't shed tears

255
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,550
until you see the coffin.

256
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,790
What a fast knife.

257
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,910
The cold light is flashing.

258
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,630
It's

259
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,000
one's eyes are not clear and one's heart confused

260
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,150
que Blade Gate

261
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,120
won.

262
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,480
I will take this opportunity

263
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,080
on behalf of all competitors,

264
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,360
to the host officials once again

265
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,150
eunuch Cao,

266
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,960
my sincerest gratitude and respect to you.

267
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,240
The Que Blade Sect

268
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,510
Is kind of interesting.

269
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,790
Master.

270
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,480
Dezhu.

271
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,030
You must take it.

272
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,360
Second Brother, you are awesome!

273
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,870
Great!

274
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,360
Alright.

275
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:40,840
Enough.

276
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,270
That's why I tried so hard.

277
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,120
In the fourth round,

278
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,440
the Tianchi Gang

279
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,240
fight.

280
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,720
Ten Horses Hall of Liaodong

281
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,030
go to all lengths

282
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,000
please rest assured.

283
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,870
The atmosphere here

284
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,080
confront each other with daggers

285
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,080
eunuch Cao,

286
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,600
the two contestants

287
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,390
the great interest

288
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,510
the Second Young Master.

289
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,120
What do you mean?

290
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,320
Only one move decides the winner.

291
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,840
This kid is pretty vicious.

292
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,270
Tianchi Gang

293
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,390
won!

294
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,080
Great. Great.

295
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,670
It's done. Right away.

296
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,360
Since when has he such an awesome apprentice?

297
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,000
I've never seen this move before.

298
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,910
Brother!

299
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,600
The chief is safe now.

300
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,510
The game continues.

301
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,910
The battle is fierce.

302
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,320
The martial art circle can have such a grand meeting

303
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,240
was supported by Eunuch Cao.

304
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,480
As the saying goes,

305
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,670
changbai Mountain gathering experts

306
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,910
eunuch Cao is the head of

307
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,910
mount Tai and Big Dipper

308
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,320
the Que Blade Master

309
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,000
he looks so good.

310
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,270
Bulletproof.

311
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,200
Horizontal Martial Arts.

312
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,000
The Magpie Blade Gate wins.

313
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,870
Great.

314
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,510
How is it, Master?

315
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,600
Nothing.

316
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,000
Is your iron head skill good?

317
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,120
Come here, wife.

318
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,910
Eldest Brother, you are awesome.

319
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
Hold this.

320
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,030
Got it.

321
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,150
Seriously?

322
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,750
He's so stubborn.

323
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,080
Next round,

324
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,390
dragon Sect.

325
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,440
Battle.

326
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,750
Thunderclap Hall.

327
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,440
A contestant from Dragon Sect

328
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,790
he just lied down.

329
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,720
And he snored.

330
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,080
No, it's not right.

331
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,360
He seems to be sleeping.

332
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,200
But in fact

333
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,480
this is your hidden motive.

334
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:03,870
You're sleeping.

335
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,120
How can they fight?

336
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,870
Master,

337
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,870
this is the Sleeping Lohan Boxing.

338
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,600
Lie down and win.

339
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,840
That's what I'm talking about, right?

340
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,320
Dragon Sect

341
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,440
won!

342
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,720
Great!

343
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,910
This is victory!

344
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,790
Lonely Sect has a beautiful female player.

345
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,320
What a pity.

346
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,030
Alright.

347
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,720
This kid is really good at this.

348
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,550
Great.

349
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,240
The player from Que Blade Sect

350
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,870
he seems

351
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,510
they are young,

352
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,600
he is weak.

353
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,200
But his body and movement are nimble.

354
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,790
His movements

355
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,480
dashing.

356
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,550
Looks and moves

357
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,150
are competing for the chief.

358
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,120
The Que Blade Sect

359
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,150
won.

360
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,150
Great!

361
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,790
Eunuch.

362
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,030
Que Blade Sect won again.

363
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,790
Master.

364
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,510
So handsome!

365
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,630
Cool.

366
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,720
Next round,

367
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
the Tianchi Gang

368
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,670
fight.

369
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,080
Dragon Sect?

370
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,360
Alright.

371
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,150
What a pity!

372
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,150
The opponent is too strong.

373
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,000
The Dragon Sect's players

374
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,320
failed to win.

375
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,240
Alright.

376
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,320
This guy is too good.

377
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,240
Showing off.

378
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,790
We've finally arrived

379
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,120
the highly anticipated final.

380
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,750
And

381
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,240
the competition,

382
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,360
In the end,

383
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,150
the final battle is

384
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,000
tian Chi Gang.

385
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,390
The Que Blade Sect.

386
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:06,790
Great.

387
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,440
Alright.

388
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,120
Tian Chi Gang

389
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,150
to win!

390
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,910
The Heavenly Pond Gang shall win.

391
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,200
The Que Blade Sect will win.

392
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,240
One or two wins.

393
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,270
Come on, Master!

394
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,360
Alright.

395
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,240
For the victory!

396
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,080
The Que Blade Sect must win!

397
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,240
What's the name

398
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,840
what's his name?

399
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,000
Inform Eunuch Qiu.

400
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,510
I heard from Master Gao

401
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,030
that his name is Ximen Changhai.

402
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,720
His martial arts

403
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,240
have no bottom

404
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,630
the Que Blade Sect

405
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,240
will win!

406
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,960
I want to test it.

407
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,750
The Que Blade Sect

408
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,510
for the victory!

409
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,670
Next is

410
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,360
Is our ultimate battle.

411
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,750
Just now,

412
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,670
our great Eunuch Cao

413
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,270
comes up with a new idea.

414
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,000
Will be the ultimate battle.

415
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,480
The two Sect Leaders

416
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,550
will personally

417
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,360
fighting.

418
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,270
Sect Leader.

419
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,320
Change the plan.

420
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,390
I've fixed it.

421
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,360
I don't want to do it.

422
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,630
Master.

423
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,750
That tall hairy guy

424
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,720
that little toy.

425
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,720
Both of your mouths are enough to scare him to death.

426
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,880
I'm useless.

427
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,070
You don't know that?

428
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
Master,

429
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,880
with his diary,

430
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,240
he can be trampled to death by your feet.

431
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,400
Why are you afraid of him?

432
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,200
If you just stand there,

433
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,400
with that strong presence.

434
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,270
Do you look down on him?

435
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,000
He laughs at you.

436
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:18,880
Are you trying to provoke me?

437
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,200
Master.

438
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,590
Beat him!

439
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,160
Master, you must be looking down on him.

440
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,160
What are you talking about?

441
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,480
Master of Que Blade Sect

442
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,790
to the stage.

443
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,750
Que Blade Sect.

444
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,880
Master, good luck! Don't be afraid of him!

445
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,310
Climb! Master!

446
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:43,960
Fighting!

447
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,510
Master!

448
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,510
Master!

449
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,830
Master, fighting!

450
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,750
Good luck!

451
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,830
Please.

452
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,920
How about a symbolic gesture?

453
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,310
Stop. It's boring as hell.

454
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,160
Master provoked him.

455
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,720
Master comforted him because...

456
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,880
After you, please.

457
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,510
No need to fight.

458
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,480
Who will win then?

459
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,160
You win.

460
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,550
You're still laughing.

461
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,030
Or cry later.

462
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,350
Please.

463
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,200
Leader of Tian Chi Gang.

464
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,750

Get on the stage.

466
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,240
I announce,

467
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,680

470
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,510

471
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,550
From now on.

472
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,200
From now on,

473
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,310
he is

474
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,160
the latest generation

475
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,590
the newest generation

476
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,790
chief.

477
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,920
No, I can't.

478
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,200
-I... -Me too.

479
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
-I will also have disciples. -Oh!

00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,920
Sect Leader Ximen.

481
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,200
According to the rules,

482
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,270
you're already on stage.

483
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,350
No passing down the throne.

484
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:01,640
Then it's over.

485
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,160
The match

486
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,880
starts now.

487
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,680
Wait a second.

488
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,400
I won't fight with you!

489
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,920
I... I also have disciples.

490
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,400
Master, don't hesitate.

491
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,160
Pass it to me.

492
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,240
The Pillar of Virtue.

493
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,400
Dad, be careful!

494
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,240
I announce that

495
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,000

497
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,830

498
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,550
Father.

499
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,480
Father.

500
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,590
Great!

501
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,960
Master.

502
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,200

504
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,590
Is this called roundabout way?

505
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,240
Double Body, right?

506
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,270
Dad, you are awesome.

507
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,270

Pass it to me, Master.

509
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,590
I want to learn.

510
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,310
I can't learn it.

511
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,640
Master, please teach me.

512
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,750
I can suffer.

513
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,200
That's useless.

514
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,720
Everyone.

515
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,200
Please rest at ease off the stage.

516
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,590

525
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,790

591
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,270
We should

592
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,590
be concerned about one's country and one's people

593
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,070
we worked together to fight against them

594
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,200
to protect our families,

595
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,110
and defend our country.

596
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,030
Great!

597
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,720
Then

598
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,960
eunuch Cao for instruction.

599
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
I will stop here.

600
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,030
You are right.

601
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,270
It's time to go.

602
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,880
Eunuch Cao, wait.

603
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,480
I think the master of Que Dao Sect

604
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,000
Isn't quite satisfied

605
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,240
with his award?

606
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,000
What?

607
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,440
He always

608
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,590
to trade places with me.

609
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,310
I refuse.

610
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,550
He wants to trade with me.

611
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,640
I don't want to do it.

612
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,640
Sect Leader Ximen.

613
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,920
You've still got a plan.

614
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,440
Eunuch Cao,

615
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,590
we have one last session.

616
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,240
Go on.

617
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,480
That's right. Please

618
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,270
to have a photo taken

619
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,240
with our award-winning Master.

620
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,070
To remember.

621
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,000
Alright.

622
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,030
Painters, please

623
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,400
everyone.

624
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,440
This is the end of

625
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,550
ends here.
