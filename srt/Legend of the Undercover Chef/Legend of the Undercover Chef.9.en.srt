1
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,510
Master.

2
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,070
Where have you been these days?

3
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,840
You gave us quite a lot of worries.

4
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,920
Don't mention it.

5
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,310
It's exhausting.

6
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,280
There's something

7
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,910
a lot has happened recently.

8
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,680
You've become a child again.

9
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,840
We're worried you might be caught by bad guys.

10
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,190
I'm back now.

11
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,590
What are you afraid of?

12
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,560
Have you heard

13
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,280
there's a fugitive in the underworld.

14
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,240
His name is Oriental Mold.

15
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,000
Caught by him.

16
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,560
Stealing children.

17
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,360
Providence will not forgive

18
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,280
you should arrest her.

19
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,750
That's right.

20
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
There's something more unusual.

21
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,280
Tell me now.

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,360
What exactly is going on?

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,360
He is a child when he sleeps.

24
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,710
But you become an old man after midnight.

25
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,190
And you let him sleep next to me.

26
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,030
What are you thinking about?

27
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,190
I'm the tiger?

28
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,960
As the leader of Heavenly Pond Gang,

29
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,310
carrying the kid out at midnight,

30
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,630
and bring Ximen Changhai back.

31
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,430
Let Ximen Changhai hold you while you sleep.

32
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,840
Why would I want to do that?

33
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
I'll be embarrassed if this gets out.

34
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,430
Who opened the door for him?

35
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,520
Was that you?

36
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,910
I was out for the bathroom.

37
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,310
Or else

38
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,400
I don't know someone's lying here.

39
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,400
How did he come in?

40
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,310
Enough.

41
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,400
Don't you have to tell me anything?

42
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,030
I'm going back to my parents' place

43
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,750
and I won't come back again!

44
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,630
My goodness!

45
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,360
He is really something.

46
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,030
Who is so shameless?

47
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,000
I heard that old man is not far away from us.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,120
There aren't many people

49
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,800
nearby

50
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,120
master.

51
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,520
There are many

52
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,630
there are only a few people

53
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,280
as old as you.

54
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,560
You know that old man?

55
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,400
My...

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,430
So what?

57
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,150
Do you know me? I thought you guys

58
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,470
how can you learn like this?

59
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,680
Don't gossip.

60
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,120
Behind others.

61
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,400
Everyone has grown old.

62
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,030
Right?

63
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,240
What's more,

64
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,750
tall guy and his wife don't match.

65
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,360
It's a long way from that.

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,800
You'll score anyway.

67
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,680
I only ask you one thing.

68
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,360
The day we part,

69
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,310
you brought his wife here?

70
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,310
You'll fulfill your master.

71
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,910
Master, what's wrong with you?

72
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,840
What's wrong with me?

73
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,240
You picked up everything.

74
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,400
That's not leakage.

75
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,750
Do you want to pick it up?

76
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,910
Hey,

77
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,470
how can you be crazy?

78
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,030
What do you mean?

79
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,240
I won't involve you in this.

80
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,680
Please?

81
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,080
The day you married her back,

82
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,680
I would embarrass you guys.

83
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,590
I'll go out with her.

84
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,720
We'll open a restaurant.

85
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,310
If I leave the clan of martial arts,

86
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,120
are you alright?

87
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,000
Not right.

88
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,750
Something happened here.

89
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,000
Master.

90
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,040
If my guess is right,

91
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,600
this old man

92
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,560
Is younger than you.

93
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,720
If you are right,

94
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,160
that old man is me.

95
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,310
Ximen Changhai.

96
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,160
What's up

97
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,160
I have no idea either.

98
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,510
Why are you yelling?

99
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,920
Where's my son?

100
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
How would I know?

101
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,120
It's embarrassing.

102
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,750
Brother-in-law!

103
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,560
Brother-in-law!

104
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,680
Get up and take the medicine.

105
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,070
I feel so depressed.

106
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,720
What's the use of holding that down?

107
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,750
Cheer up!

108
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,750
Let's seek revenge against Ximen Changhai.

109
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,240
I can't defeat him.

110
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,510
I know.

111
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,510
But we are rich.

112
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,360
Bro

113
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,480
we can hire someone to do it.

114
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,750
Who?

115
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,920
There is the most powerful combination in the world now.

116
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,510
Called the 12 Devils of Mohe.

117
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,070
They are called Cultivators of Martial Arts.

118
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,920
Of martial arts.

119
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,160
Fish farm?

120
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,720
What fish?

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,040
People doing this.

122
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,240
Killing fish.

123
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,480
Kill people.

124
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,800
He's really strange.

125
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,630
Twelve of us,

126
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,040
and most of them are martial arts masters.

127
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,120
Let's go to them.

128
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,950
Go find them then.

129
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,630
Alright.

130
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,870
But that's expensive.

131
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,720
How much is it?

132
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,750
The price of the underworld.

133
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,000
20 taels of silver per person.

134
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,190
Twelve people.

135
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,160
12 people here?

136
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,120
You can't

137
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,870
It takes two to make a quarrel.

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,600
Your sister thinks you're old too.

139
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,560
I don't want Changhai's life.

140
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,040
He just destroyed his martial arts.

141
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,430
To make it cheaper.

142
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,000
Then I'll have to find someone

143
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,600
to bargain with them.

144
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,070
If that's not enough,

145
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,600
we have to at least ten taels of silver per person.

146
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,630
I have 130 taels of silver.

147
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,190
Brother-in-law, 12 people

148
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,190
this is for you.

149
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,720
Or you'll get kickbacks too.

150
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,430
Bro

151
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,360
am I that kind of person?

152
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,560
Take them back.

153
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,600
Hurry up and get it done.

154
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,720
When this matter is done,

155
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,390
I will be refreshed.

156
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,480
Okay. Don't worry.

157
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,270
Alright.

158
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,390
Take the medicine.

159
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,390
Go on.

160
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,950
You can get the Twelve Devils of Mohe

161
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,750
you can invite the 12 Devils of Mohe.

162
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,120
What about that?

163
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,270
I have no choice.

164
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,240
That's all you gave me.

165
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,310
Just treat it as a favor, okay?

166
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,160
Not this much.

167
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,630
That's a big gap.

168
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,430
How about this?

169
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,480
When it's done,

170
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,120
I invite you to play in Yihong Yard.

171
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,800
That new head board

172
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,070
Is called Floret Butterfly.

173
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,870
She's beautiful then.

174
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,430
Don't...

175
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,070
Don't talk about this with me.

176
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,240
I see that you are so sincere.

177
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,270
And let me help you.

178
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,160
I'll brush my face.

179
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,270
Thank you so much.

180
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,310
Thank you again.

181
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,800
It's just Ximen Changhai.

182
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,950
I'll get some servants to take care of your things.

183
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,830
That's it?

184
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,040
Thanks.

185
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,600
What's her name from Yihong Yard?

186
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,270
Little butterfly?

187
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,040
60 taels of silver.

188
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
I can't do this.

189
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,000
Take this back.

190
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,750
I can't do it.

191
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,510
Hey,

192
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,510
they only give these

193
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,680
to Master Gao?

194
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,950
With them.

195
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,070
As I ran the errand for nothing.

196
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,560
You're a high-ranking agent.

197
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,200
And know so many martial arts masters.

198
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,600
Brush your face.

199
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,240
Try to think of other ways.

200
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,750
Please?

201
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,320
The Eighth Jie of Plum River accepted the face,

202
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,550
the money.

203
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,840
Hey.

204
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,670
Then you must have something good.

205
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,200
Please help me.

206
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,720
When you're done,

207
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,840
I invite you to Yihong Yard.

208
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,240
Is there a new one?

209
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,360
Its name is Little Butterfly.

210
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,150
No matter how old you are,

211
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,270
don't give me the nonsense.

212
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,120
How about this?

213
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,080
I'll just brush your face for you.

214
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,120
Because of me?

215
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,840
I'll find you someone

216
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,320
and the Eight Jie of Plum River.

217
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Is martial arts.

218
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,080
And level.

219
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,200
It's the same.

220
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,360
Who's that?

221
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,550
Six young people in the village.

222
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,870
That's not good.

223
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,840
Three whistles, six whistles and five horse spears?

224
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,240
Are always unreliable.

225
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,670
It was called a big trick.

226
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,390
What is that?

227
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,600
That's six young people in a mountain village.

228
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,150
Not six little whistles

229
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,670
they're the six young warriors hidden in the mountains.

230
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,240
Let's clean up your Kalami.

231
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,440
They are so frivolous.

232
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,550
Master Gao can't do

233
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,790
for you to do well

234
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,390
I'll let you know.

235
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,150
Alright.

236
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,240
That's it.

237
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,390
Take this.

238
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,480
I will arrange for you

239
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,600
I will definitely arrange it for you.

240
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,080
Alright?

241
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,440
Please.

242
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,240
Don't make any flaws.

243
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,750
30 taels of silver?

244
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,630
A little less, right?

245
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,720
We are descendants of a famous clan after all.

246
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,000
The underworld will laugh at us.

247
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,240
I know the three of you

248
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,200
are the descendants of the hero Ke Zhenyao.

249
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,200
But you only have so much in the budget.

250
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,390
I also heard that

251
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,550
are well-known thugs in the world.

252
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,910
I am only thick-skinned.

253
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,600
To invite the three of you?

254
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,360
You have good taste.

255
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,790
You are right to come to us.

256
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,120
But I'm willing to pay

257
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,480
hero.

258
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,440
The market is down now.

259
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,390
The price

260
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,790
Is pretty good.

261
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,240
Alright?

262
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,360
Come find us when you can.

263
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,240
That's fine.

264
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,080
I'm sure they'll be your regular customers.

265
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,910
Brother-in-law!

266
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,550
You are back

267
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,910
have a seat.

268
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,600
How is it?

269
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,080
That's all.

270
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,080
That's right.

271
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,080
How is it?

272
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,080
Does it hurt?

273
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,630
Is he crying?

274
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,870
Pick his hamstring?

275
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,720
Report him? I did that.

276
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,750
It's not that serious yet.

277
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,840
We just found someone.

278
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,840
What are you waiting for?

279
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,240
I won't spend the money?

280
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,240
No discounts?

281
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,750
No discount.

282
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,750
The original price.

283
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,790
The price is...

284
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,910
You

285
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,480
are Master Gao's most trusted disciples.

286
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,720
Master Gao used to be

287
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,750
In Guandong.

288
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,960
It's your honor

289
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,360
to be his disciple.

290
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,600
As the saying goes,

291
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,550
a teacher for a day

292
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,750
Is a father forever.

293
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,030
You should practice martial arts

294
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,000
and then morality.

295
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
And remember the rules.

296
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,750
To repay your kindness.

297
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,870
Please.

298
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,120
Master Gao is giving a lecture.

299
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,080
Big Brother.

300
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,390
We'd better find a guide.

301
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,240
It has been 8 hours.

302
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,120
Second Brother.

303
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,390
The three brothers of our Ke family

304
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,320
are highly skilled in martial arts.

305
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,670
So I get a guide.

306
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,390
Wouldn't it be a joke?

307
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,670
You're right, Lixing.

308
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,360
According to my judgment,

309
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,480
que Blade Gate should be near.

310
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,390
The rest of you

311
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,440
are all my trusted fellows.

312
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,480
My enemy is Ximen Changhai.

313
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,080
Then your enemy

314
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,390
also Simon Changhai.

315
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,720
You will regard me as the Ximen Changhai later.

316
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,550
Show me the rage.

317
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,630
And unleash the hatred.

318
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,270
Simon Changhai.

319
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,270
Simon Chang Hai.

320
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,440
Ximen Chang Hai. Simon Changhai.

321
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,480
Ximen Changhai.

322
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,960
Big brother, here you are.

323
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,750
- West Man. - Changhai.

324
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,790
Come on.

325
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,000
Simon Changhai.

326
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,240
Simon Changhai?

327
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,510
Simon Changhai?

328
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,390
Simon Changhai?

329
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,960
Simon Changhai?

330
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,200
Simon Changhai?

331
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,120
Simon Changhai?

332
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,030
This is it.

333
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,270
Simon Changhai.

334
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,550
Simon Chang Hai.

335
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,270
Simon Chang Hai. Ximen Changhai.

336
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,200
Go to

337
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,510
and get a few copper coins

338
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,840
with a few coins?

339
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,390
Keep a good mood.

340
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,440
And don't forget who I am.

341
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,910
I am Ximen Changhai.

342
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,960
Ximen Changhai.

343
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,030
Catch it.

344
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,320
Ximen Changhai.

345
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,550
It's hard for me to find you.

346
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,790
I've been looking for you so hard.

347
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,630
Simon Changhai,

348
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,480
I've been looking for you so hard.

349
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,200
Brother.

350
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,670
Waste his martial arts as soon as possible.

351
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,840
So that we can report to him.

352
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:06,960
Slow down.

353
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,910
Hero.

354
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,440
Can I ask

355
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,240
who sent you?

356
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,750
Stop knocking.

357
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,550
She's upset.

358
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,000
I need to discuss something with you.

359
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,080
Master is possessed by the devil.

360
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,790
Is not good for old.

361
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,360
Can you make another dose of medicine?

362
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,550
How can I do that?

363
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,840
My stocks

364
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,630
my stocks of aweto and summer grass.

365
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,200
But it's not good.

366
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,840
What about aweto?

367
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,750
Is used to nourish the body.

368
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,150
Are you getting little strength?

369
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,360
Is it strong?

370
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,440
Show Master

371
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,270
and strong.

372
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,960
I have

373
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,630
the recovery of your power is effective.

374
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,080
But I can't

375
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
the dosage well.

376
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,120
I wouldn't dare to use it on my master.

377
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,320
Master is old.

378
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,440
I won't be responsible

379
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,550
I won't be able to take the responsibility.

380
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,790
I'm young.

381
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,440
You can use me to test.

382
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,750
Don't think too much.

383
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,600
A teacher for a day

384
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,480
and a father forever.

385
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,910
I'm after all the Eldest Brother.

386
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,510
And I have to take the responsibility.

387
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,270
You've thought it through?

388
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,480
I still don't believe you?

389
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,150
The medicine you made must be okay, wife.

390
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,200
This one.

391
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,600
Is too sore.

392
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,120
Sister-in-law!

393
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,270
Come out and take a look.

394
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,670
The worm cage is open.

395
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,550
Why is it opening again?

396
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,390
Come on.

397
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,750
Let's see how I'm feeling now.

398
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,510
If I spend more money,

399
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,550
see if you can find me a writer

400
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,670
to write down my story.

401
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,510
You know what I mean.

402
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,000
I will use the money

403
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,870
to hire people,

404
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,080
hire thugs.

405
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,270
To hit myself.

406
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,600
I have to settle

407
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,630
my story

408
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,600
can't it

409
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,510
what's done is done.

410
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,120
What's the use of blaming yourself?

411
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,550
I am blaming myself.

412
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,600
I am scolding you.

413
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
What were you thinking?

414
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,320
You tricked me.

415
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,080
The Twelve Evil Devils.

416
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,790
Just three of them.

417
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,910
Your eyes are not good too.

418
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,270
What about the Nine Evils?

419
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,150
You know

420
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,960
my brother-in-law's position in the society

421
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,910
In the society these years.

422
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,910
This guy has three evil spirits.

423
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,630
One shot on the left,

424
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,480
and fired on the right.

425
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,840
He often stares at his words.

426
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,350
What's the use of that?

427
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,070
Isn't that what I'm asking for?

428
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,830
You should...

429
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,880
I'll beat you to death!

430
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,590
How did that happen?

431
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,510
To hire the Twelve Devils

432
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,030
the Twelve Evil Devils?

433
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,240
Yes, the Twelve Devils.

434
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,680
I can figure it out.

435
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,030
Three evil spirits, please!

436
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:19,960
Twelve evil spirits.

437
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,720
These three evil spirits?

438
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,960
One is against four evil spirits.

439
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,000
If you can figure it out,

440
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,590
I don't know what went wrong either.

441
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,310
What went wrong?

442
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,200
It's my turn.

443
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,960
Brother-in-law.

444
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,640
Luckily the nine people didn't come,

445
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,000
come, we'll both be dead.

446
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,680
My goodness!

447
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,160
So it means

448
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,680
you have become my savior.

449
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,480
I have to thank you.

450
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,310
Come on.

451
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,270
Brother.

452
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,750
Please accept my bow.

453
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,720
Stand up.

454
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,480
What are you doing?

455
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,590
Brother-in-law kowtow to you.

456
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,440
What are you doing?

457
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,400
Thank you for saving my life.

458
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,680
Bro, don't be too angry.

459
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,110
I'll find another person.

460
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,350
This time we come to Meihe Bajie.

461
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,310
This time.

462
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,440
But also cost-effective.

463
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,350
How about this?

464
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,310
Don't confirm the number yet.

465
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,550
Not all of them

466
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,200
can you see people clearly?

467
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,640
Alright.

468
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,480
Can you pay the bill or not?

469
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,350
I'll pay.

470
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,200
Go there.

471
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,270
Sent them here?

472
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,350
Hurry!

473
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,240
Luckily, I ran so fast.

474
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,510
And caught them all.

475
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,880
What's wrong with you?

476
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,160
What's the matter?

477
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,350
Where are my medicines?

478
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,160
Take them all.

479
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,000
You can take two drops at most.

480
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,000
The poison.

481
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,880
Spit it out.

482
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,550
Hao Meng!

483
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,510
Hao Meng!

484
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,350
Hao Meng!

485
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,960
Hao Meng...

486
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:53,880
What's wrong?

487
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,480
What are you doing?

488
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,160
Dezhu.

489
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,160
Let's go now!

490
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,590
Your eldest brother is crazy! Run!

491
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,510
He's crazy.

492
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,350
You quarreled with Eldest Brother?

493
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,200
About what?

494
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,000
He doesn't recognize you anymore?

495
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,070
He'll beat anyone he sees.

496
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,960
Very aggressive.

497
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,640
Sister-in-law.

498
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,200
We can hide outside.

499
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,830
Hurry up!

500
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,510
What are you afraid of?

501
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,680
When Second Brother and I

502
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,790
each one held his hand

503
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,590
and you just subdue him.

504
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,480
I can't.

505
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,550
There are only 20 of you.

506
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,680
He won't be able to be suppressed.

507
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,510
Then you don't believe in the ability of me and our second brother.

508
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,200
There are 20.

509
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,510
Two thousand?

510
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,240
He can't see anything now.

511
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,480
He can only hear some sound.

512
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,960
Attack wherever there's sound.

513
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,160
It is fine now.

514
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,110
It's all right now.

515
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,510
They didn't catch up.

516
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,830
Sister-in-law!

517
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,440
What's wrong with my Eldest Brother?

518
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,440
What's wrong with him?

519
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,680
She took too many tonics.

520
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,960
How could a tonic be this way?

521
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,440
It's a tonic.

522
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,680
I didn't expect him to eat that much.

523
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,590
Nothing.

524
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,240
It will be fine when the medicine wears off.

525
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,790
We have already escaped.

526
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,680
What should my father do when he goes back later?

527
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,070
Right.

528
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,790
Where's Master?

529
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,070
Go right now!

530
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,240
Go right now!

531
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,270
Go! Go back!

532
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,160
Return?

533
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,240
This is exhausting.

534
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,480
Guys,

535
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,000
this mission is simple.

536
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,110
But you should still be cautious.

537
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,310
Mei He used to make 108 masters.

538
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,110
And now there are only 8.

539
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,200
What's the reason?

540
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,110
Most people die from carelessness.

541
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,030
Listen to me.

542
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,960
Master Gao has given

543
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,240
given us enough.

544
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,480
As long as we get this done,

545
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,400
we can move out of Mei River

546
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,590
and settle in Central Plains.

547
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,160
Everyone,

548
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,200
do you have confidence?

549
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,920
Yes, we have.

550
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,440
Remember that.

551
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,310
You take people's money

552
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,440
and eliminate disasters with others.

553
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,400
If he can fight with his life.

554
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,000
He can.

555
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,110
Cheers.

556
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,240
Cheers!

557
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,440
Brother, where is nobody?

558
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,830
Could it be the empty city strategy?

559
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,720
Big brother, is there an ambush?

560
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,350
Ximen Changhai.

561
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,680
Aren't you going to come out and welcome them?

562
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,160
I see you.

563
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,200
It's broken.

564
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,440
Something is wrong.

565
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,160
What happened?

566
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,000
It hurts!

567
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,960
It hurts!

568
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,440
Dezhu.

569
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,270
Oh, Hao Meng.

570
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,270
Hao Meng!

571
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,590
Oh, Hao Meng!

572
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,270
Hao Meng,

573
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,310
how are you?

574
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,310
Get up now.

575
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,550
Jade, give me a hand.

576
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,070
I'm so tired.

577
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,960
What's wrong?

578
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,270
You drank too much medicine

579
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,310
you can't recognize people?

580
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,270
So many people are lying?

581
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,920
Who are you?

582
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,510
I'm here for Ximen Changhai.

583
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,200
Master is back.

584
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,000
Hurry up!

585
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,590
Master is back.

586
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,640
What happened?

587
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,960
Father!

588
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,160
They came for you!

589
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,400
They were beaten up by Eldest Brother.

590
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,350
Why do you always make trouble?

591
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,880
Master, I don't even know what happened.

592
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,270
I have no energy.

593
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,200
I...

594
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,400
That good.

595
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,550
Like this?

596
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,510
This is it?

597
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,110
I don't know what happened.

598
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,350
Master...

599
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,680
He drank too much medicine.

600
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,440
Why do you always prescribe medicine to him?

601
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,270
No, Master.

602
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,310
It's for you.

603
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,310
He'll try it on for you?

604
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,070
Stop it.

605
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,350
And see if it's blackmail against us.

606
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,960
No. Let's withdraw.

607
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,720
Hold on.

608
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,960
Don't move.

609
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,350
You

610
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,440
where did you come from?

611
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,400
You can't change your name,

612
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,920
or your family name.

613
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,200
The Eight Remarkable of Meihe.

614
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,160
What's it?

615
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,350
I want to speak to Ximen Changhai.

616
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,880
Simon Changhai?

617
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,550
He's not here?

618
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,680
She's not here? Say something!

619
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,590
Why are you beating me?

620
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:55,880
I'm leaving.

621
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,880
Hold on.

622
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,640
Since you are a martial artist,

623
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,480
hang around in the underworld.

624
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,030
Can you end this before leaving?

625
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,510
If not, we can

626
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,750
be the official?

627
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,880
We can't.

628
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,110
We'll be exposed.

629
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,510
I think

630
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,270
you are a martial artist.

631
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,880
This is our life in the underworld.

632
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,550
It's too long to report it.

633
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,880
How about private?

634
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,270
Then negotiate a price.

635
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,550
I'll offer this one.

636
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,960
Can I get this?

637
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,750
Can be lowered?

638
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,720
Come down?

639
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,510
That...

640
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,790
This

641
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,880
Is easy to talk to.

642
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,830
What about this?

643
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,440
Come down.

644
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,310
Calm down.

645
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,480
Give me the money.

646
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,550
Hurry up!

647
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,070
Master,

648
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,030
where am I going to get 100 taels of silver?

649
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:48,790
One tael.

650
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,310
One tael.

651
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,830
As long as I'm alive.

652
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,750
We can afford one tael of it.

653
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,720
Give me the money.

654
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,510
It's here.

655
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,960
Once and for all.

656
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,350
Take the knife.

657
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,310
Don't look for anyone else.

658
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,160
What's this?

659
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,310
What's this?

660
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,510
Money!

661
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,680
What's going on?

662
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,750
No, Master.

663
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,480
What did you talk to him just now?

664
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,510
Sorry,

665
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,200
don't move the money.

666
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,160
If my guess is right,

667
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,270
something is going on here.

668
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,480
They should have given us money

669
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,310
to appease us.

670
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,920
Then they'll report to the government.

671
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,790
Prince Yu,

672
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,830
what do you think?

673
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,920
I don't understand.

674
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,590
Yes, I do.

675
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:30,830
What's going on?

676
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,440
Don't spend the money.

677
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,830
What if he files a report to the government?

678
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,750
We have to pay him back.

679
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,480
If he doesn't report it,

680
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,070
to return these silver to us,

681
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,160
they are of low skins as well.

682
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,200
There is a trick here.

683
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,200
Mei He's Eight Remarkable.

684
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,920
Plum He stole it?

685
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,590
He did it alone

686
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,350
they did that to the other eight.

687
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,200
I'm impressed.

688
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,200
Don't lose heart.

689
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,510
We should spend more money

690
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,070
we must punish the worst culprits.

691
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:14,960
No need.

692
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,310
You are crueler than anyone else.

693
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,590
From now on, I'll rely on myself.
