1
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,680
He doesn't have a wife.

2
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,840
What do you think Master is thinking?

3
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,150
To become the chief of the martial art world?

4
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,560
Give gifts to all sects.

5
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,870
A smelly sauce for them.

6
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,120
Master is the chief of the martial art circle.

7
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,030
He gave me the stinky sauce

8
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,190
he must have a moral.

9
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
What?

10
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,960
Is notorious.

11
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,800
It's not like that.

12
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,560
It is...

13
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,120
It must be good with sauce.

14
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,310
You're the only one who can say

15
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,150
slowly.

16
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,400
How many days will it take?

17
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,520
Seven to eight days.

18
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,590
How long will it take?

19
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,080
Honey, look at this.

20
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,630
I've travelled to all the clans

21
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,000
to travel there.

22
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,430
I should go to

23
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,240
I have to go to some Heavenly Sect

24
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,470
they need to have a drink

25
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,400
with their master.

26
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,910
Pigeons have sent messages to me many times.

27
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,470
I was really tied up.

28
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,400
He almost ate the pigeon.

29
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,590
Don't waste your time.

30
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,630
People order God Faction.

31
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,840
Is a famous person.

32
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,030
A well-known person.

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,590
Honey,

34
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,470
he ignored us in the past.

35
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,520
Who are we now?

36
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,840
Master is the chief of the martial art world.

37
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,000
I will be the next Master

38
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,750
what?

39
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,080
Hey.

40
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,560
Hundreds of years later,

41
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,680
logical

42
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,150
won't you pass it to me?

43
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,520
I'll become like this one day.

44
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,190
Alright.

45
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,750
I'll wait for you to be the one.

46
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,000
Then I can borrow it from you.

47
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,870
Bring them down.

48
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,190
It's not that bad.

49
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,310
Listen, Hao,

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,630
once I'm not around you,

51
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,280
be careful when you travel.

52
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,310
With strangers.

53
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,360
Watch your mouth.

54
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,800
You can't eat candy.

55
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,190
Although my name is Hao Meng,

56
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,520
do I have to be so cute?

57
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,800
Do you think I'm a three-year-old?

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,310
Stop wasting time.

59
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:43,910
Hurry up.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,960
Come back as soon as possible.

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,840
Don't worry.

62
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,680
Yulang is back.

63
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,280
Xiaoqin,

64
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,240
after you finish your work,

65
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,150
go to Xiaoqin's room

66
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,280
I have something to do.

67
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,190
Alright.

68
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,120
Sister-in-law.

69
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,190
What's the matter?

70
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,360
Yulang is here.

71
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,800
My brother has been longing for you.

72
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,310
But Ziyan is always at home.

73
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,160
For him to be home.

74
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,830
Right?

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,800
It's great this time.

76
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,800
He's out.

77
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,360
What do you think?

78
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,830
Your wife.

79
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,480
What do you think I am?

80
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,310
I don't think you

81
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,390
not that kind of person.

82
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,240
How can you say that?

83
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,680
What did I say?

84
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,240
It's bad if others see this.

85
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,830
Close the door.

86
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,920
Don't close it.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,040
Close the door.

88
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,920
No, no, sister-in-law.

89
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,870
Your wife.

90
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,510
I mean,

91
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,430
your senior and I

92
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,870
had no children all these years.

93
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,720
I feel guilty about it.

94
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,920
This time,

95
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,190
to ask you for the favor.

96
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,040
That's the same thing.

97
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,750
Are you asking me for help?

98
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,680
What can I do?

99
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,000
How can I help?

100
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,800
What are you talking about?

101
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,870
You and me,

102
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,310
to give your senior a surprise.

103
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,950
A surprise can't be given to a child.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,160
Is that a surprise?

105
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,190
Isn't that a scare?

106
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,120
Listen to me.

107
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,070
Listen to me.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,830
I agree.

109
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,390
Sister-in-law.

110
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,720
Here you are, Yulang.

111
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
No one saw him?

112
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,600
No one saw you?

113
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,600
Come in.

114
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,360
Xiaoqin.

115
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,950
Why should I go to your room

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,510
my eldest brother is not home.

117
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,480
To keep Eldest Brother away.

118
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,160
We can go to your room.

119
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,270
I don't mean that.

120
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,510
Stop dilly-dallying.

121
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,360
Why are you being so girly?

122
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,240
Come in.

123
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,680
Sister.

124
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,120
How about we invite Second Brother?

125
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,240
Dezhu's mouth

126
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,120
Is as sharp as your pants' waist.

127
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,000
You can't tell him.

128
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,160
Your Highness,

129
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,240
you've been through so much.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,870
What are you talking about?

131
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,830
Come again tonight.

132
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,800
All right.

133
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,800
- Go back. - Sister-in-law.

134
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,430
Come again tonight.

135
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,070
Alright.

136
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,830
Senior brother.

137
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,310
Where have you been just now?

138
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,720
I went to practice.

139
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,800
Practicing?

140
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,480
Please don't talk about it.

141
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,270
I can't hold it any longer.

142
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,000
Junior Sister,

143
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,160
second Brother.

144
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,430
They got to know me

145
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,600
why are you so mysterious?

146
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,870
You scared me.

147
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,950
What's wrong?

148
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,750
Last night, Jiang Yu Lang was

149
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,600
In Siniang's room last night.

150
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,800
Why are you going to her room?

151
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,830
What can they do

152
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,830
what can they do?

153
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,800
Second Brother.

154
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:26,800
Can you stop

155
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,310
stop being like the village lady

156
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,750
you are full of lies.

157
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,830
The sister-in-law and junior brother

158
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,560
are not like that at all.

159
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,310
Has Eldest Wu

160
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,510
have you ever thought about Pan Jinlian and Xi Men Qing?

161
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,390
What's the end?

162
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,560
It was poisoned.

163
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll show you

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,240
the truth tonight.

165
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,800
So what?

166
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,120
That's why

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,040
this brat.

168
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,070
Second Brother.

169
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,270
We've been squatting for three hours.

170
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,680
My legs feel numb.

171
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,630
I'm still sleepy.

172
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,120
Think about it again.

173
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,480
You got it wrong?

174
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I swear to the sky that

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,070
only the right

176
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,720
I'll surely wait.

177
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,510
He's here.

178
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,430
How is it?

179
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,920
Now you believe him?

180
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,480
It's so exciting.

181
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,480
What?

182
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,030
What?

183
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,720
I mean to irritate Eldest Brother.

184
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,390
Shameless.

185
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,270
Junior Sister,

186
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,840
It's really hard to judge a person's mind from his or her appearance.

187
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,510
That's why you

188
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,270
put all your worries behind you.

189
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,630
Use that energy to me.

190
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,270
I am the most reliable.

191
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,480
I can't.

192
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,550
I'll talk to my junior tomorrow.

193
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,790
I will ask him to stop before it's too late.

194
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,240
I'll go to him tomorrow

195
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,960
I will trick him.

196
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,630
Look at him.

197
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,030
It's getting late.

198
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Go to bed.

199
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,030
Go back to bed.

200
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,790
Go back to bed.

201
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,790
That's right.

202
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,910
I have to go back to sleep.

203
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,360
I can't be like Prince Yu

204
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,200
I'm a gentleman.

205
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,840
Junior Brother,

206
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,200
you use up so much strength every day.

207
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,360
You even practice swordsmanship?

208
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,840
I'm afraid that you can't bear it.

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,360
Rest assured, Second Brother.

210
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,630
I've always been

211
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,480
and I just needed stamina.

212
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,670
I don't know what tiredness is.

213
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,510
Senior brother,

214
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,030
I've got something for you.

215
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,390
Your hands.

216
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,030
Come on.

217
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,790
Black beans.

218
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,360
It's good for men.

219
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,840
Second Brother.

220
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,120
Are you mocking me?

221
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,240
I'm in good health.

222
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
Why eat that?

223
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,750
Alright.

224
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,320
Fine then.

225
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,550
Let's have dumplings for lunch.

226
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,910
Dumplings are good.

227
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,790
I love dumplings.

228
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,390
Right.

229
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,360
As the saying goes,

230
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,720
dumplings are not as tasty as them.

231
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,630
Alright.

232
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,080
Second Brother.

233
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,670
Tell me the truth.

234
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,600
Do you know anything

235
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,960
know something?

236
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,840
If you don't want others to know,

237
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,150
you can't know it.

238
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,200
About what happened between you and my sister-in-law,

239
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,790
about your relationship with Xiaoqin.

240
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,840
Gross!

241
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,120
Second Brother.

242
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,080
I ask you a favor.

243
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,120
I want you to

244
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,120
you must keep this a secret

245
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,550
keep it a secret for me and my sister-in-law.

246
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,750
We can't let Eldest Brother know it.

247
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,670
Now you're scared?

248
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,000
Not at all.

249
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,240
What am I afraid of?

250
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,440
I want to give Eldest Brother a surprise.

251
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,910
Surprise?

252
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,720
Right.

253
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,030
This is really

254
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,320
Is so exciting!

255
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,840
Second Brother.

256
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,600
Please keep it a secret for me.

257
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,550
By then,

258
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,270
you can see how the Eldest Brother will thank me.

259
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,150
This is too much for you.

260
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,390
Gross!

261
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,510
They didn't even know

262
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,480
without being ashamed.

263
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,870
That means you are living with him.

264
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,080
Aren't those two different things?

265
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,240
All dogs!

266
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,510
How could Junior Jiang

267
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,960
how could he do that?

268
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,840
Junior Sister,

269
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,200
you are right that you didn't choose him.

270
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,270
He's not as good as me.

271
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,440
Simple.

272
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,360
Upright,

273
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,150
kind?

274
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,000
And ugly.

275
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,870
Master.

276
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,720
I'm back

277
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,000
eldest Brother.

278
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,910
Xiaorou.

279
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,270
Dezhu.

280
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,720
Where is your master?

281
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,480
My father went up the mountain to pick mushrooms.

282
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,320
That's good.

283
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,000
Listen, you two.

284
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,750
This time,

285
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,510
It's a gift with soy sauce.

286
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,270
He was a great success

287
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,030
and received good comments from all sects.

288
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,000
Then are the compliments to your master

289
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,360
she said you are both civil and martial.

290
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,720
Second Brother,

291
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,720
are you going to speak or not?

292
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,840
Tell me then.

293
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,320
How about this?

294
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,910
Proceed as planned.

295
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,480
Please leave the room.

296
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,000
If I need you,

297
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,320
then you can come in.

298
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,360
I was only gone for a few days.

299
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,240
Being mysterious?

300
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,510
My family is unfortunate.

301
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,790
What?

302
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,080
They're grapes.

303
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,120
What do you mean?

304
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,030
He is asking you.

305
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,910
What do you mean?

306
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,150
You put it there.

307
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,270
You asked me that?

308
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,510
Green melon,

309
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
there's a green apple.

310
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,440
Green pear.

311
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,600
A green persimmon.

312
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,720
Green grapes.

313
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,480
Isn't it obvious?

314
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,720
It's very obvious.

315
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,670
The color is the same.

316
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,360
Why are you so stingy?

317
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,870
If you give me a welcome dinner,

318
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,080
get me more fruits.

319
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,790
These few things

320
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,910
are these enough for anyone?

321
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,440
You can't behave like a human.

322
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,320
What do you want?

323
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,750
I was swatting flies just now.

324
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,360
In front of you.

325
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,320
On the top

326
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,750
on the sky,

327
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,360
do you understand now?

328
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,750
I brought it here when I walked through the woods.

329
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,080
What do you know?

330
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,670
You know.

331
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,670
Why are you so stupid?

332
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,790
Don't you understand?

333
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,790
Well, what are you trying to say?

334
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,270
Let me tell you the truth.

335
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,270
My sister-in-law

336
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,790
now that you're gone,

337
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,960
she stole another woman.

338
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,550
What kind of character is your sister-in-law?

339
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,670
Who she is.

340
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,750
Who she stole it from.

341
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,630
It will disgust you

342
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,550
when he says it.

343
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,630
Please.

344
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,270
How can I walk into the trap?

345
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,510
Jiang Yulang.

346
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,440
Dezhu,

347
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,360
why haven't you changed your bad habits?

348
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,720
Our Que Blade Sect has been suspended for a few days.

349
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,150
Don't be picky and picky.

350
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,200
Is that okay?

351
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,200
You don't believe what I said,

352
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,670
you can't believe Xiaorou's words.

353
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,550
Xiaorou.

354
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,440
And tell him.

355
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
Eldest Brother.

356
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,480
What My Second Brother said is true.

357
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,960
When you were out,

358
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,150
jiang Yulang stayed in her room every day

359
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,440
and stayed there for one night.

360
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,960
Did that happen the few days

361
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,600
In the past few days?

362
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,080
Well

363
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,870
I'm going to ask what happened.

364
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,120
Sit down. Wait a second.

365
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,200
Sit down?

366
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,000
About this,

367
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,600
listen to me.

368
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,080
Don't alert them first.

369
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,670
We need to gather

370
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,790
to gather the evidence.

371
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,630
After collecting the evidence,

372
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,670
and capture this adulterer and whore

373
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,030
at one fell swoop!

374
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,720
I went out

375
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,000
give out some sauce,

376
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,000
why do I have to do this?

377
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,720
I suddenly remembered something.

378
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,600
I'm extremely thoughtful

379
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,960
your wife can make poison?

380
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,390
Brother.

381
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,670
Don't be

382
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,000
the second Wu Dalang.

383
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,390
Can that be?

384
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,150
Did you plan to kill me

385
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,240
my life isn't as good as yours.

386
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,000
He died.

387
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,080
His brother avenged his death.

388
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,360
Who am I?

389
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,720
You have me.

390
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,840
Dezhu.

391
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,550
You're back.

392
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,360
Is everything going well?

393
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,120
Hao,

394
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,270
why aren't you talking?

395
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,070
Look at this.

396
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,160
I knew it.

397
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,160
I won't give you the smelly sauce.

398
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,480
Who bullied you?

399
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,270
Say something.

400
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,350
This is the feeling of home

401
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,070
why are you so emotional after going out?

402
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,110
I can make it for you every day if you want to eat.

403
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,110
Listen to this.

404
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,110
Brother.

405
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,750
You are really lucky.

406
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,400
You'll be luckier than me.

407
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,240
Look at yourself.

408
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,750
I'm no match for you.

409
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,790
Senior brother, let me tell you something.

410
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,030
Such a woman

411
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,160
It's hard to find

412
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,550
Is hard to find.

413
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,550
Mr. Yu, don't mention it.

414
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,720
Sister-in-law is not that good.

415
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,880
Eat more.

416
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,310
I have something to tell you.

417
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,270
It's a little early.

418
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,750
I have to tell him.

419
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,960
Come on.

420
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,720
Shoot.

421
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,790
I have to go out.

422
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,400
Master sent me another mission.

423
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,960
Eldest Brother,

424
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,350
why are you going out again?

425
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:17,960
Right.

426
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,200
You just came back.

427
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,640
By the way,

428
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,550
senior.

429
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,960
I can help you out if you're going out.

430
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,880
Master arranged this for me.

431
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,350
As instructed by Master.

432
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,350
We must leave before dark.

433
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,590
Enjoy the food.

434
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,310
I'll go pack.

435
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,240
We can pack after we finish eating.

436
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,920
Right.

437
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,030
No need to be so impatient.

438
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,160
Eldest Brother,

439
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,350
forget about it.

440
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,110
Let's eat first.

441
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,750
Eat.

442
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,110
Can Second Brother do it?

443
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,720
This is called

444
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,680
entice one's opponents to leave their vantage ground

445
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,310
believe me, right?

446
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,920
That's right.

447
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,030
Go back. Second Brother.

448
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,070
Let me...

449
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,200
Let me have a look too.

450
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,480
Who is it?

451
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,440
I will.

452
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,400
Sister-in-law.

453
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,270
Why can't I open it?

454
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,270
I'll help you.

455
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,400
Sister-in-law!

456
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,070
She's so beautiful.

457
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,790
Trust your taste.

458
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,750
That's comfortable.

459
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,680
Hold it.

460
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,550
It's much more comfortable.

461
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,070
Sister-in-law.

462
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,550
When are we going to

463
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,310
talk about our relationship?

464
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,880
Don't be so impatient.

465
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,480
We can't wait for him to come back.

466
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,350
What's the look he'll give

467
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,720
to know this?

468
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,790
What expressions?

469
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,750
He might open his mouth and cry.

470
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,160
As far as I know,

471
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,270
you are right.

472
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
Much more comfortable.

473
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,350
Don't move.

474
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,510
Don't move!

475
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,160
Adulteress and whore!

476
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,270
I'll catch you as well.

477
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,440
Zhao Dezhu,

478
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,960
rou,

479
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,510
why are you here?

480
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,830
We can't see

481
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,720
we won't be able to see your good deeds.

482
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,310
Right.

483
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,030
Zhao Dezhu,

484
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,880
cut the crap.

485
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,510
Get out of here!

486
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,400
Stop the excuses!

487
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,030
What is it?

488
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,400
What the heck?

489
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,590
What the hell is beautiful?

490
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,790
What is comfortable?

491
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,480
What is it?

492
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,960
Open your eyes wide and see

493
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,880
this knife...

494
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,790
Beautiful?

495
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,110
You can't solve it.

496
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,030
What does it mean?

497
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,440
The knife you used in Bumeng

498
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,310
It's comfortable?

499
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,590
It's the handle.

500
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,440
At first, it wasn't comfortable to hold.

501
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,400
He changed it.

502
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,240
It's comfortable now.

503
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:20,920
What's wrong?

504
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,160
It's really comfortable.

505
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,240
This time I finally understand

506
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,030
you are here

507
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,240
for your Senior Brother?

508
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,030
Zhao Dezhu, let me ask you then.

509
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,200
You can be nice to your brother,

510
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,350
do you know what day the next few days are?

511
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,720
So what?

512
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,440
No idea.

513
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,550
But your eldest brother's birthday.

514
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,160
I wanted to give him a surprise,

515
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,440
to give him a birthday gift

516
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,960
I especially asked Jade to help me.

517
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,240
You got with the Dragon Blade

518
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,270
and what have you done?

519
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,160
And you even suspected us of being improper?

520
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,310
Then you misunderstood me.

521
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,000
Let's set this aside.

522
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,240
Is there anything else?

523
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,680
Get out of here if not!

524
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Your Majesty!

525
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,240
You've been really good at hiding yourself.

526
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,070
How dare you?

527
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,000
In the closet.

528
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,830
What are you talking about?

529
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,790
Who is hidden in the cupboard?

530
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,270
Nobody is there.

531
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,590
Come out!

532
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,640
No hair.

533
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,790
And a monk.

534
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,590
Come out!

535
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,830
Come out!

536
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,830
Eldest Brother.

537
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,310
Eldest Brother.

538
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,070
Eldest Brother.

539
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,640
Why did you hide it in the closet?

540
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,510
Didn't you go to work for master?

541
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,750
That...

542
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,880
I just came back.

543
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,030
You still have to go out.

544
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,880
I only find two sets of clothes.

545
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,070
Put them in the closet.

546
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,480
Here they are.

547
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,160
I've been so tired in the past two days.

548
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,640
I stayed up and slept.

549
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,440
She fell asleep.

550
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,510
Hao Meng,

551
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,030
honey.

552
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,590
Sorry.

553
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,640
I've wronged you.

554
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,110
It's all Zhao Dezhu's fault.

555
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,000
He said that you two

556
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
with each other every day.

557
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,830
I don't know what happened.

558
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,920
I'll go back to my room after that.

559
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,960
I come to listen to him

560
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,640
let me see what's going on.

561
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,550
I don't know you prepared

562
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,640
you prepared a gift

563
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,830
to surprise me.

564
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,270
I was wrong, honey!

565
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,510
I was wrong, I'm wrong!

566
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,480
Eldest Brother,

567
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,960
to make a knife for you,

568
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,240
look at that knife.

569
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,160
Honey,

570
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,590
I'm really sorry, wife.

571
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,480
I wronged you.

572
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,110
I shouldn't have that thought.

573
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,030
Please hit me.

574
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,160
You hit me.

575
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,830
Stand up.

576
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:36,880
Don't...

577
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
You won't forgive me?

578
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,640
Can I stand up?

579
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,550
Stand up.

580
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,830
Stand up.

581
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,790
Take it.

582
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,440
Catch it.

583
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,680
Do you like it

584
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,110
eldest Brother,

585
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,160
I carved these flowers

586
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,440
are carved by me.

587
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,310
Isn't this the dragon-killing knife

588
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:05,350
I've been thinking about day and night?

589
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,830
Honey,

590
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,880
do I look like Xie Xun to you?

591
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,350
You look bald to me.

592
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,240
Honey,

593
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,400
thank you.

594
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,440
I shouldn't have been soft-headed

595
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,550
and listened to Zhao Dezhu.

596
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,480
If he keeps talking so much,

597
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,880
he ruined our relationship.

598
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,550
Alright, don't cry.

599
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,000
Zhao Dezhu,

600
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,440
you kid can run fast

601
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,240
- You're slow. - Me?

602
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,880
I'll chop you.
