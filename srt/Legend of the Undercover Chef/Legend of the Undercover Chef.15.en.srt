1
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,840
Thank you for your kindness.

2
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,870
My father won't meet us today.

3
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,280
You can't play with me after you return.

4
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,150
Not anymore.

5
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,640
We have Chief Ximen

6
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,030
our Chief Xi

7
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,470
they settled for us.

8
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,680
Why fight?

9
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,280
I won't avenge my wife anymore.

10
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,120
Brother Huang.

11
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,710
Let's be sworn brothers after we go back.

12
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,750
Alright, brother.

13
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,150
Let's meet Chief Ximen!

14
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,800
I took the waterway for seven days and nights

15
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,630
I came to congratulate the Chief.

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,150
Besides, the Changdao Clan

17
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,470
we're bullied by outsiders.

18
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,750
We must find Chief Ximen

19
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,190
the Chief Ximen.

20
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,750
Please let us meet.

21
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,630
You came a long way

22
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,360
he wanted us to meet him.

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,400
Please have some sympathy for my master.

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,150
You are old.

25
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,960
You've had visitors for days.

26
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,800
He solved all kinds of disputes.

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,840
He's too tired.

28
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,470
You can come back another day.

29
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,590
Come another day?

30
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,870
Let's meet today.

31
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,560
Come on.

32
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,520
I can't see him.

33
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,310
Let's see the Chief.

34
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,360
I'm too tired. Let's go.

35
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Please come again next time.

36
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
Don't use the back door.

37
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,120
If you go further back, I won't open the door for you.

38
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,840
Plug the door.

39
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,680
Master. Master.

40
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,240
And become the chief of the martial arts circle.

41
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,360
Shouldn't we celebrate it?

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,560
To improve the food.

43
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
Don't mention it.

44
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,030
I was watching him holding his breath.

45
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,960
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

46
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,080
The second and third...

47
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,870
Silver and gold!

48
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,870
All we have to do is put a piece of old paper on this piece of paper.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,960
Is this Eunuch Cao?

50
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,630
That's right.

51
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,150
I just saw it was him.

52
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,400
It's Eunuch Cao.

53
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,190
Look at this.

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,190
I think

55
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,630
master.

56
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,400
It's not important.

57
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,190
What matters is

58
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,430
the status of the martial art circle.

59
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,800
The identity of the Chief.

60
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,080
Identity doesn't matter.

61
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,400
Of course. What's this?

62
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,560
Even if it's a memento,

63
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
I can hang it there.

64
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,030
It takes up space everywhere.

65
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,560
I feel suffocated even when I look at it.

66
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,560
Where should I hang it?

67
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,310
Why not just come here?

68
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,190
Let's burn it.

69
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,870
Burn it?

70
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,280
You're the master. You call the shots.

71
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,360
Now that you're the Chief,

72
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,280
you're a little bold.

73
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:52,840
Stretch it.

74
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,470
Burn it.

75
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,430
Burn it?

76
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,400
Just burn it?

77
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,960
I just watched it

78
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,910
I watched it burn.

79
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,870
Little by little.

80
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,360
Please.

81
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,000
Alright. Alright. Alright.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,560
Burn it!

83
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,150
What are you doing?

84
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,120
This...

85
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,710
Who is so in debt?

86
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,590
I'm the one

87
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,360
no, Master. Why did you burn it?

88
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,910
It's holding its breath.

89
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:14,870
Master.

90
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,720
Do you know whose painting it is?

91
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,310
Chang Pak Hu.

92
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,950
Who is Uncle Chang?

93
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,600
He's related to long-necked deer.

94
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,160
You know nothing.

95
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,000
That Chang Bohu

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,750
was the first painter of the dynasty.

97
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,360
Let me tell you this.

98
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,390
But his paintings

99
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,430
the size of the slap is too big.

100
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,680
Is enough to buy a big house in the capital.

101
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,560
Really?

102
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,560
It is so valuable.

103
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,430
This one?

104
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,830
Let's see how many slap is left.

105
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,310
Hurry.

106
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,040
One, two, three...

107
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,950
And four five.

108
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,630
There are still six big mansions left.

109
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,480
Great.

110
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,190
This is a complete design.

111
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,630
If you burn a big hole now,

112
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,160
It'll be worthless.

113
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,720
We dropped it in the middle.

114
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,720
That's it?

115
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,750
Look at your face. There's more.

116
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,270
Yes, he is.

117
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,720
It's just that the lower body is gone.

118
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,000
My signature is gone.

119
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,070
Who knows who drew this?

120
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,360
It's such a pity.

121
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,720
All right, my dear husband.

122
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,800
You didn't do anything,

123
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,560
we spent nothing.

124
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,950
Isn't the second place nice?

125
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,750
What do you know about my good wife?

126
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,510
As a husband, he wants to build

127
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,510
to become the first sect

128
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,680
of the martial art circle.

129
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,000
The dream is shattered.

130
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,360
Alright.

131
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,750
Don't drink too much.

132
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,510
I'll go back to my room and sleep.

133
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,190
Don't wear white clothes anymore.

134
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,630
No one will wash them for you when they're dirty.

135
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,830
That's a woman.

136
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,390
She doesn't have the foresight.

137
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,680
He doesn't know what to do.

138
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
What are you two doing?

139
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,120
What are you doing here?

140
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,310
You left and right again.

141
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,120
What are you doing?

142
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,560
You come in the middle of the night?

143
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,480
I'm here to tell you

144
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,510
that your brother is very angry

145
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,680
your battle.

146
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,000
He's angry?

147
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,720
What's the reason?

148
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,240
All martial arts masters

149
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,870
all sects joined the contest.

150
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,560
Let's go. Why is he angry?

151
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,510
We are going to represent Quedao Sect

152
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,600
the children are practicing martial arts here,

153
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,680
they often fight.

154
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,870
Are we not keen to make our mark?

155
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,070
That's it.

156
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,950
The competition started.

157
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,070
What's so angry about?

158
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,950
Besides, our sect looks poor.

159
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,720
Will you tell him

160
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,920
to make people laugh at me?

161
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,430
It's nothing.

162
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,720
Warrior Changhai.

163
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,800
For half a lifetime.

164
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Because of you,

165
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,070
the Que Blade Sect

166
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,830
he has stolen the limelight.

167
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,870
He was worried that your future

168
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,310
would get more dangerous in the future.

169
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,190
He wasn't worried that I was in danger.

170
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,560
He sees me winning this award

171
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,630
when I won the award.

172
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
Besides, I didn't hit him.

173
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,240
Which one was it?

174
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,630
He can come and take it.

175
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,240
Why did you ask me to come onstage?

176
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,950
It was an emergency.

177
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,720
Your life would be over

178
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
you would've been dead.

179
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,190
Me, too.

180
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,750
And I'm about to die.

181
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,360
Tell him

182
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,000
how did you decide before you came?

183
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,920
To find me a wife.

184
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,160
Is that done?

185
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,390
Mr. Changhai has his own arrangements.

186
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,750
What arrangements?

187
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,270
I think he was just fooling me.

188
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,920
The arrangement?

189
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,480
Or I will ask him to come back

190
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,920
finish my task.

191
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,560
Your personality

192
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,070
will cause trouble sooner or later.

193
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,750
Make trouble for me?

194
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,680
I left my house

195
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,390
In my place.

196
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,310
In my place.

197
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,190
That's why I'm here.

198
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,190
He didn't cause trouble.

199
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,920
In this trouble spot.

200
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,720
He's...

201
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,190
He's in trouble.

202
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,800
Ask him to come back.

203
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm not willing to stay here.

204
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,160
During this time,

205
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,430
you must be more careful.

206
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,920
In the future.

207
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,600
Who are you actually?

208
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,160
You... You covered your face.

209
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,950
And you're here.

210
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,270
Why are you acting like a warrior with a masked face?

211
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,680
What is this?

212
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,160
What is this place?

213
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,160
Why did you collude with the Japanese people?

214
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,360
No, I don't.

215
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
It seems that I can't

216
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,120
colluding with Japanese?

217
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,070
Then why are the warriors

218
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,750
used Japanese martial arts?

219
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,070
I've told you

220
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,510
If I tell you,

221
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,310
I don't know if I can believe it.

222
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,550
I was drinking tea in the garden.

223
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,240
Suddenly appeared from nowhere.

224
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,150
That man has great martial arts skills.

225
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,670
And it happened to me.

226
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,000
The important thing is that

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,790
he said he doesn't want money.

228
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,150
To fight for the chief

229
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,150
of the martial arts world.

230
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,030
I knew it's not expensive.

231
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,030
That's good.

232
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,150
Just let him go.

233
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,360
I didn't expect that

234
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,030
on the day of the competition,

235
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,440
he took off again?

236
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
He didn't leave any message.

237
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,790
Why is he wearing

238
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,270
the clothes of people of the Central Plains?

239
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,960
Think about it.

240
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,000
He's fighting for our side.

241
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,390
Of course, he must wear our uniform.

242
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,440
Please release me.

243
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,510
I didn't know.

244
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,910
You can't punish me?

245
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,240
I...

246
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
This kind of martial arts

247
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,480
Is taught in Japan.

248
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,480
Very strictly.

249
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,030
I didn't expect the Central Plains

250
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,240
you people from the Central Plains can do this kind of Nichi-Yuan.

251
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,270
If that's the case,

252
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,600
even if he

253
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,720
he is of Japanese descent.

254
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,670
Eunuch,

255
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,550
I'm sorry to let you down.

256
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,670
Please forgive me.

257
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,200
You are incompetent.

258
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't say that.

259
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,150
There is an old saying

260
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,870
there is an old saying:

261
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,440
It's called

262
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,360
armies often lose or win.

263
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,960
Where there is life,

264
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,390
there'll be wood to burn.

265
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,000
Eunuch Qiu, you're so broad-minded.

266
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,390
He is considerate.

267
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,360
Master Guetian.

268
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,870
What is it?

269
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,270
My subordinates

270
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,630
never take care of useless people.

271
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,030
Got it.

272
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,790
Ximen Changhai.

273
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,750
This suit

274
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,320
will suit my father's status.

275
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:36,960
Right?

276
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,960
My daughter is the one

277
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,030
you are so handy.

278
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,910
I've found your mother.

279
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,320
Are you ready?

280
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,240
Father.

281
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,120
I've thought it through.

282
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,870
I can be happy

283
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,510
as long as you are happy.

284
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,550
Good girl.

285
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,320
Father.

286
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:49,910
Go ahead with your work.

287
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,870
I'll call Matchmaker Wang.

288
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,390
She's outside.

289
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,480
Come in!

290
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,790
Granny Wang, please come in.

291
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,630
Father, I'm leaving.

292
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,270
Chief Xi Men

293
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,510
congratulations

294
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,390
chief Ximen.

295
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:03,910
Please have a seat.

296
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,910
I've long seen what you can do.

297
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,550
Look at this.

298
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,200
You're the chief of the Imperial Household Department, aren't you?

299
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,910
Keep a low profile.

300
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,510
The chief of the martial art world

301
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,200
I was acting inexplicably.

302
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,670
I didn't waste much energy

303
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,270
she became a master,

304
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,840
maybe he's just honored by his peers.

305
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,510
Chief, you're too humble.

306
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,510
It's because Master Ximen

307
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,670
Is highly skilled in martial arts

308
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,150
and gained great reputation.

309
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,790
I was not serious

310
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,960
I didn't take it seriously.

311
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,240
Introduce you to Old Madam

312
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,200
because I thought

313
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,840
they aren't good enough for you.

314
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,120
Well, today...

315
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,750
I handpicked these old ladies

316
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,550
please have a look.

317
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,360
Please have a look.

318
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,030
This one is

319
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,320
you look good,

320
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,320
this one

321
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,360
It's the younger one.

322
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,630
This one

323
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,790
Is for a bride price.

324
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,910
Is there anyone who can support her old age?

325
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,870
Yes, there is.

326
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,480
There is an 82-year-old girl

327
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,360
will you consider it?

328
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,510
I'll support her.

329
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,720
She'll support me.

330
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,750
Let me support you.

331
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,550
Please have a look inside

332
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,150
see if you find anyone you like.

333
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,910
I can't see this one either.

334
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:06,510
Forget about it.

335
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,390
How about this?

336
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,870
I don't have to keep a low profile.

337
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,030
The reality doesn't allow me to.

338
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
Let me cut to the chase.

339
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,790
To find someone like you.

340
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,910
What do you think?

341
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,000
How old are you?

342
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,390
I'm 50 years old.

343
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,790
It seems

344
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,910
20 to 5.

345
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,870
Thank you for your compliment.

346
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,440
Can we do it as you...

347
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,000
I think of someone.

348
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,480
This man

349
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,870
with big faces

350
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,270
big eyes and bushy eyebrows

351
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,870
with white skin,

352
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,240
not short.

353
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,550
And

354
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,480
he has a big business.

355
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,270
She will definitely be worthy of your title.

356
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,510
Would you take me to her now?

357
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,360
Thank you for your visit.

358
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,630
I'll arrange for her

359
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,750
I'll arrange for her to come

360
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,670
to meet you.

361
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,750
I'll personally bring them to your mansion.

362
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,270
What about

363
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:55,720
thanks.

364
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,480
I shall leave the chief alone today.

365
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,000
I'll leave now.

366
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,720
Alright.

367
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,670
Rou,

368
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,240
see them out.

369
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,240
Alright.

370
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,480
Now I see something.

371
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,790
Wine sellers!

372
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,720
Du Kang made the wine and Liu Ling got drunk.

373
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,960
Liu Ling had been drunk for three years.

374
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,360
This wine is only because it is in heaven.

375
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,840
Now a good wine has come to the mortal world.

376
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,080
That thing you're carrying

377
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,600
that's too much wine.

378
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,080
Want to buy alcohol?

379
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,960
What kind of wine is that?

380
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,320
This is

381
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,790
wine Mask Brand Women's Red.

382
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,480
The best spirit in the city.

383
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,670
Then stop looking.

384
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,870
You went home and fed the pigs the wine.

385
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,720
Even pigs won't drink it.

386
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,870
Throw it away.

387
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,360
Which one is your most expensive?

388
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,510
Customer.

389
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,600
I can tell that you know wine.

390
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,910
There are many places

391
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,790
are cheap.

392
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,870
A row at the back

393
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,600
are expensive.

394
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,910
Especially this one.

395
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,390
Thirty years old.

396
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,790
Look at this bottle.

397
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,480
This bottle is from Persia.

398
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,790
Give me two bottles of this.

399
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,910
This one is OK too.

400
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,600
It's an expensive bottle.

401
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,910
They are the same.

402
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,080
It tastes the same.

403
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,120
This one is fine.

404
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,030
Master is so happy today.

405
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,790
We are so excited today.

406
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,240
I'm here to

407
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,480
can I make a suggestion?

408
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,120
Come on.

409
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:05,790
Enough!

410
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,270
Eldest Brother, stop it.

411
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,550
You drank a lot today.

412
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,600
My sister-in-law will deal with you when you get drunk.

413
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,030
Blow it.

414
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,240
(Dare she!)

415
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,360
Am I the same as I am now in the past?

416
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,440
Hey,

417
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,600
why are you yelling?

418
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,080
Go to my master.

419
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,150
What's that?

420
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,600
Whose master?

421
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,550
What are you talking about?

422
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,600
Who was your master before?

423
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,240
Right.

424
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,750
That's right.

425
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,670
My master is the chief now.

426
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,390
Chief?

427
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,390
I'm the chief's disciple.

428
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,750
You're the chief now.

429
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,080
I'm our Eldest Brother.

430
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,550
You know what?

431
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,790
To take over from master...

432
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,150
I will take over the position.

433
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,670
I'm the future chief.

434
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,510
She even dared to

435
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,270
I...

436
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,600
I divorced her.

437
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,670
What the hell?

438
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,150
Divorce her,

439
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,000
today you...

440
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,670
You get the divorce of Ye Siniang?

441
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,670
What?

442
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,600
You know what?

443
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,150
How about you get rid of her?

444
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,240
I really look down on you.

445
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,670
That spoiled brat.

446
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,080
... in your whole life...

447
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,600
Just be a good-for-nothing for your whole life.

448
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,630
Taking a break.

449
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,120
Me too.

450
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,270
When I see a woman,

451
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,550
sorry

452
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,390
you are shy.

453
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,600
How much have we drunk?

454
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,720
Master drank.

455
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,600
Two bottles.

456
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,670
This is a jar

457
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,720
do you want more?

458
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,550
Drink it!

459
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,670
-Drink it. -No.

460
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,030
Bring a cup.

461
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,000
You'll always be our good brother,

462
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,750
you're always a good brother!

463
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,550
For a lifetime?

464
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,840
Write a repudiation paper after drinking it.

465
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,360
Losers!

466
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,240
Prodigal son!

467
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,030
Ladies,

468
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,550
from now on,

469
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,630
make a clean break with

470
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,080
cut off?

471
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,150
Get out of here.

472
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,120
The Que Blade Gate.

473
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,880
Right?

474
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,350
Alright.

475
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,000
Senior, listen to me.

476
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,240
After you leave her tomorrow,

477
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,440
you are the man completely.

478
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,160
The Que Blade Sect

479
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,240
there are no more

480
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,270
good-for-nothing anymore.

481
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,030
You know what?

482
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,920
Dezhu.

483
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,880
You know me all the time.

484
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,480
Ye Si.

485
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,790
Have you slept or not?

486
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,160
Don't you pretend to be asleep?

487
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,790
Get up.

488
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,440
Let me write you something.

489
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,400
Get up. Come here.

490
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,400
You write a letter of repentance again?

491
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,680
What statement?

492
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,920
A letter of repentance?

493
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,310
Hey!

494
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,200
See? Stand up!

495
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,790
Stop it.

496
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,440
I'll read it tomorrow morning.

497
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,240
Go to bed.

498
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,920
Still fooling me?

499
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,680
You must show me the trick tomorrow.

500
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,400
Got it?

501
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,830
I'll put it away.

502
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,200
I'll follow your instructions.

503
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,270
I'll put it here.

504
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Show me.

505
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,400
Doesn't it work?

506
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,680
What's wrong?

507
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,510
I'm asking you, what's wrong?

508
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,510
What time was it?

509
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,350
Why is she still so dark?

510
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,480
Xiaorou.

511
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,880
Xiaorou.

512
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,240
Rou.

513
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,200
Dukang made the wine and Liu Ling got drunk.

514
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,880
He got drunk for three years.

515
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,440
This wine is only because it is in heaven.

516
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,790
This time it came down to the mortal realm.

517
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,680
Descend to the mortal world.

518
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,000
Brother, you are back.

519
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,270
Don't cry out.

520
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,830
What is it?

521
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,270
I'll sell all the wine.

522
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,680
Am I awesome?

523
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,440
Stop selling it.

524
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,030
You know what?

525
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,480
Our wine made old people suffer recently.

526
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,240
The government is doing a lot about it.

527
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,920
The boss told us

528
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,070
pull down this stall.

529
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,270
You'd better leave quickly.

530
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,680
Brother Xing,

531
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,440
then I will look for them.

532
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,400
I'll take a carriage.

533
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,310
Stop!

534
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,590
I've been spying on you two for days.

535
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,110
Got it?

536
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,110
What's the matter?

537
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:54,790
Are you spying on us?

538
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,030
Manufacturing and selling fake alcohol.

539
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,750
We don't have any.

540
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,400
Nothing.

541
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,030
That's so stubborn.

542
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,480
I'm not saying that.

543
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,590
You're the head.

544
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,960
I'm not the head.

545
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,440
Me too.

546
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,590
He is my elder brother and I am his younger brother.

547
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,550
I don't even know.

548
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,550
My younger brother

549
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,240
who's your boss?

550
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,920
I don't know who the boss is.

551
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,680
I really don't know.

552
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,350
To be honest,

553
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,510
I don't know.

554
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,480
Take her away!

555
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,510
I said...

556
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,110
I mean it.

557
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,750
Isn't that enough?

558
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,960
I mean it.

559
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,400
I mean...

560
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,790
Is anyone here

561
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,000
come out, Dezhu!

562
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,070
I can't. Hurry.

563
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,750
Senior, you're still alive!

564
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,310
Cut the crap.

565
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,640
This wine is going to kill me.

566
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,270
Come out now!

567
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,790
Xiaoqin didn't hit you yesterday?

568
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,590
Why did she hit me when I was drinking?

569
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,510
Don't you write her a repudiation paper?

570
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,440
Write her a repudiation paper?

571
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,240
You drank too much.

572
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,720
You wrote her a repudiation paper.

573
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,880
Don't you remember?

574
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,480
I...

575
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,070
To write a repudiation paper for my wife.

576
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,200
Right.

577
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,590
About last night...

578
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,070
You don't go to the toilet?

579
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,200
There is

580
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,270
we can have fun.

581
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,880
Honey,

582
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,240
your makeup is stunning today.

583
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,000
You want to steal my money again?

584
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,000
Not at all.

585
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,590
Come on.

586
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,030
I'll give you some support.

587
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,070
Honey,

588
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,240
this outfit doesn't look good today.

589
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,480
Change another one.

590
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,000
Please change me.

591
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,720
What words?

592
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,680
My...

593
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,750
My wife and I

594
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,790
and I thought...

595
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,440
Take the clothes.

596
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,000
Hands off.

597
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,350
Sister-in-law.

598
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,160
Sister-in-law.

599
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,310
Hurry, I have an emergency.

600
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,270
Come with me.

601
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:00,790
Hurry.

602
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,680
What's wrong?

603
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,830
You're really...

604
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,880
It's an emergency. Hurry up.

605
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,160
Hurry up.

606
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,160
We shouldn't make trouble.

607
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,920
I'm not harassing my wife. I...

608
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,030
With my years of experience in making drugs

609
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,880
these are definitely

610
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,030
It is definitely fake.

611
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,400
Fake alcohol!

612
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,920
No wonder the others are fine.

613
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,200
Master was the only one

614
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,160
master drank the wine.

615
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,750
These fake wine dealers

616
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:28,880
are so hateful.

617
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,880
Dezhu,

618
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,070
you bullied my master.

619
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,680
Master is having a blind date today?

620
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,550
Zhao Dezhu,

621
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,310

622
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,550
Come here.

623
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:40,920
Come here.

624
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,510
Master blames me for this.

625
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,000
Put you in this situation.

626
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,070
You really put me in trouble.

627
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,030
Father. Father.

628
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,440
This is Master Hao Meng.

629
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,590
Zhao Dezhu is here.

630
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,160
Stand up.

631
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:52,720
Stand up!

632
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,350
Come here.

633
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,590
Master, please hit me.

634
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,240
Father.

635
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,680
Master, do you hate me?

636
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,880
He is here.

637
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
Dad, don't be angry.

638
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,270
Where is Chief Ximen?
