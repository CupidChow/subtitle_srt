1
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,070
Brother Ximen.

2
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,950
Madam Wang introduced me

3
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,230
to date with you.

4
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,070
Nice to meet you.

5
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,590
Dad. This way. Dad.

6
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,870
It's good.

7
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,000
Auntie, have some water.

8
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,960
Xiaorou, pour water.

9
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,910
Thank you, Miss.

10
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,430
Miss,

11
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,360
can I have a word

12
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,710
with Chief Ximen?

13
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,190
Alright.

14
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,800
Enjoy your chatting.

15
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
Dad, I will leave now.

16
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,750
Okay. Have a good chat.

17
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,240
I'll leave now.

18
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,280
Please.

19
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,590
What do you think of me?

20
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,520
It's obvious.

21
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,680
The eldest sister looks like

22
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,400
with big face.

23
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,240
His skin is white as snow.

24
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,000
She's quite tall.

25
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,710
That's too kind of you.

26
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,750
I've heard it before.

27
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,590
Have some water.

28
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,150
Brother!

29
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,360
I want some of you

30
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,430
you're so humorous.

31
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,590
Isn't it only me?

32
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,150
Is this Teleport?

33
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,960
Hey!

34
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,470
You've been here for a long time.

35
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,560
Brother.

36
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,120
Who are you talking to?

37
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,710
I'm talking to you.

38
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,750
Talk to you like this?

39
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,430
Brother, you are so reserved.

40
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,360
Here you go.

41
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,840
Let me introduce myself.

42
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,910
This is my name tag.

43
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,910
My sister's name?

44
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,080
Great!

45
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,630
Brother.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,960
It's the other way around.

47
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,150
Hey!

48
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,080
What a beautiful name!

49
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,120
Brother.

50
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,720
Just call me by my nickname.

51
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,950
Your nickname?

52
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,830
What's your nickname?

53
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,800
The last two characters are my nickname.

54
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,560
These two characters...

55
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,750
The last two words?

56
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,160
Brother.

57
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,270
You can't read, can you?

58
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,870
My name is Wang Yiyi.

59
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,800
"One. One. Two. Three. Five."

60
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,560
I'm well-read.

61
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,040
Of course I can't read.

62
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,390
I thought you're called Wang Er.

63
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,600
You're so humorous.

64
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
It's not good to be quiet.

65
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,680
Eldest Brother,

66
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,830
why do you bring me here?

67
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,240
My life is about to die.

68
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,000
You know

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,190
ye Siang's temper.

70
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,830
She tried to kill me.

71
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Can you mind my business?

72
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,310
They will throw me in the ditch.

73
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,630
I have to live with dignity.

74
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,830
I'll get myself something.

75
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,040
You're right.

76
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,720
Where's Second?

77
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,310
Second.

78
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,040
Aren't you afraid of losing something?

79
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,920
Junior.

80
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,040
Who stole this?

81
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,000
No one wants it.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,830
Get down.

83
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,240
Do you sell the goods or not?

84
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,360
Dear customers,

85
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,310
what can I do for you?

86
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,390
I need a suit.

87
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,240
Let me ask you something.

88
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,720
Is it Granny or Granny?

89
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,310
I'll wear it.

90
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,830
You

91
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,680
aren't you looking so strong?

92
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,390
Let me see.

93
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,950
You need to know everything in advance.

94
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,870
Give up in a day or two.

95
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,750
I beat him beforehand.

96
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,000
How did she die?

97
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,270
She might be scared to death.

98
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,240
This is terrible.

99
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,240
The...

100
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,480
Is there any official dress

101
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,600
does it have an official robe?

102
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,560
Yes, there is.

103
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,920
I can customize it.

104
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,480
How many products are there?

105
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,560
As long as you have the money,

106
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,510
I can be any rank.

107
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,510
A Ninth Dan martial arts master will do.

108
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,600
Did you see him?

109
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,190
Tie a paper man for me like this.

110
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,950
I don't have any friends there either.

111
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,720
Ask him to keep me company.

112
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,040
Alright.

113
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,000
Why do you bring me here?

114
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,630
I'm not going.

115
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,510
You do this.

116
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,310
Are you going to prick

117
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,510
that golden couple?

118
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,830
I can tie a golden boy.

119
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,120
Don't make a golden boy.

120
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,360
I only want the girl.

121
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,680
Start a group.

122
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,360
Seven.

123
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,510
Dezhu.

124
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,720
No, seven.

125
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,510
It's too much.

126
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,600
Just two.

127
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,000
It's not enough for two.

128
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,160
Three.

129
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,270
Brother.

130
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,510
In this room,

131
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,510
In this room?

132
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,560
There are no outsiders.

133
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,510
That's me.

134
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,360
Say what you want to say.

135
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,830
I've got a crush on you.

136
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,680
Look at this.

137
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,120
I... Are you satisfied?

138
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,680
Is there anything wrong with your eyes?

139
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,480
Nothing.

140
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,630
You didn't see what was wrong with me, did you?

141
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,000
As the chief of the martial art circle,

142
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,270
as the Chief of the martial arts world?

143
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,800
Furthermore,

144
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,870
everyone has bugs.

145
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,390
Then...

146
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,800
Then it is good.

147
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,870
Then...

148
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,750
This matter...

149
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,040
That's it.

150
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,510
Pick a date

151
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,800
then we'll make a deal.

152
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,560
Come on, drink tea instead of wine.

153
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,630
Replace tea with wine.

154
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,270
Come.

155
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,800
It's settled then.

156
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,750
Alright.

157
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,600
Take care, sister.

158
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,630
I'm still here.

159
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,430
Eldest Brother,

160
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,070
you can buy this shroud and bring it home.

161
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
It's not enough to be washed there.

162
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,560
Be economical with it.

163
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:02,920
Hao Meng, please!

164
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,630
Come here.

165
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,720
Honey,

166
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,240
I'm ready.

167
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,920
Come on.

168
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,240
Sister-in-law.

169
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,440
If not,

170
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,960
make some poison for my brother.

171
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,440
With a knife.

172
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,840
That's terrible.

173
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,750
What are you talking about?

174
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,750
Let me ask you this.

175
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,320
What do you mean with this in my bag?

176
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,320
I won't drink it anymore?

177
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,510
How about I

178
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,080
would I dare?

179
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,000
Why did you give me a blank paper?

180
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
I gave him a piece of paper?

181
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,600
The God's presence!

182
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,120
Your power!

183
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,910
I want to know what you mean.

184
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,360
Dezhu.

185
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,840
You know best what is in my mind.

186
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,870
That's right.

187
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,600
Of course I know.

188
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,000
Right?

189
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:33,960
Sister-in-law.

190
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,480
Why did my brother give you a blank paper?

191
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,550
Instead of black paper?

192
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,390
What do you think

193
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,200
make a guess.

194
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,510
I don't have time to guess with you.

195
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,670
A piece of white paper.

196
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,870
It's...

197
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,750
What my brother meant was that

198
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,670
your love is

199
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
spotless white

200
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,870
right.

201
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,320
Right?

202
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,030
Right.

203
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,510
Silence speaks louder than words in this life.

204
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,840
Yes, everything happens without words.

205
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,150
It's...

206
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,320
Your love is

207
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,550
spotless white

208
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,670
live to old age in conjugal bliss

209
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,510
right.

210
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,270
How can you think so much

211
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,510
can think so much?

212
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,720
Honey,

213
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,150
I thought about this

214
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,790
to think of it

215
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,320
for a long time.

216
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,750
We've married you for so many years,

217
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,720
this is the first time I'm so romantic.

218
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,440
Honey,

219
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,870
everyone, come here.

220
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,550
My dad has something to announce.

221
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,030
Come on.

222
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,240
Get out of here.

223
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,030
What's this?

224
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,030
The things Dezhu bought

225
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,200
he bought.

226
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,910
This is yours.

227
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,000
Come on.

228
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,720
What are you doing?

229
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,320
Come on.

230
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,390
Is everyone here?

231
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,240
I have a happy news for you.

232
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,670
Wang Yiyi and I

233
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,000
will be your future lady master.

234
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,200
We are

235
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,750
satisfied with each other.

236
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,510
Although we haven't known each other for long,

237
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,750
It is much to be regretted that we have not met earlier

238
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,440
don't be anxious.

239
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,600
We'll get married tomorrow.

240
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,150
Tomorrow?

241
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,320
If you are in a hurry,

242
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,030
then tonight.

243
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,080
Tonight?

244
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,030
It's too rushed.

245
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,320
Fourth Mother,

246
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,360
to prepare some delicious dishes.

247
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,390
To celebrate it.

248
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,390
Alright, Master.

249
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,630
No need.

250
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,510
Since...

251
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,670
We're getting married,

252
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,790
we'll just be a family.

253
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,360
Right?

254
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,480
That's a good thing.

255
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,390
Everyone knows I do business.

256
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,910
If I don't want any money.

257
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,910
Today, let's go to Drunken Immortal House

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,390
enjoy good food.

259
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,670
Help yourselves.

260
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,510
I'll wrap up my meal.

261
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,750
Drunk Fairy House?

262
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,440
Alright.

263
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,600
That's great, Madam.

264
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,360
This is the first place

265
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,790
I've never been to a place like that.

266
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,390
Let's go to eat

267
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,200
- Let's eat. - Come on.

268
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,120
I don't think it's necessary to waste

269
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
let's just have one meal

270
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,240
and only have one meal at home

271
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,870
rest early after that.

272
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,600
You must be tired.

273
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,720
Don't move.

274
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,150
Don't move! Stand still!

275
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,080
They are investigating a case.

276
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,030
I don't want to move!

277
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,670
What's going on?

278
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,320
Alright.

279
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,550
Warrior Ximen.

280
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,750
Officer.

281
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,670
Sorry to disturb you.

282
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,000
By the way,

283
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,720
I came to

284
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,790
I need to run an errand.

285
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,870
We're here to catch someone.

286
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,120
Who made trouble again?

287
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,960
Nothing.

288
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,120
Regardless of time.

289
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Although today

290
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,200
Is an important day.

291
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,480
If anyone wants to break the law,

292
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,390
just take them away.

293
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,080
Stop eating, you two.

294
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,960
Are you Wang Yiyi?

295
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,320
Come with us.

296
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,720
Don't touch my lady master!

297
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,390
Get away from me.

298
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,000
She is selling fake alcohol.

299
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,270
Counterfeit alcohol.

300
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,200
What brand?

301
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,550
Hero.

302
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,270
Wine Mask Brand Lady Hong.

303
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,720
Master,

304
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,630
the case is solved.

305
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,840
What about your eyes?

306
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,320
And I was blinded by her alcohol.

307
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,080
Because of it.

308
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,960
Brother.

309
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,360
I'm being falsely accused.

310
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,870
I don't have to! You have to help me!

311
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,320
I can't let them take me away.

312
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,840
Officer,

313
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,840
let's discuss about it.

314
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,200
Can you make a mistake?

315
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,200
This...

316
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,870
Will depart

317
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,320
tomorrow morning

318
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,720
I want to talk to her today

319
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,670
see what's going on.

320
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,870
Hero.

321
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,360
You're making

322
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,720
making it hard for us.

323
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,240
We are impartial in enforcing the law.

324
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,910
Alright.

325
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,080
Take her away.

326
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,720
Brother.

327
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,910
Hero.

328
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,480
Come on.

329
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,080
Brother, you have to help me.

330
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,840
Please help me.

331
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,270
You are the chief.

332
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,120
Yiyi,

333
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,030
to transform herself.

334
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,440
I'll wait for you.

335
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,840
What if

336
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,480
they could leave after getting married?

337
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,630
What the hell is that?

338
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:51,790
Father.

339
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,270
Rou!

340
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,480
Father.

341
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,960
My eyes can well now.

342
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
You can see me now.

343
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,840
You can see now!

344
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,360
You can see me now! Dad!

345
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,910
Father, your eyes are well now.

346
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,320
They are healed.

347
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,870
Father.

348
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,390
My father can see you!

349
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,630
There, father.

350
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,030
It seems Ye Siniang's medical skill

351
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,360
Is quite good.

352
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,200
Alright.

353
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,550
Tell them.

354
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,150
Alright.

355
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,750
It's done.

356
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,630
I'll go tell them.

357
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,120
Alright.

358
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,000
Come on.

359
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,910
Luckily,

360
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,270
the Chief of the martial arts world

361
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,510
of the martial arts world.

362
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,360
Where's my sister-in-law?

363
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,750
What's the matter?

364
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,750
Xiao Meng from the Hao's...

365
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,120
Listen carefully.

366
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,790
In the future,

367
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,000
you need to show respect to me.

368
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,630
From the Marquis Manor.

369
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,200
But I'll go first.

370
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,270
What?

371
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,030
You want to use fake liquor to poison me?

372
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,030
It's even worse than fake alcohol.

373
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,910
You were drunk that day.

374
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,320
You wrote her a repudiation paper.

375
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
You took the wrong one.

376
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,600
You only took a piece of white paper.

377
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,240
What's wrong?

378
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,200
It's true.

379
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,480
It's here.

380
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,000
Prodigal wife!

381
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,000
Listen carefully.

382
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,390
It's written by

383
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,030
we're brothers.

384
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,790
When can I...

385
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,840
Hao Meng!

386
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:25,910
Hao Meng,

387
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,480
I'm calling you from your room. Why aren't you talking?

388
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,480
What are you eating?

389
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,000
Dezhu brought me yuanxiao.

390
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,120
Let me try it.

391
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,550
Is it good?

392
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,480
It's good.

393
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,080
It's so sweet.

394
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,200
Dezhu.

395
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,440
Only one.

396
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,390
And he ate it.

397
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,670
Where have you been?

398
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,870
Master was burning there.

399
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,360
We're all making excuses.

400
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,000
You've got many ideas.

401
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,390
Just think about it.

402
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,840
The bell doesn't ring

403
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,120
who needs to tie the bell.

404
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,270
Are you suggesting

405
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,670
to jail master and

406
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,840
to the landlady.

407
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,550
I went to look for the matchmaker.

408
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,200
I brought her Mandarin Duck List.

409
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,550
Let's three brothers

410
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,840
choose an old woman for master

411
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,910
a wife for you?

412
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,550
Where is this?

413
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,790
Yang Yanru is fifty-one.

414
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,080
47 for Hao Sha Sha.

415
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,510
I can't do this.

416
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,870
Little Huan Huan.

417
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,960
Thirty-three.

418
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,440
Why does this man look

419
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,870
look so familiar?

420
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,600
I think

421
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,000
It's a little...

422
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,790
Look at the face shape.

423
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,510
Look. Why are you laughing?

424
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,920
I know who this is.

425
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,070
Give it to me.

426
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:17,750
Give me that.

427
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,110
Come here.

428
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,590
Here you are.

429
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,590
The eldest of the four sons in the family,

430
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,000
her real name is Ye Siniang.

431
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,590
My wife,

432
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,160
what?

433
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,590
What?

434
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,750
What?

435
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,240
This guy?

436
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,830
This person looks exactly like...

437
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,720
(He looks like my sister-in-law.)

438
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,550
Yes, about the same.

439
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,640
They look exactly the same.

440
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,960
They all have the same name.

441
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,110
No, that's not right.

442
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,830
They must be

443
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,000
where did you do that?

444
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,750
Where did you do that?

445
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,830
I'm going to ask

446
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,680
of the matchmaker

447
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,160
this

448
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,480
there must be a problem.

449
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,240
How could she go on a blind date?

450
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,070
That's impossible.

451
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,070
Give it to me.

452
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,720
My wife,

453
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,350
let go of me.

454
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,200
Let go of me.

455
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,200
Eldest Brother,

456
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,720
a woman's heart.

457
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,160
It's the needle under the sea.

458
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,270
Thanks to your entire second-hand wife

459
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,030
I haven't got any hands on this

460
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,400
why are you three so leisurely?

461
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,310
Aren't you practicing? What are you doing here?

462
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,310
My sister-in-law.

463
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,720
The secret is exposed.

464
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,830
What's wrong with your Eldest Brother?

465
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,000
Dezhu, are you bullying your Eldest Brother again?

466
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,240
I wouldn't dare to do that.

467
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,480
I found that I, Hao Meng,

468
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,000
you're so stupid.

469
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,200
So naive.

470
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,720
What's going on, Jade Man?

471
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,480
I took a Mandarin Duck List

472
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,110
from that woman Wang.

473
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,640
I was thinking to pick an old lady for Master

474
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,110
but we can't.

475
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,550
There was a woman up there.

476
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,830
With your portrait.

477
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,400
Even its name.

478
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,590
But I'm sure that

479
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,590
It was definitely not you.

480
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,270
Ye Xiaohuan,

481
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,200
she lives in Shuangyashan.

482
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,830
She likes sweet potatoes,

483
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,960
and she is very greedy.

484
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,640
Is that you, sister-in-law?

485
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,880
It's me.

486
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,830
What's wrong?

487
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,880
We've been married for so many years,

488
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,480
how could you even pair up?

489
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,110
What?

490
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,350
Are you unhappy with me?

491
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,720
Second thoughts?

492
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,400
Hao Meng, please tell me.

493
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,960
Biao, come on.

494
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,880
That was five years ago,

495
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,960
when we weren't married,

496
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,200
my master registered it for me.

497
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,720
Before I got married,

498
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,310
sister-in-law, you're thirty this year.

499
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,160
Thirty-eight.

500
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,270
I was in the year thirty-three.

501
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,790
I haven't got to touch you yet.

502
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,590
In the email.

503
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,310
Reasonable.

504
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,750
See? I knew I misunderstood you.

505
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,590
No matter how I said it, you wouldn't believe it.

506
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,920
Sister-in-law is not the girl.

507
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,030
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

508
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
It was a wasted joy.

509
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,480
I thought

510
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,590
It's real.

511
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,240
Come on.

512
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,400
You scared me!

513
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,750
If I take her love story,

514
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,720
I was going to find one for Master.

515
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,920
I'll open another pair.

516
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,270
There you are.

517
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,830
Look who's here.

518
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,400
Hey,

519
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,440
granny Cauliflower?

520
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,880
Did Granny Cauliflower miss us?

521
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,000
So she came back to see me.

522
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,160
Where's your master?

523
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,110
Thank you for your help.

524
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,200
Please have some tea.

525
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,480
This time, I fulfilled

526
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,510
I fulfilled my personal wish.

527
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,790
This time,

528
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,480
I came back on purpose

529
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,750
to thank you

530
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,270
taking care of you.

531
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,440
That's what I should do.

532
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,440
I heard from Jade Man.

533
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,720
You treat him

534
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,240
your own child.

535
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,000
And broadening his horizons.

536
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,510
To discuss swords in Changbai Mountain.

537
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,350
You won a

538
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,790
the Chief of the martial arts world.

539
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,750
Congratulations

540
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,960
my little chief.

541
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,830
Not worth mentioning

542
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,680
It happened!

543
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,000
Oh, right.

544
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,240
Thank you for your help.

545
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,440
I...

546
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,790
It's just a token of my appreciation.

547
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,310
To make you a dress.

548
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,590
Try it on.

549
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,960
Come on.

550
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:45,880
Come on.

551
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,480
Put it on and have a look.

552
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,160
Alright.

553
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,510
-How is it? -All right.

554
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,400
Oh, my goodness. Really.

555
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,350
You old rogue.

556
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,880
If you leave right under my nose,

557
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,830
you won't be honest.

558
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,310
Right?

559
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,440
Why did you show up

560
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
whenever the time comes?

561
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,240
I'm wondering the same.

562
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,160
What's wrong with you? Tell me.

563
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,830
What is it?

564
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,270
Where did this little fox spirit come from?

565
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,240
Where are you from?

566
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,640
Simon Changhai.

567
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,720
I don't want to see this woman

568
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,270
who will kill her? You or me?

569
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,240
No one shall hit him.

570
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,000
Let's talk this over, okay?

571
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,640
I have nothing to do with you.

572
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,240
Look at yourself.

573
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,830
I can't talk about it.

574
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,110
Watch your move.

575
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,110
Savior, I'm going to fight.

576
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,920
Listen to me.

577
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,310
We are busy.

578
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,590
Let's talk it over here.

579
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,160
Please don't do that.

580
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,480
Be good. Don't fight.

581
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,830
I'll cook for you.

582
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,960
Let's sit down and drink a bit later.

583
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,110
How could you use the Heart Sutra?

584
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,240
That's crap!

585
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,790
I'm the descendant of Tomb Sect.

586
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,070
Tomb Sect?

587
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,590
Who are you?

588
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,750
Little Dragon Lady is my founder.

589
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,550
The flood rushed into the Dragon King Temple

590
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,680
you're from Tomb Sect too?

591
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,110
I'm the descendant of

592
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,590
of Phoenix Clan.

593
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,000
But my great ancestor Li Mochou

594
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,070
she's from Tomb Sect.

595
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,920
We're a branch of Tomb Sect.

596
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,510
You're with Li Mozhan.

597
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,160
Right.

598
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,880
Your founder

599
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,960
Is the senior of my founder.

600
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,880
In terms of seniority,

601
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,070
I must call you senior sister.

602
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,640
Junior sister.

603
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,640
Junior Sister.

604
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,640
Junior Sister.

605
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,480
We have to know each other.

606
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,550
It's a good thing I didn't kill him.

607
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,790
It's my fault.

608
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,110
I apologize to you.

609
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,240
It's not your fault.

610
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,680
It's my bad temper.

611
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,240
Go and find Changhai.

612
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,200
You're mistaken

613
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,640
we are not in the same relationship

614
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,400
for Brother Changhai.

615
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,790
He is my savior.

616
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,240
I'm not here to steal him from you.

617
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,720
We'll talk about sisters today,

618
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
not men.

619
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,720
Come on.

620
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,440
Go down the mountain?

621
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,880
Let me buy you a drink.

622
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,160
Come on.

623
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,110
This...

624
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,550
Why are they hitting each other?

625
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,440
Haven't you seen enough of it? Yes, I have.

626
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,510
No wonder.

627
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,000
That Senior Gongsun is so familiar with the martial arts.

628
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,590
I see

629
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,310
went to drink together?
