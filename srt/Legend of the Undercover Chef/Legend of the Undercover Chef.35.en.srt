1
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,879
Those with good fortune

2
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,680
to be blessed.

3
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,759
The leader of Tian Chi Gang.

4
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,520
My name is Gao Da Mao.

5
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,560
Where are the salted eggs?

6
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,919
Salted duck egg.

7
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,159
I don't like this.

8
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,879
It's not for you.

9
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,639
When can I have them?

10
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,080
You're too salty.

11
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,840
I have something to tell you.

12
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,560
What is it?

13
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,039
You can't open your mouth.

14
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,759
You can't open your mouth.

15
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:47,560
You can't open your mouth.

16
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,599
Please stop.

17
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,280
I also want to say,

18
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,479
I wanted to say...

19
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,919
Go ahead then.

20
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,879
What's the matter?

21
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,280
But I can't keep my mouth shut.

22
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,520
This is embarrassing.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,639
Stop it if it's embarrassing.

24
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,919
You insist.

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,680
Come on.

26
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,319
Wants to borrow something from you.

27
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,000
Money?

28
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,400
Not right.

29
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,120
This one.

30
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,400
The master of Que Dao Sect

31
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
I'll stay for two days.

32
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,560
What the hell is that?

33
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,719
I don't understand.

34
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,719
I want to be

35
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,840
I'd like to sit here for two days.

36
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,919
From Que Blade Sect?

37
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,639
You want to sit there for two days?

38
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,879
It was fun.

39
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,280
Come on.

40
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,080
To save face,

41
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,000
a group of poor relatives in the countryside.

42
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,400
His wife went home and talked to him.

43
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,080
She said

44
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,800
my current development is great.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,479
No. They are coming for you.

46
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,199
I have to

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,479
show me.

48
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,639
At least I have to

49
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,639
at least.

50
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,479
No matter how I think you are right now,

51
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,360
as you are.

52
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,759
She's here

53
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,400
you look so funny for two days.

54
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,680
For a fool.

55
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,360
OK.

56
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,039
It's nothing.

57
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,919
It's just that they won't come anymore.

58
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,400
I can pretend this time.

59
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,000
As long as you lend me the money.

60
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,360
Because of me.

61
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,639
These folks

62
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,800
treat my wife well.

63
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,399
You're here.

64
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,560
Just two days?

65
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,360
Just two days?

66
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,560
Be sure about it.

67
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
One more request.

68
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,240
For your disciples to

69
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,319
let them call me master

70
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,839
call me master these two days.

71
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,079
He can hit you. Do you believe that?

72
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,040
He can kill me.

73
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,160
I knew that.

74
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,600
The point is

75
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,959
and convey it to them.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,360
They'll follow you

77
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,360
they'll listen to you.

78
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,199
I need to tell them,

79
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,519
they'll have to kill me.

80
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,560
You are their master.

81
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,199
For two days?

82
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,759
Or I don't have enough hands

83
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,399
with just one Sixth Son,

84
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,439
calls me master?

85
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,120
To keep up such a reputation.

86
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,439
You want to save face?

87
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,040
Right.

88
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,040
I think

89
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,319
I think

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,759
In any case,

91
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,319
when people from the village come,

92
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,319
you're right.

93
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,480
I can help you with that.

94
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,040
You know me, brother.

95
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,319
However

96
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,800
will there be any fees?

97
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,079
We may incur some fees.

98
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,560
That I have the base to eat vegetables.

99
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,439
That I have

100
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,560
I have to take care of her?

101
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,160
Just pay it for me first.

102
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,800
The money I owe you?

103
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,360
Yes, I can.

104
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,759
Because one day I'll get over myself.

105
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,120
Do you think you can get over yourself?

106
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,240
Did I stop singing just now?

107
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,600
The blessed have no luck.

108
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,639
Turning over is not something that can be achieved by singing.

109
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,199
I believe that.

110
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,879
I don't believe that.

111
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,399
Okay, I'll help you.

112
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,839
What are you doing?

113
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,399
I'm gonna serve you for the rest of my life.

114
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,199
I don't have to.

115
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,360
I didn't even believe

116
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,759
that it would work.

117
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,120
Brother.

118
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,720
Are you really...

119
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,240
I didn't expect it would work out.

120
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,040
I'm so happy.

121
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,759
I don't have any wishes in my life.

122
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,120
When I turn over,

123
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,720
I'll take good care of you.

124
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,560
I invite you to become the leader of Tian Chi Gang,

125
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,680
for the rest of your life.

126
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,439
That's so nice.

127
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,639
She's warmhearted.

128
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,319
It's about time.

129
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,319
That's about it.

130
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,279
Is it done?

131
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,800
Please

132
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,480
please help me see

133
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,160
what's wrong with it?

134
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,360
It's just a couple of days.

135
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,680
We can do it ourselves.

136
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,120
Sit down.

137
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,519
Alright.

138
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,079
Have a look.

139
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,240
This way then.

140
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't worry.

141
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,480
Just a couple of days.

142
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,959
Please.

143
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,920
There's nothing I can do.

144
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,959
Our poor relatives are coming.

145
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,519
Am I shameless?

146
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,680
He is the leader of Tian Chi Gang after all.

147
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,360
He used to be

148
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,600
right?

149
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,519
Please find a way

150
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,639
these few days

151
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,160
hold your horses.

152
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,240
Call me master.

153
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,000
You can call me deputy master.

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,600
Please don't make trouble.

155
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,000
That's great, bro.

156
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,759
You too.

157
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,680
You're the better.

158
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,879
What's good about us?

159
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,399
Hello, Master.

160
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,279
Right.

161
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,519
Hi, everyone.

162
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,680
Is really good.

163
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,839
We have to put the flag away.

164
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,720
Who is that tall and hairy?

165
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,199
Master knows that

166
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,439
Is too soft-hearted.

167
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,120
His Master will

168
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,680
master will die because of his softhearted heart.

169
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,959
You should talk less,

170
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,920
and work more.

171
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,639
You're not listening to my master, are you?

172
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,120
Enough.

173
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,000
Put it away.

174
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,800
Come on.

175
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,439
Come back.

176
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,920
It's nice.

177
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,560
What are you two doing?

178
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,120
What are we doing?

179
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,040
Are you from the Tianchi Gang?

180
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,800
Tell him who we are.

181
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,959
I'm the leader of Heavenly Pond Gang.

182
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,199
Tall and hairy,

183
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,879
his wife.

184
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:16,839
Uncle.

185
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,800
Hurry.

186
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,839
Take us to see your master.

187
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,160
Hurry up.

188
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,920
Stop dilly-dallying.

189
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,240
Alright.

190
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,319
Come on.

191
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,480
Come on.

192
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,600
Uncle.

193
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,399
Please have some tea.

194
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,000
All right.

195
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,399
And honest.

196
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:32,960
Yes

197
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,799
with your family's conditions,

198
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,960
what you told Feng'er before,

199
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,279
Is a little different.

200
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,120
She said it.

201
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,600
Where I used to live.

202
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
In the west of the city,

203
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,600
and tall gatehouse

204
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,440
and large glazed tiles.

205
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,200
And shiny.

206
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,039
The courtyard walls,

207
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,960
even eagles dare not fall down.

208
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,600
Tie the horse studs.

209
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Is so thick.

210
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,240
That's awesome.

211
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,360
Then why did you move here?

212
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,039
After that, the government always hit me.

213
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,799
What I've built is almost better than the government's.

214
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,039
Isn't it publicity?

215
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,279
Keep it low.

216
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,840
And buy a house.

217
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,360
That's also a good spot with good fortune.

218
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,320
It's better to keep a low profile.

219
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,679
Right.

220
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,200
Uncle.

221
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,840
This is also a good place.

222
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,480
The government will levy a tax on it right away.

223
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,320
Then we can pay Duo money.

224
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,799
That's not bad.

225
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,080
Isn't this Sixth?

226
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
Right! So sixth!

227
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,159
The sixth.

228
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,720
In a flash,

229
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,120
after so many years,

230
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,159
he was so tall,

231
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,279
and fat now.

232
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,279
I've gained some weight.

233
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,360
Since I was little,

234
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,600
even thinner than you.

235
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,000
Right?

236
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,120
Then let me tell you.

237
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,720
We ate at my house every day.

238
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,600
I raised them.

239
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,080
Yes

240
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,519
when we were little,

241
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,399
we often had dinner at our uncles and aunts'.

242
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,799
We should be grateful.

243
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,279
Why didn't you tell me about this?

244
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,000
Both of you

245
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,440
after I knew about this,

246
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,519
I need to be thankful with you.

247
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:43,840
Right.

248
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,039
People like our parents

249
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,600
I'm a grateful person.

250
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,240
I've long heard that Feng'er

251
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,720
that she has

252
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,279
a very capable man.

253
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,480
We as the villagers

254
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,720
are happy for you.

255
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,600
Praised you.

256
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,759
We had a happy life.

257
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,639
Right?

258
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,879
He said you're much better than that tough guy.

259
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,799
Who's that?

260
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:00,759
That Feng'er of Gang...

261
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,000
With a boyfriend

262
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,600
they've been dating for years.

263
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,679
When?

264
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,799
My sister didn't do anything after that.

265
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,679
Are you sure she didn't do anything?

266
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,559
Nothing.

267
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,039
I knew nothing about love back then.

268
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,960
Cut the crap.

269
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,200
Back to business.

270
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,720
Back to business.

271
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,000
Here is the thing.

272
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,600
He's your uncle.

273
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,519
He is at home

274
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,480
she stayed there

275
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,759
that you won't be able to

276
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,480
In the martial arts circle

277
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,360
of all the

278
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,720
In the martial arts circle.

279
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,879
He has status.

280
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,840
That's right.

281
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,000
He has the status

282
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,480
there is.

283
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,360
Plotting with you

284
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,120
to use your connections

285
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,200
to find him a job

286
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,360
In the martial art world.

287
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,759
That'll be easy.

288
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,360
Just find me some errands.

289
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:44,919
You can be...

290
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,639
It's Shaolin.

291
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,240
The place

292
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,360
the wudang area

293
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,679
of Wudang.

294
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,360
Why are you laughing?

295
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,960
Stop laughing.

296
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,759
Why are you drawing your sword?

297
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,759
How can I not

298
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,120
why can't I talk about you?

299
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,360
Please.

300
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,440
He'll leave in a minute.

301
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,519
Shameless!

302
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,159
I know.

303
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,840
Come on.

304
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:11,879
Get off.

305
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,159
Goodness.

306
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,440
I can't control you anymore.

307
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,120
You don't even dare to show some respect to your master.

308
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,159
Can you show me some respect?

309
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,559
I want respect.

310
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,960
I can't even prank them.

311
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,559
Enough, Brother-in-law.

312
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,120
Don't be mad.

313
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,320
Don't be mad.

314
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,000
Husband, don't be like them.

315
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,960
The new apprentice who has just accepted doesn't know the rules.

316
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,360
I was just practicing the martial arts.

317
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,759
My brain is not working well.

318
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,279
Well, you only drew your knife

319
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,080
kneel at the door for three days before I stop.

320
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,360
Uncle.

321
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,159
In my opinion,

322
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,039
don't find other jobs.

323
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,399
And grow crops firmly at home.

324
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,559
How old are you?

325
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,559
It's hard to farm at home.

326
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,720
If that job's not good enough,

327
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,000
the Sect Leader.

328
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,440
That one.

329
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:53,919
What's that?

330
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,720
Here's the Escort!

331
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:57,000
We made a lot of money here!

332
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,440
Give me all these

333
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,960
armed escort or something?

334
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,240
Do you know martial arts?

335
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:02,799
Do you not know martial arts?

336
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,039
That's impossible.

337
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,440
Hey.

338
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,200
It's a better arrangement for you to practice martial arts.

339
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,080
Goodness.

340
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,480
Do you still need to practice martial arts?

341
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,360
I know you.

342
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,960
When I mention you,

343
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,320
you're tall and hairy,

344
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,279
so you're formidable, aren't you?

345
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,600
Right,

346
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,639
with this impressive feat.

347
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,080
Come on.

348
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,240
Uncle and Auntie.

349
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,159
We came this far

350
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:20,919
you must be hungry.

351
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:21,879
Let's eat.

352
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:22,399
Right.

353
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,960
Eat.

354
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,559
To eat.

355
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,120
We have to do that.

356
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,440
Right.

357
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,200
We can talk after the meal.

358
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,480
Alright.

359
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,279
Let's go to the dining hall.

360
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:28,759
Come on.

361
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,200
Alright.

362
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,279
Go on.

363
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,559
Go help uncle and auntie to eat.

364
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,000
Come on.

365
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,200
Is it good?

366
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,360
It's so good.

367
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,240
It's really delicious.

368
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,480
This guy eats so fast.

369
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,840
Take your time. Don't rush.

370
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,480
There's more?

371
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,679
My sister is cooking.

372
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:43,480
Have a try.

373
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,360
There's more?

374
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,720
Every meal should contain meat.

375
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,720
But meat for every meal.

376
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,799
It's been many years since

377
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,320
In my hometown in years.

378
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,240
Eat some.

379
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,679
OK.

380
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,480
Just eat.

381
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,240
You are hungry?

382
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,039
Finally, we have something to eat.

383
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,600
It's time to eat.

384
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,120
You're not waiting for anyone, right?

385
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,639
What are you doing?

386
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,759
What are you doing?

387
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,159
The master is eating here.

388
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,080
How can the servants

389
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,279
are on the table.

390
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,960
I don't know the rules.

391
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:20,879
This...

392
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,639
You still don't understand?

393
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,279
We haven't eaten either.

394
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,679
Leave now.

395
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,200
Come on.

396
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,279
What are you doing?

397
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,840
A fly

398
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,840
these rebellious students

399
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,679
what the hell is that?

400
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,559
Can't you make things worse?

401
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,879
What are we doing here?

402
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,360
Are using us as servants.

403
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,919
Calm down.

404
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,279
This is the task

405
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,039
master's task for us.

406
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,480
The task assigned by us.

407
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,600
Master. Master.

408
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,559
He's done with the arrangement.

409
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,440
And he's left.

410
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,759
Burning shame and humiliation

411
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,000
brother!

412
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,759
You all know

413
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,480
you also saw it.

414
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,799
Besides, master said that

415
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,320
everyone can be in trouble.

416
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,600
I should help her if I need.

417
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,000
It's easier said than done.

418
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,679
Or you'll be mad at me.

419
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,159
I can help.

420
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,799
When can it be the head?

421
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,559
How about this?

422
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,480
Tonight,

423
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,480
get two sacks

424
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,639
grab those two guys...

425
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:38,559
Throw them into the trap.

426
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,840
Senior Brother.

427
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,559
That's an angry word.

428
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,879
Let's be more realistic.

429
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,879
What actual?

430
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,799
As the saying goes,

431
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,159
teaching a man to fish,

432
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,799
Is better than teaching people to fish.

433
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,679
And you want to buy them fish?

434
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,480
I don't mean that.

435
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:58,919
We should

436
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,679
teach him something to earn a living.

437
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,879
How about this?

438
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,159
I'll go to the market tomorrow

439
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,080
to buy some sheep.

440
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,399
Let them keep the sheep

441
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,559
selling wool.

442
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,799
And buy some

443
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,320
of the Western Region.

444
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,600
These seeds

445
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,159
Is five times higher

446
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,679
the yield is five times higher.

447
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,639
As long as they are hardworking,

448
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,720
and become rich,

449
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,279
to become rich.

450
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:18,960
He will not

451
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,360
and stop harassing us.

452
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,600
Your idea is nice.

453
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:26,879
And who will pay for it?

454
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,840
I'll pay.

455
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,279
Whose idea would it be?

456
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,840
It was your idea, too.

457
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,000
These are the seeds of rice.

458
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,519
And these sheep...

459
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,120
Was given to you and him

460
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,559
from our master.

461
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
In the house,

462
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,559
or help me out.

463
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,679
Take these things back to your hometown

464
00:15:58,919 --> 00:15:59,639
I hope

465
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,440
your food and clothing can be solved.

466
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,120
That many?

467
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,320
Master, then...

468
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,720
That everyone

469
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,159
that's nothing.

470
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,000
That's generous.

471
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,799
This is so generous.

472
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,720
We got it?

473
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,519
- Then let's go! - Great!

474
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,039
Come, wife.

475
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,039
Come and take the sheep away.

476
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,159
Come on.

477
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,360
Move along.

478
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,159
Come on.

479
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:18,919
Come on.

480
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,919
When his uncle leaves,

481
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,840
he didn't even inform us about him.

482
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,519
They don't treat me as a human either.

483
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,440
Hey.

484
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,039
You don't see me as a human.

485
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,639
Then you can be happy.

486
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,240
I was acting in your name

487
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,320
I bought goats for your uncles and aunts

488
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,360
from Jiangnan.

489
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,639
There are also some seeds.

490
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,399
But you have to remember,

491
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,919
I'm rich now.

492
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,159
You have to return it to me.

493
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,440
I will definitely return it.

494
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,159
Are you listening?

495
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,879
I will.

496
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,639
During this period,

497
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,559
has caused you a lot of trouble.

498
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,519
These two days,

499
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,320
they messed things up here.

500
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
You're too impatient.

501
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,240
You two

502
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,799
what?

503
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,600
Sorry.

504
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,720
Thank you

505
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,799
brother-in-law, stop dilly-dallying.

506
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,039
Hurry up and leave.

507
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:10,799
Your temper.

508
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,279
Also,

509
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,000
can you leave?

510
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,559
Don't forget to return my money.

511
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,680
I'm relieved now.

512
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,359
That's it?

513
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,720
That's great!

514
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,319
You already spent the money.

515
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,720
Take the money when you go home later.

516
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,759
Then buy me two big gold bracelet.

517
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,400
You are rich?

518
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,079
Hairy guy?

519
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,880
All you can do is spend money.

520
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:02,720
Stand up.

521
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,359
This place...

522
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,640
And he's sitting here

523
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,079
he doesn't know the rules.

524
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,160
Are you the one sitting here?

525
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,599
Get the knife!

526
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Put it back.

527
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,720
You know nothing about the rules.

528
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:24,839
According to the seniority,

529
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,799
you should call me Advisor.

530
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,920
Do you know that?

531
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,400
I don't...

532
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,559
What?

533
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:31,240
I'll...

534
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:32,839
Where

535
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,680
our master bought you goats and rice seeds?

536
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,279
I've sold them off the mountain.

537
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,279
Sold?

538
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,240
Where is the money?

539
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:40,960
Money?

540
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,160
You bought the wine?

541
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,720
You bought wine?

542
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,319
Haven't you had enough?

543
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,599
I just got this jar back.

544
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,200
It seems there's a reason

545
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,279
for being poor.

546
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,119
Hairy guy.

547
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,160
Come out now.

548
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,640
It's hairy.

549
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,119
Hair.

550
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,119
My goodness!

551
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,319
Why is she back?

552
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,720
Think back and forth to oneself

553
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,039
after much consideration.

554
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:18,480
We

555
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,279
ready?

556
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,640
Stop looking for work?

557
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,160
Right.

558
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,920
Great.

559
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,319
We can only be with you

560
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,799
for the rest of our lives.

561
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,519
No matter what,

562
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,759
you are all my master.

563
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,759
Once...

564
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:44,720
In the past.

565
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,720
But now they're down and out.

566
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,799
A broken-down phoenix is not as good as a chicken.

567
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,519
He must have met a problem.

568
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,480
We should help her.

569
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,000
Master.

570
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,160
I got it.

571
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,200
Tall hairy man?

572
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,680
He's tall.

573
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:10,960
He's not here.

574
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,720
What's up

575
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,480
what's up

576
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,519
those two relatives of yours

577
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,720
are so slow.

578
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,880
How much did you have for dinner then?

579
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,680
And went to the kitchen to look for some corn at night

580
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,599
to roast corn

581
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,119
the roof is almost on fire

582
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:25,319
luckily, it was discovered in time.

583
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,759
Otherwise we would all be burned to death.

584
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,519
That's right.

585
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,559
And the rouge and powder on my dressing table

586
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:30,480
are gone.

587
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,319
I suspect your aunt took it.

588
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,519
My aunt is so old.

589
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:36,160
How could she touch your stuff?

590
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,119
It's hairy.

591
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,720
It's hairy.

592
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:39,599
It's hairy.

593
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,559
Where's Mao?

594
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,000
Auntie, what happened to your face?

595
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,720
To the rouge.

596
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,839
Here I am.

597
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,519
I eat well and stay here.

598
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,960
I need to drink something, too.

599
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,200
Does it look nice?

600
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,599
It's nice.

601
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,480
It's great.

602
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,000
It's beautiful.

603
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,119
The...

604
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:55,960
And niece.

605
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,200
Do you have any writing paper?

606
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,880
What's that for?

607
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,400
I'm going to write a letter

608
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,799
to all my friends and relatives back home

609
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,519
I'm going to compliment them.

610
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:20,920
Mr. and Mrs. Gao.

611
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,839
Please have some tea.

612
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,279
It's good.

613
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,839
Good tea.

614
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,880
The good tea.

615
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,680
It's hairy.

616
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,000
We've lived here for such a long time,

617
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:40,880
to tell you

618
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,359
something important.

619
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,440
Uncle and Auntie,

620
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,640
your kindness to my family

621
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,880
Is so great.

622
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,720
You took care of my wife

623
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,920
and my brother-in-law.

624
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,640
I should repay your kindness.

625
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,400
I know that

626
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,079
you've been staying these days.

627
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,400
Feel guilty.

628
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,359
You think you brought us a lot of trouble.

629
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,720
Not at all.

630
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,160
No trouble at all.

631
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:08,440
So many people.

632
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,759
You have to pay

633
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:11,880
well, you two,

634
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,599
right.

635
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
Don't leave in such a hurry.

636
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,759
I'm not leaving in a hurry.

637
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:15,920
In no hurry?

638
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,160
We're in no hurry to go back.

639
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,519
I don't want to go back.

640
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:22,160
I have good news for you.

641
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,400
A couple of days ago,

642
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,119
I'll write a letter back to my hometown.

643
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:25,640
Right.

644
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,359
I'll tell the folks back home

645
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,599
that the tall and hairy

646
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,799
took us in.

647
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,839
What's wrong?

648
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,000
I'll ask them to praise you.

649
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,400
And in the east of the village

650
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,960
they were going to set up a monument for you.

651
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,359
Now they're all moved.

652
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,319
Now they're all coming for you.

653
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,440
Where have you been?

654
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
On the way.

655
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:51,640
They'll be here soon.

656
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,480
Here they are.

657
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,799
It's all here.

658
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,680
For your health.

659
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,960
Are all here.

660
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,079
Are you happy?

661
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,880
Tell me, are you happy?

662
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,640
Look at this.

663
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,039
You must be happy.

664
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:23,720
We should thank Mao

665
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,519
you know?

666
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:25,519
Alright.

667
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,920
We should thank Mao

668
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,839
you know?

669
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,559
Alright.

670
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,440
Thank you Mao.

671
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,359
Thank Mao

672
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,359
do you see that?

673
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,519
Look at this.

674
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:46,319
Our rice jar will bottom out tonight.

675
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,400
These are a bunch of hungry ghost!

676
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,480
We can hold them for several meals.

677
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,319
But where to live later.

678
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,559
You can't live outside.

679
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,400
There are children and old people here.

680
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,960
Just live here.

681
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,200
That girl shouldn't go back and forth.

682
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,960
Brother.

683
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:35,920
Drink the liquor.

684
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,079
When I was little,

685
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,920
too smelly!

686
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,359
Master.

687
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,640
This is a big deal.

688
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,359
That tall hairy guy

689
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:12,400
and brought all the villagers

690
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,160
of their village here.

691
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:13,920
The Quedao Sect

692
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,240
has become a refugee camp.

693
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,759
Not only for free meals and drinks,

694
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,759
and you took money for nothing.

695
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,920
It's a little too much.

696
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,440
Right?

697
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,400
I'm really ashamed.

698
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,839
I won't let him do that.

699
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:25,799
It's just an extortion.

700
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,720
That's right.

701
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:28,599
Like this.

702
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,440
You know what?
