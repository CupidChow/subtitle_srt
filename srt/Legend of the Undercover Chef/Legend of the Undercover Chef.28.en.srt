1
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,790
So, what kind of person

2
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,560
what kind of person?

3
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,280
You

4
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,000
how am I a human being?

5
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,910
Your origin is...

6
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,120
You were actually

7
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,000
In the world.

8
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,630
You were so submissive to me.

9
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,590
I have the final say.

10
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,910
Can you still do that?

11
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,280
What do you want?

12
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,360
I want candied haws.

13
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,190
Alright.

14
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,560
Here you are.

15
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,750
I don't want to eat candied hawthorns.

16
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,000
I want to eat a roasted sweet potato.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
Alright.

18
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,310
Here you are.

19
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,190
I don't want to eat roasted sweet potato.

20
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,280
I want the roast chicken rack.

21
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,120
Great.

22
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,960
I don't want to eat the chicken rack either.

23
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,710
I want to eat the mountain dates which grow on the cliff.

24
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,560
Great.

25
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,000
Go now.

26
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,680
Your brother-in-law has been out for two days.

27
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,280
Why hasn't he come back?

28
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,680
Yes, I'm also confused.

29
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,470
Where do you think this person went?

30
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,560
I asked the newspaper store.

31
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,030
He didn't go there at all.

32
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,000
Did he take the money

33
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,910
the wrong place?

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,840
She can't.

35
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,360
I went to Yihong Yard too.

36
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,240
She's not there.

37
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,960
What are you waiting for?

38
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,470
Mobilize the whole clan to look for me.

39
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,800
Be sure to show them.

40
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,520
Yes

41
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,280
come on.

42
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,680
You should come with him.

43
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,750
Alright, I'll go.

44
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,720
It's not right.

45
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,800
To serve my father

46
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,070
and my sister.

47
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,070
How can I serve you two?

48
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:48,950
Shame on me, too.

49
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,560
The crown prince of Que Blade Sect.

50
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,510
- Ximen. - Be a good boy.

51
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,240
Come here.

52
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,160
She has recovered.

53
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,240
Today is the first day

54
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,830
this is the first lesson.

55
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,240
Let's start from the beginning.

56
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,560
Start from the beginning.

57
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,830
Catch up on what you lack.

58
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's talk about

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,920
the Tao Te Ching.

60
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,190
I'm wicked?

61
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,040
I will make it up to you.

62
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,510
Alright.

63
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,920
Turn back.

64
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,310
What a treasure!

65
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,160
Can it be said?

66
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,600
I don't know.

67
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,070
I know it very well.

68
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,830
I don't know.

69
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,800
I don't know.

70
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,560
Don't be anxious.

71
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,510
Slowly.

72
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,310
Alright.

73
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,120
What a treasure!

74
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,600
Put your hands back.

75
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,510
The lesson is a little profound.

76
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,430
How about this?

77
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,720
Let's meet the virtues one by one.

78
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,120
Alright?

79
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,390
First, OK?

80
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,390
Alright.

81
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,270
Virtue is easy to deal with.

82
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,310
Alright.

83
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,310
Put your hands down.

84
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Back your hands.

85
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,600
What a treasure!

86
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,270
Start from the shallow to the deep.

87
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:56,870
Alright?

88
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,680
Alright.

89
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,630
Let's learn the Three-character Classic first.

90
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,070
The Three-Character Classic?

91
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,750
In the beginning,

92
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,190
are basically good in nature.

93
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,600
We are similar in nature,

94
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,240
they are remote.

95
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,480
Please teach me.

96
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,720
I'll bark.

97
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,070
Woof.

98
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,070
I need dog food?

99
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,040
Look at this.

100
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,040
You're the only horse left.

101
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,870
Every move

102
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,920
you will die.

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,430
It has been two hours.

104
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,390
I still want to.

105
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,240
Why did you touch my car?

106
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,830
This is...

107
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,800
My horse!

108
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,310
Is this your carriage?

109
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,070
Horse carriage.

110
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,430
That's not true.

111
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,160
They look so serious in playing chess.

112
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,630
Dad, give me a drumstick.

113
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,830
For Eldest Brother.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,680
I'll give it to Eldest Brother.

115
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,870
He saved my life.

116
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,190
If nothing else,

117
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,070
I'll go back and wash your socks.

118
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,070
It seems that education

119
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,920
can really change a person's humanity.

120
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,190
It's been a few days.

121
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,240
What about the promise of the tall hairy guy?

122
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,830
Rest assured, eunuch.

123
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:40,870
Master Gao

124
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,040
Is a reliable and reliable official.

125
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,240
One word is as heavy as nine tripods

126
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
I won't let you down.

127
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,480
He's probably

128
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,070
ximen Changhai by now.

129
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,070
But I didn't have time to report to you.

130
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,160
Just wait.

131
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,830
I'll go and take a look.

132
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,000
Hurry up.

133
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,800
Yes

134
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,120
what are you looking at?

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let's go, dad.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,630
Alright.

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This is bad, Tall Fur.

138
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:04,950
Stop it.

139
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,480
Dad, do you want to eat?

140
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,270
Master,

141
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,430
we are wrong!

142
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,360
It's wrong, Master!

143
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,000
Master, we are wrong.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Who are you?

145
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,070
Sixth brother.

146
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,430
Master,

147
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,360
we didn't spend any of that.

148
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,160
Saved it all for you.

149
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,160
Alright.

150
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,270
You two, just go.

151
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,870
Let's go, father.

152
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,390
Uncle, please.

153
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,560
Please give me some money, sir.

154
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,600
Please, sir.

155
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Please give me some money, sir.

156
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,360
Thank you, Uncle.

157
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,550
Father.

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,840
I'm tired.

159
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,360
Let me carry you then.

160
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,510
No one can carry his son.

161
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,360
No one can carry his father.

162
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,000
Come on.

163
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,200
What a treasure!

164
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,240
-Okay. -Dad.

165
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,510
Father, I have no strength.

166
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,200
Thank you, Uncle.

167
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,120
Let's go, father.

168
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,840
- Are you tired? - Dad.

169
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,150
Why am I tired?

170
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,120
Don't you feel tired either?

171
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,630
Not too tired?

172
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,630
Such a good boy!

173
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,720
Dad, am I a good baby?

174
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,320
Am I a good baby?

175
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,200
Good baby?

176
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,150
I'm such a good baby, Dad.

177
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,270
Such a good boy.

178
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,870
You said that that tall brat

179
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,440
can make Ximen Changhai

180
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,790
beyond redemption?

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,120
What's with the traitor?

182
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,200
That you lied to me.

183
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,080
Eunuch, please calm down.

184
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,440
I'm also wondering.

185
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,120
With Master Gao's wisdom and talent,

186
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,030
right?

187
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,840
You killed her to save me?

188
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm suspecting that you are using

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,030
are using a series of stratagems.

190
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,080
And you think I'm a fool.

191
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,840
You'll be fined five years' salary.

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,870
Get out of here.

193
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,550
Scram!

195
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,240
I'm sorry.

196
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,360
It ticks me off

197
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,600
how can I kill

198
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,670
then we won't be able to find him.

199
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,390
What are you doing?

200
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,120
Go find them now.

201
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,510
Please

202
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,440
sister.

203
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,080
You have found my brother-in-law.

204
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,550
Where is he?

205
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,150
He...

206
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,120
Tell me now!

207
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
He has become someone else's horse.

208
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,240
What did you say

209
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,440
It's true.

210
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,080
Today I saw

211
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,440
ximen Changhai riding on him

212
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,550
and shop with him.

213
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,390
My husband...

214
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,390
My poor husband.

215
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,480
What has she been through?

216
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,480
Sister.

217
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,390
Stop crying.

218
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,750
Crying doesn't help.

219
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,870
My brother-in-law must have

220
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,240
Is held hostage by them.

221
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,080
A pressing matter of the moment

222
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,960
we have to save him

223
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,720
to get him out of the clutches of the devil.

224
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,720
The Que Blade Sect again?

225
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,480
Sixth Son.

226
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,390
Call for help.

227
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,390
We are going to save your brother-in-law.

228
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:03,910
Come on.

229
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,360
Cut the crap!

230
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,840
Hand them over now!

231
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,120
Jerk.

232
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,750
Don't be rude.

233
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,750
Don't forget that

234
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm an all-powerful

235
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,320
t-Rex.

236
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,750
Were you so deaf?

237
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,000
How many times have I told you?

238
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,840
Hand over my brother-in-law now!

239
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,750
She is forcing me.

240
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,550
That...

241
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,630
We don't need to pull a lot of trouble.

242
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,840
Listen to me.

243
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,440
In this period,

244
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,080
he is with us.

245
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,320
He's good.

246
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,320
My master taught him

247
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,870
the Three-Character Classic,

248
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,510
the One Hundred Family Names.

249
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,480
They get along well.

250
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,270
Bullshit!

251
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,240
I saw Ximen Changhai with my own eyes

252
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,630
on my brother-in-law's back.

253
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,600
That's not riding.

254
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,480
That's carrying.

255
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,360
We're getting along so well together.

256
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,200
Cut the crap.

257
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,390
Simon Changhai

258
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,390
listen to me. Don't shout.

259
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,910
You will wake my master up.

260
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,360
You can't take him back.

261
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,840
They're like

262
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,390
like they own each other.

263
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,030
Cut the crap.

264
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,120
Simon Changhai

265
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,720
don't cry out.

266
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,630
Don't be a coward.

267
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,720
Hand over my brother-in-law.

268
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,440
Don't speak.

269
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,960
Baby, baby!

270
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,150
Come here, baby!

271
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,440
Husband and brother-in-law.

272
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,080
Husband!

273
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,550
Are similar in nature and remote in practice.

274
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,240
Hurry!

275
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,000
Honey.

276
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,240
If dogs don't bark, I will.

277
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,120
Woof woof.

278
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,480
Honey, are you OK?

279
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,910
Honey, are you all right?

280
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,270
What are you?

281
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,720
Who are you?

282
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,480
Brother-in-law.

283
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,000
Brother-in-law.

284
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,870
I'm the sixth son.

285
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,630
Brother-in-law, I'm the eighth son.

286
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,720
Honey.

287
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,120
Isn't she silly?

288
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,030
What...

289
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,360
What did you cook for my brother-in-law?

290
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,120
Listen to me.

291
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,000
That a while ago,

292
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,150
he was knocked out

293
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,440
In the woods

294
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,600
and lost his memory.

295
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,360
And I saved her.

296
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,030
Stop it!

297
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,550
Brother-in-law!

298
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:47,960
Go home.

299
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,510
What are you doing? Leave!

300
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,390
I'm not going home.

301
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,670
Go home with my sister.

302
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,150
Ximen Changhai is my father.

303
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,670
This is Ximen, Baobao.

304
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,360
Come on. Let's go home.

305
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,870
Listen to me.

306
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,390
I designate him to go with you.

307
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,200
Honey,

308
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,720
they will take you home.

309
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,120
I won't go.

310
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,750
You're not going?

311
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,870
Just listen to me.

312
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,840
Stay still.

313
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,480
Stay still.

314
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,390
What are you doing?

315
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:07,870
Take her away.

316
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,390
Brother-in-law.

317
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,200
You can take it away now.

318
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,840
Honey.

319
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,440
Husband.

320
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,750
You guys tell Ximen Changhai

321
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,720
It's not over yet.

322
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,910
Just wait.

323
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,790
Come on.

324
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,670
Go and plug the gate.

325
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,510
Hurry up!

326
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,200
You're fast.

327
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,030
How about I show you the Iron Head Strike?

328
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,360
You wouldn't know.

329
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,390
Small sample.

330
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,960
This fellow is with my master.

331
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,600
They're like brothers.

332
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,200
At this rate,

333
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,030
the Master of Que Blade Sect

334
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,320
I can't even pick it up.

335
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,150
What are you doing?

336
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,960
She woke up.

337
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,240
It creeps me out.

338
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,870
He's awake.

339
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,910
Brother-in-law.

340
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,480
Honey.

341
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,270
My head hurts so much.

342
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,000
Bro

343
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,390
look at me.

344
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
Do you know me?

345
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,240
Isn't it Sixth Son?

346
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
She recognizes him?

347
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,360
There she is.

348
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,840
Do you know who I am?

349
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Aren't you my virtuous wife?

350
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,360
You know someone.

351
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,790
Master.

352
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,320
Brother-in-law.

353
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,960
Husband. Master.

354
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,870
You are finally awake.

355
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,150
You finally know me.

356
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Let go of me.

357
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,720
Let go of me.

358
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,550
Let go of me!

359
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,320
I'm not dead yet!

360
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,480
Why are you crying?

361
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,150
They're still alive.

362
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,320
During this period of time,

363
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,840
than to die.

364
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,510
Than dying!

365
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,750
What?

366
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,270
He forgot it.

367
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:40,960
Lost my memories?

368
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:41,840
I lost my memory?

369
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,150
You don't remember anything?

370
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:43,600
What?

371
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,550
I just woke up after sleeping.

372
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,870
I want to know what you're doing.

373
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,910
To rebel.

374
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,480
Right.

375
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,630
He lost his memory.

376
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,750
He can't remember.

377
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,480
Why are you still sleeping?

378
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,240
You've been staying

379
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,870
on the Que Blade Gate all this time?

380
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,270
Such nonsense!

381
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,480
Why should I go to Que Blade Sect?

382
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,320
What else?

383
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,840
You've been ridden by others,

384
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,360
you were on their ride?

385
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,030
Then Ximen Changhai will ride you to shop?

386
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,600
You're going to know it's my birthday, aren't you?

387
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,720
You are teasing me?

388
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,320
Teasing you what?

389
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,270
You don't believe anything

390
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,790
how can you call others father?

391
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,240
Who will you call dad?

392
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,750
Ask Ximen Changhai to call him Dad.

393
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,390
You always call him Dad.

394
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,120
That's so sweet.

395
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,390
How many times do you shout?

396
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,550
Don't yell all the time.

397
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,870
All the time!

398
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,600
I always call Xi Men Changhai dad.

399
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,320
I lost my memory.

400
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,720
He really is Ximen Changhai.

401
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,840
Wait and see.

402
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,150
Eunuch!

403
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,910
Are you still angry?

404
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,720
Take it easy.

405
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,600
That rascal Gao

406
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,390
I tripped over you

407
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,270
before Eunuch Cao.

408
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,390
About this,

409
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,240
to this matter.

410
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,120
Right.

411
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,390
There must be an explanation.

412
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,120
The Tianchi Gang

413
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,030
shall not be opened again.

414
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
It can't be opened any more.

415
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,630
You're like an echo.

416
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,320
I'm not the echo.

417
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,000
I can read your mind.

418
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,510
What you're thinking.

419
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,960
I know what you're thinking.

420
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,000
Inform Yamen

421
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,720
and check the taxes of Tianchi Gang.

422
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,440
As for Gao Damao,

423
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,840
do things stealthily

424
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,960
and schemes secretly.

425
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,550
We can't afford to be investigated.

426
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,200
Alright.

427
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
I got it.

428
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,360
About this,

429
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,600
I'll do it tomorrow.

430
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,240
Don't worry.

431
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,030
Sister-in-law.

432
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,000
Sister-in-law.

433
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,110
She's here.

434
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,240
Sister-in-law.

435
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,240
You wanted to see me?

436
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,510
What are you doing?

437
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,680
Why are you yelling?

438
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,720
You're overreacting.

439
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,550
What is this?

440
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Don't rub it on my face.

441
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,510
You finally put it on.

442
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,440
Haven't you heard that

443
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,200
notices are posted in the city.

444
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,960
The No. 1 flower-plucking thief in Japan.

445
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,110
Flower butterflies

446
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,960
frequently shows up in Liaodong.

447
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,350
The notice says

448
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,550
women under the age of 80

449
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,750
Under the age of 80.

450
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,640
Got it?

451
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,830
What?

452
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,960
Even an 80-year-old boy.

453
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,440
If not, he's a pervert.

454
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,310
Is this scary?

455
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,270
Scary?

456
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,640
Sister-in-law.

457
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,030
Then why did you plaster it?

458
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,480
I am so pretty.

459
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,070
What if he is watching me?

460
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,030
I only love

461
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,070
eldest Brother,

462
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,030
keep one's integrity

463
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,030
your sister-in-law.

464
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,830
You put so much ash on your face

465
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,680
because you don't want butterflies in your stomach.

466
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,350
That's right.

467
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,030
Isn't it safer

468
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,200
for you to wear it?

469
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,310
How could you?

470
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,030
Xiaorou.

471
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,830
You are safe.

472
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,510
Here, I'll apply some to you.

473
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,790
Come on.

474
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,790
Sister-in-law, come here.

475
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,110
I've been sitting here for hours.

476
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,720
Can we catch

477
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,200
catch him?

478
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,310
Recently, the rapist

479
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,510
are active in this area.

480
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,480
We can definitely wait.

481
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,550
I'm a little sleepy.

482
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,750
We are a righteous sect.

483
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,030
We must kill the tyrant

484
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,110
get rid of an evil for the people

485
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,270
get lost.

486
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,200
I know that

487
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,350
of your love.

488
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,880
You are doing this for Xiaorou.

489
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,160
Didn't you also do it for Ye Siniang?

490
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,110
Blow it.

491
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,790
That rapist...

492
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,920
Is as skilled as Ye Siniang's martial art.

493
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,400
Even the rapist

494
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,310
and arrest Ye Siniang,

495
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,590
he must send me back intact.

496
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,070
Stop it.

497
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,790
But I think it over.

498
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,350
Pervert!

499
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,200
Where are you going?

500
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,920
Stop.

501
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,070
You're fast.

502
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,110
Did you stab...

503
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,270
That cut?

504
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,240
It's on her buttock.

505
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
It's bleeding.

506
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,590
It won't run very far.

507
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,000
You two have been away for so long

508
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,350
are not back yet.

509
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,920
Right.

510
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,480
Why isn't she back yet?

511
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,790
Sister-in-law.

512
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,070
I don't think

513
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,200
unnecessary to make yourself like this.

514
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,030
How is it unnecessary?

515
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,960
We are talking about rapist.

516
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,030
Butterflies.

517
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,880
It'll be worth it if he keeps an eye on you.

518
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,550
What if it is?

519
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,440
There is no "if."

520
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,200
I will protect you

521
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,400
to protect you two.

522
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,110
How about this?

523
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,830
Senior Sister.

524
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,590
Sister.

525
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,830
It's getting late.

526
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,830
Please take a rest.

527
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,030
I wait for two senior brothers.

528
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:37,960
Eldest Brother!

529
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,000
Did you catch him?

530
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,070
I'll tell you that

531
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,920
I will tell you.

532
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,510
Don't...

533
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,200
Sit down.

534
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,640
It's good news.

535
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,480
By the way,

536
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,270
first Brother and I

537
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,590
caught the rapist,

538
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,200
we stayed together for three hours.

539
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,920
But there's no trace of the rapist.

540
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,640
We

541
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,270
want to give up.

542
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,880
Then we thought about

543
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,720
to save the people.

544
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,270
How can we give up so easily?

545
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,480
It was at this critical moment that

546
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,070
the rapist

547
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,240
appeared.

548
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,920
I shouted out

549
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,920
"Arrest!"

550
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,160
Pervert!

551
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,440
Serve your life!

552
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,680
After hearing this,

553
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,440
let go of the weak girl

554
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,750
and fled in a flurry.

555
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,440
I saw it.

556
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,920
And in a flash

557
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,110
took my precious knife,

558
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,880
which clank.

559
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
Just one stab.

560
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,550
Alright.

561
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,070
I only listen to

562
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,350
the sound of

563
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,350
was killed by you.

564
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,200
On the buttocks.

565
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,920
Why didn't you chop off your head?

566
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
I was going

567
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,790
I wanted to behead him indeed.

568
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,680
Then I changed my mind.

569
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,070
Off his ass.

570
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,510
I want him to die

571
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,680
die in pain.

572
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Thinking about it now,

573
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,960
I'm also mean.

574
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,310
It won't kill people, will it?

575
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,350
Younger Brother,

576
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,830
In the face of danger,

577
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,790
In the face of danger.

578
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,830
I can't be

579
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,480
a coward?

580
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,350
Yes

581
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,200
I don't have Eldest Brother

582
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,480
and Second Brother are capable.

583
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,030
But I have to

584
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,310
I have to protect my family.

585
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,920
I have to protect my sister-in-law

586
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,200
my sister-in-law and senior Xiaorou.

587
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,440
Hao Meng,

588
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,640
what are you doing?

589
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,510
You're staying silent.

590
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,070
You went to bed?

591
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,510
Dezhu beat me to it.

592
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,110
I planned to subdue the rapist

593
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,110
with Iron Head Skill.

594
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,000
I have already worked hard.

595
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,030
But when I took a closer look,

596
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,880
there was a cut on my buttocks.

597
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,830
I lost all my power.

598
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,350
Why would you take it?

599
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,350
I'm afraid I'll get hit.

600
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
Your face

601
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,680
put on makeup.

602
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,550
She looks pretty after the makeup.

603
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,510
What are you talking about?

604
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,070
I can't tell that

605
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,680
take a look at my face. Is it beautiful?

606
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,350
You're right.

607
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,110
That's it.

608
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,510
I'm sure he'll keep an eye on me.

609
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,680
You don't have to...

610
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
He's dying now.

611
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,310
He has no time to watch you.

612
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,400
Ximen Changhai.

613
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,110
If I can't bring you down,

614
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,440
I swear I won't be a mortal.

615
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,310
Stop making promises.

616
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,350
If it hadn't been for your

617
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,590
find fault with Ximen Changhai,

618
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,350
can we lose that much money?

619
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,590
How much is the loss?

620
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,510
All the losses are for the sake of

621
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,160
In the end, he has to take it back for me

622
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,480
and deliver it to me himself.

623
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,270
Really?

624
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,310
No. Believe me?

625
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,640
As if.

626
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,590
Don't forget we have Eunuch Wang.

627
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,880
I can ask Eunuch Wang to help me.

628
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
I can't cure him.

629
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,440
Let Eunuch Wang cure him?

630
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,750
Do you believe it or not?

631
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,440
I dare let Eunuch Wang

632
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,960
his house!

633
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,030
Eunuch Wang is here.

634
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,310
Eunuch Wang!

635
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,240
Eunuch Wang,

636
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,510
thank you for coming.

637
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,440
Of your coming?

638
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,160
Yes

639
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,880
the operator of Heavenly Pond Gang, Gao Da Mao

640
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,550
yes, Your Majesty.

641
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,000
Is suspected of committing serious business violations

642
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,270
bluff and deceive

643
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:55,830
according to the law,

644
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,480
close down the violators

645
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,400
close it down.

646
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,830
I'll confiscate all my assets.

647
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,960
Eunuch Qiu,

648
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
you can't either.

649
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,590
Don't...

650
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,400
Don't, Eunuch Wang.

651
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,680
Eunuch Wang, there's something else you want to do.

652
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,240
What law is my brother-in-law against?

653
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,200
Right.

654
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,510
I...

655
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,270
My goodness!
