1
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,480
Don't you feel anything?

2
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,840
Nothing.

3
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,960
She's screwed.

4
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,150
She is paralyzed.

5
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,360
Honey,

6
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
don't jump to any conclusion.

7
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,430
Try knocking in other places.

8
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,840
You too.

9
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,910
The body is so square.

10
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,120
But why are they so fragile?

11
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,430
And now I can't even stand up.

12
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,590
Stand up.

13
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,630
I can't stand up.

14
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,030
Xiaoqin.

15
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,280
The wounds aren't the same.

16
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,150
His wound rotted right after he was injured.

17
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,080
It stinks.

18
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,000
My legs are rotten.

19
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,840
What should I do?

20
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,000
Stop it.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,360
I smell your feet.

22
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,470
Didn't you see me take a spoonful of it and turn outward?

23
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,630
That way?

24
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,430
Where's the kid who hit me?

25
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,430
I'm going to kill him.

26
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,520
Where is he?

27
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,280
Hey.

28
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,030
He left it in my room.

29
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
He's more miserable than you are.

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
Please let him go.

31
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,960
It's all your fault.

32
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,710
Alright.

33
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,870
Calm down.

34
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,310
Xiaorou.

35
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,080
Rou.

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,190
Senior Brother.

37
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,750
Look at that.

38
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,710
He is sick.

39
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,910
Will you abandon me in the future?

40
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,030
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,190
I have always despised you.

42
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,150
Xiaorou,

43
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,000
don't irritate him at this time.

44
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,800
Comfort him.

45
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,030
Don't cry, Senior.

46
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,030
I won't abandon you.

47
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,800
I won't abandon you.

48
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,960
You believe her.

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,080
Sister-in-law is a great doctor.

50
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,800
I'm sure you will be cured.

51
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,190
Sister-in-law.

52
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,430
Come with me.

53
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,800
My goodness!

54
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,190
Hairy.

55
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,190
Are you watching me?

56
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,750
That hurts.

57
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,430
How could a dying person

58
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,590
how can it not be found?

59
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,590
I've lived an honorable life.

60
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,960
I'm not afraid of anything.

61
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,190
I'm only afraid that my wife will cry.

62
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,680
Your Ladyship,

63
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,920
don't cry and you'll hurt yourself.

64
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,120
Trust me.

65
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,000
We will certainly find

66
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,800
you don't have any clue?

67
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,040
There's a pit.

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,800
Is there a telescope there?

69
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,920
He's tall and hairy.

70
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,310
Look at the current situation.

71
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,870
Look for your stupid binoculars.

72
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,270
Don't do useless things on me.

73
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,360
You know what?

74
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,950
If you don't find my brother today,

75
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,560
I will make you pay.

76
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:42,870
Are you listening?

77
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,750
This is not over.

78
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,000
This is not over.

79
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,720
Right.

80
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,270
Go on.

81
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,750
I'll surely find the binoculars.

82
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:07,920
Found it.

83
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,310
Please give this to Senior for me.

84
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,360
Intermittent White Jade Ointment?

85
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,160
It is a wonder drug in the martial art world.

86
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,630
It is said that

87
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,000
there's only one bottle left.

88
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,950
Why is this in your hand?

89
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,070
This is what Granny Cauliflower

90
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,270
before she left.

91
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Is his clan's heirloom.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,600
To save my life.

93
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,630
Congwen is against me now.

94
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,560
Give this to him.

95
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,190
Treat him.

96
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,000
He'll recover after that.

97
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,160
This Dezhu must be saved.

98
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,510
Your Highness,

99
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,240
why are you crying?

100
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,600
If you don't want to leave,

101
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,040
I'll understand.

102
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,800
Your wife.

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,070
Don't think too much.

104
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,510
My tears

105
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,120
were due to

106
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,920
who choked on my feet.

107
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,070
Thank you, Yu Lang.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,070
It's great this time.

109
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,040
Oh, my goodness!

110
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,160
Dezhu!

111
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,360
Come on.

112
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,390
Stand up.

113
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,240
Come on!

114
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,830
Come on!

115
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,560
Stand up.

116
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,120
Great!

117
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,950
Alright.

118
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,000
Walk a few steps.

119
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,830
You can still point at it.

120
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,830
OK.

121
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,950
Put it on.

122
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,830
Just break it and it'll be fine?

123
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,510
Hold it.

124
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,630
Keep your arms for balance.

125
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,160
Okay. Use your arms to find the balance.

126
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,870
Come on.

127
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,310
Turn your legs back.

128
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,430
Come to me.

129
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,270
Come on.

130
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,190
This way.

131
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:58,920
My goodness!

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,040
My legs seem better than before.

133
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,000
How is it, Dezhu?

134
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,560
You can tell your leg is healed

135
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,720
after you throw the stick.

136
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,240
I thank my brother

137
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,160
and my sister-in-law

138
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,720
for giving me a second life

139
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,600
It gives me the hope for tomorrow.

140
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,040
Don't thank your brother.

141
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,600
Just thank your sister-in-law.

142
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,600
Your sister-in-law's medical skill

143
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,560
that is a rebirth of Hua Tuo.

144
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,800
Rejuvenation through urine and hands.

145
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,950
Don't be ridiculous if you don't know how to speak.

146
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,240
What did I say wrong?

147
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,920
That's called magical skill.

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,040
You peed your finger.

149
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,510
I don't know what you did to her.

150
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,430
Stop talking.

151
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,870
Dezhu.

152
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,270
Actually your leg

153
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,630
was not cured by my sister-in-law.

154
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,510
It was Yulang

155
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,190
and beat it

156
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,160
the last bottle

157
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,270
white Jade Intermittent Cream.

158
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,070
It's yours.

159
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,720
The story is touching

160
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,920
senior Brother.

161
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,270
Who is it?

162
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,240
This is the man

163
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,310
the man who smashed your leg.

164
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,680
Second Brother.

165
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,190
He's already ill.

166
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:10,950
Forget about it.

167
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,040
For the sake of my younger brother,

168
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,390
and let you off too easily.

169
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,040
Senior.

170
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,680
Aren't you supposed to say something to me?

171
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,800
Did I not say anything?

172
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,360
No, I didn't.

173
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,070
Right.

174
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,670
Hey.

175
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,150
Thank you for saving my legs.

176
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,870
Let go of your hands.

177
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,510
Let go of me.

178
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Thank you, brother

179
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,150
for saving my legs.

180
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,270
That's another matter.

181
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,000
That's another matter.

182
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,200
I won't let you have Xiaorou easily.

183
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,200
Are all from the martial art circle.

184
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,270
Life is inevitable.

185
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,030
I hope one day

186
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,120
there will also be the day when your leg breaks.

187
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,240
I will save you too.

188
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,240
Brother.

189
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,750
This is my fault.

190
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,550
I didn't know

191
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,840
that you're interested in Senior Sister Xiaorou.

192
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,550
In fact, I came here

193
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,720
just to learn martial arts.

194
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,030
They never thought about

195
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,030
love affair at all.

196
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,750
You have to believe me on this.

197
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,000
That's right.

198
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,120
As a real man,

199
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,240
he should aim far.

200
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,910
That's why he's a scholar.

201
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,030
That's well said.

202
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,510
To talk more.

203
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,440
I'm willing to listen.

204
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,600
Really?

205
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,200
I love to hear it.

206
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,960
Brother.

207
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,750
Then I'll say something more.

208
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,320
Alright.

209
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,750
Actually,

210
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,120
the first time I saw you,

211
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,630
I thought we can really hit it off.

212
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,360
I think

213
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,840
we must unite

214
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,480
we must unite

215
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,480
to fight against the enemy.

216
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,080
To make Que Sword Sect

217
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,270
and make it big

218
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,720
and become stronger.

219
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,080
This is what we should do.

220
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,960
Brother.

221
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,910
From now on,

222
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,080
brother.

223
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,270
Come on.

224
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:33,720
Come on.

225
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,120
Kneel down.

226
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,600
Eunuch Cao,

227
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,510
these Japanese spies

228
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,750
are here for you.

229
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,910
Alright.

230
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,510
Go out and get your rewards.

231
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,440
Thank you, Eunuch Cao.

232
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,360
Withdraw!

233
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,750
Both of you,

234
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,630
a message for Ambassador Akitian.

235
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,440
For this part,

236
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,120
the underworld

237
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,630
In the underworld.

238
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,080
I'm new to Liaodong

239
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,750
you guys have to be careful

240
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,360
to do things carefully.

241
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,390
How did you know

242
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,030
we are with Ambassador Akita?

243
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,320
Your Excellency.

244
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,120
We have a spy in Liaodong.

245
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,270
His name is Nite Owl.

246
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Understood.

247
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,550
What are you having

248
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,630
In the middle of the day?

249
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,670
Come!

250
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

251
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,670
Send them back.

252
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,960
Come with me.

253
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,360
Brother.

254
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,320
Slow down. Don't choke on it.

255
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,480
Hey,

256
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,840
you haven't eaten for days.

257
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,440
Eat slowly.

258
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,390
It's not good for your stomach.

259
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,750
You are hungry?

260
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,840
Give me another bowl.

261
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,630
Thanks.

262
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,790
It's more than I can eat in three days.

263
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,600
Brother.

264
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,790
Who are you?

265
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,960
Where are you from?

266
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,480
Local.

267
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,000
Local?

268
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,480
Then what's your job?

269
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
You do farm work.

270
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,630
And farm.

271
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,360
How did you fall out of the tree?

272
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,750
I was picking herbs.

273
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,080
Your feet are empty.

274
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,360
He dropped it.

275
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,390
To collect herbs.

276
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,000
What kind of herbs?

277
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,840
Yunnan Baiyao

278
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,670
hey.

279
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,320
Aren't there Yunnan Baiyao?

280
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,200
Are there Yunnan Baiyao in Northeast China?

281
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,440
Where are we?

282
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,960
If my guess is right,

283
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,510
kid,

284
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,600
are you lost?

285
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,910
Right.

286
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,790
Get lost?

287
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,510
It was hard to cross the mountains every day.

288
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,200
To make a long story short

289
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,440
thank you all for saving my life.

290
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,910
Thank you for saving my life.

291
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,360
I need to

292
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,390
to repay my kindness.

293
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,600
I...

294
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,670
Please accept my worship.

295
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,790
Alright.

296
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,670
You threw it on me.

297
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,150
Why did you worship them?

298
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,550
Thank you, my savior.

299
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,120
Please accept my worship.

300
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,030
Come here.

301
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,480
Sit here.

302
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,320
Brother.

303
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,960
What's your plan?

304
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,600
You're the kind.

305
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,790
Thank you all for saving me

306
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,440
the way the farmer saves the snake.

307
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,270
I gave an analogy.

308
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,600
Hey.

309
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,750
Did Mr. Dongguo save the wolves?

310
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,440
Farmer,

311
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,840
what am I trying to say?

312
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,360
I don't know why.

313
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,910
What I mean is

314
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,550
I will return your kindness

315
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,240
you'll return your kindness with water.

316
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,120
Don't forget to dig when you drink the water

317
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,870
just have your meal first.

318
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,550
Just have your meal first.

319
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,080
I've decided to stay here from now on.

320
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,600
I can do all the hard work

321
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,360
to do.

322
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,870
I have to repay you.

323
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,790
That's unkind.

324
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,910
Wash the socks that I saved up.

325
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,910
Alright.

326
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,080
I'm on it.

327
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,200
This...

328
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,000
You dare to take any jobs.

329
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,510
Come on.

330
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,440
I know what to do.

331
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,600
Hang in there.

332
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,510
Just go.

333
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,750
You'll thank me for that.

334
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,630
Your Highness,

335
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,630
not to mention your carefulness,

336
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,030
you belong to

337
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,270
and you saved him,

338
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,630
that's close again.

339
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,360
A lone goose is flying south.

340
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,550
And burst of desolation and sadness.

341
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,390
And wild geese are flying north and south.

342
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,200
They know the cold and heat.

343
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,200
With Liu Zi gone,

344
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,120
forever

345
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,000
no!

346
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,270
Return.

347
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,600
Sixth Son,

348
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,510
master.

349
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,440
I'm sure Sixth Prince won't come back.

350
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,480
It's been seven days.

351
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,510
I'm sorry for your loss.

352
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,630
Brother-in-law!

353
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,550
Brother-in-law.

354
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,030
I'm hallucinating right now.

355
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,910
It seems that Sixth Son is calling Brother-in-law.

356
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,480
It's not an illusion.

357
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:47,960
Brother-in-law.

358
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,080
No, this is Sixth Brother.

359
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,550
He is really...

360
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,550
Sixth Prince?

361
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,670
Sixth Prince. Sixth son.

362
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,360
My sixth son.

363
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,440
It's me.

364
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,870
My sixth son.

365
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,630
Brother-in-law.

366
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,080
Brother-in-law!

367
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,080
My sixth son.

368
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,070
I almost lost you.

369
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,510
Come here.

370
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,640
Brother-in-law, take a look.

371
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,640
What about the telescope?

372
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,920
I threw it away.

373
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,440
Throw it away?

374
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,750
Look at Sixth Brother.

375
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,000
He must have been seriously injured.

376
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,480
The blood is still bleeding here.

377
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,270
Isn't this...

378
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,160
We're at the door!

379
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,590
I don't know where that stone came from.

380
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,000
Is it this big?

381
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,030
Right.

382
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,720
With a stone this big,

383
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,750
how can he hit you?

384
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,550
Then maybe some jerk

385
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,510
slingshot.

386
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,550
It doesn't matter.

387
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,640
That's not serious.

388
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,200
It's not a big deal, Brother-in-law.

389
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,160
I have come back to report something big to you.

390
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,550
This way.

391
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,240
I'll get Que Knife Sect to save them.

392
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,790
It's his enemy.

393
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,070
How can he save you?

394
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,640
It's a long story.

395
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,720
Stop it.

396
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,200
I've infiltrated their shop successfully.

397
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,790
They trust me so much.

398
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,960
I'm going to break them up from the inside

399
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,240
they just saved you.

400
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,640
Yet you want to disintegrate him?

401
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,350
That's a good idea.

402
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,550
I learn it from you.

403
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,640
Very well.

404
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,070
Bro

405
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,310
I need a fund

406
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,240
use it.

407
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,440
Come back for it when you're done with it?

408
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,440
It's spent.

409
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,480
I want every cent.

410
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,310
Mess them up.

411
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,160
Fighting among themselves

412
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,920
to bite each other

413
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,830
and gnawed on each other.

414
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:22,920
Are you listening?

415
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,000
I have to hurry back.

416
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,440
Or they'll suspect me.

417
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,070
I'm fine.

418
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,310
Look at the six

419
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,000
you can learn from him.

420
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll go back first.

421
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,070
Sixth Master, be careful.

422
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,790
Slow down, Sixth Lord.

423
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,880
Sixth Master, be careful.

424
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,400
Alright.

425
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,750
All washed.

426
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,440
What's the occasion?

427
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,400
What are we going to eat?

428
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,480
Honey,

429
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,110
days aren't numbered.

430
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,510
It's not me.

431
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,240
Who cooked it then?

432
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,400
Turn around slowly.

433
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,750
Here comes the fish.

434
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,200
You made these?

435
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,880
I didn't cook it.

436
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,270
You bought them outside?

437
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,200
I...

438
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,920
My goodness!

439
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,640
How much is that?

440
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,590
Most importantly, I don't want to repay you.

441
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,720
Don't care about that.

442
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,750
It's what I should do.

443
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,680
You can eat this

444
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,750
that's it for Tian Tian.

445
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,400
Sixth brother.

446
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,510
You're too generous with that.

447
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,440
Kola is greedy now.

448
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,110
Have a seat.

449
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,200
Just eat.

450
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,790
Wait a second.

451
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,550
That's not right.

452
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,160
I remember you told me

453
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,310
you're a farmer.

454
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,880
Where did you get all this money?

455
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,400
I...

456
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,350
I have a house

457
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,550
there is a house

458
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,310
moved.

459
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,590
The government has paid a lot of silver.

460
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,920
I'll repay you all.

461
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,920
All of them?

462
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,200
That's enough to feed us for some time.

463
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,830
Start eating.

464
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,480
Eat. Eat.

465
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,550
All you care about is eating.

466
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,750
Has your master eaten yet?

467
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,440
That's right.

468
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,720
I should send some to master.

469
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,590
Right.

470
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,750
Please send some food to my father later.

471
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,640
Ask the elderly to join us.

472
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,880
Where are you going to get that?

473
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,030
My master is in a mountain.

474
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,110
In a shack.

475
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,240
Then why let him live in a mountain?

476
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,000
That's...

477
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,110
Brother.

478
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,920
This is our internal decision.

479
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
No need to ask.

480
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,240
Let's eat.

481
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,070
That I shouldn't have said too much.

482
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,270
You're right.

483
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,350
The food is getting cold.

484
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,070
Hurry up.

485
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,440
Younger Brother.

486
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:16,880
Sit here.

487
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,550
OK, you'll sit there.

488
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:17,960
I'll sit here.

489
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
Liu, listen to me.

490
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,830
I'm on a diet now.

491
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,400
My plan has all been ruined.

492
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,640
Honey,

493
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,270
hold on.

494
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,030
Younger Brother,

495
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,680
Is this suitable for you?

496
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,030
Senior Sister.

497
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,200
Try to run to it.

498
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,070
Stop running away.

499
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
How come

500
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,510
that you know yourself well?

501
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,400
You

502
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,110
brother.

503
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,920
Not me.

504
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,030
It's me.

505
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,680
Little rascal!

506
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,480
You're really funny.

507
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,310
Now we can have it, right?

508
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,240
Just eat.

509
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,480
Honey,

510
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,310
you want a drumstick?

511
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,270
Eat it.

512
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,030
Good wife.

513
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,160
Come here.

514
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,830
Come here.

515
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,510
What are you doing?

516
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,000
And let my husband

517
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,720
give me a hug.

518
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,590
What are you doing?

519
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Come here.

520
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,920
In broad daylight,

521
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,070
what are you doing?

522
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,000
You're so anxious as your husband.

523
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,440
Untie me!

524
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,880
Hold on.

525
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,240
Good wife.

526
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,680
I have good news for you.

527
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,110
What good news?

528
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,720
Watch this.

529
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,070
What the hell is this?

530
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,640
A letter from a flying pigeon.

531
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,790
I sent my sixth son to penetrate the Que Dao Sect.

532
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,110
I found that they are not at ease.

533
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,550
And those livestock disciples.

534
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,440
Drove their master out to live in the mountain

535
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,550
In a shed. Look!

536
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,110
Why are you so competitive in everything?

537
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,510
Good wife.

538
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,640
Not that I'm competitive in everything.

539
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,240
I want to take this opportunity

540
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,720
to completely

541
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,590
once and for all.

542
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,510
What are you holding up to do it?

543
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,030
I'm good with that.

544
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,510
He was the one who scattered

545
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,510
my father and mother.

546
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,400
Good wife.

547
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,790
I'm a little worried.

548
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,510
Worried about what?

549
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,550
I'm worried that Sixth Son will get rid of us.

550
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,830
We can't.
