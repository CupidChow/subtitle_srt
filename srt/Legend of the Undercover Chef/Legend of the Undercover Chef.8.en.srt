1
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,799
Master Guan blessed me with good luck.

2
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,079
Eighth Aunty...

3
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:05,719
Eighth Aunt,

4
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,959
protect me.

5
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,920
Escort her!

6
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,759
Are you there?

7
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,719
He's not here.

8
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,120
What?

9
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,360
A secret book of martial arts?

10
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,960
I don't know

11
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't know that yet.

12
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,400
He is so lucky.

13
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,240
Senior, you can talk.

14
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,400
I'll go practice now.

15
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,280
Great!

16
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,520
Shaolin Tongjian Boxing.

17
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,439
I'm going to learn boxing.

18
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,879
But I'm crazy without waiting for practice.

19
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,599
Is that

20
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,680
does it work?

21
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,479
Another crazy one.

22
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,400
Come on.

23
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,360
Come on.

24
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,919
What?

25
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,960
Acupressure manual.

26
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,120
I haven't

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,599
let me have a look.

28
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,879
Why are you so annoying?

29
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,520
Can you read?

30
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
The first type.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,479
Squeeze it.

32
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,560
Clear.

33
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,879
That's the best part.

34
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,680
Press Jingming Point.

35
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,439
Type two.

36
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,000
Press your temples.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,400
Shave around the eyes.

38
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,080
What luck?

39
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,680
Just so so.

40
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,840
Mine is good.

41
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,759
We are really unlucky.

42
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,560
There's a man

43
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,080
a warrior Wang in Jinzhou

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,919
pick one person.

45
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,159
Six-pulse Divine Sword.

46
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,120
Envy?

47
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,319
You mean that Warrior Wang?

48
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,599
I've long heard about that.

49
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,759
You knew this?

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,639
After that,

51
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,840
I heard that

52
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,599
his six-pulse divine sword

53
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,680
to become very good at it.

54
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,560
To be one with your sword.

55
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,400
Yes

56
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,159
they could use their fingers as swords.

57
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,800
After that,

58
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,240
I'd be picking my ears.

59
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,120
Clean your ears!

60
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,039
Mother!

61
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,960
She was so stingy.

62
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,400
Am I awesome?

63
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,240
Then you are possessed.

64
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,439
Look at this.

65
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,000
What are you two doing here?

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,439
Hey.

67
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,439
This one.

68
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,840
This...

69
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,159
Shaolin Temple?

70
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
The Scriptures Library?

71
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,719
In order to renovate it,

72
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,960
to renovate it.

73
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,719
To launch this small box.

74
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,960
It's called a black box.

75
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,479
One qian each.

76
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,879
What is the box for?

77
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,879
Black box means

78
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,800
If you're lucky,

79
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,399
what's that?

80
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,680
You'll have that.

81
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,240
Are there comic books?

82
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,839
Yes, there are.

83
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,560
I'll have one, please.

84
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,600
Here, this is for you.

85
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,360
Give me another one.

86
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,120
I'll take it to my father.

87
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,519
Your father is old.

88
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,000
How can he play with it?

89
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,720
It

90
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,920
for kids.

91
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,480
Right.

92
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Is Mr. Ximen here?

93
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,600
Hero Ximen.

94
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,759
No one saw you when you came in, right?

95
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,920
I came in

96
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,879
I entered through the back door.

97
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,560
By the back door.

98
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,439
Only one carton?

99
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,480
Where's the trunk?

100
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,160
Hurry!

101
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,360
The black box

102
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,920
Is purely driven by the market.

103
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,839
One price per day.

104
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,959
Keep going up.

105
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:11,839
If you buy it next time,

106
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,160
you will not be at this price anymore.

107
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,480
Don't let anyone know when we leave.

108
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,720
Just go.

109
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,680
What do you mean?

110
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,680
Warrior Ximen.

111
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,040
It is a long journey.

112
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,519
How about some reward?

113
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,319
I'll ask for some money.

114
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,480
My goodness.

115
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
Hero award.

116
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,000
You're really generous.

117
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
Thank you, hero.

118
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,959
Come on.

119
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,399
Then I shouldn't go back by the back door.

120
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,399
Didn't you use the backdoor to get in?

121
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,600
Don't let anyone find us.

122
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,600
Don't make a sound.

123
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,439
What book?

124
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,680
There's no word.

125
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,680
The Heavenly Maiden.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,800
Your Ladyship.

127
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,360
Judging from his pulse condition,

128
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,680
the problem

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,360
Is not on you.

130
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,360
That's nonsense.

131
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,120
What are you doing?

132
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,560
I'm the famous Little Cyclone in Guandong.

133
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,920
I'm the one to blame.

134
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,600
Show me.

135
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,120
Master Gao,

136
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,759
from her pulse,

137
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,879
you're the problem.

138
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,560
See? I told you.

139
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,079
You weren't serious just now.

140
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,240
Come on.

141
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,040
For a new look.

142
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,839
A misdiagnosis?

143
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,399
Misdiagnosis?

144
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,120
Your Ladyship,

145
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,919
with all due respect,

146
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,919
If we have to

147
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,440
treating infertility

148
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,720
compare it to mountain climbing.

149
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,720
In terms of your illness,

150
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,639
It's just like

151
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,320
the Changbai Mountain alone

152
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,799
It's not that high.

153
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,759
I'm afraid of heights.

154
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,519
Please forgive my incompetence.

155
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,919
I'll leave now.

156
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,960
To figure it out.

157
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,639
Honey.

158
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,679
Good wife.

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,639
I'm incompetent.

160
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
You're not incompetent.

161
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,039
He is a quack.

162
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,759
You can't abandon me, right?

163
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,960
Why would I?

164
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,279
I didn't say I want to replace you.

165
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,600
I just want a child.

166
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,159
You can call me mother

167
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,679
darling, please find a way

168
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,480
master!

169
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,159
Master.

170
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,679
Come in.

171
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,519
Master,

172
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,120
I cooked for you.

173
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,279
Drink it while it's still warm.

174
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:01,960
Don't let it get cold.

175
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:02,840
Put it there.

176
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,440
Alright.

177
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,440
Close the door.

178
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,559
Alright, Master.

179
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,799
Why are you watching?

180
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,399
Let's go practice.

181
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,279
What are you, little girl?

182
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,519
What do you mean?

183
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,120
Am I not your master?

184
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,039
That's amazing.

185
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,399
It's very white.

186
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,440
Don't move.

187
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,000
Don't move.

188
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,159
What are you doing?

189
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,799
Show some respect.

190
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,559
Master.

191
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,559
I, I...

192
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,120
I'm looking at your legs.

193
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,039
Look at that!

194
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,960
My father is getting smaller.

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He really looks energetic.

196
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
Xiaorou,

197
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,519
father is getting smaller.

198
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,679
It's still the same.

199
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Make me a suitable suit as well.

200
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
Alright, Dad.

201
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,879
What on earth is happening?

202
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,919
The martial arts master has practiced

203
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,399
Is the wicked martial art of Basking Tianshan.

204
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,240
I've only practiced the first part of it now.

205
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,720
In order to recover,

206
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,919
you have to get the second half of the secret martial art book.

207
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,000
You must continue to smoke the black box.

208
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,519
Still smoking?

209
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,039
How much is it?

210
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,600
I don't think I can get any money

211
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,960
I guess it's impossible.

212
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,080
He'll surely strip our school.

213
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,559
That's what I should do.

214
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,000
I mean, how was my master

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,320
was well yesterday?

216
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,600
Today she's...

217
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,399
Young as you wish.

218
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,279
Stop crying.

219
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,480
You should give me some advice as your Eldest Brother.

220
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,000
How about this?

221
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,960
Go home!

222
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,360
Raise funds for me.

223
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,960
Keep smoking the black boxes.

224
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,720
Enough.

225
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,639
Could you listen to my opinion?

226
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,440
Do I want to turn back?

227
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,000
I think

228
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,159
I'm very well now.

229
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,679
My father is right.

230
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,759
Think about it.

231
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,639
Who's unhappy when they grow old?

232
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,039
Master.

233
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,679
Why can't you think for yourself?

234
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,279
Now other sects

235
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,240
If they know

236
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,200
you've become smaller,

237
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,679
will beat us in front of our door.

238
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
If not,

239
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,639
we can open a restaurant.

240
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,399
Master,

241
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,000
why do you always want to open a restaurant?

242
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
If you are to open a restaurant,

243
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,919
we'll both ruin your dinner.

244
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,720
Master, how about this?

245
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,559
Listen to me.

246
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,519
I...

247
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:45,080
This time the master of Que Dao Sect

248
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,919
what do you think?

249
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,679
Be so shameless?

250
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,000
Does my Xinque Blade Gate

251
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,960
on there?

252
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,639
It's ready-made.

253
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,799
I just have to come.

254
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,759
There's no use finishing it.

255
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,360
I am the Eldest Brother.

256
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,799
I haven't forgotten the Second Brother yet.

257
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,919
Second brother is not as big as Eldest Brother.

258
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,559
Which one is bigger than two?

259
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:02,799
Stop fighting.

260
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,519
You can be whoever you want.

261
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,559
I'm going out to play.

262
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:07,840
Master.

263
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,080
- Master! - Dad!

264
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,440
Master.

265
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,799
I invited her here.

266
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:19,919
Come in.

267
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,480
You're that infamous...

268
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,399
Look at my mouth.

269
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,120
The most famous

270
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,200
the Eastern mold, right?

271
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,799
Master Gao doesn't mean that.

272
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:37,600
Have a seat.

273
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,240
Have a seat.

274
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,120
Please have some tea.

275
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,919
I'll get to the point.

276
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,360
How much does it cost to adopt a child?

277
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:54,919
Master Gao,

278
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,279
we are one family.

279
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,720
With a flat price.

280
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,799
Five hundred taels of silver?

281
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,320
You're worse than my martial club.

282
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,080
What's the current market situation?

283
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,320
Just wipe it down.

284
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:07,559
Five tael of silver?

285
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Is this a joke?

286
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,399
Can you leave Tianchi Gang?

287
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,440
Do you know how deep the water is?

288
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,519
Can you swim?

289
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,440
Don't flood.

290
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,759
For the sake of your shamelessness,

291
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,200
I'll take it.

292
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,919
That's right.

293
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,559
Child, what do you want?

294
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,120
Half-blood noble.

295
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:37,879
Master Gao

296
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,360
Is a ruthless man.

297
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,240
Five tael of silver.

298
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,639
If I find a mixed-blood,

299
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,519
where can I find one?

300
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,440
This is it.

301
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,440
Hawthorn on sticks!

302
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,919
Hawthorn on sticks!

303
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,080
He looks like he's of mixed blood.

304
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,600
I'm sure his child can do it.

305
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,720
To save your master,

306
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,240
you can only turn to my master.

307
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,480
My master is an informed man.

308
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,879
He must have a way.

309
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,679
Brother.

310
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,039
Thank you

311
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,919
you go ahead

312
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,080
let go of her.

313
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,120
You haven't told me what you've written.

314
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,279
I wrote it.

315
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,320
Are you there

316
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,639
biao, come on.

317
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,159
Straight to the point.

318
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,440
And waste my first-class carrier pigeon.

319
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,320
The key is,

320
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,679
your master is the master of the Valley of Evil.

321
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,440
It's presumptuous of me to say it directly.

322
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,799
Let me be polite.

323
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,039
Rewrite it.

324
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,000
Play another one.

325
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,200
I can write it down.

326
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,279
There are no pigeons left.

327
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,279
I have several carrier pigeons.

328
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,440
You have five special carrier pigeons in total.

329
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,480
Three were eaten by my master,

330
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,879
one is on a mission.

331
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,320
I just released one.

332
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,600
How many are left?

333
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,799
You can't do anything.

334
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,399
I should go there myself.

335
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,720
I'm just being polite.

336
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,759
The wind is blowing.

337
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,679
The grass is green.

338
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,559
Leaves hang on the lattice.

339
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,840
Mother's baby.

340
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Whose baby?

341
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,399
Another song.

342
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,559
It's perfect.

343
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,919
You need another one.

344
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,039
This child...

345
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:43,679
Hey.

346
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,720
Master.

347
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
How about this?

348
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,120
March passed is also Li'er's day.

349
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,360
In March it is tomb-sweeping day.

350
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:00,879
Lady, in my room,

351
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,039
I had a lovesick dream.

352
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,440
I dreamed that my beloved man

353
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,960
In my house.

354
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,400
Eight carrying that sedan chair?

355
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,880
To marry my daughter, Yingying.

356
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,680
Forget about it. My God.

357
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,119
Deersai,

358
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,319
who are you, old girl?

359
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
How come you talk more experienced than me?

360
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,240
Hey.

361
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,640
What do you want?

362
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,599
Cut the crap.

363
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,319
You know what?

364
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,119
I'll take you to a place later.

365
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,960
Follow my orders.

366
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,640
Or

367
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,960
I'll kill you.

368
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,599
Old sister, you...

369
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,960
Who do you call old sister?

370
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,319
How old are you?

371
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,720
63?

372
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:34,680
He is the Tiger.

373
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,680
Full of nonsense!

374
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:57,920
Moral pillar!

375
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,920
Moral pillar!

376
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,079
Moral pillar!

377
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,960
Dezhu.

378
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,920
Where's Master?

379
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Where is Master?

380
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,000
He's right here.

381
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:08,519
It might be because

382
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,599
she went to the toilet.

383
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,440
I was just there.

384
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,039
Master!

385
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:17,880
Master!

386
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,359
Master.

387
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:20,839
Where is it?

388
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,200
Good appearance.

389
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:29,720
Appearance,

390
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,720
height,

391
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,119
and temperament.

392
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,599
As if I were alive and well.

393
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,680
That's right.

394
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,799
Her skin tone

395
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,799
the same as yours.

396
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,200
Is there anything wrong with your eyes?

397
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,200
No, I am not.

398
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,039
This color difference

399
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,319
and the same color.

400
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,480
You are making such a big fuss.

401
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:54,799
What's the rush?

402
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,519
The kid will recover after a few days of sun exposure.

403
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,240
She was cured

404
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,160
call me father!

405
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,799
Call for Dad.

406
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,319
Why doesn't he speak?

407
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:10,000
He was a little rebellious when he came here.

408
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,359
You gave me acupressure.

409
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:12,799
Untie it.

410
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,839
Untie them!

411
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,279
What if you escape?

412
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,440
Do this from now on.

413
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,519
Don't worry.

414
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,119
It will be enough.

415
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,200
And you have to be good to him.

416
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,559
Cultivate the feelings first.

417
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,480
If you cultivate them,

418
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,720
he won't leave even if you ask him to leave.

419
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
Understood.

420
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,400
The best way to cultivate a relationship

421
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,960
I will call him Dad for now.

422
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,440
Master Gao is so humorous.

423
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:36,839
Just kidding.

424
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,400
Thank you.

425
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,599
As long as you're satisfied.

426
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,960
I'll leave now.

427
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,519
OK.

428
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,559
If you have anything to do with me,

429
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:44,480
If you have something to say.

430
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,160
Thank you.

431
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,640
Father.

432
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:51,400
Father.

433
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,000
Father.

434
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:03,960
Father.

435
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:10,519
Junior Sister.

436
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,599
Second Brother.

437
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,079
Junior Brother!

438
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,640
Have you found my father?

439
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,960
He is not.

440
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,000
Youngest Sister,

441
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,279
I'm really sorry.

442
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
I have lost

443
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,720
my master.

444
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,480
Darn it.

445
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,640
It's over.

446
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,319
My father is gone.

447
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,160
I have no father left.

448
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,119
Alright.

449
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:31,519
Don't cry.

450
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,279
Don't, don't cry.

451
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,000
Yu Lang,

452
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,759
have you got any clues?

453
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,920
I have searched everywhere I can.

454
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,680
My master...

455
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:48,039
Why did you just throw him away?

456
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,039
Eldest Brother,

457
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,240
stop crying.

458
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,720
My master is missing.

459
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,839
Not exactly.

460
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,079
Let's keep searching.

461
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,759
We'll surely find it.

462
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,279
That's right.

463
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,160
Youngest Brother is right.

464
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:00,400
Eldest Brother,

465
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,640
you'll be the Acting Chief

466
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,400
you'll be the Acting Chief.

467
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,000
Who else can be the Acting Chief?

468
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:06,640
Right.

469
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,039
To unite as one,

470
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,559
brother Great.

471
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,000
You're the Sect Leader.

472
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:12,920
I...

473
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,680
The Second Sect Leader.

474
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,880
You are the Third Sect.

475
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:15,519
Junior Brother.

476
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:16,400
Your Fourth Master.

477
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,200
There are six of us.

478
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,720
We lost one.

479
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,119
The Four Chiefs.

480
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:22,960
My wife is not at home.

481
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,960
Who is our concern?

482
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,000
To get my sister-in-law back.

483
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:25,720
We will take care of her.

484
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,039
Why are you looking for her?

485
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,400
You should go to my father.

486
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,079
Right.

487
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,039
Find your master first.

488
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,359
Where is my father?

489
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:41,200
Look at how handsome

490
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,000
of handsome appearance.

491
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:44,599
White and tender.

492
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,359
If we have a child ourselves,

493
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,799
of course we'll have a monkey.

494
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,039
Don't be ridiculous.

495
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:51,079
There's no way to have such a child.

496
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,240
Right?

497
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,119
It's so cute.

498
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,200
Give it a kiss.

499
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,440
Come.

500
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,480
Give me a kiss.

501
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,200
Come on.

502
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,160
I'll have one, too.

503
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,119
That won't help.

504
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,440
The child has grown up.

505
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,640
He already knows.

506
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:07,039
Why don't you do this?

507
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,079
Today,

508
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,960
I will vacate my place.

509
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,319
Your mother used to cuddle me every night.

510
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,440
But this time,

511
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,480
I should cuddle you to sleep.

512
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,920
You two cultivate a good relationship.

513
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:18,880
Then

514
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,920
so that I can poke your acupoints.

515
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:21,799
Come on.

516
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,039
Eldest Son,

517
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,160
come to my arms.

518
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:24,960
Come here.

519
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:28,359
Lie down.

520
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,599
What a baby!

521
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,640
You're my little baby.

522
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,519
Honey,

523
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:43,559
you're back?

524
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,960
Have some water first.

525
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,240
What did your master say?

526
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,720
My Master said that

527
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,680
the Martial Art Manual

528
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,000
that your master has learned

529
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,720
Is a fake one.

530
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,519
It's fake.

531
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
It doesn't hurt much.

532
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,400
You just need to wait until the full moon night

533
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,000
when there is a full moon.

534
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:05,799
Great.

535
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:07,839
That's great.

536
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:44,480
Look at this kid.

537
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,680
This kid's sleeping?

538
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,160
Went up for a while,

539
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,920
my goodness.

540
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,599
This brat

541
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,880
he's so strong.

542
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,480
Your big feet are like

543
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
your feet are big.

544
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:22,759
And he snores.

545
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:24,720
The child might have been tossing all day.

546
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,920
Tired?

547
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,240
Show your precious here.

548
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,119
Isn't this Ximen Changhai?

549
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:41,039
Ximen Changhai.
