1
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,680
Few people ate today.

2
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,280
No one ate.

3
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,870
I'll eat.

4
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,400
You have no manners at all.

5
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,000
Master, is it on the table?

6
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,400
No rules.

7
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
No need to wait.

8
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,800
Master, I don't want to eat.

9
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,470
Xiaorou went down the mountain with Yulang.

10
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,310
I won't eat either.

11
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,030
I need to prepare some ointment

12
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,120
for wounds to his master.

13
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,800
What happened to his master?

14
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,190
Is injured.

15
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,280
Saying my butt hurts

16
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,680
because I'm lying on the kang.

17
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,910
My butt hurts.

18
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,150
And lying prone.

19
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,430
He's...

20
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,800
Lying prone like this.

21
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,960
Or...

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,520
Lying prone like this?

23
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,240
Dezhu, are you out of your mind?

24
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,190
Aren't you lying down?

25
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,680
This is lying down.

26
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,680
So here comes the question.

27
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,910
Why isn't Master sitting down?

28
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,630
Didn't I tell you just now?

29
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,520
My butt hurts.

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,310
Is it hurt?

31
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,280
I can't sit up.

32
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,030
What medicine should you prepare for Master?

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,470
Wound medicine?

34
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,840
What are those for?

35
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Your brain is shrinking as you live.

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,630
What is the sore wound medicine for?

37
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,800
Scratch.

38
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,360
And scald,

39
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,240
It's to stop the bleeding.

40
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,150
Nothing.

41
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,840
You two can eat.

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,030
My butt hurts.

43
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,750
Stop bleeding.

44
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,750
Eldest Brother,

45
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,470
the rapist

46
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,120
and got stabbed by me.

47
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,080
Master's buttocks ached today.

48
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,800
Is this something

49
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,360
something odd?

50
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,590
Could it be

51
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,430
rapist?

52
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,080
It's Master.

53
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,310
That's him.

54
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,910
Can you?

55
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,840
See that?

56
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,400
The strength of this stick skill

57
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,430
see that?

58
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,120
This is Mei Family Stickstick.

59
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,240
It turns out that I was teaching

60
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,960
Is the Gao family's method.

61
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,470
We're from the Tianchi Gang.

62
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,150
The method of palm?

63
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,430
Now she changes the stick method.

64
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,960
It

65
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,310
It's not aiming at attack

66
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,280
the main reason is

67
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,310
to channel the meridians.

68
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,680
And open seven apertures.

69
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,000
To improve your health.

70
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,030
At your age,

71
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,560
mother Pornpan,

72
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,870
It's good that you're here to practice.

73
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,590
Are you using the stick

74
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,560
or the stick?

75
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,080
You were behaving like a monkey.

76
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,750
How can you say that?

77
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,240
Can you show some respect?

78
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,360
This is Mei Fa Fight.

79
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,800
What do you mean by playing monkey?

80
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,840
What are you talking about?

81
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,360
Don't be so loud.

82
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's watch.

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,070
Then go home.

84
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,120
Mind your words.

85
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,120
The recruitment of students

86
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,390
any enrollment?

87
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,560
Anyone who's registered?

88
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,310
Don't be like him.

89
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,190
He is quite young.

90
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,750
Still young?

91
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,240
Because he is strict

92
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,630
of disciplining his disciples strictly.

93
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,950
That's the only way to be an excellent disciple.

94
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,270
You're really bold.

95
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,800
Recruit students?

96
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,870
Aren't you afraid the government will arrest you?

97
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,240
I'm not.

98
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,950
Because now she's

99
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,510
sect Leader Mei.

100
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,560
Nothing to do with Tian Chi Gang.

101
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,390
I've passed Heavenly Chi Gang to him.

102
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,800
The more reason we can't go.

103
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,120
Just go.

104
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,950
Get out of here.

105
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,160
Liar. Come on.

106
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,480
He's a liar!

107
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,270
Say something.

108
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,870
You are a liar!

109
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,070
Don't say those harsh words.

110
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,480
What you mean by liar

111
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:57,950
you, the liar!

112
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,510
Tell me you don't want to learn.

113
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
You really have a bad temper.

114
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,510
You really need to improve your temper.

115
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,720
What? My temper.

116
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,040
I told you it wouldn't work.

117
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,630
Now you are the dung beetle

118
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,750
notorious

119
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,750
we all know that Heavenly Lake is defeated,

120
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,000
we can't recruit any new students.

121
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,630
Another one.

122
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,720
What the hell did you introduce

123
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,950
we are not selling medicine.

124
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,750
You have a good command of all five senses.

125
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,480
How did I trick you

126
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,000
what can I tell you?

127
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,160
You won't be able to do this.

128
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,310
Stop thinking. Forget it.

129
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,480
Shame on you.

130
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,480
Embarrassing? What's the trick?

131
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,120
We should

132
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,310
this incident again.

133
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,800
What if it wasn't Master?

134
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,950
You can't judge a person's mind by his or her appearance.

135
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,160
Back then, Huashan Sect's leader Yue Buqun

136
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,070
In front of his disciples,

137
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,560
but I still have five men and six women.

138
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,510
Who would've thought

139
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,720
he hid himself that well.

140
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,630
Don't mention Yue Buqun.

141
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,160
Let's talk about Xi Men Qing.

142
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,070
On the surface,

143
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,240
a man of striking appearance

144
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,240
and secretly,

145
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,870
he's doing

146
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,560
theft and prostitution.

147
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,120
For causing Mr. Wu's death.

148
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,070
Our master

149
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,270
Is not as handsome

150
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,920
as Xi Qing,

151
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,360
he dare not go out in the daytime.

152
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,830
But at night

153
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,830
to hide his face

154
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,360
can't you see what he looks like?

155
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,190
Ximen Qing.

156
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,630
Ximen Changhai.

157
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,000
Could it be that the Ximen family

158
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,720
picked flowers as well?

159
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,950
This root

160
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,560
younger Sister,

161
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,390
what are you talking about?

162
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,560
Everything you said.

163
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,480
My father was so good to you all.

164
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,310
And you're even suspecting him behind his back.

165
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,950
Are you still human?

166
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,720
Xiaorou.

167
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,000
Lower your voice.

168
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,720
Listen to me.

169
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,560
When it comes to major issues of principle,

170
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,510
make your position clear.

171
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,950
That matter

172
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,000
almost done.

173
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,560
But please don't tell Master.

174
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,270
It'll alert the enemy.

175
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,000
We must

176
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,480
we're trying to

177
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,800
to turn Master

178
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,040
forsake heresy and return to the truth

179
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,160
rou.

180
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,120
Rou.

181
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,240
Rou.

182
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,390
Rou.

183
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,870
What to do?

184
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,120
You're listening to me?

185
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,000
I thought to myself,

186
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,000
to prevent more women from

187
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,270
be harmed,

188
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,800
we should uphold righteousness above family loyalty.

189
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,240
How do you want to kill them?

190
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,040
Just watch.

191
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Pervert!

192
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,600
She is resting there.

193
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Two Senior Brothers,

194
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,040
I thought it over.

195
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,720
We are convinced

196
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,430
master is the rapist?

197
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,190
That's too hasty.

198
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,070
After all, we don't have enough evidence.

199
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,630
I was afraid that we would frame Master.

200
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,510
Your Highness,

201
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,600
we didn't want that.

202
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,630
After all, we got involved.

203
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,070
Face it.

204
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,390
You know what?

205
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,870
Why does he always

206
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,070
In recent months?

207
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,240
If you can't find him, then...

208
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,680
Such an evil stratagem.

209
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,720
I have faith in you.

210
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,040
But I also believe in Master.

211
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,240
If the rapist wasn't Master,

212
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,800
I...

213
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,870
I'm your grandson!

214
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,800
Your Master is a rapist?

215
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,950
He's my grandson.

216
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,870
It's none of my business.

217
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,680
We're the grandchild.

218
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,190
What about

219
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,800
senior Brother.

220
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,830
If you two

221
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,430
Insist on thinking that I'm

222
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,360
who steals flowers.

223
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,600
I have my reservations.

224
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,670
I won't get involved.

225
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,750
This brat.

226
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,480
I'm going back to sleep.

227
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,600
That's crap.

228
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,360
Look at that dead man.

229
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,750
We should have a sense of justice.

230
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,390
Come on.

231
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,120
Master.

232
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,510
I call you Master.

233
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,910
Maybe he'll

234
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,600
to call you Master

235
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,630
I'm the last to call you Master.

236
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,360
Are you leaving?

237
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,480
It's not certain who will leave first.

238
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,870
What do you mean?

239
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,390
Although I, Zhao Dezhu,

240
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,390
although we were born in the wild,

241
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,120
they still have

242
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,080
a sense of righteousness.

243
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,270
Today,

244
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,960
on behalf of the

245
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,240
on behalf of those innocent people

246
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,630
and bring you to justice.

247
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,270
Get rid of an evil for the people

248
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,270
and give them justice.

249
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,080
Although I was a teacher for a day,

250
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,320
and always a father,

251
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,360
how about the last one?

252
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,120
But when it comes to major issues of principle,

253
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,910
I still can stand

254
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,240
and stand on your side.

255
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,550
This ill-advised plan

256
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,000
I have no choice.

257
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,670
Master,

258
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,200
I hope you can understand.

259
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,910
Grab a rope

260
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,630
for what?

261
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,840
Should we hang ourselves?

262
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,510
Don't argue, OK?

263
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,360
Goodness.

264
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,320
In front of both of us.

265
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,150
We will be gentle.

266
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,440
You have to explain to the government,

267
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,910
this will not be the same.

268
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
You two are talking nonsense.

269
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,000
Does it hurt?

270
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,150
Both of you.

271
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,240
Really something.

272
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,840
To become the Chief?

273
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,910
Do you want to strangle

274
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,320
to strangle him?

275
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,720
Rapist?

276
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,320
Just tell the truth.

277
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,750
Come on.

278
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,720
Pick what?

279
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,910
Rapist?

280
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,360
Who is it?

281
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,200
You

282
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,510
I've been in Que Sword Sect for so long

283
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,750
I don't have a wife

284
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,840
I'm waiting here.

285
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,150
But I don't need to pick flowers.

286
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,720
What do you mean?

287
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,480
Stop it.

288
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,360
What happened to your buttocks?

289
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,480
You don't know?

290
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,600
It's a witness.

291
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,240
Material evidence?

292
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,270
And your wound.

293
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,440
What wounds?

294
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,320
How did you get the wound on your buttocks?

295
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,120
Are you not talking nonsense?

296
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,840
My ass...

297
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,790
I was careless

298
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,910
when cooking the tea.

299
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
When the kettle is tilted,

300
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,910
I put it on.

301
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,720
It just burns!

302
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,840
What happened?

303
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,840
What a good excuse.

304
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,030
Looks like you're an old hand.

305
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,030
You two.

306
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,390
Show us your wound?

307
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,670
What do you mean?

308
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,840
You can cure him?

309
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,120
Look at this.

310
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,600
It's done.

311
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,480
It hurts.

312
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,670
It's stuck! Come on!

313
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,240
It's all glued on.

314
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,840
Dezhu.

315
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,080
Where did you go?

316
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,240
I stabbed

317
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,510
should be of two parts.

318
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,670
The horizontal opening,

319
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,790
vertical Mouth.

320
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,510
I don't have any mouth.

321
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,360
You're really cunning...

322
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,320
He is

323
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
got stabbed by a knife.

324
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,360
In order to

325
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,720
deceive

326
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,630
she scalded

327
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,440
on purpose.

328
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,720
What do you two want?

329
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,240
Are you trying to rebel?

330
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,000
Just tell me if you want to leave.

331
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,000
Alright?

332
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,030
What are you talking about?

333
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,390
Looks like you're stubborn.

334
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,510
I've taken them off.

335
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,390
Look at this wound.

336
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,750
How else can I be hurt?

337
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,080
Is your skin peeling off?

338
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Dezhu.

339
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,480
It's just a scalded blister.

340
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,630
There's no hole inside.

341
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,200
That's right.

342
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,750
Did you heal so fast, master?

343
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,320
What was the misunderstanding?

344
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,720
What are you talking about?

345
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,720
Are they scald or hemorrhoids?

346
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,270
Which are they?

347
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,750
They are scalds.

348
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,080
Whose hemorrhoids are external?

349
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,030
You two are studying my butts.

350
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,240
My ass?

351
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,870
Put it on!

352
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,910
Quickly come and help.

353
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,200
Xiaorou has been taken

354
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,080
captured by a butterfly.

355
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,030
Honey,

356
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,600
hurry up.

357
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,510
Come on, Mrs. Dezhu. Give me a hand.

358
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,000
Hurry up!

359
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,550
Honey, get up.

360
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,360
Honey,

361
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,390
what's going on?

362
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,630
My head hurts.

363
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,510
What's going on?

364
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,390
Hurry up.

365
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,320
Finished.

366
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,550
Xiaorou is caught

367
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,240
got caught by that butterfly.

368
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,320
It seems that the rapist

369
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,510
Is someone else.

370
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,270
What did I say?

371
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,270
Xiaorou,

372
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:01,910
honey,

373
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,550
lock the doors and windows.

374
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,550
I am going to save Xiaorou.

375
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,600
Where are you going?

376
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,390
What's up, sister-in-law?

377
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,000
Eldest Brother.

378
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,960
Mr. Jade.

379
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,320
Hurry and save Xiaorou.

380
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,790
Xiaorou was caught by the rapist

381
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,480
by the rapist.

382
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:11,960
Hurry up!

383
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,480
You've wronged me.

384
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,510
Why are you still blaming us

385
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,960
why are you still blaming us?

386
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,670
Also,

387
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,240
didn't Second Brother say that

388
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,440
the rapist was stabbed.

389
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,600
If he gets stabbed by the thief.

390
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,240
Can you stop acting like this?

391
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,550
Go and save them.

392
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,840
Alright.

393
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,510
Sister.

394
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,550
The others

395
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,630
and they even decided to

396
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,200
what do they want to do to my father?

397
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,630
They want to uphold justice at the expense of relatives.

398
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,720
Report to the authority.

399
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,600
Report to the authority?

400
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,960
That won't do.

401
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,600
What will my father do?

402
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,270
For light punishment, he'll be locked up for two years.

403
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,080
What about the heavier one?

404
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,080
Be executed by slicing them.

405
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,750
I can't.

406
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,870
My father can't die.

407
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,000
Xiaoqin.

408
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,150
My father was not that kind of person.

409
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,550
I also thought about it carefully.

410
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,390
Master,

411
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,840
to be that kind of person.

412
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,360
Right.

413
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,000
But they have the evidence.

414
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,120
Sister-in-law.

415
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,320
Don't believe them.

416
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,240
Please help my dad, okay?

417
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,840
I can't even

418
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,790
a weak woman?

419
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,360
Sister-in-law.

420
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,080
I have an idea.

421
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,840
Got it?

422
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,360
But if Master is really a butterfly,

423
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,600
that would be enough.

424
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,840
Sister-in-law.

425
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,720
How could my father be a butterfly?

426
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,150
My father is the chief of the martial art world.

427
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,440
Is he capable of that?

428
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,550
Alright.

429
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,360
I'll take a chance.

430
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,550
Master isn't that kind of person.

431
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,240
Thank you, sister-in-law.

432
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,480
I'm leaving then.

433
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,480
They're starting now?

434
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,440
Come and help.

435
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,120
The butterfly is captured by Xiaorou.

436
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,550
Hey.

437
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,630
Xiaorou has been taken away by a butterfly.

438
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,910
Quickly, come and help.

439
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,630
Xiaorou has been taken away by a butterfly.

440
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,360
Senior Sister.

441
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Senior sister.

442
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,480
Rou.

443
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
Rou.

444
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,120
Rou.

445
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,840
Senior Sister.

446
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,910
Rou.

447
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,910
Rou.

448
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,510
Rou.

449
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,840
Rou.

450
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,440
Have you found Senior Sister?

451
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,150
No, she is not.

452
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,550
See? I told you.

453
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,440
Master is not the rapist at all.

454
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:30,630
Enough.

455
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,840
I'm the grandson, okay?

456
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,510
Why are you still doing this?

457
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,360
What are you doing?

458
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,790
Come find Senior Sister.

459
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,150
Just go.

460
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,790
Grandson.

461
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,270
Senior Sister.

462
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,150
Miss, don't be nervous.

463
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,240
I am not the rapist.

464
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,510
I'm the rapist.

465
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,480
Why do you call me that?

466
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,720
I have rules to do things.

467
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,150
Listen carefully.

468
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:13,910
I will take off

469
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,720
when I remove the thing from your mouth,

470
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,550
then shout at the top of your voice.

471
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,720
Call for help.

472
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,440
The louder you shout,

473
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,080
the more successful I feel.

474
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,320
And then?

475
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,790
I'll do whatever I want.

476
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,150
I laughed like crazy

477
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,360
♫ I turned my back ♫

478
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,910
And here you're crying your eyes out...

479
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,440
Got it?

480
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,840
It starts.

481
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,670
Speak louder.

482
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Help

483
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,120
help

484
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,960
like this.

485
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,870
Help

486
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,480
help!

487
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,480
The procedure is enough.

488
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,270
Xiaorou.

489
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,720
Father.

490
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,640
Xiaorou. Xiaolou.

491
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,440
When will you come back to me?

492
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,400
Xiaorou.

493
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,920
Because I missed you so much.

494
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,590
You're heartbroken

495
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,480
hold it back,

496
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,550
don't cry.

497
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,350
That's bullshit!

498
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,640
She's not your wife now?

499
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,350
Stop it.

500
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,640
Dezhu, what do you mean?

501
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,350
You mean that

502
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,790
that I should get caught.

503
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,720
If you were caught by others,

504
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,790
you will be sent back instantly.

505
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,310
Besides that,

506
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,880
give us 400 kg of rice!

507
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,310
Zhao Dezhu,

508
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,270
did you go too far?

509
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,750
Shut up.

510
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,110
Xiaorou.

511
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,830
You're back.

512
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,680
Rou. Rou.

513
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,240
I'm back

514
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,680
hurry up!

515
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,240
Hurry up!

516
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,070
All right.

517
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,790
Stop crying.

518
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,920
What's going on?

519
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,270
Stand up.

520
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,880
Who sent it back?

521
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,310
Sister-in-law!

522
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,720
I was caught by the rapist.

523
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,160
Yes

524
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,440
your senior brothers all know about it.

525
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,270
Who saved you?

526
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,070
My father.

527
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,510
Who saved my father for me.

528
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,550
Xiaorou, are you muddled?

529
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,110
Master slept for several hours

530
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,240
for several hours.

531
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,110
That's right.

532
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,830
That's impossible.

533
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,400
Go and have a look.

534
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,440
It's my father who saved me.

535
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,030
Look at that.

536
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:32,830
Come on.

537
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,680
You frightened her.

538
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,790
Your father is sleeping.

539
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,400
Senior.

540
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:53,920
Hey!

541
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,590
Why are you here?

542
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,110
I'm here to see you.

543
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,240
Do you also think that I have a blurred vision?

544
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,590
Others think that.

545
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,070
I believe that you can

546
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,200
but I really saw my father.

547
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,640
My father really saved me.

548
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,310
But Master,

549
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,350
he's been sleeping in the room.

550
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,960
How do you explain this?

551
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,830
Are you sure that

552
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,400
after I was abducted by the flower-picking robbers,

553
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,750
my father never left home.

554
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,680
I am sure that

555
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,350
that's strange.

556
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,590
I checked his eyes.

557
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,550
Is indeed the triangular eyes

558
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,880
unique triangular eyes.

559
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,310
And we're from the same family.

560
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,200
I have that feeling.

561
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,920
We have deep enough feelings.

562
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,350
Between hearts

563
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,590
that's true.

564
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,310
Hey!

565
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,160
You're trying to get in the mood behind my back.

566
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,960
Right?

567
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,550
Second Brother.

568
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,510
Why are you here? Second Brother!

569
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,880
Can I watch you two if I don't come?

570
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,790
Today I will

571
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,790
I'll jump off the cliff.

572
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,830
To fulfill your wish.

573
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,200
Alright?

574
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,720
Second Brother.

575
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,750
Just hear me out.

576
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,270
Don't stop me.

577
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,510
Second Brother.

578
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,160
Second Brother!

579
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,000
Hold onto me.

580
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,110
Don't let go of it.

581
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,270
Don't loosen your hand.

582
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,440
You come up first.

583
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,310
You first.

584
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,550
What's going on with you two?

585
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,720
What do you mean?

586
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,790
It was about the father-daughter relationship.

587
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,000
How is that relevant to me?

588
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,440
Right.

589
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,750
Come up here!

590
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,880
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

591
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,030
Pull me up.

592
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,830
Second Brother,

593
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,030
why didn't you tell me earlier?

594
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,590
You didn't listen to me either.

595
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,880
It's my master who saved you,

596
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,310
then who's the one in your family?

597
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,640
Second Brother.

598
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,200
I wonder if you have heard of

599
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,680
there is a kind of occult in the world of martial arts

600
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,510
called disguise technique.

601
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,030
Disguise technique?

602
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,590
Did someone change

603
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,310
to disguise as Master?

604
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,510
No wonder Master was acting strangely

605
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,510
It was strange.

606
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,880
Mysterious.

607
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,960
I suspect that he is not possessed by the devil.

608
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,440
I have something to tell you.

609
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Then he'll disguise himself as my father

610
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,160
will my father be in danger?

611
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,070
Senior Sister,

612
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,350
don't worry.

613
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,160
This is just our speculation.

614
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,350
If this person

615
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,070
really use this disguise technique,

616
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,400
then his face

617
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,960
he'll surely have flaws

618
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,680
then how should we

619
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,960
make him expose himself?

620
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,350
I have to think about that.

621
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,440
No more pondering.

622
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,110
I won't believe it

623
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,350
I won't believe it.

624
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,400
They look so ugly.

625
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,510
I'm an old man.

626
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,270
What the heck is that?

627
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
This is even older.

628
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,680
What's this?

629
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,830
It's too shabby.

630
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,400
My goodness.

631
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,590
Your face is good.

632
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,720
That's good.

633
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,350
What are you doing?

634
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,000
Who are you?

635
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,160
That matchmaker

636
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,550
make this pair of mandarin ducks for me.

637
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,350
You mean that...

638
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,400
Is older than the other.

639
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,030
You know...

640
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,440
Let me ask you this.

641
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,310
Who exactly are you?

642
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,960
Who am I?

643
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,720
I am your master.

644
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,240
You are my Master.

645
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,160
You're not my master.

646
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,240
You're a fake one.

647
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,750
Didn't I tell you that?

648
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,350
Don't you

649
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,400
If you don't believe me?

650
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,510
If my guess is right,

651
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,880
Is this your disguise skill?

652
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,240
What skill?

653
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,720
The disguise technique.

654
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,030
You wore a disguise.

655
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,720
Who is behind your face?

656
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,160
No one is there.

657
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,750
You are good at pretending.

658
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,240
Your face is

659
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,480
It's a fake face.

660
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,880
Who is the man behind the fake face?

661
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Behind the fake face?

662
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,160
Are you looking for Erpifacial?

663
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,110
Instead of going to Que Sword Gate?

664
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,400
You want to turn against me?

665
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,720
Who sent you here?

666
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,070
What's your intention?

667
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,400
What is your intention?

668
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,790
I gave you face, right?

669
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,880
Take it off.

670
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,790
Let me see it.

671
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,510
Isn't this still you?

672
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,920
And playing with us?

673
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,960
Come on,

674
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,750
It's sick.

675
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,400
Can we pull them up without pulling on them?

676
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,160
Senior Sister.

677
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,640
Second Brother.

678
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,830
Is reckless,

679
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,920
and simple-minded.

680
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,070
Isn't it inappropriate

681
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,960
to entrust it to him?

682
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,720
Right.

683
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,200
She has been in for a long time.

684
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,110
What should we do?

685
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,720
How about

686
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,440
I'll call him out.

687
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,720
Let's stop checking.

688
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,070
Give me that.

689
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,200
What are you doing?
