1
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,400
This is...

2
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,760
It's Old Xie's.

3
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,070
Scratch that.

4
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,280
It's Lord Hong Qi's...

5
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,790
Earscoop.

6
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,000
This is what Ouyang Feng

7
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,630
of Da Hong Pao tea.

8
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,310
That's the hair

9
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,800
on Xie Xun's head.

10
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,960
I don't need any of those.

11
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,190
Is this a doggerel

12
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,470
or is it allegro?

13
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,630
Something fierce.

14
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,080
Look this way.

15
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,400
Uncle Chang.

16
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,560
This is it.

17
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,590
With long eyes.

18
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,470
Of Chang Bohu.

19
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,470
That's right.

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,240
Unfortunately,

21
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,030
there's only half left.

22
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,630
Where did you get this?

23
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,870
Some time ago,

24
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,750
the Que Blade Sect

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,470
when I first came here.

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,710
But now it's

27
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,030
screwed.

28
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,870
I'll renew it.

29
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,120
It's done.

30
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,240
It's rotten.

31
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,560
What's the use?

32
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,120
Have you watched Eunuch Cao?

33
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,800
The entire area

34
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,560
Is burned.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,240
I told you when the award ceremony was held.

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,560
I said Eunuch Cao, please stay.

37
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,280
He's not satisfied with the painting.

38
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,430
What's going on now?

39
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,960
He dared to burn the portrait of Eunuch Cao.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,750
He's so bold.

41
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,030
To one's eyes there is no other

42
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,430
eunuch Cao,

43
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,310
I feel that this Ximen Changhai

44
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,470
have an ulterior motive

45
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,560
look at him.

46
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,400
But why did he burn his lower body?

47
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,960
Are you laughing at Eunuch Qiu?

48
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,150
How bold of you!

49
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,310
What are you talking about?

50
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,280
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,080
Eunuch Cao!

52
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,310
Please calm your anger!

53
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,800
We are absolutely loyal to you.

54
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,310
I...

55
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,150
We'll never allow anyone

56
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,960
anyone to slander you.

57
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,800
Eunuch Qiu,

58
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,560
I suggest we arrest Que Dao Men

59
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,000
this Ximen Changhai

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Is the chief of the martial art world.

61
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,080
If we start without a reason,

62
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
he is

63
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,150
he may be suspected of abusing public power for personal revenge.

64
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,470
Eunuch!

65
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,910
I'm here to ask for permission.

66
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,750
Give me three days.

67
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,470
I will make that Ximen Changhai

68
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,270
and be disgraced.

69
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,160
Alright.

70
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,190
I'll give you three days.

71
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,270
Come, bring some more tea.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There are magpies chirping at the door.

73
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,000
Something good will come to us.

74
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,240
You seem to be in a good mood.

75
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,560
It's such a happy day.

76
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,270
Don't you know what to give me?

77
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,310
It depends on what you want as your wife.

78
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,920
What can I want?

79
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,750
I just want a child

80
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,120
our own child.

81
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,600
I thought we couldn't get a job.

82
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,600
She is in the process

83
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,190
of toning her body?

84
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,630
I found that Divine Doctor Fan

85
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,680
Is a quack!

86
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,870
And a liar!

87
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,600
Good wife.

88
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,630
Please forgive me.

89
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,270
Or you can't?

90
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,310
Replace him next time.

91
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,430
We can ask around in the underworld.

92
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,430
Master.

93
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,510
Master!

94
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,680
Master.

95
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,390
Look at this.

96
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,680
What's this?

97
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,600
Are you watching?

98
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,120
Here comes the good news.

99
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,120
Who sent these?

100
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,480
In the cellar.

101
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,360
They just dug them out.

102
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,000
That's right.

103
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,070
They dug the vegetable cellar.

104
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,680
Look here.

105
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,160
See this?

106
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,000
The steamed pulp

107
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,510
good wife.

108
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,560
Look at this.

109
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,160
We can open a window here.

110
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,190
We can see its quality.

111
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,040
Do a little cutting.

112
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,270
Give your lady master a bracelet.

113
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,190
It's not right.

114
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,750
Why does the bottom seem to be cracked?

115
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,510
Master.

116
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,310
What are you doing?

117
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,070
To him.

118
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,390
It's so unlucky.

119
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,310
Don't be afraid, a good wife.

120
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,160
I'm scared.

121
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,240
Who dug it?

122
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,510
He dug it?

123
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,120
Brother-in-law.

124
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,040
Brother-in-law.

125
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,000
That's unlucky.

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,720
Brother-in-law.

127
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,070
What's wrong?

128
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,600
Look at this.

129
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,120
What's this?

130
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,160
Don't be afraid, a good wife.

131
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,240
Isn't it boneless?

132
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,360
It's OK. Don't be afraid.

133
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,390
Where did they come from?

134
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,630
In the cellar.

135
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,950
What are you getting here?

136
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,600
Have you no brain?

137
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,560
Brother-in-law is so scary.

138
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,360
If the magistrate finds it out,

139
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,750
saying we must save lives.

140
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,000
Won't we be in court?

141
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,830
Bury him back.

142
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,680
Hurry up!

143
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,600
I didn't dig it.

144
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,070
Keep your distance.

145
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,040
Hold on.

146
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,560
Bro

147
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,870
why do you look at this thing?

148
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,270
It doesn't work.

149
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,270
Didn't we promise Eunuch Cao

150
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,000
that we would harm Changhai?

151
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,830
If the county magistrate found the skull

152
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,430
In the backyard of Ximen Changhai's home,

153
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,070
what will happen?

154
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,000
Even in his backyard.

155
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Don't we have them?

156
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,830
We dug this out, didn't we?

157
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,160
It's dead,

158
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,390
you are alive.

159
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,070
High.

160
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,270
Then Brother-in-law,

161
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,190
how could the government

162
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,190
poach his backyard?

163
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
Report it.

164
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,190
Do you need to be paid?

165
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,920
We need some.

166
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,040
No less.

167
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,360
Give it to me.

168
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,920
We can talk after it is done.

169
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,600
Hurry up.

170
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,870
About the money.

171
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,160
Hey.

172
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,560
You're here.

173
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,160
Hey.

174
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,800
That, you...

175
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,480
Come to my room tonight.

176
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,600
Sleep in my room.

177
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,120
I'm going to sleep in your room.

178
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,830
Right.

179
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,920
I'm afraid the smell of your feet.

180
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,750
Can't I sleep with my shoes on?

181
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,720
Come on.

182
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,310
What?

183
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:09,680
Senior Brother.

184
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,430
Why do you ask me to sleep in your room?

185
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,310
Why do I let you sleep in my room?

186
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,040
Just sleep in my room.

187
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,680
Cut the crap.

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,560
Tell me the truth, I won't go.

189
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,240
You know what?

190
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,920
I had a nightmare

191
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,630
a nightmare just now.

192
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,720
It woke me up.

193
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,070
I don't dare to sleep.

194
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,800
I woke up from a nightmare.

195
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,480
Second Brother.

196
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
I didn't see that

197
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,840
you're so timid!

198
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,510
How bold you are!

199
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,790
That's for sure.

200
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,670
I used to wander around.

201
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,120
Let me put it this way.

202
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
As long as it is a place to lie down,

203
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,750
I can fall asleep.

204
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,750
Let me take you somewhere.

205
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,790
To test me.

206
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,600
Do you dare to go there?

207
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,630
Come on.

208
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,390
Come on.

209
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,390
Come on.

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,270
Really? You dare to stay here?

211
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,240
You must bear hardships

212
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,510
to do better in life.

213
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,550
I confirm that

214
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,440
alright.

215
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,270
You can stay here.

216
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,870
Second Brother,

217
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,030
are you scared?

218
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,720
= Goodnight to me. =

219
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,240
Good Night.

220
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,240
Xiaorou.

221
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,320
Why are you going to the front yard this late?

222
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,000
My father's clothes were hanging in the front yard.

223
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,030
I'll go get them back.

224
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,600
Can you

225
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,080
and leave it there?

226
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,120
Xiaorou,

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,440
do you think it

228
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,960
boy or girl,

229
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,630
why are you holding this?

230
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,720
Lower your voice.

231
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,870
Master is sleeping.

232
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,080
Eldest Brother,

233
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,080
why is it

234
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
why does it exist?

235
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,670
Could it be Master practicing?

236
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,960
Nine Yin White Bone Claws?

237
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,550
Cut the crap!

238
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,550
Master, can a great Master

239
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,550
to practice wicked martial arts?

240
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,240
In the society,

241
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,150
he can't help himself.

242
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,240
Second Brother,

243
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,240
just throw it!

244
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,120
It's scary.

245
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,840
And throw it down the mountain.

246
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,510
Don't be frightened by the others.

247
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,120
Alright.

248
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,510
I've got a place

249
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,320
a home that suits it.

250
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,630
Brother-in-law!

251
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,840
Have a seat.

252
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,600
Mission completed.

253
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,550
How is it?

254
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,910
It's perfect.

255
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,480
We've already buried them.

256
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,000
Please don't be too deep.

257
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,790
It's very old.

258
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,200
I'm worried if it's not properly buried.

259
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,600
I even stepped on a few feet.

260
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,510
That's good.

261
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,000
Now you're smart.

262
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,000
No one saw you, right?

263
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,270
With my skills,

264
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,480
he can still see me.

265
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,320
And keep his secret.

266
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,030
Great.

267
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,360
After I report to Eunuch Wang,

268
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,550
let's wait and see the joke.

269
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,030
Right.

270
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,510
Come on.

271
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,320
Brother-in-law, get you a cup of wine.

272
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,030
Great!

273
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,840
What a wonderful day!

274
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,790
Come on.

275
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,440
Here's to you.

276
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't toast me.

277
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,120
I'm unable to drink.

278
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,550
Alright.

279
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,200
I'll give you five taels of silver later.

280
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,030
My husband.

281
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,600
My eyelids always flutter.

282
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Something is going to happen.

283
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,200
Nothing is going to happen.

284
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,670
It's a good thing if it happens.

285
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,750
Don't worry about it with your eyelids.

286
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,080
May all your wish come true

287
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,550
to think about something good.

288
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,080
You know what?

289
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,750
Destroy others' ancestral grave,

290
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,630
and killed others with their skulls.

291
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,910
Would his soul

292
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,120
not come to you?

293
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,550
Come on.

294
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,600
Someone in the heaven would come for me.

295
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,910
Stop his spirit searching for me.

296
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,510
Let him come with the skeleton.

297
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,510
He will be scared to death.

298
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,320
Go to bed.

299
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,000
Let's wait and see.

300
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,080
The joke about Ximen Changhai will be finished.

301
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,200
What's this?

302
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,600
He's really bold.

303
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,080
Who's that?

304
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,510
Are you sleeping at my grave?

305
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,960
And you're asking who I am.

306
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,200
Men and women shouldn't be improperly intimate.

307
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,200
Are you a human or a ghost?

308
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,200
I used to be a human.

309
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,960
But now,

310
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,360
I don't know what I am anymore.

311
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,910
So you mean that

312
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,080
you are a female ghost?

313
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,630
If I guess it correctly,

314
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,120
are you scared?

315
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,790
I was sleeping on your grave!

316
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,840
Why is your voice

317
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,120
so far away from me?

318
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,510
I...

319
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,510
Hey.

320
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,670
I'm visiting someone.

321
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,360
I'll be home right away.

322
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,270
Wait for me. Don't run.

323
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,910
Where is she?

324
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,670
Where were you?

325
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,440
I'm back

326
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,600
I will let you...

327
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,030
I will...

328
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,720
Hey.

329
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,630
My...

330
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,440
Please.

331
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,070
Why are you your senior?

332
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,240
Me...

333
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,070
That I...

334
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,270
I'm afraid that you're scared.

335
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,590
I... I'm here to keep you company.

336
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,640
Brother.

337
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,240
Thank you for your concern.

338
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,110
Just stay here.

339
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,400
Got to go.

340
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,830
Brother.

341
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,960
Are you leaving?

342
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,480
Take care, Senior Brother.

343
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,110
Senior Brother.

344
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,590
Don't fool around.

345
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,000
It hurts people and ghosts.

346
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,550
Do you think

347
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,160
he's back?

348
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,750
He obviously buried it.

349
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,110
Go and bury him.

350
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,440
Bury him.

351
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,880
Bury them in the yard?

352
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,510
Don't bury them out of the yard.

353
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,590
Are creepy.

354
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,550
Bury yourself in the back hill.

355
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,030
There's a graveyard in the back hill.

356
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,270
With great feng shui.

357
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,590
You must bury it yourself.

358
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,400
Be more religious.

359
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,590
You are a master after all.

360
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't want to look down on you.

361
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,070
Honey.

362
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,400
The other day,

363
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,510
to Diancang Sect the other day?

364
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,070
The leader of the clan

365
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,880
and his wife couldn't have children.

366
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,200
After that,

367
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,750
sect Leader's wife

368
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,720
got Sect Leader a concubine.

369
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,510
Within six months,

370
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,590
within six months.

371
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,640
That kid

372
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,270
that would be exciting.

373
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,550
Before I left,

374
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,270
I even gave you five taels of silver.

375
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,240
Really?

376
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,030
Was born in six months.

377
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,030
That's right.

378
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,720
It's pretty good.

379
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,200
Hao Meng,

380
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,640
actually, we've been married for so many years.

381
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,590
I feel sorry for you.

382
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,590
I didn't have any children.

383
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,110
How about

384
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,790
I'll get you a concubine too.

385
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,200
Honey,

386
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,240
I didn't expect you to be so generous.

387
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,830
You might as well take in a concubine.

388
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,510
But I'm not

389
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm not the chief now.

390
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,790
Isn't it better

391
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,200
now that you're the Sect Leader, you want a concubine?

392
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,680
Right?

393
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,160
Not a wife?

394
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,590
Now that you're the Chief, you want a concubine?

395
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,550
Right, honey?

396
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,590
My goodness!

397
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,510
The hot eyes.

398
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,550
The two of us are doing this.

399
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,480
To pass it on.

400
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:29,920
Zhao Dezhu.

401
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,270
Why didn't you knock the door?

402
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,550
She didn't knock.

403
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,160
This is so exciting.

404
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,640
Stand up.

405
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,960
I'm falling.

406
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,510
What happened to your face?

407
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,000
Have you fallen into a cesspit?

408
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,920
Apply some medicine

409
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,720
to wipe the wound.

410
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:48,920
The wound?

411
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,240
It's just torn.

412
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,310
Go on.

413
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,510
Just wait.

414
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,830
Dezhu!

415
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,880
You saved my life.

416
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,960
My head is...

417
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,200
My head.

418
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,440
My goodness!

419
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,920
My master's cooking is good.

420
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,880
It's so good!

421
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,920
Second Brother!

422
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,920
Second Brother!

423
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,720
You really put in so much effort for me.

424
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
Tell me the truth.

425
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,160
You're not much in martial arts.

426
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,480
But you're quite good

427
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,440
handmade work.

428
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,680
He made it look like this.

429
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,440
To its origin owner

430
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,510
my husband, what's wrong?

431
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,350
Look how scared you are.

432
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,790
How could you be so screwed up?

433
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,270
That tall brat?

434
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,960
You should be scared.

435
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,070
Why are you back?

436
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,110
What happened?

437
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,510
Second Brother.

438
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,240
You're not lying.

439
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm not lying.

440
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,960
Aren't you going to hit me in the head

441
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,680
with this thing?

442
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,510
When did I hit you with this?

443
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,000
I only played a kid to scare you.

444
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,830
When did I hit you like that?

445
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,400
I'll put it

446
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,110
In the tall blanket.

447
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,000
I don't know what to do.

448
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,550
You come to my quilt again.

449
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,790
This is so weird.

450
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,400
This thing.

451
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,640
How can it find its own way back?

452
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,720
Why don't you listen to me?

453
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,510
I told you to throw it down the mountain.

454
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,160
That's not right.

455
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,030
I...

456
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,920
I was just trying to scare

457
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
to scare the tall guy?

458
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,550
Is this stuff meant to scare people?

459
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,110
Do you know its evil nature?

460
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,240
I remember now.

461
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,160
My master told me

462
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,510
when I was little in the Valley of Evil.

463
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,160
This is a rare medicine.

464
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,680
It can cure femoral head necrosis.

465
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,830
It is worth some silver.

466
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,550
Dezhu, you can go down and sell it tomorrow.

467
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,400
This thing...

468
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,270
This thing?

469
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,440
Didn't I bring home a precious thing?

470
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,240
You took it back?

471
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,000
Who hit my head?

472
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,590
You put it in my quilt.

473
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,510
Right.

474
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,510
Put it on my quilt.

475
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,350
What the hell are you doing?

476
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,720
I thought you fell out.

477
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,240
I want to return it to its owner.

478
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:56,880
To its origin owner

479
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,480
put it down! Stop it!

480
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,310
Let go on my quilt! What the hell are you doing?

481
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,960
Stop fighting.

482
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,720
Stop this nonsense.

483
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,030
Sell it tomorrow.
