1
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,070
But after going down the mountain,

2
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,230
after the trip down the mountain?

3
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,470
That I came back

4
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,360
I met a storyteller.

5
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,310
I was so annoyed.

6
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,680
That fellow made fun of Tian Chi Gang.

7
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,840
The No.1 swordsman from Guandong.

8
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,470
The best master in Changbai Mountain.

9
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,590
This guy has bragged

10
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,910
he's all high.

11
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,240
He's not a martial arts master.

12
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
He's a martial arts master.

13
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,960
He's also an expert among liars.

14
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,360
Everyone said yes.

15
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,800
Then I found out that

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,360
that he bought

17
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,030
was bought off by him.

18
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,280
Accepted his money?

19
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,680
Exaggeration

20
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,840
and false propaganda.

21
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,030
Just to take a disciple?

22
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,910
By accepting his disciple.

23
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,470
He's such a loser.

24
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,750
He exaggerates the things

25
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,360
we can exaggerate things too.

26
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,190
This kind of shameful thing

27
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,240
what can we do?

28
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:54,870
Don't worry.

29
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,750
Listen to me.

30
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,680
What's the name of the storyteller?

31
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,190
His surname is Hou.

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,680
His name is the big-mouth monkey.

33
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,150
With the big mouth?

34
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,280
It's here.

35
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,750
Master, please have a seat.

36
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,870
Fengshui here

37
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,400
good feng shui.

38
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,750
Shall I tell your fortune?

39
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,800
It's...

40
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,150
No need to see it now.

41
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,630
I invite you here

42
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,960
to help my master

43
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,680
to make up stories for my master.

44
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,240
That will give him

45
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,680
to gain more popularity.

46
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,240
You got the right person.

47
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,710
I'm a professional.

48
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,080
Hold on.

49
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,910
Here you go.

50
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
This is

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,360
make up a part of it?

52
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,710
You only need one paragraph.

53
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,120
I can make up stories like this for you.

54
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,590
Alright.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,800
Ximen Changhai.

56
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,720
He has learned martial arts since childhood.

57
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,870
Three years old.

58
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,000
Kick the cow to death.

59
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,560
Alright.

60
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,310
Five years old.

61
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,390
Kick the tiger to death

62
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,360
and turn five thousand somersaults.

63
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,630
Go up a little higher

64
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,120
85 meters high.

65
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,190
And stomp on the street.

66
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,120
All eaves in the city lose soil.

67
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,430
What are you doing?

68
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,120
Your story is beyond the ordinary.

69
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,920
Who would believe it?

70
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,830
Aren't you joking?

71
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,720
Aren't you teasing me?

72
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't be ridiculous.

73
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,600
You

74
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,120
come on.

75
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,390
What you really love

76
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,560
to your master,

77
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,920
I need to be honest with you.

78
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,870
Do you know what common people

79
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,430
like to hear the most now?

80
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,040
The story.

81
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,680
You're wrong.

82
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,950
Gossip.

83
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,830
And now

84
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,950
these famous people in martial arts circle

85
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,310
rely on scandals.

86
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,630
Let me think.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,950
Whose fame is that?

88
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,270
The master of the Five Poisons Sect.

89
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,720
He's influential

90
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,190
In the martial world now.

91
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,750
Let's just touch him.

92
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,480
The clan leader of the Five Poisons Sect

93
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,560
will he be satisfied?

94
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,510
By then,

95
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,390
your master is needed

96
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,040
to clear this up,

97
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,000
to sue me

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and sue me.

99
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,950
I will come out to pay my respects to him.

100
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,000
Not only...

101
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,480
The misunderstanding is cleared.

102
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,000
This is the second

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,390
another hype!

104
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,310
This is called serial boxing.

105
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,430
Your master.

106
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,600
Specify the fire.

107
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,240
Pinch it.

108
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,040
Fight!

109
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,000
Fight!

110
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,390
Eunuch Qiu!

111
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,360
Are you messing with the cricket?

112
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,360
That's nice.

113
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,310
Recently,

114
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,600
what's so unusual

115
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,510
any abnormality?

116
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,390
To keep an eye on them.

117
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,070
Eunuch Qiu.

118
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,070
Just to report to you.

119
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,630
Qipanshan Sect and Shennong Gang

120
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,070
are quite close recently.

121
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,800
The Chief of Yellow Flower Club.

122
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,560
Recently,

123
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,480
went out a lot recently.

124
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
The Commander of Flying Blades Gang

125
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,920
was not with the clan for three days.

126
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,680
In addition,

127
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,240
the clan master of the Five Poisons Sect.

128
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,750
Master of Bai Long Sect

129
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,430
Is also very active.

130
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,190
None of these clans is easy to worry about.

131
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,310
There are.

132
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,360
The Sect Leader of Que Dao Sect

133
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,720
she cooks all the time.

134
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,160
The clan master of the Huilong Clan

135
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,720
he sleeps at home every day.

136
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,800
As long as these people in martial arts circles exist,

137
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,240
as long as they are alive.

138
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,600
Eunuch,

139
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,920
did you mean that

140
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,430
come here.

141
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,870
These two crickets

142
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,070
are aggressive in nature.

143
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,600
Once raised against them lightly,

144
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,510
they will fight to the death.

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,560
These people in the martial art circle.

146
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,950
Eunuch Qiu!

147
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,120
Understood.

148
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,070
You want me to incite them to fight.

149
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,000
Pinch me!

150
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,000
Pinch me!

151
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,630
I want you to listen up,

152
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,270
let me be clear to you.

153
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,430
Recently,

154
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,390
to stay out of trouble.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,040
After you've done that,

156
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,240
after you've done it

157
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,430
that I'm useless.

158
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,480
Recently,

159
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,070
I can't.

160
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
They've lost all their martial arts skills.

161
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,870
Look at yourself.

162
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,360
You used to tell me to be ordinary.

163
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,750
Now I can't.

164
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,000
Better make friends than make enemies

165
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,360
do you know

166
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,310
safety comes first.

167
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,360
You got into trouble.

168
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,120
You will...

169
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,830
For example that tall hairy guy.

170
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,040
Why do you feel sorry with him?

171
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,630
Let's do our own things.

172
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,030
It's like running a restaurant.

173
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,240
You won't get far

174
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,670
she's not far away from you.

175
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,150
We both earn money

176
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,750
with different profits

177
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,870
and sell their own goods.

178
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,790
Right?

179
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,320
Harmony brings wealth

180
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,960
remember this.

181
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,630
Father.

182
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,870
Father.

183
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,510
There are many things hanging up in front of our door.

184
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,510
It's scary.

185
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,910
Please go out and have a look.

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,960
Who hung this?

187
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,440
Hurry up and check the door.

188
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,550
What's going on?

189
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,720
It's scary.

190
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,600
Come on.

191
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,440
Don't be anxious.

192
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,240
Who's that?

193
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,510
Where is it?

194
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,270
Father! Master!

195
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,360
Behind you!

196
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,910
Master.

197
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,870
Father.

198
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,320
Who did this?

199
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,670
If I'm not wrong,

200
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,240
It should be

201
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,150
ye Siniang used to deal with this thing.

202
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,960
She'll hang up.

203
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Don't rely on your sister-in-law.

204
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,840
Siniang is picking herbs.

205
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,510
We don't have time to make light of it.

206
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,550
That's wrong.

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,200
The arrangement of the poisonous insects

208
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,360
Is very particular.

209
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,840
I heard from Granny Cauliflower

210
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,200
If I remember correctly,

211
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,030
they should be the Five Poisons Sect.

212
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,510
The Five Poisons Sect?

213
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,440
What the hell is this? What a mess.

214
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,870
The Five Poisons Sect

215
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,960
pays special attention to form

216
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,790
to find the key...

217
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,080
To nail poisonous insects

218
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,270
to their door.

219
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
The more poisonous insects we have,

220
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,750
the higher the level of

221
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,150
the higher the killer level to kill you,

222
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,790
a venomous worm

223
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,320
It's a junior killer.

224
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,750
The two poisonous insects

225
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,320
are ordinary killers.

226
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,360
Three.

227
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,270
It's the hall leader.

228
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,120
Four.

229
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,000
Yes. Elder.

230
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,870
Five of them.

231
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,750
Be totally addicted to the five vices (gluttony, drunkenness, lechery, gambling and drug abuse)

232
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,440
Clan Leader is out of the mountain.

233
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,360
Father.

234
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,440
We have no quarrel with the clan master.

235
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,960
Why would he kill us?

236
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,080
I don't know.

237
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,150
What's this?

238
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:10,840
Master.

239
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,270
I have a saying here.

240
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,480
I don't know if I should say it or not.

241
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,080
What do you want?

242
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,790
Rumors in the underworld

243
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,960
the master of the Five Poisons Sect

244
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,720
Is your love child.

245
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,720
Piss off!

246
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,670
Get lost

247
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,030
what the hell is this?

248
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,870
You even gave me a jerk.

249
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,200
I don't even have a wife now.

250
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,510
When can I come out?

251
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,440
It's said in the underworld.

252
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,120
Who?

253
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Who is it?

254
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,270
What?

255
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,840
What are you staring at?

256
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,120
Master.

257
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,840
I don't mean any harm.

258
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,120
What are you doing with them?

259
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,510
What are you doing?

260
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,600
I said I wanted to hype you.

261
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,440
And hype me?

262
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,840
I used to hype and cook.

263
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,630
The moment I left,

264
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,720
and you came here?

265
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,910
You become a hype!

266
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,030
Hey.

267
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,150
What's the background

268
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,390
of the Five Poisons Sect?

269
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,120
Why are you all afraid of him?

270
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,200
I know.

271
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,870
The clan master of the Five Poisons Sect

272
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,080
Is the most terrifying being

273
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,440
In the martial art circle.

274
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,910
His body

275
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,150
and gave off poisonous gas.

276
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,910
If he slapped you

277
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,600
we will die on the spot.

278
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,480
I heard that in the Sword Contest in Huashan,

279
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,000
there were five masters of the Five Mountains

280
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,120
he killed four of them.

281
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,870
And the other one has mental breakdown.

282
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,120
He hasn't recovered.

283
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,790
Don't be so nervous.

284
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,600
The storyteller has said,

285
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,030
when it comes to the critical moment,

286
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,670
If the clan leader of the Five Poisons Sect comes,

287
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,030
master, give him a gift.

288
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,670
Apologize to him.

289
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,440
Tell them it's a misunderstanding.

290
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,670
By that time, the more likely your reaction would be.

291
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,790
Everyone thought it was a joke and passed by.

292
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,750
Senior Brother.

293
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,030
Your words are wrong.

294
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,790
As far as I know,

295
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,960
the master of the Five Poisons Sect

296
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,630
Is a very narrow-minded person.

297
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,750
It's said that the master of Crocodile Gang

298
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,440
joked with him

299
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,910
saying his hair is kind of ugly.

300
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,790
After three days,

301
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,600
everyone in the gang

302
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,910
no one was left alive.

303
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,440
Even the earthworms in the yard

304
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,030
were dug up and split into two.

305
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,200
He's simply a devil!

306
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,550
Do you think Dezhu

307
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,720
he doesn't mess with anyone.

308
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,910
I must provoke the master of the Five Poisons Sect.

309
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,750
There are rumors in the martial art circle.

310
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,200
I'd rather fight with the God of Death

311
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,910
than the Five Poison Sect.

312
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,360
Are you looking for trouble?

313
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,670
Do you think my master was caught in this trouble?

314
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,150
I'm the Eldest Brother.

315
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,550
I have to help.

316
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,000
What will you do?

317
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,750
Could you please use your head

318
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,080
to my wife,

319
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,750
I'll fight him with Iron Head Strike.

320
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,150
Your Iron Head Strike

321
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,030
with your iron head skill.

322
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,000
Where are you going?

323
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,080
I am talking about outsmart.

324
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,670
What's this, honey?

325
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,360
This is the top-secret poison

326
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,600
that I brought from the Valley of Evil.

327
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,000
Yu-xiang Soft Muscle Powder.

328
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,750
Once it gets on anyone's skin,

329
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,870
she'll lose her martial arts skill.

330
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
That's great!

331
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,480
Come on.

332
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,270
Let me apply some to you.

333
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,630
No, I won't.

334
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,600
Honey,

335
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:07,960
wipe it for me.

336
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,630
I'm ruined, honey.

337
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,000
Look how gutless you are.

338
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,200
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

339
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,630
Let me wipe your hands

340
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,240
and then the antidote.

341
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,440
Then you went down the mountain

342
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,870
to find the master of the Five Poisons Sect.

343
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,910
Pretending to negotiate peace with him on your master's behalf,

344
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,440
find a chance to shake hands with him.

345
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,120
He was poisoned

346
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,080
before I knew it.

347
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,630
It's a good idea.

348
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,510
But my master is

349
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,960
be perfectly open in all one's actions

350
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,390
of indomitable spirit

351
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,600
will never let me do that.

352
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,440
Apply more.

353
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,080
Thicken.

354
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,270
Apply it all.

355
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,150
Thickly.

356
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,200
Did you take the antidote?

357
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,790
Yes, I have.

358
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,080
- Pour it all. - Stop it.

359
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,030
Master.

360
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,000
You often say that people from the underworld

361
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,270
have morality in the underworld.

362
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,550
That's not good.

363
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,750
The priority is to save your life.

364
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,750
What's the morality?

365
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,600
Give him medicine when he gets there.

366
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,870
Are you sure about that?

367
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,000
Don't worry.

368
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,030
I went down the mountain to see the master of the Five Poison Sect.

369
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,960
I would shake his hand.

370
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,150
We must get him out of here.

371
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,910
You don't need to shake hands with me.

372
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,270
Who would shake hands with you?

373
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,840
Give him a high five.

374
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,630
High-five.

375
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,670
Let's celebrate.

376
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,510
Come on.

377
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,960
Master.

378
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,670
Sister-in-law.

379
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,080
Sister-in-law.

380
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,390
How is my father?

381
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,480
He just took the antidote.

382
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,240
She's fine.

383
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,550
I'm just a little weak.

384
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,550
The master of the Five Poisons Sect

385
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,270
hasn't come yet.

386
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,790
How was my father poisoned?

387
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,360
It's said that

388
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,630
the uniqueness of

389
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,000
It's that before they reach the stage,

390
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,320
the poison first

391
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,390
this is their uniqueness.

392
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,960
Eldest Brother,

393
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,390
what's your opinion?

394
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,030
To be honest,

395
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,270
stop guessing.

396
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,910
In fact, for this matter,

397
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,870
for the whole thing.

398
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,390
Why you?

399
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,960
It's Dezhu's fault.

400
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,030
What a bad idea.

401
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,790
This is good.

402
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,440
Will be destroyed soon.

403
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,960
Eldest Brother,

404
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,390
we're halfway there.

405
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,080
Go on.

406
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,910
Your sister-in-law is right.

407
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,150
It's your fault.

408
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,910
Then...

409
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,320
What should we do?

410
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
Let's think of something first.

411
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,200
To find a solution.

412
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,550
Honey,

413
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,480
we'd better be frank.

414
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,790
Or I really feel terrible about it.

415
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,480
What else can you do?

416
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,360
He wouldn't blame me either.

417
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,150
He was

418
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,960
rou,

419
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,150
how is your master?

420
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,480
He's still weak.

421
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,440
He's lying in the room.

422
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,270
You're still weak?

423
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,870
No. Please give Master some tonic.

424
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,320
Junior Brother.

425
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,320
Mr. Yu.

426
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,720
Where were you?

427
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,510
Since we can't defeat the Five Poison Sect,

428
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,840
we need to outsmart them.

429
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,960
Outsmart?

430
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,200
I can't.

431
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,080
When your sister-in-law said that she outsmart me,

432
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,960
I...

433
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,550
From the beginning to the end.

434
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,510
I think we should confront him head-on.

435
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,600
I don't believe my iron head skill.

436
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,480
I can't defeat him.

437
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,080
We can't fight hard.

438
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,750
I set a few traps

439
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,510
on their way to Que Knife Gate.

440
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,030
What's the use of making stuffing?

441
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,550
We'll return it after we finish it.

442
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,000
You will get more energy after eating.

443
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,960
It's a trap.

444
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,870
Large traps set up small traps.

445
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,480
Small holes for old holes.

446
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,670
There are water in it.

447
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,120
And nails in it.

448
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,200
It'll be quiet after you go down there.

449
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,960
It seems that

450
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,510
It seems that we need to rely on you.

451
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,080
How can we rely on him?

452
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,630
What about me?

453
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,670
I'm counting on you.

454
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,120
You only know to make trouble.

455
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,390
Junior Brother even helped you out?

456
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,240
How shameless you are!

457
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,200
If you're shameless,

458
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,960
I'll prove it to you today.

459
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,030
My strength

460
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,120
without waiting for the master of the Five Poisons Sect

461
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,640
without waiting for the leader of the Five Poisons Sect.

462
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,110
I'll take him down.

463
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:06,830
Shit!

464
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,030
Senior Brother.

465
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,160
You prick your feet.

466
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,790
Mom, your feet hurt.

467
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,240
Where are you?

468
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,480
I'm here.

469
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:30,880
Second Brother.

470
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,070
Pull me up!

471
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,680
It's so refreshing to come here now.

472
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,790
Why are you here to take a shower?

473
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,880
I'll take a shower.

474
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,640
I didn't know that jerk dug the hole.

475
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,830
I fell in the pit.

476
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,160
Second Brother, stop scolding.

477
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,070
I dug this hole!

478
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,310
What the hell are you doing?

479
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,680
It's against the master of the Five Poisons Sect.

480
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,790
You can dig there,

481
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,400
do you have to dig here?

482
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,000
It's such a nice pit, so you ruined it.

483
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,550
Pull me up.

484
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,070
Hurry up.

485
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,400
Hurry up!

486
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,640
Just follow the way down.

487
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,480
Hurry up.

488
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,920
Your feet hurt?

489
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,880
Let me pull you. Hurry up.

490
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,240
Second Brother.

491
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,960
Please forgive me.

492
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,070
How can I dig my hole for you?

493
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,920
You fell in by accident.

494
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,310
How can it not end?

495
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,400
In this life,

496
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,590
to forgive you.

497
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,960
Such good feet.

498
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,590
Tie me like this.

499
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,510
Cut the crap.

500
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,830
You don't need to forgive me.

501
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,000
You caused this

502
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,790
It's your fault.

503
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,640
You are the one to blame for this.

504
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,270
Why are you all blaming me?

505
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,310
Dezhu.

506
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,590
Master is not here, but I am here.

507
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,750
Cut the crap.

508
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,830
Since when?

509
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,590
After I die,

510
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,400
father.

511
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,920
I woke up. Please.

512
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,030
What's the noise?

513
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,830
Master, everyone is waiting for you to come out.

514
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,550
Is your usual ability?

515
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,880
You're confused now?

516
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,790
You got confused?

517
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,000
I told you that.

518
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,510
Don't cause trouble.

519
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,070
I can't fix it.

520
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,000
What are you

521
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,510
provoke the Five Poison Sect?

522
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,400
Say something.

523
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,030
Who is talking about me?

524
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,830
What happened?

525
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,720
Your Highness,

526
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,400
you caused a lot of troubles.

527
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
How come the Five Poisons Sect still comes?

528
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,030
The pit was for nothing.

529
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,960
Not for nothing.

530
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,440
Am I not trapped in the earth?

531
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,510
Second Brother,

532
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,680
can you stop it?

533
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,310
I told you you fell into the river yourself.

534
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,310
It's not my fault.

535
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,920
Such good feet.

536
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,030
Why not?

537
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,240
I have to check them carefully.

538
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,110
Before the enemy,

539
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,920
before the enemy.

540
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,110
Hurry up.

541
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,550
Are you finished?

542
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,270
Open the door.

543
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,070
Hurry up.

544
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,030
Open the door!

545
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,680
Come on.

546
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,750
Come on.

547
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,030
I...

548
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,240
Open the door.

549
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,270
Who are you looking for?

550
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,070
That...

551
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,640
Is Warrior Ximen here?

552
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,110
Who...

553
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,160
Who are you?

554
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,030
I'm the master of the Five Poisons Sect.

555
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,000
The five...

556
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,830
You're the master of the Five Poisons Sect?

557
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,160
That's me.

558
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,680
Now you can understand, right?

559
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,070
I didn't expect that

560
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,310
that your story is made up too?

561
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,070
In this age,

562
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,240
how many real heroes

563
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,510
real heroes?

564
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,440
It's all made up.

565
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,270
Then think

566
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,000
follow us?

567
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You are going to

568
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,200
I'm your illegitimate child.

569
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,350
The gossip

570
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,790
has become a hot topic

571
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,000
Is the hottest topic.

572
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,400
Therefore,

573
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,480
my team and I have studied it.

574
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,590
And I've decided to ask you two to

575
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,920
to create a publicity stunt.

576
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,790
Turn the popularity

577
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,790
to a higher level.

578
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,960
Great!

579
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,200
You will be more and more popular.

580
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,000
Great!

581
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,750
You know nothing.

582
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,350
Lower your voice.

583
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:57,880
Hey,

584
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,590
firing me isn't enough.

585
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,480
Where... where are you from?

586
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,310
Don't worry.

587
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,440
My mother

588
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,790
she's willing to cooperate with me

589
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,270
be willing to put on an act

590
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,000
and put on an act with you?

591
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,110
At that time, we will

592
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,200
a grand

593
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,790
blood shedding ceremony

594
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,790
we can sell the tickets at a high price

595
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,750
fame and wealth!

596
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,590
Aren't you afraid that

597
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,510
aren't you afraid to put on a fake show?

598
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,440
Don't worry.

599
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,960
What kind of image is your mother?

600
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,640
Look at me.

601
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,400
I look exactly

602
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,270
as like as two peas

603
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,790
that's it.

604
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,350
How do I see it then?

605
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,310
Go to

606
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,750
kick him out. Come on.

607
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,440
Leave the room.

608
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:40,920
Get out now.

609
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,960
Warrior Ximen. This is a great opportunity.

610
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,480
How about we negotiate a price?

611
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,200
Get out of here!

612
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,110
Get out of here!

613
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,070
Let's make an offer.

614
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,750
Give an offer,

615
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,640
scram!

616
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,400
Alright.

617
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,640
Wait here.

618
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,030
Scram!

619
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,720
Scram!

620
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,510
Scram!

621
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,240
Master.

622
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,680
Look what I have made for you.

623
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,070
What is this?

624
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,030
It's ginseng.

625
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,680
Matrimony vine.

626
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,350
It's a nourishing soup.

627
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,550
What can I do for it?

628
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,160
It's good for your health.

629
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,880
It's good for health.

630
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,960
Stop conditioning me.

631
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,720
Master.

632
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Oh, my mother.

633
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,270
What's wrong?

634
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,400
It's a great news.

635
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,270
Go on.

636
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,790
Your reputation in the martial art circle

637
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,000
very popular.

638
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,110
How?

639
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,110
The master of the Five Poisons Sect

640
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,110
the master of the Five Poisons Clan

641
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,750
she found many storytellers.

642
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,000
Started to hype.

643
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Saying you are his own son.

644
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,920
Your own son.

645
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
His own son.

646
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,680
Right.

647
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,750
I fry it again.

648
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,960
You fired it again?

649
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,440
This time,

650
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,200
you're his

651
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,070
a jerk?

652
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,680
My goodness!

653
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,480
That's good.

654
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,720
He said I was him.

655
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,680
Who would believe that?

656
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,830
Me?

657
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,640
I believe that.

658
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,640
Just get out of here.

659
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,030
Hey!
