1
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,000
Uncle.

2
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,120
Did the martial arts you taught me just now

3
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,159
did it work?

4
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,919
He was really angry,

5
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,759
he was going up.

6
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,840
Didn't your master teach you this?

7
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,280
My master hasn't taught me martial arts

8
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,960
since he came out of seclusion.

9
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,840
That's irresponsible.

10
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,840
How about this?

11
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,560
I'll teach you

12
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,400
the inner martial arts

13
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,000
of our sect.

14
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,240
Alright.

15
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,680
Put on your shoes first.

16
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,840
Alright.

17
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,000
The strength is good, wife.

18
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,879
Give it more strength.

19
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,039
As if you haven't eaten anything.

20
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,800
Why are you so resistant?

21
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,599
Honey,

22
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,080
do you think

23
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,199
I've planted a crop.

24
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,039
And the crop has been sown,

25
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,520
but no seedlings can grow.

26
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,039
You said that

27
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,199
the farming matter

28
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,319
or the land.

29
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,919
The land.

30
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,319
What?

31
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:02,919
I...

32
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,400
Let me tell you something, Hao Meng.

33
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,400
Don't think you can

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
you talk to me by insinuating something.

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,319
When you talk to me.

36
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,039
I have done nothing

37
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,120
I've done everything.

38
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,840
If you date other women

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,360
with another woman behind my back,

40
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,840
or I'll kill you.

41
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,240
Why are you so crooked?

42
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,159
I was just talking with you.

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,960
Press your foot.

44
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,599
Is the strength good?

45
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,879
It's a rat!

46
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,080
There's a rat!

47
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,560
There's a rat!

48
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,080
Eldest Brother.

49
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,960
Eldest Brother, open the door quickly.

50
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,560
Who is it?

51
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,120
Eldest Brother.

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,719
Go open the door.

53
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,520
Eldest Brother.

54
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,400
It seems to be Xiaorou.

55
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,120
Eldest Brother, open the door quickly.

56
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:52,919
Eldest Brother,

57
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,199
come on.

58
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,080
Why are you in such a hurry?

59
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,639
Eldest Brother,

60
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,840
I have a mouse in my room.

61
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,439
Go get the mouse for me.

62
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,120
You're not coming in the right time.

63
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,639
Your sister-in-law told me that

64
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,360
she wouldn't let me contact with other women.

65
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,800
You're such a Biao.

66
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,639
Xiaorou is another girl?

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,400
Go now.

68
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,960
I'll go and see you, wife.

69
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,240
Hurry up, Eldest Brother.

70
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,719
Hurry up.

71
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,040
Eldest Brother, hurry up.

72
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,600
Mouse is in the room.

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,360
I'm already here. What are you afraid of?

74
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,600
How old is she?

75
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,079
You're the boss now.

76
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,560
How many?

77
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,360
One?

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,399
How many?

79
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,000
Only one.

80
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,199
Just one. Why are you afraid of it?

81
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,800
It's right here, Eldest Brother.

82
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,759
This little thing.

83
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,399
The staff is bigger.

84
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,279
See? That's unnecessary.

85
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,360
Do the work, Eldest Brother.

86
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,000
I will step on it to death.

87
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,680
Stop!

88
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
There they are!

89
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,839
There they are!

90
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,399
They are running!

91
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,800
They went through here.

92
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,079
Such a big hole.

93
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,199
Eldest Brother.

94
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,360
How many rats can live

95
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,920
how many mice must live in it?

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,040
You need to figure out a way

97
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:58,720
cure them.

98
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,160
It's okay. Leave it to me.

99
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,240
Eldest Brother, don't go.

100
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,800
I will let you steal the cave

101
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,079
come on.

102
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,199
So much water,

103
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,959
cannot fill it.

104
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,279
This is not a small hole.

105
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,199
Eldest Brother,

106
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,240
stop it.

107
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,959
I've heard that

108
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,000
someone broke down their house

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,120
because of irrigation.

110
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,800
That's impossible.

111
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,319
Hao Meng,

112
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,560
the kang collapsed.

113
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,800
It's full of rats.

114
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,199
Come back and have a look!

115
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,639
Hurry up.

116
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,160
This...

117
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,000
Hurry.

118
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,160
This...

119
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,079
How is that possible?

120
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Recently,

121
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,399
there are many mice

122
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,680
In the room

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,680
what about you?

124
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,879
Try to find a way

125
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,560
to find a way

126
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,920
how to kill them?

127
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,720
Right.

128
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,000
Please figure something out.

129
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,279
I won't dare to sleep at night.

130
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,680
You look really troublesome.

131
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,680
I've asked Fourth Mother

132
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,519
to collect poison.

133
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,759
Let the mouse eat some poison

134
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,079
the poison will kill it.

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,519
This poison won't work at all.

136
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,720
The best way to deal with mice

137
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,600
Is to kill them.

138
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,959
You have so many rats.

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,639
Do your cats work?

140
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,560
I remember that

141
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,120
there is an old sun under the mountain.

142
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,519
He's very kind.

143
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,240
He has adopted

144
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,639
hundreds of stray cats over the years.

145
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,959
You can borrow them to him.

146
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,040
We can do that without delay.

147
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:51,680
Dezhu.

148
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,399
I'll leave the matter to you.

149
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,959
Alright.

150
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:54,879
Second Brother.

151
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,879
I'll come with you.

152
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,319
Alright.

153
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,000
Second Brother.

154
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:57,759
I'll go with you.

155
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,759
I can have a walk down the mountain.

156
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,240
Alright.

157
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,399
Don't go.

158
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,439
Come on.

159
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,079
Come on, Uncle.

160
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,319
Be back soon.

161
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
There are hundreds of cats.

162
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,519
Can you return it if you go there?

163
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,480
Sorry

164
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,199
I'm really sorry.

165
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,920
That my children

166
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,959
have encountered misfortune.

167
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,879
What the hell is going on?

168
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,759
It's spring now.

169
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,800
Even cats have a season to rut.

170
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,519
When the night comes,

171
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,639
It's a bit noisy.

172
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,600
And we're close to the Heavenly Pond Gang.

173
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,399
This tall hairy guy

174
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,759
he thought our cat

175
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,040
and disturbed his sleep.

176
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,439
He sent people to poison him

177
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,279
luckily, I found it out in time,

178
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,120
In time.

179
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,759
Look at these.

180
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,040
Resting in his den.

181
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,879
He even threatened me

182
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,000
not to have any more cats

183
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,480
and asked me to move out.

184
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,399
What can I do?

185
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,639
How absurd

186
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,519
this tall hairy guy

187
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
he's so mean.

188
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,759
He wouldn't even

189
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,839
the cat.

190
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,240
How can he kill them?

191
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,399
Second Brother.

192
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,279
Sun.

193
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,680
Look how upset my Junior Sister is.

194
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,879
Don't worry.

195
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,439
I will find justice

196
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,399
and get the justice for you.

197
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,079
No wonder the tall fur

198
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,680
that they can kill cats.

199
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,839
Look at that tall hairy guy.

200
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,720
He doesn't look alike.

201
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,360
That black mouse is very smart.

202
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,039
Like

203
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,519
Is he also this way to others?

204
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,559
He's going too far on other people.

205
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,120
Uncle.

206
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,279
And we already

207
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,279
already became enemies.

208
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,559
To target us.

209
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,720
We have

210
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,679
our ability is limited

211
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,480
to deal with him,

212
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,639
to deal with him.

213
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,960
You can't spoil him.

214
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,480
To Uncle.

215
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,919
Please punish him properly this time.

216
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,519
Avenge Sun and the cat.

217
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,679
Alright.

218
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,159
Leave this to me.

219
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,519
Leave this to me.

220
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,919
When your sister and I have our own child,

221
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,440
take care of her when she has the child.

222
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,919
Mom, my uncle is my aunt.

223
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,600
That's...

224
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,399
Are you listening?

225
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,759
What's that?

226
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,399
Maybe I was wrong.

227
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,879
Why I asked you

228
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,320
to teach her?

229
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,440
I found that

230
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,000
you're obviously capable.

231
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,679
Have you seen something pass by?

232
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,039
No, I haven't.

233
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,399
Maybe I'm drunk.

234
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,639
Come on. Drink.

235
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,000
Some bats in the yard at night.

236
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Two hours has passed.

237
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,600
Why aren't you leaving?

238
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,039
Hello, Uncle.

239
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,559
Uncle.

240
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,039
Uncle.

241
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,960
Do we have any plan for today?

242
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,519
Take the day off.

243
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,759
I'll walk around.

244
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,039
What? Something happened to his family?

245
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,840
What happened?

246
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,919
The Tianchi Gang

247
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,360
there were a lot of mice last night.

248
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,200
On my ear.

249
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,559
Such a big chunk of meat

250
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,480
what's wrong?

251
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,720
A couple of days ago,

252
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,840
he even brought trouble to Sun's cat.

253
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,279
That's incredible.

254
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,360
Back then, I wanted to

255
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,679
to give that Mouse

256
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,799
who knew that mouse was more skilled?

257
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,799
Jump up and bite my ears.

258
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,639
Why are there so many of them?

259
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,080
It scared your sister back to her parents' house.

260
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,639
That's easy, Brother-in-law.

261
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,840
Give me the money.

262
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,200
I'm going to buy a house for you.

263
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,639
We'll move out.

264
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,039
As a leader,

265
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,799
Is scared to move.

266
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,879
How am I going to survive in the society?

267
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,559
What should I do then?

268
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,320
To get the cat

269
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,399
to catch mice.

270
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,279
There are hundreds of cats in Sun's place.

271
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
And you even drugged them?

272
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,159
Where are the rest?

273
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,360
Find it!

274
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,120
Find it!

275
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,080
Give me the money.

276
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,440
That cat with Lao Sun.

277
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,639
He wanted a penny from me,

278
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,480
he was scared to death.

279
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,480
He always mentioned money.

280
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,120
Old Sun.

281
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,480
Come here.

282
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,000
Come forward.

283
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,000
Master Gao,

284
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,600
you're welcome.

285
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,480
About the cats you died,

286
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,759
I feel sorry.

287
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,519
I was trying to

288
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,360
to help you feed it.

289
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,159
Maybe the food I've eaten

290
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,399
became spoiled

291
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,440
It's spoiled.

292
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,600
She fed your cat to death.

293
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,399
Can you be mad at me?

294
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,919
No, I won't.

295
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,000
How many are left?

296
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:26,919
It's gone.

297
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,639
Sold?

298
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,120
It must be very casual.

299
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,279
People who love cats

300
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,639
you can't just sell them.

301
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,720
For a high price.

302
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,360
Who did this?

303
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,720
I booked them.

304
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:42,960
How did you come in?

305
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,720
I came and went without a trace.

306
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,080
May I have your name?

307
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,240
I'm really

308
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,799
absolutely.

309
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,600
You can take away his cat.

310
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:55,360
Right.

311
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:57,960
I'll buy it.

312
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:58,799
I don't want to sell.

313
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,879
It seems you really don't know

314
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,720
the power of Heavenly Lake's Palm.

315
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,279
I'd like to have a try.

316
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,720
There is enough.

317
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,360
Alright.

318
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,840
You can eat more.

319
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,000
Come here.

320
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,639
Thirty taels of silver for one.

321
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,120
I'll take them all.

322
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,360
It's a rental,

323
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,639
not for you to rent.

324
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,600
I know.

325
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,080
It's cheap.

326
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,559
How cheap is it?

327
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,039
I was worried that you would lose money.

328
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,200
Uncle.

329
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,960
It fits you.

330
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,320
You didn't redeem the cat from Sun?

331
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,120
Right.

332
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
It's the Great Hero who asked me to say that.

333
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:10,960
This is

334
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,320
empty gloves, silver.

335
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,000
Uncle.

336
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,480
You're really something.

337
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,279
You can find the money

338
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,639
from Daomao?

339
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,159
That's awesome!

340
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,960
Hey,

341
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,360
remember that

342
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,399
she taught me

343
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,399
and return them to him.

344
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,639
That is the best response to them.

345
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,440
Good point!

346
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,039
That's well said.

347
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:29,759
Uncle.

348
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,240
I finally know today.

349
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,840
Why you call me Juejiezi?

350
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,639
That's amazing.

351
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,919
These are all tricks.

352
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,720
Sun,

353
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:41,879
you should take

354
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,759
all these pieces of silver.

355
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,320
This is so much money.

356
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,399
I can't take it.

357
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,440
Uncle.

358
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,159
Shouldn't we

359
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,559
some of the silver.

360
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,679
Still want to leave them?

361
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,480
Take it all.

362
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,960
Sun,

363
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,679
you should take all

364
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:26,919
all these.

365
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,039
Everything.

366
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:30,639
Right.

367
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,039
Take the money

368
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,399
you can help

369
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,200
and help

370
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,440
and stray animals.

371
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,039
Let me thank you

372
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,840
on behalf of those kids.

373
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,120
You're welcome.

374
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,200
We've finally cleaned up

375
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:53,639
cleaned up.

376
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,200
That's all?

377
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,039
That's all?

378
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,360
Every single one left.

379
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,120
It's so peaceful.

380
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,600
Honey.

381
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,360
Do you think

382
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,759
this is a natural disaster, right?

383
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:08,799
This is a man-made disaster.

384
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,360
Brother-in-law!

385
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:13,919
Brother-in-law.

386
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,200
How is it going to do the scouting?

387
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,559
Find out everything.

388
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,879
That Jueju Zi

389
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:21,320
Is the junior of Chang Hai, the west gate of Que Dao Sect.

390
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:28,720
Kametian Sang

391
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,320
the news of his defeat

392
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,360
has reached Japan.

393
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,600
We are right

394
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,039
the martial art circle

395
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,840
fear very much.

396
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,679
Eunuch Cao,

397
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,399
any plan

398
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,879
or a way to solve it?

399
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,159
Which can weaken it.

400
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:52,840
I've planned a poisonous plan.

401
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,039
Under your leadership, Que Blade Sect

402
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,880
has been getting better and better.

403
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,720
He never taught us martial arts

404
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,759
after his confinement?

405
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,519
I almost forgot that

406
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,880
I'm from the martial world.

407
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,880
I want to bring my wife

408
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,960
to farm.

409
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,240
As long as you follow your uncle's words,

410
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,119
I promise that

411
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,400
the Que Blade Sect

412
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,920
will be more brilliant.

413
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,920
How come you're back, honey?

414
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:28,799
Don't mention it.

415
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,119
The official road is closed.

416
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,000
Is closed?

417
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,119
That's too much.

418
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,640
Sister-in-law is ugly.

419
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,599
But she's not that ugly.

420
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,880
Zhao Dezhu, what are you talking about?

421
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,160
Honey, don't get mad with him.

422
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,839
Why are you so shy?

423
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,000
Is my wife beautiful?

424
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,960
It's none of your business.

425
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,880
I'll follow your words.

426
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,200
You also told me

427
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,960
you said my sister-in-law was ugly.

428
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,640
When did I say that?

429
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,359
Disgusting!

430
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,559
Enough!

431
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,519
Stop!

432
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,720
Stop.

433
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:52,039
Honey,

434
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:52,799
enough.

435
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,680
We are from the same sect.

436
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,559
Harmony matters the most.

437
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,000
Family harmony and good luck.

438
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,720
Got it?

439
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:01,640
Yes. Uncle.

440
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,440
What is the reason?

441
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,279
It is said that

442
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,559
I wonder who wrote

443
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,319
the secret of martial arts in Sunflower Book

444
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,640
to the wall.

445
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,839
Many people from the martial art circle

446
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,839
compete to enter the city

447
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
to practice this skill.

448
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,839
In order to maintain order,

449
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,079
In order to maintain order.

450
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,920
Such an evil martial art skill

451
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,480
can be attached to the city walls.

452
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,759
Now the city is in a mess.

453
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,240
The hemostatic powder is sold out!

454
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,319
What powder?

455
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,160
Hemostatic powder?

456
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,240
For hemostatic?

457
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,119
It seems that

458
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,160
In the martial arts circle.

459
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:37,519
Today,

460
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,599
I will teach you a trick.

461
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,279
Great!

462
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:40,880
It's called

463
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,359
It took me eighteen months to fall.

464
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,039
And 18% down.

465
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:45,880
Watch this.

466
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:54,880
Uncle.

467
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,640
What's up

468
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:56,480
uncle.

469
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,839
Uncle.

470
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,400
That's a trap!

471
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,000
Uncle. Hurry up.

472
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,920
Hurry and get up.

473
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,480
Master.

474
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,480
What is that?

475
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,079
He's just pretending.

476
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,519
Let me ask you this.

477
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,079
Do you think

478
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,559
I was defeated

479
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,559
by you.

480
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,279
That's for sure.

481
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,960
You let go of the bear.

482
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,799
So the enemy

483
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,240
he'll think the same of me.

484
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,240
At this time,

485
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,279
I can surprise you

486
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,640
and hit him back

487
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,200
and kill him.

488
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:23,839
Your Uncle

489
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,200
that's how he made

490
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,079
In the society for decades

491
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,079
In the underworld.

492
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,519
It's tricky.

493
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,160
What are you doing?

494
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,799
So you have learned it.

495
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,000
Uncle, you have great ability.

496
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,519
Uncle.

497
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,119
Brother.

498
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,160
Sit down.

499
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,039
You are back.

500
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,119
Why are you so happy?

501
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,279
Uncle, look at this.

502
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,880
The Sunflower Treasure Book.

503
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,400
Where did you get this?

504
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,119
It's sold everywhere.

505
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,240
Let me see.

506
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,880
Spread so fast?

507
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:54,799
That's impossible.

508
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:55,839
What are you doing?

509
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,839
I have to put it away.

510
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,000
I paid for it.

511
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,039
Why is that?

512
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Remember that

513
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,000
don't read

514
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,680
such wicked book.

515
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,200
After watching this,

516
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,240
after watching it.

517
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,200
And destroy your own bodies.

518
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,519
It would be like a drug.

519
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:13,960
You will never return

520
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,839
there's no turning back.

521
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,279
I just watched it.

522
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,200
Nothing.

523
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,799
What bird calls so unpleasant?

524
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,680
Is that the crane?

525
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,680
Over there!

526
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,160
Never give up.

527
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,680
How have you been?

528
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:38,880
Who's that?

529
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,039
With so much Yin energy,

530
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:44,960
who are you?

531
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:46,079
It's Xiaochun.

532
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,079
You still remember me?

533
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,160
Whose naughty kid is?

534
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,640
You trod on the house when you came down.

535
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,200
He's my disciple before.

536
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,240
I disabled his martial arts skill

537
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,039
I crippled him,

538
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,559
and expelled from the sect.

539
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
What kind of master?

540
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,440
What kind of disciples will you have?

541
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,480
Mind your words.

542
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:10,119
He is good at nature.

543
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,240
I thought

544
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,079
that my martial arts skill

545
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,799
I won't be able to seek revenge against you

546
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,559
take revenge on you in this life.

547
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,200
I didn't expect that

548
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,240
I got the Sunflower Book.

549
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
This time I'm here

550
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,640
to repay your kindness.

551
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,000
Uncle Master Uncle

552
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,480
so you used the Eighteen Strokes

553
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:34,400
uncle.

554
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,519
Why didn't you hit me?

555
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:40,640
What are you laughing at?

556
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,359
Cat catching mouse

557
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:44,960
won't be easily killed.

558
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,200
In the future,

559
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,920
I will come here

560
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:50,440
every three days.

561
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,160
Until

562
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,119
I will kill you!

563
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,839
Uncle.

564
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,119
Uncle.

565
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,519
I got hurt yesterday.

566
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,200
Why are you embarrassed?

567
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,599
I grabbed the quilt with my wife

568
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,119
to grab the quilt.

569
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,440
I didn't take her.

570
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,759
She fell?

571
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,599
Go back to your room and pack up.

572
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,160
We can leave and hide for a few days.

573
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,079
Or else Xiaochun

574
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,400
xiaochun will come again these days.

575
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,200
- Uncle! - Master!

576
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,720
It's bad! Something is wrong!

577
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:22,599
Follow me.

578
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,640
What is this thing?

579
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,480
Look at this.

580
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,559
= Ran = Those who leave the circle will be killed without amnesty.

581
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,920
Is it this circle?

582
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,240
What if I don't?

583
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,400
Hold on, Eldest Brother!

584
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,880
Who drew this?

585
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,759
Who?

586
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,720
Who did this?

587
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,359
Don't stand out from the circle.

588
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,160
Wait me back

589
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,480
he ran away.

590
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,880
Show your courage.

591
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,000
What about

592
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,599
I hope it's alright.

593
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,640
Thank you

594
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:16,200
for saving my life.

595
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,000
Don't thank me.

596
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,240
Thank roosters.

597
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,799
He's trying to kill us.

598
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,480
Uncle.

599
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,319
You've been wandering for two hours.

600
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,000
If you're not confused,

601
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,279
we're confused.

602
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,880
We'll hide in the pen every day.

603
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,559
Let's try our best.

604
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,160
Maybe I can.

605
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,279
What's the use of not fighting?

606
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,119
I thought about this

607
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,559
I thought about this all night.

608
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,599
I made a decision

609
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,960
that goes against our ancestors.

610
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,279
What decision?

611
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,279
Say something.

612
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,039
Xiaorou,

613
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,519
you are a girl.

614
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,440
It's not for you to hear it.

615
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:13,720
Please leave us.

616
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:16,799
I'll leave now, Uncle.

617
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,519
I have no choice

618
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:23,839
you have no choice.

619
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,920
I hope

620
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,599
please don't blame Uncle.

621
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,880
But we need to know what it is.

622
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,559
Come on.

623
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,240
Come on.

624
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,440
To what extent?

625
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:34,599
For the survival of Que Blade Sect,

626
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,720
I've decided to

627
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,279
to choose one

628
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,400
choose one.

629
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:43,359
This is the Sunflower Manual.

630
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,079
This...

631
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:47,880
This goes against...

632
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,000
A bit strongly.

633
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
That's not gonna kill me.

634
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,680
Isn't that right?

635
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,079
That's right.

636
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,599
We can't do it.

637
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,160
Look at the situation.

638
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,079
There's no such thing as you and me.

639
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:55,880
Now we're both the same

640
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,039
the same industry.

641
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:57,640
And also,

642
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,960
this is your disciple,

643
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,279
why have you made us suffer?

644
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,119
Uncle.

645
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,519
I think

646
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:06,000
I think it's inappropriate.

647
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,359
How is it improper?

648
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,119
Remember this.

649
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,480
If you want to stay alive,

650
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,559
come to my room tomorrow morning.

651
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:13,839
Let's draw lots.
