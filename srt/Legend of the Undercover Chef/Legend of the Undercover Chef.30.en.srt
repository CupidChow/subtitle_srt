1
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,310
Xiaorou.

2
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,800
How is your face now?

3
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,190
Second Brother,

4
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,190
you were so harsh.

5
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,590
The master

6
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,310
can't leave home

7
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,960
I'm afraid I won't go out.

8
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,630
Second Brother.

9
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,080
Do it harder.

10
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,910
How can I

11
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,120
are even by you.

12
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,360
I wanted to

13
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,400
to distinguish between the real and the fake?

14
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Not like the look on your master's face.

15
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,120
Are integrated.

16
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,360
Then we have misunderstood Master.

17
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,870
That's impossible.

18
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,590
My intuition is right.

19
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,520
If it's not the disguise technique,

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,470
someone who looks

21
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,630
who looks alike.

22
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,840
Pretending to be his master?

23
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,080
This person hid it too well.

24
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,750
What trick will you use?

25
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,710
How can we know if he's the real one?

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,560
Second Brother.

27
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,710
You've been with Master for so many years.

28
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,960
Haven't you noticed any

29
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,910
private features on him?

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,840
Characteristics?

31
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,000
You know what?

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,710
There is.

33
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,870
Master has an decayed tooth in his mouth.

34
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,630
I'll think about the specific tooth.

35
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,030
Senior.

36
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,840
Think about it.

37
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,750
Senior Sister.

38
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,240
Which one? Tell me.

39
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,000
What kind of feature is that?

40
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,680
My father has nothing but rotten teeth.

41
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,750
I remember he has a red birthmark

42
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,470
on my father's back.

43
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,120
Junior Brother.

44
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,310
Junior Sister.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,430
Please give me a chance

46
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,150
to redeem myself.

47
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,750
Second Brother.

48
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,150
Are you going to strip Master's clothes?

49
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,190
Are you stripping him of his clothes?

50
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,800
Right.

51
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,240
I'm taking off my clothes...

52
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,400
Isn't taking it off the board the same as doing it?

53
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,680
It's rude to take it off.

54
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,150
Take it off.

55
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,470
Very civilized.

56
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,430
He was...

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,590
I am different from you.

58
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,430
What the hell are you doing?

59
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,310
Master.

60
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,870
I...

61
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,800
My...

62
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,750
I sleepwalked.

63
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,800
What are you doing here?

64
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,270
You're sleepwalking.

65
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,070
Brother.

66
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,310
Come here.

67
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,240
I just looked at Master's back,

68
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,070
I don't know.

69
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,800
I was shocked when I saw it.

70
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,310
Your back.

71
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,720
It's all a note.

72
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,310
It's all to remember.

73
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,920
Yes

74
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,190
It's a whole.

75
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,510
It's a big

76
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,630
(Trying to solve the problem) that

77
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,750
one by one?

78
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,390
Is it round?

79
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,600
Slightly smaller than this.

80
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,950
Round. Round.

81
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
What color?

82
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,950
Purple.

83
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,600
Senior Brother.

84
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,950
Use your head.

85
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,270
The birthmark

86
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,720
could it be

87
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,870
It's cupping therapy.

88
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,720
Really?

89
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,800
Even if the cupping therapy is used,

90
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,390
why did he have to do it right now?

91
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,480
Why do I have to pull it out now?

92
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,360
Then it's hard to say.

93
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,390
Could it be...

94
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,190
Someone here

95
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,630
It's leaked.

96
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,950
Great minds think alike

97
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,160
he's a cover-up.

98
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,510
Who's that?

99
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,160
It can't be me.

100
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,830
It can't be Xiaorou.

101
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,560
Could it be...

102
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
That's not the case for you.

103
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,150
It must be someone else.

104
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,870
Who they are?

105
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,000
Brother.

106
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,080
Try to recall.

107
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,240
No one comes to Que Dao Sect?

108
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,870
Two days ago,

109
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,000
divine Doctor Fan was here.

110
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,200
It's him.

111
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,320
Right.

112
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,630
He did the cupping therapy for Master.

113
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,000
Divine Doctor Fan!

114
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,120
Divine Doctor Fan!

115
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,480
You two are working together?

116
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,080
Junior Brother,

117
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,910
nothing wrong with me.

118
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,630
Why do you ask Divine Doctor Fan

119
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,750
check me?

120
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,630
Recently,

121
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,200
the imperial court

122
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,150
and check out the plague.

123
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,270
Not only you have to check,

124
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,750
you need to check

125
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,790
I need to check it, too.

126
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,600
Divine Doctor Fan.

127
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,720
You're finally here.

128
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,390
Here she comes.

129
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,790
What about yesterday?

130
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,480
It's not the right analysis.

131
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,240
I suspect there is something wrong with her.

132
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,120
That's why

133
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,870
I'll ask Divine Doctor Fan

134
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,240
to come and check her.

135
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,000
Don't let Senior Sister know

136
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,480
you can't let Senior Sister know this.

137
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,840
Let me ask him then.

138
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,150
If he pulled the cupping therapy.

139
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,870
Hold on.

140
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,120
Brother.

141
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,630
If you are suspicious,

142
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,670
this is not

143
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,240
did you find anything?

144
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,550
I calculated it with my fingers

145
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,270
everything is normal.

146
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,480
Normal.

147
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,550
That's impossible.

148
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,750
What do you mean? Junior Brother.

149
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,600
Are you hoping there's something wrong with me?

150
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,080
What?

151
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,200
It's just

152
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,600
I'm afraid that there is something wrong with you.

153
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,320
Hey,

154
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,120
are you seeing a doctor?

155
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,360
Or tell your fortune?

156
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,790
How could you predict it?

157
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,870
It all depends on your mind.

158
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,750
It's a secret.

159
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,600
Enough.

160
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,240
Divine doctor!

161
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,840
How about this?

162
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,600
Come to my room

163
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,720
check it for me too?

164
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,240
Come on.

165
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,240
Get out of here.

166
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,790
Divine healer,

167
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,000
come to my room for a while.

168
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,480
Take this.

169
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,440
Alright.

170
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,910
Slowly.

171
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,510
All right.

172
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,550
Have a good rest, Senior Sister.

173
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,150
Here, Divine Doctor Fan.

174
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,630
Sit here.

175
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Divine Doctor Fan.

176
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,150
Let me ask you something.

177
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,510
The fire pot on my master

178
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,510
enough.

179
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,360
Don't ask about that.

180
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,480
Divine Doctor Fan.

181
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,200
What has happened

182
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,720
to my senior sister?

183
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,720
According to

184
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,510
from the pulse condition,

185
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,360
and his Qi and blood will stagnate.

186
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,120
The gods are disturbed.

187
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,270
What kind of sickness

188
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,480
what kind of sickness?

189
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
I suspect that

190
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,150
she has Soul-separation Sickness.

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,960
Soul separation?

192
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,790
My Junior Sister has always been good.

193
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,390
How can she get this disease?

194
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,080
This disease

195
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,630
Is usually caused by fright.

196
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,840
Scare?

197
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,600
Do you think Xiaorou has been

198
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,080
xiaorou lately?

199
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,240
Yes, she did.

200
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,120
She just thought that her father wasn't real.

201
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
That's right.

202
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,630
This is

203
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,360
since I was little,

204
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,750
without a father's love,

205
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,550
many heroes

206
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,320
have this problem.

207
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,390
For example,

208
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,870
young Hero Yang Guo.

209
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,910
He never had much love from his father.

210
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,600
Yang Guo.

211
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,120
He has no arm,

212
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,510
everything else is normal.

213
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,550
Do you think

214
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,150
that person who always hangs out with Eagle

215
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:21,870
Is that normal?

216
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,550
Then what medicine

217
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,960
for her illness?

218
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,510
The one who removes the bell must put it on.

219
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,080
Divine Doctor Fan!

220
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,150
Are you the one

221
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,360
my master's hot pot?

222
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,270
Take care.

223
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,120
Goodbye, Doctor.

224
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,360
Just admit that you plucked it.

225
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,750
Younger Brother.

226
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,150
I plan to talk to him

227
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,510
I plan to talk to him.

228
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,000
Senior Brother,

229
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,960
you tore Master's face apart.

230
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,720
How dare you talk to Master?

231
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
I'm afraid it's Master who has the nerve

232
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,870
I'm too ashamed to talk to you.

233
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,320
Father.

234
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,720
Try this dress on.

235
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,120
Alright.

236
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,390
It took me half a year to make this.

237
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,000
I made these Taoist robes

238
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,390
Is it nice?

239
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,510
It's nice.

240
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,960
It fits perfectly.

241
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,960
My daughter is very handy.

242
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,150
You made all of these?

243
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,750
I made all of them.

244
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,440
How can you make a Taoist robe for me?

245
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,840
To become a monk?

246
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,600
Father.

247
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,630
What are you talking about?

248
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,600
This Taoist robe

249
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,030
Is the name of this garment.

250
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,960
I made this for you

251
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,670
of fine cotton.

252
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,960
On the cuff, look.

253
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,150
I made a closure.

254
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,150
This way, when you travel from the underworld,

255
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,030
In this way.

256
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,270
It's convenient to wear it.

257
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,200
My daughter is

258
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,960
the top tailor in Liaodong.

259
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,480
Father.

260
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,150
You are so good at

261
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,480
have clever hands and good sense

262
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,840
father, you are so kind.

263
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,720
Xiaorou,

264
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,510
you should

265
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,030
you've got married.

266
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,440
Dad, what are you talking about?

267
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,080
If I don't marry him,

268
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,200
In the future.

269
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,320
Are you in love with Prince Yu?

270
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,240
Father.

271
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,630
He doesn't love me?

272
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,870
I have my father.

273
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,150
I can make the decision for you.

274
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,670
You can take a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink

275
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,790
that's fine with me.

276
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,510
You think in this way?

277
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,550
Dad is supportive.

278
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,600
Dezhu is a nice guy.

279
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,440
Right?

280
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,320
I don't like him.

281
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,840
Second Brother is so reckless.

282
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,910
Alright.

283
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,630
In the future,

284
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,120
you can decide my daughter's marriage on your own.

285
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,120
It's time for me to get married.

286
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,480
You can just tell me

287
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,750
just tell me about it.

288
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,200
I agree.

289
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,670
Father.

290
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,630
You are so kind.

291
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:58,840
Father.

292
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,030
I made you a new pair of shoes.

293
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,870
Using the most complicated Xing Yue Stitch.

294
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,670
Try it.

295
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,720
Put it here.

296
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,910
I need to leave for a while.

297
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,910
He acts like this every time.

298
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,600
Father.

299
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,750
You're such a good friend.

300
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:22,720
You will stay like this.

301
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,750
Stay the same.

302
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,720
My father in the past

303
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,670
was different from this father.

304
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,360
It's the same.

305
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,550
On the day I retire from the society,

306
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,670
every day.

307
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,030
I'm going back to my room then.

308
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,150
Father.

309
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,030
I'll visit my daughter when I'm free.

310
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,750
Alright.

311
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,270
Alright.

312
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,000
I can be two more dads for you.

313
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,750
Dad, you can't wear this, right?

314
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,270
You're awesome!

315
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,600
Who is it?

316
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,320
Mr. Jade.

317
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,790
Father.

318
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,720
Father.

319
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,670
Father.

320
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,000
Prince Yu!

321
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,870
Master.

322
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,200
I want to tell you something.

323
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,350
Go on.

324
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,590
Last night

325
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,070
I dreamed of my father.

326
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,830
I want to go back and see him.

327
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,110
My father's memorial day

328
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,350
Is my father's memorial day.

329
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,750
I want to visit my father's grave

330
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,070
and worship him.

331
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,680
There's such a coincidence?

332
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,590
What's up

333
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,440
I had a dream about my father, too.

334
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,720
They're definitely not the same person.

335
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,240
That's for sure.

336
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,070
Where is your father?

337
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,880
My father

338
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,510
was buried in a secluded place

339
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,960
In a secluded place.

340
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,400
You may not have heard of it,

341
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,110
It's called

342
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,960
the ridge of the ridge.

343
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,310
Sow furrow.

344
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,590
My father didn't bury that.

345
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,400
Go then.

346
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,270
I'm leaving, Master.

347
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,270
Dad, be careful on the way.

348
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,200
Don't worry.

349
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,310
Come home early

350
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,830
to your Master.

351
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,960
To the grave.

352
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,880
To burn some paper.

353
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,030
I'll go back to the shack tonight.

354
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,830
Are you

355
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,720
you are the Chief of Ximen, right?

356
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,510
I've long heard that Chief Xi Men

357
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,070
Is highly skilled in martial arts.

358
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,830
Is chivalrous and gentle.

359
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,510
Stop

360
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,590
fly over the walls

361
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,000
no one could stop him.

362
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,310
I heard the words.

363
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,350
Tell me about it.

364
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,030
Want a war or something?

365
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,350
Your Majesty.

366
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,110
Lin Meiming.

367
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,070
It fell from the sky?

368
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,790
Someone surnamed Jia?

369
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,000
The ghosts and monsters of the world.

370
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,400
He is

371
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,350
Is a hypnotist.

372
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,000
Hypnotic.

373
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,920
What is this?

374
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,270
Isn't it in the Middle East that can hypnotize you?

375
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,070
Why did you come to Liaodong?

376
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,550
At the fork road.

377
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,200
This is a misunderstanding.

378
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,350
I accepted

379
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,240
I received a major contract that involved several districts.

380
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,830
I passed by this place,

381
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,400
I'm not familiar with the place.

382
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,720
And wanted to spend the night.

383
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,070
Please come in.

384
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,000
Slow down.

385
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,960
Four more.

386
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,510
What are you talking about?

387
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,350
You can stay here for one night

388
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,000
we won't stay here anymore.

389
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,920
Warrior Ximen.

390
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,720
You don't know

391
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,720
I'm just helpless.

392
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,200
These four are all dying.

393
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,510
Were controlled by my hypnotism.

394
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,480
Please make an exception.

395
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,830
No, you can't.

396
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,110
You... You are really...

397
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,590
Aren't you cheating?

398
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,920
Chief Xi Men.

399
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,200
You don't know

400
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,750
these four brothers

401
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,200
are anti-Japanese fighters.

402
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,680
Their families

403
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,000
are looking forward to their return.

404
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,200
Could you please

405
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,350
please make an exception.

406
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,510
You're the only one living here.

407
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,510
We don't live here.

408
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,720
Where?

409
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,070
In that case,

410
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,030
leave one for each room.

411
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,510
What?

412
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,310
Master.

413
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,830
- My quota. - Here you go.

414
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,880
Give it to Dezhu.

415
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,030
I'm having a child with Siniang.

416
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,790
It won't take another whole night.

417
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,960
The key is this thing.

418
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,160
Two people in your room.

419
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,480
I want kids too.

420
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,160
Who are you having kids with?

421
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,110
Where are people from the underworld?

422
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,480
Where are they?

423
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,960
You've never been afraid of a dead person.

424
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,350
Why would you be?

425
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,270
He's such a

426
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,440
I can't beat him.

427
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,240
Stop it.

428
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,920
They are soldiers who fought against Japan.

429
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,680
You must stay here.

430
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,750
How about this?

431
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,790
I have to

432
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,640
I have to mourn for my father.

433
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,680
I can't accompany you.

434
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,750
Alright.

435
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,070
I'll burn some paper for him.

436
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,880
You and these four brothers

437
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,240
stay tonight.

438
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,350
Thank you, Chief.

439
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,270
Thank you.

440
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,000
Thank you.

441
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,960
Arrange it now.

442
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,590
Cook?

443
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,160
Master.

444
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,200
How to cook the food?

445
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,750
We don't know what he eats.

446
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,830
He... he knows.

447
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,240
Take care.

448
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,240
Master, where are you going?

449
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,000
Father.

450
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,720
You

451
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,720
father.

452
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,000
What is it?

453
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,720
You got scared away.

454
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,550
Who spilled water?

455
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,510
Doomed.

456
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,240
Is it scary to pee?

457
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,920
It was Master who peed?

458
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,200
Everyone,

459
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,960
you don't have to be embarrassed.

460
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,720
In the woodshed for the night.

461
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,400
Alright.

462
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,240
Don't.

463
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,510
Let's go inside first.

464
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,790
Don't be afraid.

465
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,590
Dezhu.

466
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,720
What are you doing?

467
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,790
What's there to see in that?

468
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
It's depressing.

469
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,310
Go back to your room and sleep.

470
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,240
Screwed!

471
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,550
Master too.

472
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Why do you keep it here?
