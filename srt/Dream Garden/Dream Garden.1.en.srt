<i>You are a partner at Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center, Lin Shen?</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

7
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,200
You understand the reason why you are here?

8
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,100
You've recently had a visitor named, Sun Dong? He suddenly disappeared. <br><i>(T/N: Visitor is a type of psychology client who often comes to therapy at another's request)</i>

9
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,600
<i>He left behind a diary and disappeared in a car with a license plate ending in 8503.</i>

10
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,400
<i> According to the diary, we discovered Sung Dong has recently been having an emotional breakdown. </i>

11
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,100
<i> And all this happened after he received psychological counseling at your center. </i>

12
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,700
<i>As a result of our investigation, we found that something happened to your mother at the nursing home.</i>

13
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,400
<i>Something was wrong with the ECG monitor being used.</i>

14
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,500
<i>It did not immediately send out a alert signal.</i>

15
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,200
<i>In Sun Dong's diary, he details that after he found out</i>

16
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,000
<i>your mother nearly had an accident from using the ECG monitor he sold,</i>

17
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
<i>his state of mind changed.</i>

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,400
<i>He said he committed an unforgivable mistake and is not worthy of forgiveness.</i>

19
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,600
<i>Sun Dong authorized you to record the entire psychological consultation session.</i>

20
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,400
<i>However, after Lejian's incident</i>

21
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,600
<i>you did not record Sun Dong during his hypnosis.</i>

22
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,200
<i>So we have every reason to suspect</i>

23
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,600
<i>that during the hypnosis, you purposefully cause Sun Dong</i>

24
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,800
<i>to have an emotional breakdown.</i>

25
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,600
<i>According to the information the family provided, there's another counselor, Xiao Xiao.</i>

26
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,800
<i>She also counseled Sun Dong during this time. <br> (Lin Shen)</i>

27
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
<i>You two cannot leave Luteng City for the time being.</i>

28
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,400
<i>At least, until Sun Dong appears.</i>

29
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,400
<i>Lin Shen and Xiao Xiao's location has been confirmed.</i>

30
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,500
<i>Proceed with the original plan.</i>

31
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,600
<i>I have a story, do you want to hear it?</i>

32
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,400
<i>There's a man who lost the person</i>

33
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,000
<i>most important to him in the world.</i>

34
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,700
<i>He found the culprit.</i>

35
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,200
<i>He vowed to have the person experience what losing someone is like.</i>

36
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,800
<i>He wants the person to have nothing left.</i>

37
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,600
<i>However, that is never enough.</i>

38
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,200
Don't move!

39
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,600
<i>What would you say real love is?</i>

40
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,100
<i>(Episode 1)</i>

41
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,300
<i>(A year and a half ago)</i>

42
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,000
<i>What is hypnosis?</i>

43
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,900
<i>Many people believe that hypnosis will cause people to lose consciousness.</i>

44
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,400
<i>This is actually a serious misunderstanding.</i>

45
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,200
In reality, not all hypnotic practices are categorized as clinical hypnosis.

46
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,000
The goal of clinical hypnosis is to apply hypnosis-related theories

47
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,600
and techniques in order to improve psychological and physical distress.

48
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,200
To better performances of individuals and groups,

49
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,500
are there any questions regarding this focus point?

50
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,000
<i>Viewers live on set and in front of the television,</i>

51
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,800
<i>hello and welcome to another episode of "The Heartbeat of Love".</i>

52
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,700
Our show is sponsored by Zhibai, a brand of self-care products.

53
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,200
<i>(Zhibai)</i>

54
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,400
For this episode, our guest is Xiao Beibei.

55
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,800
Let me make an introduction for everyone. Xiao Beibei's public account is very popular among young ladies.

56
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Especially young ladies with confusion toward romantic relationships.

57
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,000
They will go to her for love counseling.

58
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So then we will have Xiao Beibei answer

59
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
the questions from the last episode for everyone.

60
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,400
Hello, everyone. I'm Xiao Beibei.

61
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,300
I feel that this man will not choose his ideal type

62
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,200
and choose a girl who has a crush on him instead.

63
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,600
In the video, the girl with a crush on him grasps at opportunities to showcase herself.

64
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,800
Showing sincere admiration to a man

65
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,000
will cause the man to feel recognized.

66
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,300
So which girl will he choose in the end?

67
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,800
Let us take a look.

68
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He really did not choose his ideal type. You are amazing.

69
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,200
In life, there are many actions that are considered hypnosis such as hypnotic hints.

70
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,400
People more often develop an interest in those who are interested in them.

71
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,600
This is a kind of mental hint and is what is called "love compensation effect."

72
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,000
Another example would be being distracted.

73
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,200
Being distracted is a kind of self-hypnosis.

74
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Let me create an example. When being distracted in class, you will be in an absent-minded state.

75
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,600
<i>When you find out that someone likes you,</i>

76
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,300
you will unconsciously look for the person's merits

77
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,700
and fall for the person unknowingly.

78
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,400
<i>All right. Let's look at the next group of videos.</i>

79
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
<i>Let's see how Xiao Beibei will use psychology</i>

80
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,300
<i>to guess the direction that the couple will go in.</i>

81
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
All right.

82
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,600
These two students are just watching a show.

83
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,100
They did not induce any self-hypnosis.

84
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,400
<i>Although the video is about them wanting to break up,</i>

85
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,600
<i>I think they both are very reluctant to separate from each other.</i>

86
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,600
I observed their actions, behaviors, and microexpressions.

87
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,200
When they were interacting, they were really in sync. During the farewell dinner,

88
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,400
the waiter placed the tableware on the right side.

89
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,600
After sitting, the woman very smoothly moved the tableware to the left side.

90
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,600
It's because she knows the man is left-handed.

91
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,800
<i>When the man poured water for the woman,</i>

92
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,600
he wiped about the water vapor.

93
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Also, when the two were talking about breaking up,

94
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,000
the man's muscles around the eyes constricted

95
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,800
and his pupils contracted. These expressions are those of unwillingness to accept the situation.

96
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,400
The woman is the same. She is unable to stop herself from being sad.

97
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,100
The corners of her mouth turn down. She must still have words she wants to say to the man.

98
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,300
Also, those words are very likely to persuade him to not break up.

99
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,000
However, because of the current situation where they are breaking up, she cannot say them.

100
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,800
<i>From a psychological standpoint, people's innermost thoughts will be reflected in their actions.</i>

101
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,500
Because they both still have deep feelings for each other

102
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,800
and are considerate of each other, they have such actions and expressions.

103
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,200
I find your view to be quite novel and interesting.

104
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,800
That is to use microexpressions to figure out the details between the couple.

105
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,900
Looks like you are very knowledgeable in psychology.

106
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,600
I heard that show is very popular right now. Is that right?

107
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,400
<i>Yes.</i>

108
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,500
Then, let's do this. For this class,

109
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,800
let's analyze this case using psychology.

110
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,700
Here's your phone.

111
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,800
Thank you, Dr. Shao.

112
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,400
- Bye-bye. <br> - Help me walk her out. <br>- All right.

113
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,400
- Hello, Lin Shen. <br> <i> - Shao Ning <br> (Shao Ning - Psychological Counselor) </i>

114
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,800
last time, you wanted me to participate in some television show about analysis relationships as a guest, right?

115
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Are you talking about "The Heartbeat of Love"?

116
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,600
The show's director is my classmate. I'll go contact him for you.

117
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,800
Actually, for the show, we have invited a professional psychological counselor.

118
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,600
He is a partner of Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center, Mr. Lin Shen.

119
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,600
He will participate via phone. Let us see

120
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,400
how a professional psychologist

121
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,600
may analyze this couple. Please welcome him.

122
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,600
I guess that this couple, at this moment, is already broken up.

123
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,200
<i>Who is this person? Is he here to tear my stage down?</i>

124
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,600
Excuse me, Mr. Lin.

125
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,800
Our guest here thinks that there are still have lingering feelings between the couple.

126
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,400
If they handle the situation properly, they could get back together.

127
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,800
The in-sync behavior between the couple in the video

128
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,600
is just a habitual reaction stemming from

129
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,000
how long they have been together and has nothing to do with their feelings.

130
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,400
In addition, the guest mentioned microexpression analysis.

131
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,200
There is a premise that must be mentioned called psychological stress. <br> <i>(Psychological Stress)</i>

132
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,000
Psychological stress is the first response to

133
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
an unexpected stimulus.

134
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,400
In the face of so many cameras filming at the same time,

135
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,000
the couple's non-first responses in the video

136
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,800
are logically of no value for analysis

137
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,400
Oh, right. This guest.

138
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,600
You must know that that are many students studying psychology who are watching this show.

139
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Your false statements may affect their knowledge of psychology.

140
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,400
I have really embarrassed myself in front of everyone and a professional psychologist.

141
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,800
I wonder if Counselor Lin holds any classes.

142
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,700
No matter how expensive the tuition, I would like to go study.

143
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,490
Then, how did you come to the conclusion that their relationship is over?

144
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,380
This couple is not compatible with their views on life, value, and world.

145
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,980
Even though they stay together,

146
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,470
they just hypnotize themselves to be compatible.

147
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,330
It is not good for their mental health.

148
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,480
All right. That is all I will say.

149
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,120
<i>Boss Xiao, you are trending.</i>

150
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,260
<i>A relationship expert's death scene.</i>

151
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,580
<i>(#LoveExpert'sDeathScene Famous relationship blogger Xiao Beibei was left speechless by a professional psychologist on a show.)</i>

152
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,180
This Lin Shen has such low EQ.

153
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,770
Calls himself a psychology expert! Bah!

154
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,750
Hello, Sun Kele.

155
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,710
As my public relations manager, can you stop reading so much gossip?

156
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,590
Do some serious work.

157
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,540
Ask Luo Luo when will she be finish with the illustrations.

158
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,510
We're uploading a new post tomorrow. Can you ask about that instead?

159
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,060
<i>That is your sister (best friend). Do I not want to live anymore, pressuring my boss's sister?</i>

160
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,390
I don't care. Go ask. Bye-bye.

161
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,350
Hello, hello, lovely Luo Luo Jiang.

162
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,240
Will you finish your comics tomorrow?

163
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,690
I believe that you won't disappoint your best friend

164
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,080
to leave a blank on the web page.

165
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,920
Today, we will give a small benefit to audience on site.

166
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,550
You can ask your love questions to our guest.

167
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:50,230
Let her answer your questions as a love expert. <br>Raise your hand.

168
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,060
The man over there, please.

169
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,380
Xiao Xiao, long time no see.

170
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,930
Long time no see.

171
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,930
On the first day in college, I pursued you but was rejected.

172
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,140
Later, I followed you all the time.

173
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,780
As far as I know, you were not in any relationship.

174
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,250
I am puzzled since then.

175
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,490
Since you have never been in love,

176
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,600
how can you be qualitied as a love expert?

177

- Xiao Xiao, is Luo Luo here? <br> - Hello, Uncle.

188
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,470
She asked me to see her. But she is not in.

189
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,950
Why is the room so messy?

190
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,180
That girl doesn't even know how to clean up. Who will want her in the future?

191
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,860
You didn't teach her well.

192
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,660
It's as if a thief came in here.

193
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,880
Thief?

194
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,770
Hurry and take a look. See if the bank cards, saving, or other inexpensive things

195
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,170
are taken. Go look around.

I want to ask you if Yan Luo contacted you these two days.

199
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,150
Have you contacted her?

200
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,640
I did but couldn't find her. I called her but she didn't answer. <br>That is why I came.

201
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,480
-So you couldn't find her. -Yes.

202
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:13,030
Uncle, aunt, when was the last time you contacted her?

203
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,060
I couldn't remember.

204
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,490
Hubby, did you find anything?

205
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,630
Keep looking.

206
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,690

Look. It has diamonds.

209

Auntie, this electricity bill is from four days ago.

210
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,550
Yan Luo is very organized.

211
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,620
It's impossible the home would be so messy and the bill be taped to the door for four days.

212
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,720
She has disappeared for at least four days. Look.

213
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,200

- Yes. <br> - Okay. Goodbye.

We won't be reporting a case anymore.

229
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,900
- Why are we not reporting? <br> - I suddenly remembered

230
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,920
that Yan Luo most likely went on vacation.

231
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,020
She's done this a few times before.

232

She is usually home after a few days.

Auntie. If Yan Luo went on vacation, why would she stop uploading the cartoon?

236
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,930
She must be in some kind of danger.

237
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,620
- We will still report a case. <br> - No, no.

Why won't I be worried about her?

00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,800
What danger could a girl who was jumping around a few days ago be in?

241
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,540
Auntie, Uncle, you must think it through carefully.

242

- If you don't report it now and something happens to Yan Luo, you will regret it for the rest of your lives. <br> - Hey, hey.

00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,710
<i>Why would the police come here?</i>

314
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:22,080
<i>So, Lin Shen is related to Yan Luo's disappearance.</i>

315
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,990
Mr. Lin. I have been looking forward to meeting you.

316
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,470
I hope I can join Shao Lin and learn from you.

317
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:48,290
Lin Shen, she is here to interview for the position of your assistance.

318
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:53,490
Mr Shen, I just received a phone call from Wang Ai Mi, saying she couldn't make it for the interview today.

319
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,660
So, you are...

320
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,020
I am not Wang Ai Mi.

321
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,710
I am Xiao Xiao.

322
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,470
Xiao Beibei.

323
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,850
You are Xiao Beibei.

324
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,340
Yes.

325
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,060
Actually, on the day of TV recording,

326
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,550
Mr. Lin fully convinced me.

327
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,320
I am his fan now.

328
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,620
I just learn psychology.

329
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,390
But he is knowledgeable. During the recording, he disliked...

330
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,990
what he pointed out

331
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,210
opened the door to psychology for me,

332
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,500
widened my view, and deepened my thinking.

333
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,060
I suddenly sense it.

334
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:42,710
I need to learn psychology.

335
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,270
And he is my teacher.

336
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,240
You go home first.

337
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,770
Yes.

338
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:01,140
I hope to see you tomorrow, Mr. Lin.

339
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,980
This way, I will take you out.

340
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,900
How strange.

341
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,080
When you’re on the show, you demolish other people’s channels. They don’t hate you.

342
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,780
I became a fan of yours. It’s so charming

343
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,730
I've made a decision. Hire her

344
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,790
That's it? A wild card like her with no common sense and you still want to hire her?

345
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,830
I don't care if she's a wild card with no common sense.

346
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:32,130
With her career level and development potential

347
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:35,000
Besides, she has done a lot of preparations.

348
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,350
She knows that we are working with colleges and universities.

349
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:42,070
Her understanding of young women's heart is also helpful to us.

350
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,720
In addition, you and she together can be considered a handsome man with a beauty.

351
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,780
You two can go on an episode of The Heartbeat of Love together.

352
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,370
- To expand our Shaolin's influence. <br> - Wait, wait.

353
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,930
Handsome man with a beauty?

354
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:00,130
Teacher Lin, you can deny that you are a handsome man.

355
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,270
However, you cannot deny that she is a beauty.

356

<i> I welcome you in joining us. </i>

358

<i>(Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center)</i>

360
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:47,080
Sister Yan, I heard that you took care of Teacher Lin's secretarial work.

361
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,910
Then do you know if he had any dates after work?

362
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,550
Or does he have a girlfriend?

363
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,040
And you say that you are not interested in Teacher Lin.

364
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,070
Aren't I his assistant now?

365
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:01,510
If he wants to get off work early to go on a date and I didn't prepare for that,

366
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,590
wouldn't I be not doing my job well?

367
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:06,170
So that's what this is about.

368
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:10,590
Then it's inappropriate for me to tell you about Teacher Lin's personal life.

369
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,630
Interested.

370
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:23,320
I am actually very interested in him.

371
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,860
Get a piece of paper.

372
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,490
Not that. A paper for notes.

373
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,510
Our Teacher Lin does not drive or ride in cars.

374
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:38,070
He usually travel by subway or bike.

375
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,540
He does not have many hobbies. He'll occasionally run.

376
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,990
As for fruit coffee, his favorite is grapefruit ice drip coffee with maple syrup.

377
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,550
He also adds maple syrup to his tea coffee.

378
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,940
<i>Adding so much syrup. What kind of weird quirk is that?</i>

379
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,170
His birthday is November 1st, 1991.

380
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,910
He's a scorpio. You understand, right?

381
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,960
Scorpio? No wonder he's so... cool.

382
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,150
- Come in. <br> - Teacher Lin, this is the materials for the visitor today.

383
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,160
I will put it here for you.

384

Give it to me.

388

- It's okay. Let me. <br> - Give it to me.

Teacher Lin, I'm really sorry.

391
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,690
I don't need a clumsy assistant.

392

You can go to the front desk to receive the clients with Xiao Jia.

If you don't want to, that's fine. You can leave right now.

Then is there a visitor named Yan Luo?

399
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:59,850
There is but it's your first day at work so how do you know?

400
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:03,510
I heard Teacher Lin mention her but he didn't go into details.

401
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:06,850
However, I feel he is troubled over this visitor.

402
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,370
I want to know more from you.

403

Our clinic has a strict confidential procedure for visitors.

404

Also, there are confidential agreements.

Besides the person in charge, even those who work here cannot access the information.

406

Furthermore, from what I know,

407
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:24,740
- that case has been locked in Teacher Lin's drawer. <br> - Why?

Yesterday, there were police who came to investigate Yan Luo's matters.

409
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,760
She seems to have disappeared.

- Let's go. We're off work. <br> - Xiao Jia, what about the others? Did Teacher Lin get off work already?

411
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,520
Teacher Lin just left.

Let me tell you, Lin Shen, I like you.

450
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,050
I didn't want to say it. I came here to Shaolin because I just wanted to quietly watch you.

- Excuse me. <br> - Xiao Xiao! Xiao Xiao!

469
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:21,180
Hello, everyone. I am a report of the Luteng television station. We are at the beach where an unidentified female body was found.

470
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,740
Please follow me for the updates on the matter.

471
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,890
My friend, please step back. We are conducting a case right now.

472
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,890
- I'm sorry. Sorry. I want to go take a look. <br> - Please stay back.

473
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:31,200
We will release a public notice. You can look at the notice when it is released.

474
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,710
Thank you to everyone who's cooperating. Thank you.

475
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:35,550
Was there anyone suspicious nearby at the time?

476
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:39,010
There are usually not many people around here so there is no one seems suspicious.

477
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,320
Did you come here alone?

478
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,970
No, I was with my friend.

479
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:29,250
<i>Where did this Xiao Xiao run off to? She's also not picking up her phone.</i>

480
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,940
<i>The USB for the lecture is also with her.</i>

481
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,110
<i>Looks like I'll just have to go with the notes.</i>

482
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:38,730
<i>(Bai Chuan University)</i>

483
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,550
I am very happy and honored to have received an invite for today.

484
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:44,390
Let's discuss the use of hypnosis.

485
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:48,180
Speaking of hypnosis, in 1765, Viennese physician

486
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:52,120
Franz Mesmer created Mesmerism, an ancient hypnosis technique.

487
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,390
When he was doing clinical trials, he used magnets to massage people's bodies.

488
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:59,410
Then he discovered that this action

489
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,130
causes what we now call hypnotism.

490
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,770
This technique can be used to treat patients

491
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:07,280
because the effects silently took place.

492
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,660
It caused what we now call a hypnotic state.

493
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:18,450
Uncle, I went to there and it was not Yan Luo at all.

494
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:21,340
You rest assured. All right.

495
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:29,040
<i>I'm very happy to be working with you. Let me walk you out.</i>

496
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,870
<i>Bye-bye. Bye-bye.</i>

497
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,640
<i>Your drawing is so unprofessional. No need to mention how immature the style is.</i>

498
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,190
<i>- Waiter. <br> - The scenery and shadows are a mess.</i>

499
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:52,370
<i>Look at the head you drew.</i>

500
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,460
<i>It doesn't match the proportion of the person's shoulders at all.</i>

501
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:59,360
<i>I'm sorry, let's work together next time.</i>

502
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,580
<i>Excuse me, your drawings.</i>

503
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:33,160
<i>Throw them all away for me. I don't need them.</i>

504
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,160
<i>- All right. No problem. <br> - Thank you. </i>

505
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,590
<i>Can you let me take a look?</i>

506
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:41,910
<i>- Yes. <br> - Thanks. </i>

507
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:09,300
<i>I like your drawings a lot. It would be such a pity to throw away.</i>

508
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,810
<i>If you throw away your drawings because of one person's criticism,</i>

509
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:18,310
<i>then these drawings won't get another opportunity to get more admiration from others.</i>

510
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:24,640
<i>He's actually quite right.</i>

511
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,240
<i>I have never learned to draw professionally.</i>

512
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,650
<i>I'm indeed lacking in skills.</i>

513
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,040
<i>Exactly! You never learned to draw professionally yet you draw so well.</i>

514
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,610
<i>That just proves even more that you have talent.</i>

515
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,500
<i>I just resigned. I am starting my own business and public social media accounts.</i>

516
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,510
<i>I think your drawing style is quite suitable for my writings.</i>

517
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:52,190
<i>I wonder if you're willing to draw for my public accounts.</i>

518
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:57,010
<i>I just started for I don't have that much money and cannot give you a high salary.</i>

519
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:00,180
<i>However, I have over 10,000 fans. If your drawings</i>

520
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,740
<i>are posted with my writings, then over 10,000 people will see your drawings.</i>

521
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:08,390
<i>I believe there will have people who is like me and likes your drawings.</i>

522
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:20,960
<i>Then... let me introduce myself. I'm Xiao Xiao.</i>

523
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,030
<i>I'm Yan Luo.</i>

524
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:31,250
<i>Teacher Lin's USB!</i>

525
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,530
Driver, let's change route to Bai Chuan University. Please hurry.

526
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,420
All right.

527
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,950
Previously it was thought that the degree of hypnosis depends on the visitor's willingness to accept the suggestions.

528
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:46,450
The more the susceptible the visitor to suggestions, the easier it is to hypnotized.<br><i>(Xiao Xiao)</i>

529
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:50,520
The Ericksonian approach is to have a good interactive relationship with the visitor

530
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,290
before any hypnosis treatment.<br><i>(Bai Chuan University)</i>

531
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:56,460
Communicate with each other in a warm, respectful, understanding, and cooperative manner.

532
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,210
It then allows the visitor to accept the different part of themselves to the greatest extent

533
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:01,740
and realize their potential.

534
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,120
All right. Our lecture ends here. Thank you, everyone.

535
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,550
<i>(Tianguan)</i>

536
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:31,470
My dear comrades,

537
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:35,230
Counselor Lin show us his super-professional ability

538
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:39,420
and extraordinary memory of giving a lecture without any teaching agenda.

539
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,850
Complete his wonderful lecture perfectly.

540
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:47,640
At the same time, used his highly attractive self to mesmerize our future junior brothers and sisters into becoming fans.

541
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,280
Also promoting our work at Shaolin's.

542
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,750
You'll have to take part of these events more in the future.

543
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,290
Let's have a toast, celebrate it.

544
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:58,570
- Here. <br>- Here, here.

545
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,480
Let me say a few words.

546
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,840
Today is not just a celebration.

547
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,710
It's also Xiao Xiao's parting party.

548
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,940
I wish Xiao Xiao a bright future.

549
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:29,430
- Dig in. <br>- Let's eat!

550
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:32,610
How to you expect us to eat after your that speech?

551
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,580
Xiao Xiao, your matters, let's talk later.

552
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,890
Okay?

553
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:42,170
Come on, let's eat. So many delicious dishes. Come on, dig in!

554
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,120
Why don't you start eating.

555
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,500
Counselor Lin likes to joke around.

556
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,640
He said he wanted to fire Xiaojia more than 10 times. She's still here.

557
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,270
Boss Lin, I'm sorry for today.

558
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:16,590
No matter the reason, it was my fault.

559
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,880
I hope you will forgive me.

560
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,020
Counselor Lin, I know I was in the wrong.

561
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,770
I will purchase a waistband to tie you to me—

562
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:32,790
No, no. I should be the one tied to you instead.

563
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:36,800
From now on, I will follow you closely. Please don't fire me.

564
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:41,600
Counselor Lin, I came to Shaolin because I really want to learn from you.

565
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,130
I want to be a qualified psychologist.

566
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:48,090
I won't leave you. I won't leave Shaolin either.

567
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:58,210
Counselor Lin, Xiao Xiao is being so sincere.

568
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:00,960
Won't you forgive her this time around?

569
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:04,890
Bottoms up on this glass too.

570
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,760
I will definitely be more diligent in my work in the future.

571
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:25,010
<i>Counselor Lin, we'll have to trouble you to take Xiao Xiao home.</i>

572
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:28,440
Mister, we are coming out now.

573
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,460
Yes, yes, yes. I see you now.

574
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:33,880
All right. I'm heading home.

575
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,980
- Bye-bye. <br>- Bye-bye.

576
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,510
It should be the black one.

577
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:43,360
Yes, that's right. I'm leaving.

578
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,360
- Bye-bye. <br>- All right. Stay safe. <br>- Will do.

579
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,320
- Are you all right? <br>- I'm fine.

580
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,380
Counselor Lin.

581
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,690
Where do you live? Let me call a taxi for you.

582
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:58,460
No need. You go ahead.

583
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,590
Oh my.

584
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,010
Bye-bye, Counselor Lin.

585
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:05,470
Let me call a taxi.

586
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:06,810
Okay.

587
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:15,190
Where is my home?

588
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,320
Don't mind me, Counselor Lin.

589
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,000
My house is near the sea.

590
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,320
No, my house is in the sea.

591
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,090
<i>The door is unlocked.</i>

592
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:28,190
Slow down. Be careful. Careful!

593
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,090
Wait.

594
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:35,900
Here. Come.

595
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,340
Slow... Slowly.

596
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,380
- I... <br>- Hey, hey, hey. Don't throw up.

597
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:54,050
- Don't. Don't throw up. In here. Here. <br> - Water.

598
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:56,690
- Water. <br>- I'll get you some water.

599
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,970
Don't throw up on the sofa, okay?

600
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:10,710
Xiao Xiao, water. Here.

601
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:15,440
I want hot water! Hot.

602
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:03,440
<i>This painting style resembles Yan Luo's.</i>

603
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,690
<i>- Is this really related to Yan Luo?<br>- Xiao Xiao.</i>

604
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,560
Xiao Xiao!

605
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:24,140
Xiao Xiao!

606
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:29,860
Calm down. I'm Yan Luo's best friend.

607
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:34,190
If you hurt me in any way, Yan Luo's disappearance, you won't be able to be clear of it.

608
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:46,770
You really haven't seen Yan Luo for a week?

609
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:48,320
Right.

610
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,180
Why did the police come for you the day I went in for the interview?

611
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,800
Yan Luo sent me an email

612
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,570
because she had an appointment for a psych evaluation with me before her disappearance.

613
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,500
She didn't show up during the appointment time slot.

614
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,180
Is it convenient to make a copy of the video and files

615
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,100
of her consultation with you before?

616
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:09,220
- All right. I'll have my colleagues one right away. <br>- All right, okay.

617
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,510
I suddenly remembered.

618
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:14,680
She had sent me a strange email.

619
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:19,750
- Why would she send something like this? <br>- I find it strange too.

620
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:25,100
During her consultation, there was no abnormality. I even asked her afterwards.

621
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,260
She said she didn't sent this email.

622
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:31,210
Then, how do you explain this? Why would she send you a gift?

623
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:35,330
I recently had a birthday and my colleagues gave me a gift.

624
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:38,600
Yan Luo was the one to wrapped it and delivered it to my house.

625
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,440
These things must be have been mixed up after she had left the office.

626
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,640
If you are lying, I will expose you to Zuo Yan.

627
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,070
Do whatever you want.

628
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,910
This obviously is not a gift for me.

629
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,580
It's for this "W" person.

630
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:56,070
<i>I have a big crush on you.</i>

631
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:05,260
Is it the man that has been pursuing her?

632
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,720
Aren't' you Yan Luo's best friend?

633
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,840
You're asking me?

634
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,520
All right. That's all I have to say. Please do as you wish.

635
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,610
Counselor Lin, please help me.

636
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,830
Previously no matter what the situation, we would also stick together.

637
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:23,050
If this "W" person is really her boyfriend, I didn't even have a clue.

638
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:25,610
I heard that hypnosis can relax one's state of mind and enhance their memory.

639
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:29,710
If you can just help me find some clues about this "W" person, it'll be great.

640
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,380
For an investigation, go to the police. I'm just a psychologist.

641
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,130
Didn't you want to fire me?

642
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:40,420
If you help me find this "W" person, I'll resign myself.

643
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,490
Or else, I'll make you suffer in the office.

644
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:47,790
I'll be corny in front of our colleagues and bounce up and down within two meters of your desk.

645
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,910
Counselor Lin. I'm begging you, Counselor Lin.

646
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:51,990
Yan Luo really is my best friend.

647
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:55,760
If you can help me find her, I will do anything.

648
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,100
<i>You need to learn to open and free yourself.</i>

649
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:05,630
<i>If you feel like you can't complete the task, you can ask a friend to help you.</i>

650
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:08,160
Do you have any friends that you can relaxed

651
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,710
and feeling of warmth?

652
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:14,980
Yes. I have a best friend who is like the sun.

653
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:21,030
She is confident, optimistic, and energetic. When I'm with her I have no anxiety.

654
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:28,630
<i>(Recording, 19.48...)</i>

655
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:35,280
Do you have any impressions with this manhua?

656
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,180
Absolutely none.

657
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:45,400
When was the last time you saw Yan Luo?

658
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,370
About half a month ago.

659
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,430
<i>What should I wear to meet the Editor-in-chief?</i>

660
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:19,270
<i>A suit?</i>

661
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:22,060
<i>This one is very nice. Try it on.</i>

662
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:26,790
<i>It's too expensive.</i>

663
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:29,550
You are going to meet with the editor-in-chief,

664
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:32,670
You need to buy something decent to present yourself.

665
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,620
Then, I will try this one as well.

666
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,840
Let's go!

667
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,410
<i> Xiao, do you think this one is too causal?</i>

668
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:43,040
<i> It won't.</i>

669
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,290
This dress looks very nice.

670
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:49,650
It's also made of genuine silk.

671
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:56,270
Other than the clothings, what else caught your eye?

672
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,640
<i> This one looks good.</i>

673
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,020
<i> It makes your skin tone look extra fine.</i>

674
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,870
<i> What's going on?</i>

675
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:05,260
<i> Nothing.</i>

676
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:09,280
There is nothing significant.

677
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:12,020
Wait.

678
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,780
There is something caught her eye.

679
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,740
What did you see?

680
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:36,330
So you saw a navy blue cap?

681
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:37,520
Yes.

682
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,860
For this particular navy blue cap,

683
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:42,620
you saw it somewhere else later on?

684
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:46,310
Yes. I saw it again later that day.

685
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,260
<i> Come this way!</i>

686
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,470
<i> It's amazing! Look!</i>

687
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:58,430
<i> Number 1 best seller this week. "My small small world"</i>

688
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,710
Your choice is still better.

689
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:05,450
<i> No, It's your own talent.</i>

690

692

693

<i>Indirected experience still consider as experience.</i>

695
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:21,750
<i>Lately, I have been thinking perhaps I need to enhance my knowledge on psychology.</i>

696
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:25,000
<i>In order to give my articles more depth.</i>

697
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,130
<i>Let me take you to check out the psychology books.</i>

698
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,760
Is that person

699
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:56,310
be Yan Luo's "W"?

700
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,520
Hi Mr. Editor,

701
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:09,330
We will upload it no more than three days.

702
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:14,030
That's right. You cannot count this as breaching the contract.

703
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:16,220
Alright. Okay.

704
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:19,190
Don't worry. Good Bye.

705
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:26,150
She won't be in trouble this time, right?

706
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:29,130
She had gone missing once.

707
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:32,510
But she has gone missing a bit longer this time.

708
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:35,470
What should we do now? The penalty fee is hefty.

709
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:40,420
We can find a ghost artist to resolve the upload this time.

710
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:43,280
I heard they are very expensive.

711
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,060
What are you two talking about?

712
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:48,100
- Xiao Feng!<br> - Where is my older sister?

713
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,540
You go take a break.

714
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,390
I will look for her myself.

715
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:57,910
Xiao Feng. No need to be anxious.

716
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:59,980
I have already reported to the police.

717
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:03,440
Also, where are you going to find her late at night?

718
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,280
You guys have never cared about my older sister.

719
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,790
All you care is her money!

720
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,570
Hey!

721
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:12,440
You!

722
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,230
Kiddo, how can you say something like that?

723
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:17,580
You thought your dad and mom need money?

724
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,460
What we do is for your own good.

725
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,720
If you are live well, our family will be good.

726
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,700
Why can't you understand this point?

727
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:28,400
I bet your older sister is hiding at her friend's house.

728
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,200
Xiao Feng, don't worry about her.

729
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,710
<i>Old Yan, are you still playing?</i>

730
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:34,660
I'm coming! Listen to me.

731
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:38,050
Go get some rest.

732
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:39,560
Let's carry on.

737
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:07,320
What's the matter?

738
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:11,040
Counselor Lin, can you help me again?

739
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,810
I have done what I could.

740
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:16,720
Dr. Lin, you are so amazing. Only if you go one step further and pick out this W,

741
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,250
you will not hear from me again.

742
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:29,580
Have you thought of the relationship between Yan Luo and "W" are closed,

743
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,010
and yet she decided not to tell you?

744
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:33,740
What do you mean?

745
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,360
Perhaps she was contemplating.

746
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:40,920
She was contemplating about the relationship or about whether told me about them or not?

747
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:44,890
You are Yan Luo best friend, you should know her way better than me.

748
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:48,500
Perhaps, this "W" is not reliable.

749
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,580
Or perhaps, he is a dangerous person.

750
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:55,540
Instead of coming here to beg me, you should think of the people around Yan Luo.

751
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,670
<i> I must visit Luo Luo's home again.</i>
