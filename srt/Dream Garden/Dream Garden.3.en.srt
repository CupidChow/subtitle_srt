<i>Dianfan Corporation CFO, Zhou Rui</i>

8
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,360
In the beginning, I... only felt that I was being stalked.

9
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,010
But this time, I was surprised to see it during the hypnosis that I made myself—

10
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,140
What you saw during your hypnosis

11
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,750
was actually the bigger picture of your subconscious.

12
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,710
But this time, the appearance of both the perpetrator and the victim was you.

13
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,550
But why?

14
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,800
They were all so real.

15
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,260
I could clearly remember even the vehicle plate number.

16
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,730
Can you recall what you've told me last month?

17
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,490
You had an altercation with a truck driver.

18
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,160
Hypnosis doesn't create things.

19
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,690
It would take fragments of what you saw in your daily life

20
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,800
and project them in your hypnotic state.

21
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,350
Teacher Lin, is my condition getting worse?

22
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,450
On the contrary, I think you're making progress.

23
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,850
You're already aware of the difference between subconscious and reality.

24
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,400
We all live in a big city and somewhat get stressed.

25
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,810
External stress interacts with your inner struggle.

26
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,350
Parts of it emerge on the surface of your consciousness.

27
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,640
But you're unaware of the other parts.

28
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,090
Hypnosis can show what are suppressed

29
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,160
in your subconscious.

30
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,820
I'm sorry, Teacher Lin, I have to come see you this late.

31
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,860
But I really feel very tired lately.

32
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,350
Don't worry. Psychological counseling is basically a gradual progressing process.

33
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,130
I'll have to go catch the last subway train. What about you?

34
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,150
I live nearby. I'll walk back.

38
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,280
slowly close your eyes.

39
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,700
Relax yourself.

40
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,630
Imagine you're again going back to that day.

41
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,800
You stood on the stage.

42
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,360
The light was bright.

<i> Three. Two. One. Say cheese. </i>

44
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,730
No. This is all my imagination.

45
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,300
Maybe I was too nice to her and she misunderstood me.

46
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,920
But actually I was nice to her just because she's one of the senior fans in the fan club.

47
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,470
I've no other intentions. When public opinion ends,

48
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,630
I'll go see Zhang Shanshan to clarify things.

49
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:44,030
And I hope she won't have those strange illusions again because of that.

50
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:50,270
Shanshan, whether holding hands or not may not be important. Listen to me,

51
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,820
take a deep breath, and then...

52
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,900
What else do you see?

53
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,070
What's the matter, Shanshan?

54
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,720
<i> Don't you want to go see the movie with me? </i>

<i> Zhou Ran clearly was holding you that day. Why you denied it?</i>

56
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,180
No. He didn't hold my hand.

57
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,610
From that day on, why didn't you go to movie anymore?

58
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,890
-I don't know. -After that day,

59
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,270
you are together. He wants to conceal that.

60
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,920
Every time, he only took you to a drive-in theater.

61
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,050

64
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,140
<i>I saw a room.</i>

65
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,100
<i> Zhou Ran lived here. </i>

<i> You just stood there watching him while he was composing music. </i>

67
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,600
No. These are my illusions.

68
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,950
We raised a dog called Shanshan Yao.

69
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,230
<i> But the landlord didn't allow him to keep the pet, so he kept it on the rooftop. </i>

70

<i> You both even painted the rooftop, </i>

71
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,600
<i> and wrote San San Yao's home.</i>

<i> Where are you taking me? </i>

75
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,600
Shanshan, who's taking you away?

76
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,900
Do you have things like videos or pictures

77
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,140
as evidence to prove that Zhang Shanshan continuously harassing Zhou Ran?

78
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,400
Because as a We Media, I have to be responsible for my viewpoints.

79
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,330
It'll be better if you have pertinent evidence to support what you have said.

80

81

- Yes, there is, please wait and let me go get it for you. <br> - Okay.

82
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,700
This is the house Jierui used to live before he became famous.

83
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,720
Last night, Zhang Shanshan unexpectedly attempted to trespass.

84
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,050
It's good that Jierui already moved out, otherwise...

85
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,220
Look, she was trying to open the door.

86
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,320

87
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,530

88
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,850
<i> A door... it's locked. </i>

89

The answer that you want is here, go see it yourself.

90
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,520
The word's say "Shanshan Yao's house" is-

91
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,730
It-It really was here.

92
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,620
I know you want to believe it, so do I.

93
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,080
I think it is really funny, how could I be the one imagining things?

94
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,380
But yesterday when I used their keys

95
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,950
and wanted to open the door but no matter what I couldn't.

96
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,040
I really thought we had a pet

97
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,220
that was named Shanshan Yao.

98
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,420
But-

99
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:57,090
But after we came to this balcony and discovered there was nothing.

100
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,100
We should all wake up.

101
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,860
Shanshan Yao!

102
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,660
Shanshan Yao, where are you?

103
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,720
Shanshan Yao come out! Shanshan Yao!

104
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,040
Shanshan Yao, come out. Please come out!

105
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,360
Wake up, there is nothing here!

106
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,070
Let me go get you a cup of water.

107
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,020
Here.

108
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,880
Count Keyserling was physically weak and suffered from insomnia.

109
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,480
Bach composed her this song,

110
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,060
to comfort him in the sleepless nights.

111
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:52,120
So from that moment on, Back thought of this song as hers.

112
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,810
That's correct. The consistency of the fixed harmonic structure

113
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,800
is the subtext of this variation.

114
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:04,880
"Walk along side with you" is the subtext of this piece.

115
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,720
It looks like you have a lot of knowledge and understanding in music.No matter is the historical background

116
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,520
or Bach's composing period,

117
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,680
this variation is one of a kind.

118
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,720
It's like the relationship between the musicians and their fans.

119
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,370
Essentially they are looking for listeners who appreciate the music. As you said, "walk along side each other".

120
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,790
Teacher Lin.

121
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:34,690
From this hypnosis and Shanshan Yao appearing, I am even more sure that

122
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,880
I have a mental disorder.

123
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,800
From this hypnosis, everything was about her.

124
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,470
Then in the hypnosis, I killed myself.

125
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,810
I really don't know what else I would think of.

126
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,760
Actually, you didn't kill yourself.

127
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,660
But reality's pressure has caused you to not believe the relationship you have.

128
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,680
This is the result of the current artificial stimulates, I will see you again next week.

Let's just sign the contract. It'll be more reasonable than elsewhere.

248
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,600
Without reasons, you brought Yan Luo to look for a rental in my community.

249
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,800
Then you asked her to treat me for dinner, isn' this a premeditated invitation?

250
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,000
Mr. Lin. You fortell things like a prophet.

251
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,600
What troubles are you in, Xiao Beibei?

252
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,000
It is like this.

253
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
This is...

254
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,200
some important information I got from the interview.

255
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,800
But I think that this matter is fishy. I want to consult with you,

256
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,100
for a professional counselor, stalking fans are...

257
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,200
Xiao. Tripe...

258
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,600
There's no more tripe.

259
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,700
OK. OK.

260
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,900
The evidence that Zhou Ran's manager provide can indeed prove that Zhang Shanshan is a sasaeng fan.

261
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,200
Waiting in a corridor, spam-calling,

262
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,600
Zhang Shanshan did everything expected of a sasaeng fan.

263
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,700
Look, this is another video filmed at Zhou Ran's home.

264
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,500
This is another harassment call that their group recorded.

265
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,000
Hello?

266
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,200
Hello? Who are you? Why do you keep calling me at night?

267
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,600
Hello?

268
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,100
Current sasaeng fans are so capable,

269
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,200
calling at one in the moring every day.

270
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,300
They don't say anything when the call is answered and even hang up.

271
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,800
Was where Zhang Shanshan standing Zhou Ran's home?

272
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,200
This looks quite old. Zhou Ran's home doesn't seem to fit this small community's buildings.

273
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,600
Zhou Ran's manager mention this before.

274
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,400
That is where Zhou Ran originally lived, but he moved after he became famous.

275
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,800
Since Zhang Shanshan can find his old house's address and private phone number,

276
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,800
then it won't be difficult for her to get his new house's address, right?

277
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,800
That's right. She should go to Zhou Ran's new home.

278
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,500
That way there's a higher chance to see him.

279
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,700
As for this harassment call...

280
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,700
Let me ask you. If you were dating someone and he dumps you—

281
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,800
How could I possibly be dumped by someone?

282
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,400
I'm saying hypothetically.

283
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,400
If you were dating, was dumped by him, and even blocked by him,

284
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,400
would you think about getting a new number to call him?

285
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,200
I have never been... dumped before.

286
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,800
How would I know?

287
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,400
That's true.

288
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,600
Xiao Beibei, a relationship expert.

289
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Depending on what perspective you take, you will get a different answer.

290
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,400
In your heart, you have already determined Zhang Shanshan is a sasaeng fan.

291
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,800
Then her actions are harassment.

292
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,000
What if you change your perspective?

293
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,800
Change perspective?

294
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,000
Let me give an example.

295
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,800
When we are doing psychological counseling, we often only hear of that person's one-side story.

296
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,200
Just like this coin. If you want to truly know a person

297
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,000
as well as their problems,

298
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,600
you have to look at its other side.

299
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,800
Look at the other side.

300
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,000
If Zhou Ran and Zhang Shanshan did date before,

301
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,600
then everything Zhang Shanshan did makes sense.

302
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,700
Luo Luo?

303
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,300
Come, come.

304
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,600
Close the door.

305
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
- Happy! <br> - Yes, happy. <br> - Happy, happy.

306
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,800

307
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,400
- Yes. <br> - Yes, you can still drink more.

308
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,000
- Let's put her into the bed, Counselor Lin. <br> - Yes, you can still drink more.

309
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,400

310

316
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,900
- Get up. <br> - Too heavy.

317
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800

She's asleep.

332
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,200
How did you get drunk? She actually didn't drink much.

333
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,700
That's true.

334

My investor dad must be looking for me right now.

349
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,800
Hopefully, Sun Kele can take care of it for me.

350

Who's Sun Kele?

351
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:04,000
He is the operation manage of my social media feed. He must be urged by the advertisers to upload my article.

373
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,360
Gentlemen?

374
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,700
Move aside.

375

475
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,940
So I suggest you guys,

476
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,700
ask Shan Shan if she is willing to continue the treatment.

477
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,910
But Shan Shan's mom doesn't want to. She just wants to make the situation less complicated.

478
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:56,350
Also after Shan Shan came to the hospital, she hasn't said a single word.

479
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:59,130
I respect Shan Shan's wishes. When she wakes up

480
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:01,570
I will come talk to her.

481
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:07,650
Okay. I trust you.

482
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:18,000
What's wrong? Didn't sleep well?

483
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,430
What's up with this?

484
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:25,090
I helped you out.

485
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:28,850
You overdid it. Shan Shan-

486
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:41,620
Forget it. I just want to focus on my music.

487
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:46,910
Don't worry, your press conference is already prepared.

488
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:56,630
How's the dog?

489
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:04,020
I've been busy these days.

490
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,840
Let me buy you another dog, a pure bred.

491
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,630
That mutt can't compare to your status now.

492
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,180
What do you mean?

493
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:28,110
Hello?

494
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:31,710
<i>Is this Xiao Beibei? Hi! We are from Dianfan Group.</i>

495
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:34,100
I'm not, you called the wrong number.

496
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,180
Hello? Teacher Lin.

497
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,270
What? Shanshan went missing?

498
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,080
Shanshan.

499
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,120
Shanshan?

500
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,730
Shanshan!

501
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,460
<i> I confronted Zhou Ren and Fong Lin at their office just now.</i>

502
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,870
<i>I do think this matter is a bit strange.</i>

503
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:07,770
<i>I bet these messages were all posted by users paid by your company.</i>

504
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,180
<i>Is there a problem? Our celebrity was being smeared by rumors.</i>

505
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,980
<i>Are we not allow to verify?</i>

506
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,920
<i>- How do you explain this?</i><br> - What's latest update on the Stalker Fan incident?

507
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,280
<i> Is that Sansanyao, imagine herself dating the idol?</i>

508
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,870
<i> I saw the live feed, this Sansanyao visited Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center.</i>

509
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:31,160
<i> My friend knows Shaolin's Dr. Lin, he said she has survive delusional disorder.</i>

510
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,620
<i> The netizens are quite amazing, they can digged out all these information.</i>

511
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:39,560
<i>Such a coincident. I worked at this Shaolin's Psychological Center before.</i>

512
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:44,090
<i>How about we ask this Dr. Lin? </i>

513
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:47,690
<i>(Lin Shen)</i>

514
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:52,490
<i> I don't care anything anymore, the most important thing is to find Shanshan.</i>

515
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,650
Her father and I have looked everywhere around the hospital. We haven't found her.

516
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,710
Let me think about where she would go.

517
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:01,060
Did she go back to Zhou Ran's old home?

518
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,360
This way.

519
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,930
Shanshan's father.

520
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:31,240
Hello?

521
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,260
You found Shan Shan?

522
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,930
That's great.

523
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:40,390
Okay. We understand.

524
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,620
Shanshan-

525
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,310
Shan Shan's dad said she was lost.

526
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,510
Shanshan.

527
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,350
Shanshan.

528
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:03,040
Shan Shan?

529
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,710
Shan Shan Yao?

530
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:15,070
<i> (Inpatient) </i>

531
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:17,480
Teacher Lin.

532
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,750
-Uncle, Aunty. <br>-Where did you get this dog?

533
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:24,550
I went to the place where she said she used to live with Zhou Ran.

534
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:27,460
She said they raised a dog named Shan Shan Yao.

535
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,760
I didn't expect to find it.

536
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:41,830
<i> Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center </i>

537
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:44,420
How was the conversation with Shan Shan?

538
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,120
Zhang Shan Shan forgot about Shan Shan Yao.

539
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:52,590
Her parents hope that she forgets about everything related to Zhou Ran.

540
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:56,600
Then what you are saying is that Shan Shan might have actually dated Zhou Ran?

541
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,940
-That is correct? <br>-Just based on a dog?

542
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,770
That dog will respond every time I say, Shan Shan Yao.

543
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:05,320
It is possible that they raised it together.

544
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:11,870
If I can ask, when Shan Shan fell from the stairs.

545
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:14,790
What did the head CT say?

546
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:18,010
It said that everything was normal and nothing was injured.

547
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:21,730
It's just that she had some external injuries but that can heal with rest.

548
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:26,650
Then have you thought about why Shan Shan had forgotten everything regarding Zhou Ran?

549
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:32,010
Isn't that good? Since she can't remember Zhou Ran,

550
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:35,950
then we don't need to force her to remember it.

551
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,810
This is the problem. Choosing to forget

552
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:45,900
is something a person with a traumatic experience will do.

553
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,330
When she fell, she experienced an psychological change.

554
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:54,980
If anything triggered her nervous in the future, her hidden memories will reappear.

555
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:57,260
We just want

556
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:01,020
us to all live a calm life.

557
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:07,540
Dad, Mom can we keep him?

558
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,350
Then what should we do now?

559
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:18,270
Since her family has already said no.

560
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:22,320
Then as her psychologist, I can only stop here.

561
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,030
This isn't very you.

562
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:27,110
All visitors must have a motive.

563
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:29,360
I cannot initiate the invitation, it's against the practice.

564
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,670
I'm not a psychological counselor. I don't have those rules.

565
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:54,940
Xiao Beibei.

566
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,990
Xiao Beibei.

567
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:59,310
You are?

568
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:01,890
My assistant had tried to reach you in regards to working together.

569
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,410
But you rejected it, this is my name card.

570
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:06,930
<i>Dianfan Group?</i>

571
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,730
-Hello? <br>-Is this Xiao Beibei?

572
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:15,220
<i>Hello, this is Dianfan Group. May I ask—</i>

573
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,280
I am not, you called the wrong number.

574
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,080
I remember now!

575
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,390
Are you free right now? Can we talk?

576
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:23,570
Yeah.

577
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,040
Let's go.

578
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:30,110
I apologize, I was not in the right mood that day.

579
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:33,890
I didn't want to deal with work and hung up on your assistant.

580
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,020
That's understandable.

581
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:45,260
Actually, we met before at Zhou Ran's company.

582
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:54,240
<i>Your pen.</i>

583
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,140
Thank you!

584
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,640
It was you?

585
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,870
That is such a coincidence.

586
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:01,720
It is. I was there for a meeting.

587
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,600
His manager has mentioned about you.

588
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,690
Then I went to checked you out on the social media.

589
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:10,640
I saw that you wrote an article regarding Zhou Ran.

590
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,200
I think it was viewed over ten thousand times, right?

591
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,020
It didn't. It wasn't even posted for half a day and I deleted it.

592
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,580
Deleted? That's article was pretty explosive.

593
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,030
Then why did you delete it?

594
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:36,960
Actually when I wrote this article, I was a bit biased.

595
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,980
And I ended up hurting the other person.

596
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:46,630
I also heard that when you deleted this article, Zhou Ran's company wasn't too happy about it.

597
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:50,870
Yeah, they won't answer my phone call and won't even let me see Zhou Ran.

598
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:54,860
Seeing Zhou Ran isn't that hard.

599
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:58,830
Don't misunderstand. I have no other intention.

600
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:01,860
Frankly, my company and Zhou Ran's company have some business collaborations.

601
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,260
So we will see each other often.

602
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,890
Do you need any help?

603
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:11,550
Why would you help me?

604
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:13,720
Why would I?

605
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:31,610
Because I like your journalism.

606
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:36,130
The key is based on the deleted article incident, I can see you are a responsible person.

607
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:40,390
Currently, a lot of popular writers is seeking for fame and they don't have any bottom lines.

608
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:44,160
On another note, speaking in business term, I think your account has a lot of value.

609
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,200
That's why I want to manage all your online exposures.

610
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:53,760
Don't worry, based on the content you write about, I won't interfere.

611
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,970
Thank you for believing in me.

612
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:58,660
But, I want to see Zhou Ran first.

613
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,740
We can talk about partnership another time.

614
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,870
That's fine with me.

615
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:10,320
I'll arrange it for you.

616
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:20,230
<i> Where do you want to go to the university?</i>

617

<i> National Taiwan University. How about you?</i>

618
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:29,060
<i> I want to go to National Taiwan University too!</i>

619
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,920

623
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,130

00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,730
<i> We shouldn't fight.</i>

632
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,220
Why did you stop playing?

633
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:42,390
This piano doesn't sound quite right. Especially is the C note.

634
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:44,080
Is that so?

635
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:50,370
That's right. This piano needs to be tuned.

636
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:53,080
You are?

637
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,570
I am the boss of this shop.

638
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:57,870
Hello, Boss.

639
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:00,720
- Hello. It is your first day here, right? <br> - Yes.

640
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,670
Looks like we recruited the right person.

641
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:06,640
Then, do you study music?

642
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,940
No. Before, I wanted to study music.

643
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:13,960
However, because of some things, I was not able to study it.

644
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,390
It's because...

645
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:28,350
Sorry, I forgot the reason. <br> - Such a pity.

646
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:32,360
Oh, right. Why don't you help me paste these posters.

647
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,850
<i>(Dream with Chopin)</i>

648
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:11,990
<i>(Best Singer: Zhou Ran)</i>

649
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:24,590
You promised me we will move tomorrow but you are now going to a business trip.

650
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:28,940
You're just going on a business trip for one day. When you come back, I'll help you move.

651
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:33,060
Let me first help you look for a professional moving company.

652
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:35,800
I'm not worried about that.

653
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,100
I'm worried about you.

654
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:44,080
You got so many upset readers just because you couldn't update your social media feeds in the past few days.

655
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,290
Massive negative reviews are still sort of a publicity.

656
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:51,080
This is not like you.

657
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:54,900
Zhou Ren Meet and Greet VIP seat,

658
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,930
it's amazing. This Director Fang is really keeping his promises.

659
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:02,640
Zhou Ran! Zhou Ran!

660
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,070
Zhou Ran! Zhou Ran!

661
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:08,190
Did you find my dog?

662
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:12,380
I haven't yet, but we put poster's up everywhere.

663
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:15,180
Don't worry. We're looking for you.

664
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:19,740
Boss. The reporter is backstatge.

665
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:21,780
All right. You go on first.

666
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:25,910
Jerry, you're okay, right?

667
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:27,990
How does my hair look?

668
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,510
Not bad. Then, I'll head over first.

669
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:32,030
All right.

670
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:36,030
Are you ready?

671
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:37,660
Okay. We are counting down now.

672
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,020
Okay.

673
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:55,110
Zhou Ren! Zhou Ren! Zhou Ren!

674
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:54,230
Zhou Ren! Zhou Ren!

675
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:56,970
Thank you Zhou Ren!

676
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:59,720
It's amazing performance.

677
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,520
Be quiet down, everyone.

678
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,260
Next, we will choose a few fans to come up

679
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,900
and play a few games. What do you think? <br> - That's fine.

680
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,790
Me! Me!

681
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:10,710
I will pick one for you.

682
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:13,710
Okay, Let me see who is the lucky one?

683
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:15,170
That person with the short hair.

684
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:18,480
This person with the long hair. As well as this person.

685
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,310
Also, the person with the ponytail.

686
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:23,870
Hello. <br> - Come. Please stand on the side.

687
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:26,610
Stand on the side. In a line.

688
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,590
<i> Why is Shanshan here?</i>

689
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:39,830
Look at the live feed from Zhou Ren's Press Conference.

690
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,740
Why would you be here? What is your relationship with him?

691
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:03,670
Are you in a relationship with him? Are you Zhang Shanshan?

692
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:05,330
<i>Are you here to confront Zhou Ren?</i>

693
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:06,830
What relationship do you two have?

694
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:09,180
<i> Are you guys really had a relationship before? Did you fabricate the story?</i>

695
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:11,970
What is Zhou Ran's relationship with you? Why are you here?

696
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:13,630
Could you please explain?

697
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:15,780
<i> Is it a publicity stunt? Why don't you answer my questions?</i>
