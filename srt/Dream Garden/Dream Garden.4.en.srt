It let netizens discuss and laugh at it

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,150
- I'm going in. <br>- Don't worry, Shan Shan.

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,360
It's all right now.

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,480
- You're awake. <br>- Quickly, give it to me. <br>- What?

00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,810
Don't worry, your face was not injured.

22
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,010
Scared the heck out of me.

23
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,590
- It's okay. <br>- Yes, it's okay.

Don't get up. Sit, sit.

25
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,870
Please sit.

26
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,940
I can I speak with her alone?

27
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,390
Okay.

28
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,610
You're Xiao Beibei, right?

29
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,540
Recently, I've been having nightmares.

30
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,210
In my dreams, I would see a familiar person.

31
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,300
Then, that day I was at the piano store I saw Zhou Ran's poster.

32
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,210
I thought that person was him so then I researched all I could online about him.

33
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,180
I discovered that between him and I, we have many stories.

34
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,370
So I decided to go to the fan meeting and see what he thought.

35
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,070
I also saw your post being reposted online.

36
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,660
I've seen you on the variety show, therefore I was able to recognize you.

37
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,540
When I say those, I just couldn't...

38
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,990
I couldn't help but think maybe

39
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,480
I'm that unacceptable. Everyone in the world would hate me.

40
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,620
I'm sorry. That was the mistake of my team.

41
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,270
But you know what I was thinking when you are rushing towards me?

42
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,950
I was thinking, it turns out there are people who are willing to protect me.

43
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:50,270
I... I didn't think I was that unacceptable.

44
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,220
It's good now.

45
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,700
You deleted the article for my sake.

46
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,400
And you wanted to protect me too.

47
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,430
Thank you.

48
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,890
Is there room for treatment in Zhang Shanshan's situation?

49
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,890
Selective forgetfulness is a psychological mechanism.

50
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,660
She started to have symptoms.

51
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,040
It's just obvious now.

52
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,670
At the beginning, she selectively forgot about Zhou Ran's relationship.

53
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,670
Until now, to completely forget the person.

54
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,900
- But... <br> - But, what?

55
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,470
But, after your incident, Zhang Shanshan's parents

56
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,210
already agree to let her continue counseling.

57
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,020
Then when do you plan on counseling her?

58
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,640
- Will you hypnotize her? <br> - Hypnosis cannot solve everything.

59
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,570
Then what do you plan to do?

60
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,460
How about I help you?

61
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,430
I am partially responsible for Zhang Shanshan's matters.

62
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,920
I also want to use psychology to help her.

63
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,920
To help her find her memories.

64
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,920
You never studied psychology.

65
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,120
But you're a master at psychology. You can teach me.

66
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,710
I'm no master.

67
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,850
You just don't want to teach me.

68
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,370
Once you're well rested, come see me. I'll teach you.

69
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,770
Then I'll go report to you tomorrow.

70
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,490
I can teach you some methods for hypnosis but you have to understand

71
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,200
that this isn't what they do in professional counseling.

72
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,630
You have to use it carefully.

73
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,560
Help me get a pillow.

74
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,710
- There's one behind you. <br> - T-That one is bigger.

75
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,790
- They're the same. <br> - They're not. Look.

76
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,340
Look. Give me that one.

77
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,790
I'm so hungry.

78
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,510
I'm good

79
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,540
It's not even well organized.

80
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,490
Why did Zhang Shanshan post this long list of numbers to her Weibo?

81
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,710
What's the meaning of this?

82
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,510
Here's another one.

83
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,770
She probably wants to express something.

84
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,330
It says Zhang Shanshan frequently goes to the drive-in theaters.

85
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,550
Maybe it has something to do with a movie?

86
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,890
Let's check.

87
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,950
1918, July 14

88
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,370
Two three three five is 11:35pm.

89
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,870
What do these last four mean?

90
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,940
This is the FM radio station for the drive-in movie theater.

91
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,400
FM radio station for the theater?

92
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,850
- Here. <br> - Thanks.

93
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,370
<i>(Drive-in Cinema)</i>

94
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,960
<i>(I Who Doesn't Exist)</i>

95
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,050
Why did did she watch all these marked movies?

96
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,160
<i>Perhaps, she didn't manage to watch "I Who Doesn't Exist".</i>

97
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,660
Sorry, can I ask what this one 177.1 means?

98
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,210
This is the FM radio station

99
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,450
for that movie.

100
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,570
So, it was "I Who Doesn't Exist".

101
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,410
Zhang Shanshan wanted to see it but didn't get to.

102
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,720
This is her desire.

103
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,980
We can also make use of this information.

104
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,590
Except I don't understand any of this.

105
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,320
No rush. Just a minute.

106
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,540
- What is this? <br> - Sign it.

107
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,890
Confidentiality agreement.

108
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:19,310
Party A, Lin Shen, and Party B, Xiao Xiao. Why are you Party A?

109
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,710
All right, Party B, Xiao Xiao, sign.

110
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,080
Party A. And then?

111
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,300
Let's start with theories.

112
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,910
Let's begin.

113
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,120
Is this all for me?

114
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,120
Xiao Xiao

115
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,720
How about you go rest first?

116
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,580
I am fine. I want to finish this.

117
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,200
You are up.

118
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,180
I feel asleep at I was studying last night.

119
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,610
Would you like a cup of coffee?

120
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,190
Thank you.

121
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,770
Your left side.

122
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,020
Do you have an oil cleanser?

123
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,490
Oil cleanser? No.

124
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,380
Do you cook? Olive oil works, too.

125
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,260
I don't have olive oil. I have almond oil, do you want it?

126
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,770
That works.

127
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,660
Here.

128
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,900
Thank you.

129
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,590
What is the matter so early.

130
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,380
<i>Are you home?</i>

131
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,020
What is the matter?

132
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,990
Say it.

133
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,410
Out of the ordinary.

134
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,080
-Who is it? <br>-There is a newly open coffee shop around your house.

135
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,590
I brought you some.

136
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,340
I have a stomachache today, so I can not drink the coffee. I will see you at the center.

137
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,050
Wait.

138
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,550
This is unusual. Something is happening.

139
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,600
-Nothing is happening. <br>-Let me take a look.

140
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,420
Let me take a look.

141
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,560
Still trying to deny that nothing is happening. Who shoes are these?

142
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,680
-I...My shoe. <br>-The trees is blooming.

143
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,300
You're overthinking. We'll see each other later at the office.

144
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,730
Lin Shen, your almond oil stings my eyes.

145
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,570
That voice sounds familiar.I should say my greeting.

146
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,680
Do you need some help?

147
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,300
Boss Shao

148
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,090
Hello. I bought this coffee for Lin Shen.

149
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,300
Grapefruit ice drip coffee with maply syrup. He loves it. It's super sweet.

150
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,660
I guess you do not like to drink this anymore since you two are already so sweet.

151
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,550
It is not like that. It is not what you think, Boss Shao.

152
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,750
No need to explain.

153
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,740
I am happy for you. I am leaving.

154
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,080
Say something.

155
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,890
-Lend me your car. <br>-Lend you a car?

156
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,230
Keys.

157
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,360
You're borrowing this is so out of character. What are you going to do with it?

158
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,570
Hurry up and give it to me.

159
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,780
I am leaving.

160
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,720
Why did you not say anything earlier?

161
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,880
There is nothing to explain.

162
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,590
Tonight we will go to the car cinema.

163
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,830
I will meet you at the car cinema. You drive.

164
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,980
Are you not afraid of riding in a car?

165
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,540
<i>(Car Cinema)</i>

166
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,640
-Hello? <br> <i>-Where are you at right now?</i>

167
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,560
Sorry. Can you wait just a little bit.

168
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,290
It started seven minutes ago. If not, we will have to wait for the 10 p.m time slot.

169
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,330
<i>I am almost there.</i>

170
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,600
That's not right. Don't you have to ride subway line 3 to get there?

171
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,990
Why are you so much faster than me?

172
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,580
Because there is no traffic in the subway.

173
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,450
Alright, wait for me. Almost there.

174
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,810
Get in the car.

175
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,440
<i>Hurry up. We are going to be late.</i>

176
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,070
<i>Shen Shen, hurry up or else you are going to be late.</i>

177
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,430
<i>What is the matter? Get in the car.</i>

178
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,600
<i>Hurry up.</i>

179
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,600
Sorry. I did not know that there is a car acident scene in this movie.

180
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,260
I saw that you were reacting quite severely so I turned it off.

181
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,110
H-How about I try it one more time?

182
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,320
The attention of a hypnotized person is different than of a regular person.

183
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,600
It's focused by the hypnotist through verbal cues.

184
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,820
If the focus point of the hypnosis does not meet expectations,

185
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,560
you should follow his change in direction and tempo

186
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,110
to let him describe what he sees.

187
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,050
If he's nervous and fearful, you can conduct

188
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:41,230
catharsis and desensitization of the body on him. Understand?

189
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,250
I just mastered this and am not very familiar with it.

190
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,790
How about we try one more time?

191
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,030
-Hello, Luo Luo. <br><i>-I am back from my business trip.</i>

192
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,880
<i> You said you would help me move in. What time are we meeting.</i>

193
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,510
Yes. I am at-

194
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,280
<i>Are you watching a movie? Are you with Teacher Lin?</i>

195
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,700
<i>Did I call at the wrong time?</i>

196
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,360
What do you mean. How about tomorrow at 10 a.m?

197
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,890
<i>Sounds good. See you tomorrow.</i>

198
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,590
- You've worked hard. Thank you. <br> - Thank you.

199
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,540
- Don't put it in the middle, blocking the path. <br> - I can't do it anymore.

200
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,490
I can not do it anymore.

201
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,540
-Let me sit. Move over. <br>-Quickly.

202
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,210
Why do you have so many things?

203
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,050
Xiao, do you have time tomorrow to go furniture shopping with me?

204
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,560
Not a problem. Let me take a look.

205
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,770
I know now.

206
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,250
What do you understand?

207
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,890
The baby product is right after the recent married product.

208
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,820
This is the stimulation of the deep-rooted demand via the superficial demand of the consumer.

209
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,600
Zhang Shan Shan goes to a vehicle cinema to watch movie.

210
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,200
Her satisfaction was probably just her superficial demand.

211
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,730
Her deep-rooted demand is to have a just and honorable date with Zhou Ran.

212
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,570
Vehicle Cinema is just a secretive date.

213
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,420
Hence, it can resolve her preoccupation. It's not the drive-in cinema at all.

214
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,060
Teacher Lin

215
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,650
Xiao Xiao, I have a new idea. Let us meet at Shaolin.

216
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,570
I happen to be looking for you.

217
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,740
I have something to do. I'm leaving now.

218
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,570
- Hey, this person is favoring a lover over friends. <br> - I'm heading there now.

219
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,120
<i>( Lin Shen )</i>

220
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,780
This box was discovered by Shan Shan's mom when she was cleaning the room.

221
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,590
<i>The things in this box may have to do with Zhou Ran.</i>

222
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,630
<i>If not it would not be in this state.</i>

223
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,270
<i>(Tickets for drive-in cinema)</i>

224
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:00,240
<i>There's a drive-in cinema in the movie too.</i>

225
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,760
<i>And two ordinary tickets for the same movie.</i>

226
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,130
<i>Zhang Shan Shan mentioned numerous time in her blog</i>

227
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,290
<i>that she went to a vehicle cinema.</i>

228
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,550
<i>If she indeed did have a realtionship with Zhou Ran,</i>

229
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,500
<i>Because of Zhou Ran's unusual identity,</i>

230
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,080
<i>the drive-in movie theater may be where they often have dates.</i>

231
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,250
<i>Or Zhan Ran likes that place. </i>

232
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,780
<i>Because it is not public.</i>

233
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,750
<i>What is the matter Shan Shan?</i>

234
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,970
<i>Do you not want to go watch a movie with me anymore?</i>

235
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:33,070
<i> Shan Shan mentioned that in her dream that another her mentioned that Zhou Ran owe her something.</i>

236
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,440
<i>He does not own me anything.</i><br><i>-Then tell me.</i>

237
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,400
<i>How come you never watch a movie at a theater after that.</i>

238
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,850
<i>-I do not know.</i> <br><i>It is because after that day,</i>

239
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,090
<i>you two got together. In order to hide it from everyone,</i>

240
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,730
<i>he only takes you to a vehicle cinema to watch movies.</i>

241
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,370
It seem like we were going the wrong direction.

242
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,620
could be wrong.

243
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,870
Wrong direction?

244
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,440
When we conducted information analysis,

245
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,200
we thought Shan Shan's preoccupation was the drive-in cinema.

246
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,500
But with what we discovered today, we may have analyze this situation incorrectly.

247
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
<i>When I went to the vehicle cinema to understand more about the sitution.</i>

248
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,800
<i>I discovered that Shan Shan watched all the movies that she listed.</i>

249
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,600
<i>It's only on 14th July that she didn't watch "I Who Doesn't Exist".</i>

250
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,200
<i>She could have watch a movie with Zhou Ran at the vehicle cinema.</i>

251
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,800
<i>Why did she not watch it?</i>

252
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,800
<i>I later discovered that Zhou Ran had a fan meeting on July 14.</i>

253
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,600
<i>Zhou Ran did not go to that day vehicle cinema date.</i>

254
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,520
<i>Therefore on the 15th, Shan Shan</i>

255
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,200
<i>invited Zhou Ran to a date at a regular movie theater.</i>

256
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,600
<i>In the end, Zhou Ran did not attend even though he had nothing scheduled.</i>

257
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,400
I still haven't gotten to the bottom of Zhang Shan Shan's issue.

258
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,440
It might be at regular movie theater.

259
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,200
Watch a movie publicly.

260
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,400
<i>(Rookie)</i>

261
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,200
Darkness effect.

262
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,400
Yes.

263
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,600
Darkness is a element that cause fear. Except for movie theater.

264
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,400
In front of unfamiliar audience and surroundings,

265
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,360
some people may not be fearful

266
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,200
and might actually enjoy it more. This is because

267
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,200
our attentions are forced in a different direction.

268
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,200
Lin Shen, think about going back to your college campus.

269
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,600
You can tell me what you see.

270
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,200
I see

271
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,400
<i>that there are people holding hands.</i>

272
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,200
<i>What else?</i>

273
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,200
I also see

274
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,000
corridors.

275
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,600
Field.

276
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,600
There are also classrooms.

277
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,200
What else do you see?

278
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,600
<i>I also see you.</i>

279
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,200
Lin Shen? Lin Shen, where are you?

280
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,900
Xiao Xiao!

281
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,060
Here, for you. Did you know

282
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,400
the iron horse is you and the ice river is also you.

283
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,200
What does this mean? In any case, I'm not human, right?

284
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,200
No, no. What I means is...

285
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,800
All right. Relax. I will go. I happen to want to watch this movie, too.

286
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,400
Thanks.

287
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,800
Xiao Xiao, wait for me.

288
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,800
This is not the only movie you've watch with that boy, right?

289
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,400
Sun Kele, why are you only here now?

290
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,000
This is my friend from college who often asked about you.

291
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,200
Congratulations, you can leave your single life behind very soon.

292
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,100
Childish.

293
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,400
Do you think this lady has feelings for this guy or this other one?

294
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,800
All this talk is meaningless.

295
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,600
In the future, don't help me with these matchmaking.

296
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,300
It's not-

297
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,800
I-I'm not randomly matchmaking. He's quite nice.

298
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,600
He's also sincere about you. Trust me.

299
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
He's really quite great.

300
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,400
Lin Shen.

301
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,200
<i>I will count to three now.</i>

302
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,500
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

303
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,700
What is it?

304
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,000
If I remember correctly, that movie aired two years ago, right?

305
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,600
That's right.

306
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,400
How does a person who's been single since birth two years ago

307
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,200
open a public account to teach others how to date?

308
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,800
We're here to learn about hypnosis. Let's not talk about other stuff.

309
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,600
Then have you learned it?

310
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
Learned what?

311
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,000
Anti-hypnosis. You were trying to hypnotize me just now.

312
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,600
But then you were led by me.

313
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,000
You're spying on other people without their permission.

314
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:45,990
Counselor Lin, I'm not as talented as you think.

315
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,300
I got it. I will remember that next time.

316
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:56,260
But when did you wake up?

317
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,100
Was it when I let go of your hand?

318
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,600
You woke up when I let go of your hand, right?

319
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,100
That means that I must hold your hand the whole time I hypnotize you.

320
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,600
Xiao Beibei.

321
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Director Fan, what are you doing here?

322
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,400
Our company just received announcement of a new play.

323
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,200
The press conference happens to be here so I came to take a look.

324
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Are you here to watch a movie with your boyfriend?

325
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,200
Let me introduce you two. This is my supervisor, Lin Shen.

326
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,300
We were working. It just ended.

327
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,600
- Fan Qi. <br> - Hello, I'm Lin Shen.

328
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,000
Thank you. I will have a new post on Wednesday.

329
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,800
I look forward to it.

330
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,400
Today I'm not too busy. If you are in a rush, I can give you both a ride.

331
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
No need. That would be to much trouble for you.

332
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,600
It's also not convenient. My supervisor likes to travel in an eco-friendly manner.

333
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,200
- All right. Bye-bye. <br>- Gret. Bye-bye.

334
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,000
Okay, great.

335
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,400
<i>How does a person who was still single since birth two years ago</i>

336
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,000
<i>open a public account to teach other how to date?</i>

337
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,800
<i>Owl typed person. This type of person is dependable.</i>

338
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,400
<i>Serious. Attentive to deatils.</i>

339
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,400
How do you feel on your first day in your new home?

340
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,800
<i>I can finally have a good night of sleep.</i>

341
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,800
That's fine. I'll go to the furniture store with you in a few days.

342
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,000
Let me see.

343
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,800
There a new comment on a post I made over a year ago.

344
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,000
<i>It's probably one of your die-hard fans.</i>

345
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,800
It's someone who's here to cause trouble.

346
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,200
<i>What? Is it a very bad comment?</i>

347
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,600
Lin Shen is following my public account!

348
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,800
<i>That's a good thing!</i>

349
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,600
Go take a look.

350
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,700
Hurry and eat.

351
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,800
Shanshan.

352
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,000
I see that you're home all the time. Do you want to go out with a friend

353
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,200
to go watch a movie or go shopping?

354
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,400
My college friends have graduate long ago.

355
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,400
They are quite busy with work. They're not like me,

356
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,600
staying at home alone.

357
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,400
You can go out with Xiao Xiao since she also is a public figure.

358
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Yes, that's right.

359
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,600
Last time, Xiao Xiao saved you. I have not even thanked her yet.

360
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,200
I originally wanted to invite her here for dinner.

361
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,000
However, I'm also afraid she'll be uncomfortable.

362
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,400
That's right. You two young people can go out to watch a movie or go shopping or something.

363
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,630
Can you send her

364
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,560
- a text? <br> - Of course.

365
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,350
Sansanyao, let's go!

366
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,100
<i>(Xiao Xiao)</i>

367
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,790
<i> Do you have time to watch a movie together?</i>

368
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,550
<i> Yes! There is a movie I've been watching to watch.</i>

369
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,410
<i> I' will buy the tickets.</i>

370
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,100
<i> Let's start the plan.</i>

371
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,200
<i> After all the hassles,</i>

372
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,670
<i> we just wanted to fulfill this tiny dream.</i>

373
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,610
<i> It could be because I'm also a girl, I do understand her thoughts.</i>

374
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,150
<i> It's not that she cannot let go of this relationship,</i>

375
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:35,230
<i> it's because she is reluctant to admit this relationship was in the dark and ends in the dark.</i>

376
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,280
<i> The best way to unlock her heart</i>

377
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,370
<i> is to help her ends the relationship openly.</i>

378
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,570
<i> We visit a normal cinema.</i>

379
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:48,090
<i> we will arrange a relax hypnosis session and let down of her guard.</i>

380
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,860
<i> (Xiao Xiao)</i>

381
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,300
<i> (Xiao Xiao)</i>

382
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,950
<i> (Non existent me)</i>

383
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,990
<i> Non existent me?</i>

384
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,310
<i>It sounds so familiar?</i>

385
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:23,770
<i> (Non existent me)</i>

386
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,480
I'm sorry.

387
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,540
- I'm late.<br> - Don't worry, we can make it.

388
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,260
- Your ticket. <br>- Thank you!

389
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,410
- I bought drinks. <br> - Thank you.

390
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,970
Let's go.

391
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,110
- We still have ten minutes. <br> - We're in theater 6.

392
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,980
Theater 6.

393
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,270
Excuse me.

394
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:06,040
<i> Where do you want to go for college?</i>

395
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,480
<i> The University of Taiwan. What about you?</i>

396
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,020
<i> I also want to go there.</i>

397
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,490
<i> What's wrong? What do you expect?</i>

398
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,570
<i> He won't come. Stop waiting for him.</i>

399
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,430
<i> You aren't the same.</i>

400
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,910
<i> He won't let go of his career for you.</i>

401
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,170
<i> You don't deserve him.</i>

402
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,740
<i> You're just a lunatic.</i>

403
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,810
<i> I'm not crazy!</i>

404
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,660
Shanshan.

405
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,620
- What's wrong. <br> - Can you sit down?

406
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,520
Sorry.

407
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,360
<i> Reporting!</i>

408
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,100
- I'm sorry. <br> - Sorry.

409
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,390
Sorry, sorry.

410
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,780
Shanshan.

411
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,180
Xiao Xiao, I want to go home.

412
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,470
What's wrong? Was the movie too boring?

413
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,890
No.

414
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:11,350
I feel like I've seen this movie somewhere,

415
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,600
but I don't remember where.

416
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,930
I have a headache right now.

417
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,470
How about we hang out sometime else?

418
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:25,110
Shanshan, I want to admit something.

419
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,470
I didn't bring you here because I wanted to watch a movie.

420
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,380
I wanted to help you...

421
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,520
I wanted to help you to recover some of your memories.

422
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,410
I'm sorry.

423
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,810
Shanshan, recently,

424
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,460
have you had any nightmares about Zhou Ran?

425
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,700
In my dreams, I can hear him,

426
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,100
I can touch him too.

427
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:12,110
But I have always thought that it was all my imagination.

428
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,730
Besides, I've keep thinking

429
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:17,740
that I've seen that movie somewhere.

430
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,090
But I really can't recall anything about it.

431
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:25,060
Shanshan, I'll only ask you one question.

432
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,660
Do you want to completely forget the memories

433
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,170
or do you want to recover them?

434
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,940
I want to remember them.

435
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:57,180
Even if it's bad memories,

436
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,640
that's still a part of my memory.

437
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,570
I have the right to know

438
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,270
what happened.

439
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,300
Let's go.

440
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,210
<i> People who have had trauma will experience short-term memory loss.</i>

441
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,450
<i> You're nightmares are signs of trauma.</i>

442
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:21,390
<i> Why don't we pay a visit to Councilor Lin?</i>

443
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,420
<i> (Lin Shen - Psychology Counselor)</i>

444
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,700
Shanshan, if you returned to the theater,

445
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,750
who do you hope to go with you?

446
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:40,160
- Xiao Xiao. <br> - Okay.

447
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,160
Now, slowly close your eyes.

448
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,380
Slowly.

449
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,380
Imagine yourself back in the theater.

450
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,120
Good.

451
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,830
<i>Shanshan, don't be scared. I'm here.</i>

452
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,580
<i>Breathe deep. Imagine yourself</i>

453
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,470
<i>back at Zhou Ran's movie premiere.</i>

<i>I'm very glad you could come to Zhou Ran's fan meet.</i>

455
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,120
<i>Hello, everyone. I'm Zhou Ran.</i>

456
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,300
<i> Next, it's time for a group photo.</i>

457
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,870
<i>For some reasons, when I first signed into the company, we still had limited resources.</i>

458
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:32,780
<i> In my hardest time, she was the one who set up this fan meet.</i>

459
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,320
<i> She was also my first fan.</i>

460
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,410
<i> We're here. Why aren't you stopping?</i>

461
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,450
<i> Where are you taking us?</i>

462
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,970
<i> You're not happy.</i>

463
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:15,290
<i> There is a road that does not have an end.</i>

464
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:19,720
<i> He is sprinting away, leaving you back at the starting point.</i>

465
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:49,810
<i> You are one of the thousands of fans.</i>

466

<i> You can't stop this change.</i>

467
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,770
<i> Because this is something you wish would happen.</i>

<i> It's you.</i>

<i> What's wrong, Shanshan? Don't you want to come watch a movie with me?</i>

474
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,840
<i> I actually thought that we had a pet</i>

<i> named Sansan Yao. Wake up.</i>

476
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,150
<i> There's really nothing there.</i>

477
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,090
<i> Can't I not have a dog?</i>

478
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,130
<i> You're just one of my fans.</i>

479
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,270
<i> Mom, I just wanted to tell him</i>

480
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,900
<i> that I'm not crazy.</i>

481
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,550
<i> Shanshan, you can do some</i>

482
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:15,640
<i> deep, slow breathing. There might be a part of you that's wondering</i>

483
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,310
<i> what the ending of the movie is like.</i>

484
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:37,960
<i> Hurry! This way. Come here.</i>

485
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,520
<i> My flower.</i>

486
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:51,070
<i>- Why did you suddenly get a new car? <br> - So I could detract the attention to pick you up.</i>

487
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,220
<i> Let's raise a pet dog together.</i>

488
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,560
<i> Let's call him Sansan Yao.</i>

489
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,690
<i>Why are you releasing your frustration with your guitar?</i>

490
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:28,210
<i> I have enough. I love music.</i>

491
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,660
<i> I'm chasing after my dream, that's why I'm doing this.</i>

492
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:35,240
<i> At the end? My company forced me to act in the drama.</i>

493
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,440
<i> Why can't I just be a singer?</i>

494
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,050
<i> Who am I now? Am I a puppet to you?</i>

495
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:44,750
<i> You are not. You are not. Don't be mad.</i>

496
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,720
<i> All these restrictions are temporary.</i>

497
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,470
<i> You have gone through so many obstacles and difficulties. </i>

498
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:55,750
<i> These is nothing for you. There gotta be a way out.</i>

499
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,930
<i> Give me a smile.</i>

500
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,020
<i> Sansanyao's home.</i>

501
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:11,030
<i>From now on, this is our secret base.</i>

502
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:15,120
<i> A place for for three of us, can we?</i>

503
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,620
<i> Our Sansanyao not has a home.</i>

504
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:23,310
<i> We will definitely have a home one day.</i>

505
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,270
<i> I believe one day,</i>

506
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:31,940
<i> you will take me to your music dream.</i>

507
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,760
<i> Stand up on the world stage, </i>

508

<i> show off your talents.</i>

509
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:41,460
<i> When I become famous, no one will able to control me.</i>

510
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,860
<i> I want to hold your hands, and announce to the world</i>

511
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,510
<i> that I love you.</i>

512
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,700
<i> I want to make this clear with you.</i>

513
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:58,910
<i> We don't have a chance of dating. You're just a fan of mine.</i>

514
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,610
<i> It's not like this, Zhou Ran. It's not like this, you know that.</i>

515
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,950
<i> Zhou Ran, we... You can't do this to me, Zhou Ran!</i>

516
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:12,170
<i> Zhou Ran, you can't do this to me.</i>

517
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:14,720
<i> Zhou Ran!</i>

518
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,510
<i> Hurry, get on the car.</i>

519
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:21,790
<i> Zhou Ran. Zhou Ran!</i>

520
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:24,920
<i> Zhou Ran, we...</i>

521
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,170
<i> Zhou Ran.</i>

522
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,420
I need to get out.

523
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,210
<i> (Sansan Yao's Home)</i>

524
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,210
<i>Zhou Ran, stop her. Why aren't you stopping her?</i>

525
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,170
<i>Zhou Ran!</i>

526
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:37,270
<i> Zhou Ran. I'm begging you. Stop her.</i>

527
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:32,220
<i> Let go. Since he doesn't admit our past,</i>

528
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,650
<i> what's the point of my existence?</i>

529
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:36,770
<i> No.</i>

530
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,740
<i> Let go.</i>

531
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,920
<i> No!</i>

532
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,830
<i> It's really my memories!</i>

533
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,220
<i> The past you used to love Zhou Ran.</i>

534
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,500
<i> It's because he was glowing</i>

535
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,950
<i> and successful in his music career.</i>

536
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:12,330
<i> He is just an obstacle in your music dreams.</i>

537
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,020
<i> Soon, he started to become more successful.</i>

538
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:19,000
<i> But you left yourself behind, lost your own identity.</i>

539
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,320
<i> You, no. You're me.</i>

540
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,470
<i> I need to have a need interpretation of this relationship,</i>

541
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:26,400
<i>a memory that would help me.</i>

542
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,370
<i> I'm awake from the dream. But my dream is still in my control.</i>

543
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:34,410
<i> Shanshan, listen to me now.</i>

544
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:38,570
<i> When I count to one, slowly open your eyes. All right?</i>

545
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:43,110
<i> Three, two, one.</i>

546
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,120
<i> Xiao Xiao, I'm completely aware of everything now.</i>

547
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,650
<i> I'm very thankful. I also feel sorry.</i>

548
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,050
<i> We left before the movie finished last time.</i>

549
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:08,900
<i> Are you still willing to finish the move with me?</i>

550
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:26,780
I wasn't able to hear Zhou Ran admit this relationship.

551
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:30,000
But it's over now anyways.

552
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,340
It's still possible.

553
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,890
Thank you guys for all you've done for me.

554
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:45,390
You should thank yourself more.

555
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:49,570
You used your own strength to say goodbye to your past.

556
00:48:55,030 --> 00:49:00,510
I... always wanted to apologize to you.

557
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,870
I owe you a formal apology.

558
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,420
Please don't.

559
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,000
Actually, meeting you is my biggest pleasure.

560
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,970
After going through this much, I have already stopped thinking about who others see me as.

561
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:23,050
Thank you for allowing me to accept this relationship.

562
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:43,230
Hello, Director Fan. I'm Xiao Beibei.

563
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,130
<i> Can you do me a favor? I want to meet Zhou Ran again.</i>

564
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:48,400
If you want to meet him, there's ways to do that.

565
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,960
There happens to be a chance soon.

00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:03,180
As my partner.

570

576
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:00,680
Sure. I'll choose the location.

577
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,790
I'll send it to you.

578
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,890

to play a little game with him.

586

Wow. The lucky winner has been picked.

590
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,360
Everyone guess who it is.

591
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:04,790
Okay, let's congratulate

Let's welcome our lucky winner onto the stage.

594
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,500
Stand next to our Zhou Ran.

595
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,760
- What's your name? <br> - I'm Xiao Xiao.

596
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:32,760
In video Zuo Yan sent, Xiao Xiao is quite beautiful.

597
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,880
Her high heels must be at least eight centimeters.

598
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,820
Take a look. I'm not sure if she'll go home alone

599
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,330
or Director Fan will send her.

600
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,680
Where are you going?

601
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,720
You eat first. I have to go get something.

602
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,720
It's the thirty-seventh already.

603
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,350
This game we're going to play is very easy. It's called

604
00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:00,550
Zhou Ran's Little Secret. This game is

605
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:03,990
very easy for Zhou Ran's fans.

606
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:07,380
The first question is, ever since Zhou Ran's debut,

607
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,760
what's his favorite place?

608
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,770
<i> The stage!</i>

609
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,550
The recording studio.

610
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:24,960
<i> I can teach you psychology, but you–</i>

611
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,810
<i> I know, the regualtions.</i>

612
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:30,430
<i> I cannot be a professional counselor without formal training and education.</i>

613
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:33,480
<i> This is our learning materials.</i>

614
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,520
<i> You can take a look.</i>

615
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,110
<i> Association games?</i>

616
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:44,430
<i> We would often use association games to call down the visitor.</i>

617
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,160
<i> Thoughts, memories, or relationships that they do not admit</i>

618
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,990
<i> will usually be remembered subconsciously.</i>

619
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,150
<i> Learn it thoroughly.</i>

620
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:56,710
<i> Are you trying to say that I can make connections to</i>

621
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:59,720
<i>stimulate someone's memories?</i>

622
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:06,760
How did you get it wrong? Everyone already told you the correct answer.

623
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,320
Hurry and call the workers to get that girl down.

624
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,070
I'm sorry. That is Director Fan's friend. She cannot leave for the time-being.

625
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:16,520
Director Fan? Impossible.

626
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:20,440
Director Fan wanted me to tell you that this is just a game, you don't have to be nervous.

627
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,370
What?

628
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,310
What is he trying to do?

629
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:28,440
Zhou Ran had a music video regarding delicacies.

630
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,720

631
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,820
<i> Spicy beef!</i>

632
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:37,980
Incorrect. Zhou Ran doesn't like to eat spicy food.

633
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:45,380
<i> Actually, Zhou Ran is completely different from what you see.</i>

634
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,110
<i> He can't eat spicy food. Not even a little.</i>

635
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:52,440
<i> He has irritable bowel syndrome. But I love to eat spicy food. I love it.</i>

636
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,110
<i> Because his identity is special, we can't go eat out often.</i>

637
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:05,520
<i> This thing is so spicy! How am I supposed to eat it?</i>

638
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,230
<i> It's delicious because it's spicy!</i>

639
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:09,860
<i> It's so refreshing when you eat it.</i>

640

<i> If you can't eat it, give it to me. We can't food.</i>

641
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:19,700
<i> If you like it that much, I'll write a song called "Spicy Beef" for you.</i>

642
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,590
<i> It's really good. I just like to eat spicy food.</i>

643
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:30,500
<i> Here. Scream for me. I'll put it into the song.</i>

644
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,130
<i>- You don't think I can scream? <br> - Scream then.</i>

645
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,260
<i> Scream.</i>

646

<i> I'll scream twice for you.</i>

647

<i> Are you really going to use it?</i>

648
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:47,410

I don't know them.

Zhou Ran, you don't have to act like that.

681
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:07,160
She wanted me to pass this on to you. She doesn't want to prove anything.

682
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,610
She already put everything down.

683

As an outside, if you really liked her and accepted you past,

684

you should say goodbye to her properly.

685
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,310
Shanshan told me that she told you before.

686
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:30,250
You didn't want to be the company's burden. That you wanted to be yourself.

687
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:36,680
Zhou Ran, don't walk forward and leave your heart behind.
