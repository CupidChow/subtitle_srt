Stop speaking nonsense.

You're still lying.

23
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,190
I went to tennis class to pick you up. They said you never even went there.

24
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,810
I never even liked tennis.

<i>Do you know that tennis is an upper class sport?</i>

29

Other kids don't have the resources even if they wanted to learn.

What do you always force me to learn?

33
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,950
<i>You always force me to do thing I don't want to. My dad would never do that.</i>

Mom, I can drink anymore.

57
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,020
A glass of vegetable juice before bed strengthens the stomach and maintains the figure.

Is there anything else?

89
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,990
Master, I blacked out and don't remember anything.

90
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,570
If I offended you in any way, I didn't mean to.

98

This is Zuo Yan's newest account username.

101
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,280
She made another comment last night.

102
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,050
<i> Aunt, do you know how hard our Baby Xi works? Based on what are you saying his acting's bad? </i>

103
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,100
<i> Is your acting as good as his? You should shut up. </i>

104
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,100
<i> Since you're calling me aunt, let this aunt teach you how to be a person. </i>

<i> Second, I don't know if I should stop or not</i>

107
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,950
<i> but your Baby Xi should really improve his acting skills. </i>

108
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,510
<i> He shouldn't stare when he's crying, surprised, or sad. </i>

109
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,810
<i> Does he need he need his eyes enlarged? </i>

110
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,640
<i> Third, your Baby Xi changed his birth year from '85 to '95. </i>

111
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,000
<i> Aren't you embarrassed to call him baby? </i>

112
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,030
I thought that there would have been some changes after yesterday night.

113
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,430
Why did she start arguments with Zhang Kexi's fans again?

114
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,220
Zhang Kexi's top fans have been attacking Zuo Yan for a while now.

115
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,610
Zuo Yan held her in for a very long time, but people have times where they have to let things out.

116
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,000
Considering why she started to argue back yesterday...

117
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,190
I guess it has something to do with her mom.

118
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,710
<i> The car that I called is here. We should leave now. </i>

119

<i>(Mom)</i>

120
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,250
When we have dinner with Zuo Yan, she always gets home before 11 p.m.

121
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,710
She says it's because she doesn't want to work overtime,

122
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,740
but seeing the current situation,

123
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,120
it should be her mom who gave her a curfew.

124
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,550
You both drank until midnight.

125
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,370
Her mom called her many times and she didn't answer.

126
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,300
So when Zuo Yan got back, her mom must have been mad.

127
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,740
If you want to solve a problem, you have to start from the cause.

128
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,020

Your present arrived at my office.

140
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,860
This isn't a present. It's a gift.

141
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,670
Is there a difference between the two?

142
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,130
This was originally going to be a gift for the

143
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,260
couples that were successful from the fellowship.

144
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,380
But it wasn't so we have some left.

145
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,110
Then, how do you plan to handle it?

146
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,930
This is really good cards, I have to share it with you.

147

Share?

148
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,000
Are you sure I want to share this good thing with you?

149
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,800
It's pretty good. Can you just cooperate with me?

150
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Why should I cooperate your date with someone else?

151
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,280
<i> Perhaps he is jealous?</i>

152
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,260
Mentor, how about this. We use this to plan some company meet-ups

153
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,900
and we can give Sister Yan a being angry gift?

154
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,260
A being angry gift?

00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,540
Mainly because we have eight experience cards left for the Hot Spring Hotel from the fellowship.

160
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,780
We can use it on this meet-up.

161
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,640
I even found a professional photographer for this trip.

162
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,410
My special assistant, Sun Kele.

163
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,080
You see. All of us including Sun Kele

164
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,680
is seven people, and we will have one left.

165
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,140
Boss Shao, you can invite your friend.

166
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,390
I invite a friend?

167
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,770
Hey Xiao Xiao, why don't you introduce a friend?

168
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,820
This way, we can have eight people for the Saturday meet-up.

169
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,620
I'll leave it all to you.

170
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,870
I find a friend? Who should I bring?

171
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,590
<i>(Lin Shen - Psychology Counselor)</i>

172
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,980
<i> (Xiao Xiao)</i>

173
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,320
<i> She clearly said she wanted to talk another day, why did she come now?</i>

174
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,110
Come in.

175
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,080
I asked you to come with me for lunch and you said you already had plans.

176
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,460
How come you're still in the office?

177
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,100
I originally did have plans, but the other party had something come up.

178
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,570
Someone who always has strict plans,

179
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:05,330
how would you allow the other person to not tell you the specific time and location

180
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,750
and make you stay in the office waiting?

181
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:14,050
As a person is waiting for someone's message nonstop,

182
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,330
then congratulations, you are in love.

183
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,100
- Where are you going? <br> - You said you wanted to eat lunch. Let's go.

184
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,490
I'm not going. I'm not going to eat.

185
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,900
If you don't want to eat, then don't. I'm treating.

186
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,410
- Then I want to eat a huge meal! <br> - It's Shaxian food.

187
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,810
You agreed that you'll go to the meet-up with us this Saturday.

188
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,320
It's your company's meet-up, why would I go?

189
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,910
Boss Shao told me to bring a friend along.

190
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:49,550
Besides, you need to get a break since you always update your manhua.

191
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,540
Then, never mind.

192
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,110
You can't! You have to go with me.

193
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,960
<i>Xiao Xiao, my mom arranged a blind date for me on Saturday and I cannot cancel.</i>

194
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,540
<i> I won't go the the meet-up anymore.</i>

195
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,160
Who are you texting? It's dinner time!

196
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,310
Okay, no problem.

197
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,820
<i> Sister Yan, do you really want to meet your blind date?</i>

198
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,420
<i> It's a person that matches my mom's requirements.</i>

199
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,130
<i> But he's not the type that I like.</i>

200
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,180
<i> But...</i>

201
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,880
<i> Sister Yan, do you still remember what we said at the bar?</i>

202
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,920
<i> Even if it's extremely difficult to change, we must change little by little.</i>

203
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,500
<i> You have to make decisions for your own life. </i>

204
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,900
<i> You can't be tied down by others for the rest of your life.</i>

205
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,150
<i> Perhaps, I've been tied for too long.</i>

206
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,570
<i> I feel like I have Stockholm Syndrome <br> (an emotional response which happens when the victim has positive feeling towards their abuser)</i>

207
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,330
<i> I've already forgotten how to rebel.</i>

208
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,600
<i> Frankly, I cannot change anything.</i>

209
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,250
Where are you going?

210
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,750
I'm going to dump the trash.

211
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,940
Wait a moment. I'll go for you.

212
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,360
Lin Shen throws his trash every day at 9:30 p.m.

213
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,500
I need to talk to him about something.

214
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,740
Let go. You even know what time Lin Shen throws out his trash. What stage are you two at?

215
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,430
What are you talking about?

216
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:47,150
I saw you two texting on WeChat during dinner. Aren't I right?

217
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,830
No, I was messaging my colleague, Zuo Yan.

218
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,040
You can lie to others, but you can't trick me.

219
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,600
That's true. It's urgent matter.

220
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,470
I admit that

221
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,790
when Mentor Lin is working, he is a

222
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,300
little but sexy.

223
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,050
But I only admire him. Our Mentor Lin can only be admired from afar.

224
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,570
Do you understand now?

225
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,540
Listen carefully, I'll go to the meet-up.

226
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,010
I'll get inspiration for my "Dream Garden".

227
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,380
What are you talking about? I really am looking for him for proper business.

228
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,740
Don't gossip and spread rumors about us.

229
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,080
- Got it? <br> - Go explain to your Mentor Lin!

230
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,290
<i> The being angry gift</i>

231
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,880
<i> for Zuo Yan.</i>

(Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center - Yan Yan)

233
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,340
<i> As one is constantly waiting for one's message,</i>

234
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,350
<i> then congratulations, you're in love.</i>

235
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,410
I can only watch from afar and not do anything profound.

236
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,720
I can only watch from afar and not do anything profound.

237
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,160
Do not do anything profound. Nothing profound.

238
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,020
Are you speaking a curse?

239
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,450
I'm throwing trash away.

240
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,670
Where is your phone?

241
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,290
My phone is at home. I left it upstairs.

242
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:54,720
I prepared some things that Zuo Yan likes and dislikes.

243
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,250
You can use this meet-up and irritate her.

244
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,350
- Mentor, I still want to talk to you about this matter. <br> - She's not going anymore?

245
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,940
Sister Yan's mom planned a blind date for her on Saturday.

246
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,020
- I think we should reschedule to work with Sister Yan. <br> - Is that necessary?

247
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,970
If she doesn't come, doesn't it defeat the purpose of even hosting such an event?

248
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:20,170
To solve her problems, she needs to cooperate with us mentally.

249
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:24,190
If she can't even take the first step, no one can help her.

250
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,840
Why are you looking at me like that?

251
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,310
Mentor, you've been working with Sister Yan for three years.

252
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,780
You still use a professional lens to view her.

253
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,600
What do you mean? Are you saying that I'm cold-hearted?

254
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,760
I said that you are really logical. Who said you are cold-hearted?

255
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,940
I didn't say that! Hey!

256
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,260
Go home earlier. You didn't bring your phone so it's not safe.

257
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,750
I can only watch from afar and not do anything profound.

258
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,920
<i> Zuo Yan, are you sure you're not going to attend the meet-up?</i>

259
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,060
<i> There's some urgent matters at home. I don't have time this weekend.</i>

260
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,220
<i> How about we change it to next Saturday instead?</i>

261
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,230
<i> As escape becomes a habit, it is a very frightening matter.</i>

262
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:22,210
<i> But this doesn't mean that you can't change.</i>

263
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,770
<i>The most important thing for you right now is your marriage.</i>

264
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,470
<i>If you two got married, you can even moved to United Kingdom with him.</i>

265
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,120
<i>You have to seize the opportunity when it is presented to you.</i>

266
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:53,560
<i>When compromise became a habit, it's a very dangerous thing.</i>

267
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,120
<i> But it doesn't mean the situation cannot be changed.</i>

268
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,240
<i> What I have been tell you? Choices are important.</i>

269
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,820
<i> Choices are important but your choice</i>

270
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,900
<i>should be selected by you.<br> - I pick this one.</i>

271
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,270
This one is called Singapore Sling.

272
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:16,190
<i>You have picked this break free of bondage cocktail.</i>

273
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,600
<i>Break free of bondage. </i>

274
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:25,540
<i>You have studied psychology. In order to solve a problem is to dissolve the knot in your heart.</i>

275
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,880
<i> You cannot resolve it by external help. I have been working you for many years and I know you. </i>

276
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,670
<i> There is a strong and big monster inside you.</i>

277
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,240
<i> You should release it and lead you to the real you.</i>

278
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,950
<i> Move forward and make your choice.</i>

279
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,950
Hi. The rooms for your team are ready. Here are the room keys.

280
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,500
- Okay. Thank you!<br> - You are welcome.

281
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,810
This way.

282
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,360
Let's do it.

283
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,340
I just realize that herbal pillow and herbal essence oil are

What she hates is

285
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,030
That's it. The room is ready.

286
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,880
Sun Kele has already contacted the restaurant. Our group dinner,

287
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,140
from menu to music, they are all Sister Yan hated the most.

288
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,140
Xiao Xiao, we will be there in 10 mins. Are you there yet?

289
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,560

Xiao Xiao told Yan Luo everything, even me made an appearance on the comic book.

295
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,660
You are awake.

296
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:42,800
- Are we there yet? <br> - Around 5-6 mins.

297
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:52,590
Wear the sunglasses, it's very bright outside.

298
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,880
Thank you. How about you?

299
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,530
Me?

300
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,430
That's pretty cool.

301

Hi. This is your water.

Don't you normally rip the express mails open with your bear hands? How come you can't even twist the cap open?

Sister Yan said she has something and she won't join us.

312
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,790
Do you want water?

313
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,500
<i>Isn't that Sister Yan? </i>

314
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,000
- Sister Yan!<br> - I'm sorry I'm late.

315
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,250
Nevermind. As long as you are here. It's not too late.

316
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,990
Shall we wait until Counselor Lin and Sun Kele are here then we distribute the rooms?

317
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,540
Counselor Lin!

318
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,850
- Everyone is here. <br> - Great.

319
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,890
I'm sorry!

320
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:31,320
- I'm late. <br> - Who told you to be here so late?

321
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,860
Sister Yan.

322
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,720
- Leader Xiao, since we are all here. Can we distribute our rooms?<br> - Of course.

323
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,140
Let me announce our team retreat's rule number one.

324
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,740
Hand it over your cellphones.

325
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,350
Cellphone has taken over too much of our leisure time.

326
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,240
Because of that we missed a lot of beautiful sceneries.

327
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,270
That's why our retreat has to do something different.

328
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,180
We are confiscating all your cellphones.

329
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,720
We will need to communicate with each other face to face.

330
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,120
- Sister Yan.<br> - Wait for a moment.

331
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:15,950
<i> Where are you? Why didn't you go to the blind date?</i>

332
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,880
<i> I'm attending the company retreat.</i>

333
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,790
This room's aroma seems very special.

334
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,970
It has this herbal medicine scent.

335
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,490
Sister Yan, let's unpack.

336
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,550
We will start our afternoon activity shortly.

337
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,610
Okay.

338
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,080
<i>Mom, I want to change the pillow.</i>

339
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,620
<i> The classmate are teasing me that I got this herbal medicine smell.</i>

340
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,390
<i>You can't. Those kids don't know anything, it's good for your body.</i>

341
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,480
<i>Mom, can't you just change it for me?</i>

342
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,260
<i>Stop nagging.</i>

343
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,660
<i>You have promised me before.</i>

344
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,790
<i>Go in and study.</i>

345
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,700
Let's start the plan.

346
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,880
You guys are here.

347
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,120
- Xiao Xiao. <br> - Where is Boss Shao?

348
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,550
He is tired, taking a break over there.

349
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,660
Where is Yan Luo?

350
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:45,560
She was working on the deadline last night, she is taking a nap now and join us later for dinner.

351
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,090
Sister Yan, why don't you play.

352
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,980
- I don't know how to play, I can't.<br> - Don't be humble, Sister Yan.

353
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,820
I heard you was the Junior tennis champion.

354
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,480
How can play with this outfit?

355
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,530
Sister Yan, just give it a try.

356
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,440
<i> Where were you??</i>

357
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,870
<i>I was at the tennis lesson.</i>

358
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,160
<i> Why are you lying?</i>

359
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,140
<i> I went to pick you up and they said you weren't there.</i>

360
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,550
<i> - But I'm not interested in tennis. <br> - I want you to become an outstanding person. </i>

361
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:47,620
<i> My former classmate earned the scholarship to study abroad because of tennis. </i>

362
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,320
<i> I almost got into the same university because I was few points behind. </i>

363
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,400
<i>Do you know tennis is a high class activity. </i>

364
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,020
<i> Other family can't even afford to learn this sport.</i>

365
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,020
<i> How can you not understanding your mom's intension?</i>

366
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,000
<i> How I don't like tennis to begin with. </i>

367
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,300
<i> Why are you forcing me to learn?</i>

368
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,780
<i> You have been forcing me to do things I don't like. Dad never do this to me.</i>

369
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:13,650
<i> Mom. I made a mistake. I'm sorry.</i>

370
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,830
<i> If you don't want to play, just say no.</i>

371
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,460
<i> Fine. Let's play a set.</i>

372
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,950
<i> We failed the first step of the plan.</i>

373
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,030
You, Sun Kele and I has to keep in touch.

374
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,640
Don't let anybody else find out.

375
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,060
Fine. I'm going to the bathroom. You go in first.

376
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,590
Okay.

377
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,470
Dinner is almost start. Where are you going?

378
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,120
Boss Shao brought few bottles of good wine from his personal collection.

379
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,370
I can go pick it up. You must be tired after the tennis game.

380
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,110
I have been focusing on Sister Yan's matter, and forgot to bring the car key.

381
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,170
That's right, Xiao Rui doesn't have cellphone.

382
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,150
Xiao Rui, where are you going?<br> Xiao Xiao went to pick up the wine but she forgot the car key.

383
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,170
I will do it.

384
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,890
Xiao Xiao!

385
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,150
That's strange.

386
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,770
Director Fan is really something.

387
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,190
There are so many personal collection.

388
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,180
What do you need my help with?

389
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,230
What I need your help with?

390
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,020
<i>Be careful of the car. That's so dangerous.</i>

391
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,550
Brother Qi, why are you here?

392
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,670
<i> Shouldn't I be the one asking you that?</i>

393
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,640
<i> I brought my colleague here for some food.</i>

394
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,980
I have to thank you for the hotel vouchers.

395
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,700
<i> How about this? Since I bumped into you, help me out with something.</i>

396
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,100
<i> Help with what?</i>

397
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,630
I want you to help me pick out a wine.

398
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,760
I don't understand it enough to be able to pick out one.

399
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,700
If you don't know, that's great. If you do, you might pick out an expensive one.

400
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,170
Then, I will be heart broken.

401
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,430
Now, I would give it a go.

402
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,960
How about this bottle?

403
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:57,450
This bottle, if I remember correctly, I made lots of effort to bid this.

404
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:01,530
You said that you cannot pick out wine, but you don't look like it.

405
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,250
If it's so valuable, I should change my pick.

406
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,450
No, you don't have to do that.

407
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,150
Picking wine is like picking a person.

408
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,960
If you pick this bottle, it means you have fate with this person.

409
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,520
Just like how I met you, it's like fate. Right?

410
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,620
Okay, let's drink this one.

411
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,210
Are you gifting it to everyone?

412
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,920
To be precious, this bottle of wine is for you.

413
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:57,010
<i> Right away!</i>

414
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,240
Your friend is also my VIP.

415
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,160
This is their first visit and I should treat them well as the host, don't you think?

416
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,330
We can't. This trip was paid by your vouchers.

417
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,610
We can't take your wine on top of that.

418
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,500
If you are really grateful, you can treat me to dinner.

419
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,640
If you reject one more time,

420
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,000
I wonder if you don't want to drink this wine, or if you don't want to treat me to dinner.

421
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,580
Of course I do.

422
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,760
I need to find a place that matches the Brother Qi's taste.

423
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,850
Then, how should I thank you?

424
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,090
Let me hurry and tell everyone first.

425
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,470
Where is my phone?

426
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,910
<i> Hi Teacher, did you call me?</i>

427
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,900
Where are you?

428
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,450
I'm at the basement of the garage. I lost my phone and I just found it.

429
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,980
Where were you?

430
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,820
<i> I went to pick up the wine from the car. </i>

431
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,760
But I forgot the car key.

432
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,420
I bumped into Director Fan and he gave us a few bottles of wine.

433
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,080
Director Fan?

434
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,670
Teacher, where are you? Are you okay?

435
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:26,680
I'm okay. You should get back first.

436
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,230
Let's salute to Director Fan.

437
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,230
Okay, thank you!

438
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,330
Where is Counselor Lin?

439
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,840
Xiao Xiao, would you like a glass?

440
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,040
No need. I still have some.

441
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,970
I forgot to tell you something.

442
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,980
When you went to pick up the wine, you forgot the car key.

443
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,800
Counselor Lin went and delivered the key.

444
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,090
How come the person that came back with you was Director Fan?

445
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,710
Are you saying he went to the parking garage to find me?

446
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,000
If not, why else?

447
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,180
I would like to invite you to a BBQ event. As a host, I hope all of you can attend.

448
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,110
Have some good time.

449
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,520
I'm sorry, but I have to go to the restroom first. I'll be back.

450
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,790
Director Fan, should we cheers once more?

451
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,320
Thank you.

452
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,840
<i> The number you dialed is not connected...</i>

453
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,270
Teacher, you are in your room?

454
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,880
Where did you go? Why are you suddenly injured?

455
00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:00,010
I was looking for you, I saw some one's pet got kidnapped.

456
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,620
So in that split moment, I ran after them.

457
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,460
Because of a pet?

458
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,910
You are too considerate. It's so unlike you.

459
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:11,650
That's right. I'm hot headed and ran after them. I didn't care what's happening around me.

460
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,370
Did you find the pet?

461
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:22,750
That little pet really needs to say thanks to you.

462
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:29,460
Then, how should she thank me?

463
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,470
How can she thank you?

464
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,330
Aren't I the one taking care of you?

465
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:37,570
Pretend like me putting on the bandage is her way of thanking you.

466
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,550
Yan Luo.

467
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,090
Here.

468
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,560
Thank you.

469
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,990
Writer Yan, I haven't salute you.

470
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,050
<i> Limited to one glass of alcohol</i>

471
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,890
Xiao Rui.

472
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,150
Since Yan Luo doesn't have a high tolerance,

473
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,850
how about we drink a glass instead?

474
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,060
Let's welcome Yan Luo into our big family.

475
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,940
I am very happy today, so let's drink some more.

476
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,540
Don't drink that much.

477
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,310
Drink a bit less.

478
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,610
I...am the sauce.

479
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,980
What sauce?

480
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,740
Ketchup!

481
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:44,390
I'm telling you a secret. A secret from our office.

482
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,340
Few people on this table are

483
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:51,310
Jiang Jiang Luo's fan club member.

484
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,150
Cheer to the fan club.

485
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,860
There to the fan club.

486
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,790
How's Sister Yan's situation?

487
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,190
I told Sun Kele,

488
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,300
we need to increase Sister Yan's anger level.

489
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,880
Tomorrow, we are heading for the sauna.

490
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,470
Hopefully under a high temperature environment will prompt to emotional explosion.

491
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,310
We can give it a try.

492
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,570
Teacher,

493
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:19,130
Will there be no results tomorrow?

494
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:24,570
Have you asked yourself why do you want to become a psychologist?

495
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:27,250
I also don't know...

496
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,820
That's why result is not a pre-set

497
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,860
and it's because of your own hard work.

498
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,350
Got it.

499
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,470
Xiao Rui, hurry and ask the staff to change the music.

500
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,400
Why?

501
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,790
Don't you think this song sounds very nice?

502
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,890
It has a meaning.

503
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:53,140
There are two musical instructions, erhu and piano.

504
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:57,780
Those two sounds might be different but it intertwine with each other.

505
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,260
It's like two lovers falling in love.

506
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,850
<i>Mom!</i>

507
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,510
<i>Mom, I know that I'm wrong. Open the door!</i>

508
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,350
<i>Mom!</i>

509
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,460
Why does this restaurant have to play this piece?

510
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,360
Sister Yan, what's the matter?

511
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,130
I'm fine. Here.

512
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,920
Let me toast you.

513
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:40,050
Teacher, what were you thinking when you were injured?

514
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,030
I was thinking about that pet.

515
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:49,840
Shouldn't you think of an important person?

516
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:53,200
That's my question.

517
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:59,740
It seems like I've never seen you this anxious over a person before.

518
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:05,990
<i> From time to time, the emotion will be triaged by certain people or situation.</i>

519
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:10,410
That's also en experience worth to try.

520
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,790
I tried that already.

521
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,630
I bet that that's long time ago.

522
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,110
It wasn't a good feeling.

523
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,960
Why?

524
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,120
When you miss someone, you will afraid to lose someone.

525
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,270
I don't want to be weak.

526
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:35,460
Weak is also

527
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,500
a normal emotion.

528
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,650

571
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,890
Sister Yan doesn't have her phone and no other way to attack people online.

572
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,470
Why didn't she fall for it?

573
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:38,890
Do you think it's because I sang too well?

574

Relax, that's impossible. I've never hear anything worse than you

575
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,060
Then that's good. That's mean I'm pretty good then.

576
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,600
She might not be angry, but I almost lost it.

577

Then what do we do now?

578

Master.

579
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,740
I don't think it was all a waste.

580
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,930
But we still need your help for the next part.

I-I-I ok.

583
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,470

00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,470
I came to apologize.

589
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:10,150
I didn't know that the song I rearranged this afternoon was your idol's.

590
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,890
I'm sorry.

591
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:18,120
I'm also one of their fans.

592
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,510
Like minded friends.

593
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,790
It's alright. Don't think too much about it. It's alright.

594
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,740
That's good then.

595
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,710
Then, how about I treat to you afternoon tea?

596
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,670
As a gesture of apology.

597
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,480
Ok, then I'll meet you in the cafe downstairs.

598
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,740
Alright, see you downstairs.

599
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,750
Master, do you think it'll work this time?

600
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:57,050
Zuo Yan's tolerance has been refined for so many years.

601
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:00,100
She must have more willpower than we imagined.

602
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:04,920
But the groundwork we put down before won't be wasted.

603
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,910
- Enjoy. <br> - Thanks.

Sister Yan, I specifically ordered this for you. It's a new seasonal menu.

606

You have to try it.

- T-this is? <br> - Vegetable juice.

608
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:38,790
A lot of organic vegetable

609
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:41,220
were blended together to make this mixed vegetable juice.

610
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,350
It's good for weight loss and beautification.

611
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:45,720
It's perfect for beautiful ladies to drink.

612
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:57,130
Sister Yan, you have to drink it. It's full of my apologies.

613
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:05,040
<i> A glass of vegetable juice before bed strengthens the stomach and is good for the figure. </i>

<i>You need to maintain the habits I helped you build all these years. </i>

615
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:13,720
If you don't drink it, that means you still don't forgive me.

616
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:17,850
That's not it. How could I?

617
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:20,590
Then drink it as your forgiveness.

618
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,710
<i> I didn't work so hard to nurture you for you to suffer with him. </i>

619
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:40,310
<i> In the future, you must come home before 11. </i>

620
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:44,210
<i> Whether it's alright or not, I'll help you decide. </i>

621
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:47,550
<i> I'm your mom. What can't I see? </i>

622
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:51,410
<i> - Sister Yan, you're making me look bad. <br> - Where the hell are you?</i>

623
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:54,840
I'm sorry.

624
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,850
Zuo Yan? Stop!

625
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:07,360
I've already apologized, why are you still acting cold?

626
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,800
Please shut up.

627
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,480
Wow, I couldn't tell that

628
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,340
you have two faces.

629
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,780
You were fine in front of others and now you're here telling me to shut up. What do you mean?

630
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,450
Who do you think you are? The hulk? You change when you want to?

631
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:23,160
Can you stop faking?

632
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,920
Also, what is an idol? No one can sing their songs?

633
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,070
I don't know if Counselor Lin doesn't give you enough work

634
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:32,380
or you're lacking stimulation in your daily life. You're 30 something years old

635
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:35,140
chasing idols with 18 year old, what's wrong with you?

636
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,060
Don't think I don't know what you've done online.

637
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,890
You have issues up here along with narrowness here.

638
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,690
The butterfly is about to move it's wings.

639
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:58,190
- Why is it like this? <br> - It's not over yet.

640
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,390
Keep watching.

641
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,300
Listen up, Sun Kele.

642
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,780
First, my destiny isn't the hulk, it's the black widow.

643
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,730
Let me tell you what true upbringing is.

644
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:18,710
I was polite in front of other because I disdain getting angry at them.

645
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:24,260
I know the minute I open my mouth, I'll leave them no dignity and embarrass them. But you, Sun Kele,

646
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,460
I don't feel the need to do that with you.

647
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,840
Up here, I'm 103.

648
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:32,580
Here, C+, you stupid kid.

649
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:51,260
I-I'm sorry.

650
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:55,100
You finally did it.

651
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,580
You finally learned how to accurately express your emotions.

652
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:01,130
Can I hug you?

653
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,430
Sister Yan. Sister Yan.

654
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,080
Don't change them. Zuo Yan already took a huge step.

655
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,410
Maybe Sun Kele can resolve it better than you.

656
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,620
It's not good to drink in the middle of the day, right?

657
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:40,210
Before doing anything,

658
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:43,720
you can't always think about getting other people's approval, right?

659
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:50,890
Right.

660
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:05,060
Um...I'm sorry.

661
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:09,230
No, I should be thanking you.

662
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:11,140
Thank me for what?

663
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:16,320
I'm not sure what's wrong with me these past few days. I hate everything.

664
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,860
Thank you for giving me this opportunity to release all of that.

665
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:26,640
Both of us can say we've been through it together. What are you thanking me for? Make us seem like strangers.

666
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,960
Actually, let me tell you, I almost couldn't play along any longer.

667
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,380
If you didn't let it out, I really don't know what else I should've done. You

668
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,990
- splashed water in my face — <br> - Play along?

669
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:47,050
No wonder I thought everything was so strange.

670
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,430
As if it were all coming for me.

671
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,530
No, sister.

672
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:54,140
Everyone was doing it for your benefit.

673
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,920
It's not what you think it is.

674
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,950
- W-w-we just wanted to — - Sun Kele,

675
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:10,900
thank you.

676
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,080
No, no, no. As long as you're not mad.

677
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,460
You scared me to death.

678
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,670
I-I was really scared you would kick me out when I went to find you in your room.

679
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:23,870
- Here. <br> - Give it to me.

680
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:29,320
Wait.

681
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,870
- What's going on? <br> - What are you doing? <br> - Isn't this perfect?

682
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:41,790
Trash should be with trash.

683
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:44,020
- What are you saying? <br> - Alright, alright.

684
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,440
- Don't get physical. Don't get physical, ok? <br> - Forget it, forget it.

685
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,570
- Let's not fight with them. <br> - What's your deal?

686
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:50,530
Let's go.

687
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,890
Not bad.

688
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:09,500
It's so refreshing to be able to say whatever I'm feeling.

689
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:24,100
Our first step is successful. I hope that Sister Yan can put down her hardships.

690
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,400
But I'm happy for Sister Yan.

691
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,950
Mentor, why do you think Sister Yan doesn't want to let things out to us

692
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:35,170
but would be open to a stranger like Sun Kele?

693
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:37,570
You already took a test on this.

694
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:41,120
Your second question, mini-question seven on the entrance exam.

695
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,830
Did you forget?

696
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:47,980
Rong Ge's theory on personality mask.

697
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:51,860
A personality mask refers to a person

698
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:55,190
who acts differently depending on their environment.

699
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:58,950
For example, some people are very lovely in front of their parents

700
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:04,380
but like to argue with people online. Other people are very serious in front of their colleagues,

701
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:07,800
but...

702
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,360
in love, they will become more gentle.

703
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:20,420
But when facing a stranger,

704
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:23,890
they would easily take off their mask to become themselves.

705
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:36,170
Mentor, you still care a lot about me.

706
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:40,530
Then why would you review my entrance exam questions?

707
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:42,030
It's so humid.

708
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:47,840
We’re in public. Let’s keep our distance.

709
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,100
Did you see it or not?

710
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,910
It looks so romantic.

711
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:03,540
Drink a glass of orange juice.

712
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:09,180
Can you not tell Counselor Lin about my drawing?

713
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,800
Sure.

714
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,520
But to make us even, can you give me a spoiler.

715
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:17,350
If I was an inspiration for a character,

716
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:20,090
would you arrange a CP? <br> (T/N: Couple Pairing)

717
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:24,460
I...I haven't given any thought to CP's yet.

718
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,330
Then, wouldn't I be very pitiful?

719
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:29,790
In the drawing and in reality, I am still a lone wolf.

720
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,810
How about the master of hypnosis

721
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:39,160
with a gentle girl?

722
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,400
I have a suggestion for you.

723
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:46,850
The master of hypnosis can also be with a youthful girl.

724
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:49,560
A youthful girl?

725
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,020
What do you think?

726
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,150
I- It's not

727
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:04,150
impossible.

728
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,580
Xiao Xiao.

729
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,730
Brother Xiao Qi, you just arrived?

730
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,620
I was busy before. Sorry about that.

731
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:19,710
It's okay, I understand. You're an important character here.

732
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:21,750
An important character?

733
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:24,070
They're already eating?

734
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:25,510
Not yet. We've been waiting for you.

Brother Xiao Qi, you're awake?

753
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,160
Are you okay? Rest first and I'll go call a doctor.

754
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,730
No need.

755
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,840
The doctor said you are okay for the most part,

756
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:21,120
but you have to rest up for observation.

757
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,180
- Thank you. <br> - No problem

758
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:29,140
Why did you suddenly faint?

759
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:36,940
I have a small story. Would you like to listen?

760
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:44,820
There used to be two brothers. The little brother was picky and always caused trouble.

761
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:47,120
To protect the little brother, the older brother

762
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,270
always put all the responsibility on himself.

763
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,470
<i>This...</i>

764
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:02,380
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

765
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:05,740
<i> In the older brother's eyes,</i>

766
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,640
<i> his little brother</i>

767
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,280
<i> was the most important person in his life.</i>

768
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:18,200
But the older brother was also a kid at the time.

769
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,830
- He could only hide in inside him if he got bullied. <br> <i> - Brother!</i>

770
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,710
<i>Xiao Qi!</i>

<i> - Brother! <br> - Let me go!</i>

772
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,810
<i>Every time the brother say his little brother cry,</i>

773
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,930
<i>he would also be extremely upset.</i>

774
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:43,590
After a long time, whenever the little brother hears someone crying,

775
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:46,100
he would get receive a stressful response.

776
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,380
