14
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,730
Auntie Li, this house is used as a processing center. There's very little maintenance here.

15
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,070
You don't have to worry.

16
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,940
I'm not worried. Since I rented this to you, nothing basic has changed.

17
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,680
That's why I say that good things remain great no matter where you place them.

18
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Not like some people

19
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,730
who when you know them for a long time, you still don't know their true nature.

20
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,990
Auntie, you can compare this house with a person. People have feelings.

21
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,450
We've rented this house for such a long time,

22
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,420
we've developed feelings for it. This is like a home for us.

23
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,760
- Isn't that right, Xiao Rui? <br> - Yes, yes, Auntie Li.

24
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,450
Being here is very like being in one's own home.

25
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,590
Feelings?

26
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,630
Can feelings give you food?

27
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,210
There are some people that you treat well

28
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,490
who won't feel grateful; maybe they even curse you in their hearts.

29
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,360
- How could there be such a terrible person? <br> - Auntie.

30
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,790
People are changeable; rents are like that too.

31
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,010
So, rent increases are inevitable.

32
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,910
<i> - What's wrong? <br> - Something's happened, Teacher Lin. </i>

33
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,940
<i> The landlord suddenly wants to raise the rent. </i>

34
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,170
<i> Okay. I understand. I'll be there soon. </i>

35
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,160
Good morning, Sister Li.

36
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,100
Boss Lin, you've kept me waiting a long time.

37
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,050
Sister Li, about the rent...aren't things written clearly in our contract?

38
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,540
Within 5 years, if there are no exceptional circumstances, there can't be changes in the rent.

39
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:53,010
Without exceptional reasons, both parties must discuss the changes, isn't that right?

40
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,590
For such a small matter, you didn't need to personally come visit us.

41
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,060
You could just give us a call.

42
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,680
There are some things that you have to clarify in person.

43
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,180
Auntie Li, you like tea, right?

44
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,290
This is Dragoon Well tea (famous green tea produced in Hangzhou) we recently received. Try it.

45
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,100
Green tea?

46
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,620
Never mind. Green tea is what I dislike the most.

47
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,900
Then, how about some hot water, Auntie Li?

48
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,120
Go pour some coffee for her.

49
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,740
Sister Li, why don't we go discuss the matter of the rent in the conference room?

50
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,440
Okay.

51
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,480
Sister Li, then I'll just speak frankly.

52
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,800
Is there some misunderstanding between you and Zuo Yan?

53
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,070
Since I came, you've been paying special attention to Zuo Yan.

54
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,160
In addition, I remember that your favorite was the tea Zuo Yan brewed for you.

55
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,620
Not only would you not drink it today, there was a hidden meaning in your words. (idiom: words mean more than they say)

56
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,070
Then, I won't hide this from you.

57
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,410
Look at this.

58
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,880
I originally thought that this young lady was so pretty.

59
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,120
That she was gentle and amiable.

60
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,540
So I introduced her to my nephew.

61
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,050
I can't believe that she's so two-faced.

62
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,300
Come in.

63
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,600
Auntie, I've brought you a cup of coffee.

64
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,940
Thank you.

65
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,610
Fortunately, whatever happens, my nephew talks it over with his mother.

66
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,170
Otherwise, we'd have been totally deceived.

67
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,560
Take a look at this, young lady.

68
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,930
Tell me. If you don't like someone, fine.

69
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,690
Do you have to laugh with them face to face

70
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,930
and be so sarcastic and mean behind their backs? Even blacklist them.

71
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,440
<i> My mother really loves to cook. </i>

72
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,530
<i> Every day, she researches something delicious to make. </i>

73
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,340
<i> Another day, I'll definitely invite you to the house to try her specialty dishes. </i>

74
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,730
<i> Why are they all vegetables? </i>

75
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,850
<i> Ever since I was little, I'm actually not happy without meat. </i>

76
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,250
<i> But my mom, in order to create balance in my diet, would take vegetables and make decorative patterns out of them every day. </i>

77
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,720
<i> So I ate them all the time, and gradually came to love vegetables. </i>

78
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,920
<i>Nowadays, based on what she cooks, my diet is more balanced and I don't put on weight. </i>

79
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,780
<i> Sorry, are you busy? Then, we'll talk when you're not busy. </i>

80
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,060
<i> Let me ask, what does the way your mother raised and educated you have to do with me? </i>

81
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,600
<i> Do you plan to teach me how to be a housekeeper </i>

82
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,290
<i> so that I can serve you according to your mother's standards? </i>

83
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,340
<i> Do you need me to explain the meaning of a mother's boy?</i>

84
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,050
Sister, don't get agitated.

85
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,640
Zuo Yan has worked with us here for over 3 years.

86
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,010
Her usual behavior and conversation isn't like what's on the screen here.

87
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,600
- Could there be some misunderstanding between them? <br> - Then, this...?

88
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,540
Auntie, this is totally out of bounds.

89
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,750
How can they call someone who is listens to his mother a 'mama's boy'?

90
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,070
Hey. This young lady is quite objective.

91
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,480
I'm not the kind of person who speaks up for myself.

92
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,940
That's right, Auntie. You shouldn't read this. This is certainly Zuo Yan's fault.

93
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,620
Do you see?

94
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,850
But I think, Zuo Yan didn't do this with bad intentions.

95
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,570
Because working here, it's hard to escape the negative

96
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,140
emotions of the clients who come here.

97
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,320
Over time, we can be influenced by these emotions.

98
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,940
Maybe we unconsciously vent them sometimes.

99
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,670
So, Auntie, don't worry. Zuo Yan certainly wasn't targeting your nephew.

100
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,790
I think that the best plan now is

101
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:40,030
to have your nephew put an end to this and start anew.

102
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,840
That's what I want.

103
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,680
Auntie, you can look it up online.

104
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,230
Right now, there are a lot of dating website that are great to use.

105
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,830
How would I understand those things?

106
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,560
- I know how to do it. I can help you. <br> - Will you teach me?

107
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,650
<i>-Registering is really convenient. </i> <br><i>-How do I register?</i>

108
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,330
Look. Choose this website.

109
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,260
Let's check this websites success rate. It has a high success rate.

110
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,170
Why don't you type in your number or your nephew's number to register an account first?

111
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,300
- Here? <br> - Yes, right there.

112
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,910
Yes, yes, yes. That's good. Look, Auntie.

113
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,680
This is asking for you to upload some pictures.

114
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,830
Your nephew is said to look like his uncle. Your husbad must be handsome.

115
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,710
Have your nephew upload his picture and

116
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,110
then fill in his hobbies, education, and his current occupation.

117
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,270
Auntie, you do not have to worry. Just sit at home and the ladies will rush over.

118
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,130
Young Lady, do you have a boyfriend?

119
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,860
She is still going in college. She is here for work study.

120
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,230
How old are you?

121
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,840
Auntie, I'm 18 years old this year.

122
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,990
18?

123
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,000
Such a pity.

124
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,050
- She's a bit young. <br> - Yes.

125
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,570
Auntie, the rent here...

126
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,820
That's a misunderstanding. It won't be increased.

127
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,610
Auntie, come often. I'll make coffee for you.

128
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,140
This young lady's mouth... How come I like her so much?

129
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,550
So great.

130
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,620
Don't you still have work? That document is not done. Go back to work first.

131
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,630
That's right. Auntie, I'm leaving now to get back to work.

132
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,750
When you have time, come visit often. Bye-bye, bye-bye.

133
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,650
I didn't dare believe those words are what Sister Yan said.

134
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,760
She is very gentle when she meet people.

135
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,670
It's like she has no negative emotions. There's no need to even mention blowing up on people.

136
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,850
Mentor, should I ask Sister Yan what is going on?

137
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,910
This is her private matter.

138
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,490
She has never mentioned going on blind dates to us.

139
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,710
Clearly, she doesn't want to tell us about it.

140
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,900
Perhaps she just doesn't like blind dates. That's all.

141
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,230
Even if she doesn't like blind dates, she wouldn't suddenly transform into another person, right?

142
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,690
Yes, that nephew continuously mentioning his mom would make people uncomfortable.

143
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,740
However, based on Sister Yan's personality, she shouldn't have such a big reaction.

144
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,810
Go back and read this book.

145
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,930
I already read this book when I was testing for graduate school.

146
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:20,280
Can Sister Yan's matter be analyzed according to ego, id, and superego? <br> <i>(T/N: psychoanalytical concepts by Sigmund Freud)</i>

147
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:25,910
In the office, the Sister Yan presented is her ego.

148
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:31,620
Her polar opposite side is her id.

149
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,430
Then what triggers her id?

150
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,800
Is it her disgust for mommy's boys

151
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,410
or her disgust for blind dates like these?

152
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,950
Or that Auntie Li is too friendly and irrated her?

153
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,970
Any of those are possible. Right now, what we know is

154
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,250
the landlord's nephew's screenshots.

155
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,160
We are missing pieces of information here and there so we don't have the full picture.

156
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,640
What if I gather all these things in the same place?

157
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,580
- Different types of boys, a blind dating setting, and strict rules. <br> - How so?

158
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,270
What if I host this huge dating party?

159
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,460
You have quite a immagination.

160

Mentor, you have to come participate as well.

161
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,520
I need someone there as a support.

Why don't you tell me about him?

He's all right.

177

What does "all right" mean?

178
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,130
As I have said before,

whether he is all right or not, I will help you judge that.

How far have you progressed with that boy?

181
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:36,340
Not much progress. I also don't have time. When free, we would exchange Wechat messages.

<i>Honestly, since I was a child, I always ate meat.</i>

191

<i>However, in order for me to a balanced diet and nutrients, my mom would change up how she cooks vegetables.</i>

192
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,010
<i>In the end, after a while, I slowly fell in love with vegetables.</i>

Good news and bad news. Which do you want to hear first?

- Why? <br> - You have a lot of female fans but only three male fans.

214
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,270
How would the blind dating work with a high demand and low supply?

- Then, what's the good news? <br> - I will attend.

Hello? Director Fan.

222
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,650
I took the liberty to call you

223
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,470
because I heard you want to hold a summer socializing event.

224

I wonder if there's still room among the male participants.

00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:42,550
What, Director Fan? Do you need to go on blind dates as well?

226
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,180
It is like this. Our group has an investment company.

There are many single male colleague.

<i>I initially wanted to host a similar event. </i>

But lack single female ladies.

230
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,720
Since you happen to be hosting such an event, then it would be great to kill two birds with one stone.

231
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,360

Oh, right. There's one more thing.

The first activity is a five minute casual talk.

Your education is not bad. Do you plan on further your education abroad?

I think we can talk other things rather than just education and work.

00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,760
Right.

274
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,110
It is vulgar to just talk about education.

275
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,420

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,650
-Is it broad? <br>-Yes.

308
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,960
It's alright.

309
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,060
<i>Boss is calling. If you are not picking up, boss will get angry.</i>

310
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,690
<i>Boss is calling. If you are not picking up-</i>

311
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,200
Look.

312
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,120
An interesting personality use an interesting ring tone.

313
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,910
Director Fan, I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

314
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,750
Mentor,didn't you say you are not coming.

315
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,920
How is it with Zuo Yan?

316
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:13,890
Six male participants during the one on one talk

317
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,520
picked Zuo Yan as their beloved lady. Regarding their impression on Zuo Yan, they used words like

318
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,160
gentle, modesty, and any words similar to those.

319
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,760
It's the same image of Zuo Yan that we have in our minds.

320
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,560
-Yes. <br>-So?

321
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,300
So, blind dating will not trigger Zuo Yan's other side.

322
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,680
There must be something else.

323
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,330
Hi.

324
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,250
Becareful.

325
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,160
It looks like your mentor is quite popular.

326
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,790
- Let's go. I'll help you over there to sit. Let's not disturb him. <br> - All right.

327
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,940
I like to do yoga and travel. Do you like to travel?

328
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,020
Sorry. I have other business.

329
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,140
I visit an island for vacation every year.

330
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:06,080
And do yoga while the wind is blowing. I hope to do this with my partner next time.

331
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,390
Is this a life style that you like?

332
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,710
Did you sprain you ankle?

333
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:12,460
It seems like you are not suitable for high heels.

334
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,220
How do you know that I am wearing high heels.

335
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,950
<i>High heels does not suit you.</i>

336
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,650
What is the matter?

337
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,110
Thank you for your assistance, Director Fan.

338
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:46,450
-I have a question for you. Do view us as friends? <br>-Yes

339
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,850
Since we are friends, are you just going to keeping calling me "Director Fan" in the future?

340
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:55,670
What should I call you? I can't call you Old Fan.

341
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,080
It's not that you can't.

342
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,130
What kind of girls do you like?

343
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,980
I don't like women that like to smile.

344
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,300
How about this? If you like, you could call me Brother Xiao Qi.

345
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,000
All right. Brother Xiao Qi.

346
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,350
Alright.

347
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,590
- Thank you, Brother Xiao Qi. <br> - You're welcome.

348
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,380
Here, have some cake.

349
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,000
- Thank you, Brother Xiao Qi. <br> - You're welcome.

350
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,770
<i>He was quite straightforward when rejecting me.</i>

351
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,720
<i>Now he is so natural when talking with others.</i>

352
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,660
<i>Where is she? Why did she suddenly gone?</i>

353
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:15,120
<i>Sun Kele</i>

354
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,730
<i>What are you doing over there?</i>

355
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,020
Teacher Lin, this is an important document that you need to sign in person.

356
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,790
The front desk told the delivery person that I am not there after calling,so he brought it here.

357
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,700
<i>(Hu Guang Express Delivery)</i>

358
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,990
<i>(Lawyer Letter - To Ms. Zuo Yan for her online post as "Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center - Yan Yan.")</i>

359
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,230
Sister Yan, why are you here alone?

360
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,290
Xiao Jia went to get a delivery. It's supposed to be an important document.

361
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:58,410
There is an important document that he did to sign in person.

362
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:14,610
There are wine, water, and other drinks. Why did your bring you own coffee?

363
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,600
I...I get nervous easily.

364
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,510
When I get nervous, I like to drink coffee, so I keep it with me.

365
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,730
What are you nervous about?

366
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,880
I...when I see pretty girls, I get nervous.

367
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,390
Then...is drinking coffee helpful?

368
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:42,120
It is helpful. Why don't you try.

369
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,810
It's fine. I have other.

370
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,430
Thank you.

371
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,230
How is it.

372
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,230
It taste good.

373
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
I'm sorry. I need to reply a WeChat message.

374
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,200
Not problem,Sister Yan.

375
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,800
Sister Yan, you do what you need to. I will go over there to take a look.

376
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,200
Alright.

377
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,400
You look like a messy kitten.

378
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
Here. Wipe it off.

379
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,200
Sorry to interrupt. We have a unexpected work to complete.

380
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,000
We need to leave.

381
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,500
Excuse us, Brother Xiao Qi. We will get going first.

382
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,300
Alright. Take care.

383
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,800
What did you call him?

384
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,200
Brother Xiao Qi

385
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,400
Director Fan said to not sound so formal with him at such an event.

386
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,600
Open it and take a look.

387
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,600
Sit down Sister Yan.

388
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,200
You use the center's weibo to criticize Zhang Ke Xi. He sent us a lawyer letter.

389
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,500
<i>Originally, I only had questions about the set up of the roles.</i>

390
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,100
<i>That is until I read her little essay. So then let's have the representative explain the underlying meaning.</i>

391
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,800
<i>"Criticizing the role" is "you all are targeting me." Saying "However, I won't admit defeat and will continue to work hard" </i>

392
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,400
<i>is the equivalent of "I will continue to be the female lead to hurt your eyes."</i>

393
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
<i>"I don't only want to gain views" means</i>

394
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,800
<i>"I can venture into more business deals in the future."</i>

395
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,030
Sister Yan

396
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,910
I...I forgot to log out of my account.

397
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,600
<i>Yan Yan</i>

398
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,800
<i>It is almost 11 p.m, why are you not getting ready to rest.</i>

399
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,200
When I discovered it, I immediately deleted it.

400
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,200
It should not be a huge issue.

401
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,600
The opposing party not only want you to delete the post and publicly apologize.

402
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,800
They want Shaolin to apologize also.

403
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,900
Your weibo post not only represents you, it also represents Shaolin.

404
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,000
Sorry, Teacher Lin.

405
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,700
I‘m so sorry.

406
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,600
<i>Xiao Xiao, the event on my side successful ended.</i>

407
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:36,600
<i>But there is something else. I just saw a male participant</i>

408
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,000
<i>upload his talk with Zou Yan to his friends.</i>

409
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,200
<i>Today, I met a rare contrarian.</i>

410
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,900
<i>When the event is over, we should go out and have a drink.</i>

411
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,000
<i>I know of a bar that only foreigners know.</i>

412
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,200
<i>Do you not know how to talk if you do not include a English word in our conversation?</i>

413
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,600
<i>You're so afraid that others don't know you passed CET level 4. <br> (T/N: Chinese College English Test)</i>

414
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,000
<i>These drinks that use artificial coloring.</i>

415
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,100
It is so unhealthy.

416
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,200
<i>You studied abroad to get your Ph. D and is even a published author.</i>

417
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,100
<i>So amazing. I'll applaud you like a seal slapping its fins. <br> (sarcasm)</i>

418
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,200
<i>The person my colleague is dating is someone who is at least a VIP at your company.</i>

419
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,200
<i>I have a bad habit. I only look up and not down.</i>

420
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,300
<i>You truly do not catch my attention.</i>

421
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:21,000
<i>Also, I'm very curious. You work out four times a week, yet why do you still have a beer belly?</i>

422
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,200
<i>The fitness instructor probably really likes you, right?</i>

423
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,500
<i>You get a membership and pay him every year. You can't slim down no matter what you do.</i>

424
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,000
<i>Lastly, can you stop showcasing your green submariner to me? <br> (T/N: a style of Rolex watch)</i>

425
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,900
<i>It's really about to blind my titanium eyes.</i>

426
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,700
Colleagues? Dating? VIP?

427
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,400
There's no dating.

428
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,400
I just made something up there. I didn't mean it.

429
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Starting arguments for the sake of an argument is often controversial.

430
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,500
Those who do it often aggressively counter back using their own reasonings.

431
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,600
Some do it unintentionally.

432
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,200
Sister Yan clearly knew that these actions are not right yet still can't help but do it.

433
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,300
This may be more dangerous than doing it unintentionally.

434
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
We have to think of a way to help Sister Yan.

435
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,800
Otherwise, she will have this kind of trouble in the future, too.

436
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,000
Moreover, her words and actions represent Shaolin.

437
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Right now, we need to find the reason why Zuo Yan likes to start arguments.

438
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,600
Sister Yan usually has such a good personality at work.

439
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,800
Why would she argue with people online?

440
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,400
Zuo Yan is aggressive in her online attack and unaware of that fact.

441
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,000
There is a clear difference between that and her gentle persona in the office.

442
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,800
Why would she have a habit of hiding her aggressiveness

443
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,200
in front of those she knows? That is worth exploring.

444
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,300
Then what ignited her aggressive behaviors?

445
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,800
Everything happens for a reason.

446
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,200
I have a not so mature idea. How about leaving Sister Yan's matters to me?

447
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:10,020
What do you plan to do?

448
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,600
<i>Hello, everyone. This is the Weibo of Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center's Yan Yan.</i>

449
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,400
<i>Today, because of my inappropriate remarks toward Zhang Kexi,</i>

450
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,800
<i>I have hurt his reputation. I would like to express my apology.</i>

451
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,600
<i>In addition, I would like to reiterate that my words and actions</i>

452
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,200
<i>have nothing to do with Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center.</i>

453
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,800
<i>As the same time, as a member of the counseling center,</i>

454
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,200
<i>I would like to sincerely apologize to the colleagues who have been</i>

455
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,400
<i>hurt and casted skepticism on.</i>

456
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,800
<i>In the future, I will pay extra attention to my words and actions.</i>

457
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,800
<i>How can I find all of Sister Yan's online posts?</i>

458
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,600
<i>Kele, help me investigate Sister Yan's other account.</i>

459
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,100
No. I refuse to investigate Zuo Yan's other account.

460
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,800
<i>I'm a dignified man.</i>

461
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,800
I won't do such a thing to invade a beautiful lady's privacy. Don't even think about it.

462
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,400
I'm not trying to invade her privacy. I just want to know what she has said.

463
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,800
That way I can find out how to undo the knot in her heart.

464
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,000
Then what are you trying to do?

465
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,600
I want...

466
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,000
to gain a deep understanding of how a contrarian starts an argument so I can start one with Zuo Yan.

467
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,600
<i>A record of Zuo Yan's other account as a contrarian?</i>

468
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,200
Never mind, Sun Kele. Someone already did your job.

469
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,400
<i>(Lin Shen)</i>

470
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,600
Mentor, how did you find Sister Yan's smurf account?

471
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,200
Why do you always think the same as I?

472
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,400
<i>Zuo Yan's other account is not hard to find.</i>

473
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,800
<i>The main focus is the posts from that account.</i>

474
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,600
<i>Before you read them, be mentally prepared.</i>

475
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,000
Come in.

476
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,700
Mentor, I printed Sister Yan's posts that mocking people.

477
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,000
Are there any others?

478
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,800
Sister Yan's other account has not mocked people in days now. She must have switched to another account.

479
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,200
- And? <br> - I want you to help me analyze context hidden behind these.

480
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,600
Looking at her smurf account,

481
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,400
she registered the account at least six or seven years ago.

482
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,600
These posts mocking people is the pit of fire inside her.

483
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,400
It's like a dormant volcano. It will eventually explode.

484
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,000
Then, this pit of fire should be her subconscious id.

485
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,400
Id, ego, superego.

486
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,600
The interaction of these three will determine a person's action in the end.

487
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,000
When id and superego are in conflict and create anxiety,

488
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,600
people will think of ways to protect themselves. That is their defense mechanism.

489
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,400
Then why would Sister Yan use starting arguments as a defense mechanism?

490
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,600
There are three mechanisms similar to arguing.

491
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,600
Projection, rationalization, and displacement.

492
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,500
Projection is very simple. I want it but I won't say that. I will say that you want it.

493
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,200
Rationalization is when you say that the grape you can't get is sour.

494
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,300
Displacement is when I'm angry I will take it out on something else.

495
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,400
I had Kele do a word frequency report on Sister Yan's posts.

496
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,000
I found that the keywords that usually trigger Sister Yan to start arguments include

497
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,200
"not possible," "should," "must," words that express a command.

498
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
- Come in. <br> - Counselor Lin.

499
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,400
- Xiao Xiao. <br> - Hello.

500
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,200
Counselor Lin, there's a visitor who wants to be counseled by you. This is the person's information.

501
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,500
All right.

502
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,010
<i>(Id, ego, superego; contrarian)</i>

503
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,300
- Sister Yan, we are not... <br> - Are you two analyzing me?

504
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:12,600
It's fine. I think your thoughts are quite interesting.

505
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:17,200
We think you should be more concerned about it.

506
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,400
Thank you for your concerns. I'm fine.

507
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,000
However, I hope that Counselor Lin and my colleagues

508
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,600
won't be overly concerned about my private matters.

509
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,500
I will get back to work now.

510
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,400
Did you hear?

511
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,500
She was saying that you are being a busybody.

512
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,400
Looks like we can really trigger her.

513
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,600
Besides, in my memory, Sister Yan's has never used this kind of attitude toward you before.

514
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,450
What's wrong?

515
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:06,150
What are you two up to, always being so mysterious?

516
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:12,170
- What's wrong? <br> - There's a wedding. Represent Shaolin and go visit.

517
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:15,990
I have a visitor coming that day so I won't have time. I already arranged the money.

518
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,360
Yu Yang?

519
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,840
Isn't this Zuo Yan's ex-boyfriend?

520
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,080
To be more accurate, in Yu Yang's words,

521
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,340
they were only classmates.

522
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,030
Were they together then? What does this man do?

523
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,640
The groom is our work partner.

524
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,830
He mainly helps with EAP. <br> <i> (T/N: Employee Assistance Program)</i>

525
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:41,030
When Sister Yan first came to the company, he basically introduced her here.

526
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,760
I'll leave it to you.

527
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:52,190
<i> I'm going to get married. You are welcome to come to my wedding.</i>

528
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:03,120
<i> (Wedding Invitation)</i>

529
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,770
Thank you.

530
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,340
Is it because of Yu Yang?

531
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,060
I can't hide anything from you.

532
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:19,930
I've always been a good listener.

533
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,650
Hello guys.

534
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:47,750
I didn't know you knew how to make cocktails.

535
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:52,840
When I first made my public account, I often invited my friends here to get inspiration.

536
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,190
After coming here for a while, I learned a little. Let me tell you,

537
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,670
making cocktails is a form of art, too.

538
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:02,190
Whoever's sitting in front of you and what kind of drink you have to make,

539
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,570
like today. The wonderful Miss Zuo,

540
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:09,100
what kind of drink would you like? Pick one.

541
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:14,210
I'll pick this one. I'll leave this one for you.

542
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:17,250
This drink is called "Passionate Kiss".

543
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:21,670
It has a mix of the sweet and sour taste of wild berry champagne, the bitterness of bitter melon,

544
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:25,410
and the concentration of vodka will make you feel your own heartbeat.

545
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:29,120
Just like your love. Within your heart,

546
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,970
it contains a little sour from a lemon.

547
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:45,630
You are really a good friend.

548
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:47,470
Give it a try.

549
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,220
How is it?

550
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,960
It's good.

551
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,830
<i> Where are you?</i>

552
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:03,920
<i> I'm with Sister Yan.</i>

553
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,270
Did you know what my mom would say?

554
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:17,190
"Yan Yan, you can't drink drinks that contain pigments, especially alcohol.

555
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:20,180
It's nothing like what a lady should do."

556
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:29,490
Let me show you a picture.

557
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:41,120
- Is this... Yu Yang? <br>- This was back when we

558
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,320
were in the same club and we cut it out from the group photo.

559
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:47,370
Wasn't I very stupid?

560
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:51,560
Sister Yan, pretend like I'm your

561
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,060
emotional trash can. You can tell me whatever you want.

562
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,160
After we walk out of this bar,

563
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,910
you can continue being the indestructible Sister Yan.

564
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,990
Come. Cheers.

565
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,060
Cheers.

566
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,240
<i> What kind of condition is this?</i>

567
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,060
<i> You even like him back.</i>

568
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:24,120
<i> The person I want you to marry don't have to be handsome or rich.</i>

569
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,420
<i> But they can't have worse conditions than you.</i>

570
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,760
<i> I raised you till now, I don't want you to go live in hardship with him.</i>

571
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,360
<i> In the future, don't contact anyone like this.</i>

572
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,960
<i> Mom.</i>

573
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:45,050
<i> (Yang) <br> (I already have a boyfriend. Let's stop contacting each other.)</i>

574
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:49,470
<i> Mom will help you delete him.</i>

575
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:52,070
<i> (Delete)</i>

576
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:09,470
Yu Yang graduated from a regular college.

577
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:13,980
In my mom's eyes, he doesn't have good education or a citizenship.

578
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,200
So in the future, he won't have a good future.

579
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,450
She thinks that being with a man like that is a huge mistake.

580
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:23,900
But he's the first person I liked.

581
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:31,980
Did you know? Yu Yang is really a good person.

582
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,760
His bride must be very happy.

583
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:41,010
Sister Yan, at the time, why didn't you fight harder?

584
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:44,820
You have good taste. Yu Yang is doing very well in his job.

585
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:48,960
It's Auntie's fault, her opinion was too subjective and one-sided.

586
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,400
How would I fight harder? Do you know what kind of person my mom is?

587
00:48:56,090 --> 00:49:00,740
When I was younger, I was never allowed to have any negative thought.

588
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,510
My mom's colleague's child stole my toy.

589
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,190
She only wanted me to be generous.

590
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:11,330
I needed to look like I was educated.

591
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:13,090
But I was so young at the time.

592
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:17,520
Why did other children get to be a child and I had to be an adult?

593
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,260
In my point of view, this wasn't being educated.

594
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:24,300
This was oppressive and fake.

595
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:30,330
In my family, more accurately, in my mother's side of the family,

596
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,600
there's a huge word that says "bear". <br> <i> (Bear)</i>

597
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,100
This word is like a knife always

598
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,460
hanging at my neck. It reminds me nonstop

599
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:45,000
that I have to bear it, no matter how unhappy I am with my mom.

600
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Because she is my mother. Just because she is my mom,

601
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,530
my other half has to call her mom too.

602
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,900
So you chose to be completely free

603
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,180
online?

604
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:11,020
In reality, I can only escape,

605
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,680
but online, no one knows me.

606
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,060
Online, I can

607
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:21,250
do anything, even express myself.

608
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,180
This...

609
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:26,600
This could be a way for me to vent.

610
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:59,420
Sister Yan, have you ever thought if Auntie never held you back,

611
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,580
what kind of ending you would have had with Yu Yang?

612
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:05,610
I have.

613
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,020
If it wasn't for my mom,

614
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:16,280
we might have married after we graduated.

615
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,260
Had children,

616
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,240
happily

617
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,790
living our lives.

618
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:31,970
Sister Yan, if you lived your lives together in your imagination,

619
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:35,070
and that feeling was wholehearted,

620
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:36,760
and not forced,

621
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,010
would you think that not forgetting Yu Yang

622
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:44,070
is actually a sort of forbidden effect?

623
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:49,970
Are you trying to say if one is forced to forget someone, it would be harder to forget them?

624
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:57,030
What you said is correct.

625
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:01,510
Maybe I have no way to let it go, not because of Yu Yang,

626
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,080
but because of my mom's restrictions so I lost love?

627
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:15,330
Hey Max? May I get a Singapore Siling and a Pink Lady?

628
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:16,870
Sure.

629
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,830
Thank you.

630
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:29,200
The wonderful Miss Zuo, please pick your drink.

631
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,790
I'll pick this one.

632
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,650
This one is called Singapore Siling.

633
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:41,140
In 1915, in the period where women aren't allowed to drink alcohol,

634
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:44,980
a bartender specially made this kind of color

635
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:47,100
that is similar to juice.

636
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:51,620
But you chose this one, a wine that breaks bonds.

637
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,860
A wine that breaks bonds?

638
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,660
How about this one?

639
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:02,320
This one is called Pink Lady.

640
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,780
Pink represents love.

641
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:09,600
Then... it means your love is coming?

642
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:14,150
Actually, this one is for you too.

643
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:18,720
Sister Yan,

644
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:24,840
in the future, no matter what happens, you can tell me. Okay?

645
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:30,510
But you know that some things can't change overnight.

646
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:36,150
I'll just accompany you and change little by little.

647
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:43,090
Then tonight, I'll let you borrow my love luck.

648
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:45,610
Okay. I won't refuse love.

649
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:47,970
- Cheers. <br> - Cheers!

650
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,070
- Why did you drink so much? <br>- I'm fine.

651
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,350
- Slowly, careful. <br>- I can do it.

652
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:07,440
Watch where you are walking. Let me help you.

653
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,510
Sister Yan, next time let's drink together again.

654
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:11,680
- All right. <br>- Okay, of course.

655
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,890
If you can tell me if you have any problems.

656
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:16,880
All right. Okay, I will.

657
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,880
Are you here to pick up Xiao Xiao, Counselor Lin?

658
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,270
- Oh, it hurts. <br>- Why did she drink so much?

659
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:22,750
She probably drink too fast.

660
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:25,400
The taxi I called is here. Let's go.

661
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,850
<i>(Mom)</i>

662
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,560
Counselor Lin, can I trouble you to take Xiao Xiao home?

663
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,450
No need, I can go back myself. I really can.

664
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:36,580
- Let me know once you've taken her home. <br> - All right.

665
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:39,540
Then send me the picture of the car license plate. Okay?

666
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,050
All right, don't worry.

667
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:43,780
Don't worry. Be safe on your way.

668
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,900
- Be good, okay? <br>- Bye-bye.

669
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,030
How much did you drink?

670
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,310
Aren't you drunk?

671
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,180
You can walk properly if you are not drunk, all right?

672
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:58,170
You... Y-you shouldn't be too close to me.

673
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,950
If I am not close to you, you going to fall into the water here.

674
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:05,030
This is too dangerious.

675
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:06,530
That's good that you know it's dangerous.

676
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:09,950
No, what I'm saying is...

677
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:15,750
You are very dangerous.

<i>The door is unlocked. Please push down on the handle.</i>

684
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,350
Do you know what time it is?

685
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:54,580
You didn't even answer your phone.

686
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:57,880
You haven't gone to bed yet? You scared me to death.

687
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:02,270
How can I asleep when you haven't returned?

688
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:05,210
I was chatting with my colleagues and forgot to check my phone.

689
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:07,790
Colleague? Woman or man?

690
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:10,760
- Woman. <br> - What's her name?

691
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:14,660
- Xiao Xiao. <br> - I've never heard you mention her before.

692
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,820
She is the new special assistant at the company.

693
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,880
All right, all right.

694
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,120
From now on, you can't come home after 11 p.m. Do you hear me?

695
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,860
I got it.

696
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,410
Drink this before going to bed.

697
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:30,890
Mom, I'm too full.

698
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:34,870
Before bed, drink a cup of vegetable juice. It will help keep your stomach healthy and keep you fit.

699
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:38,870
You have to continue the habit that I have worked hard to instill in you.

700
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,330
By the way, did you participate in some kind of fellowship?

701
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:06,380
Did you meet any boys?

702
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:10,040
You can't just play around with your colleagues all the time.

703
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,010
Mom, how would you know that?

704
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:16,070
I was cleaning your purse and saw the invitation.

705
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:20,070
Mom, how old am I already? Yet you are still looking through my purse?

706
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:22,300
I'm your mom!

707
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,890
What is there of yours that I can't see?

708
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:27,770
For your little diary you had when you were young,

709
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,260
I was the one to remember your passcode for it.

710
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,620
Hurry and drink it. Go to bed after.

711
