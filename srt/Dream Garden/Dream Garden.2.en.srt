Can you take a close look? Is it really not fixable?

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The hardware is broken and not worth fixing.

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,400
It's better to buy a new one. It's too expensive to repair.

<i> In reality, it strikes me really hard.</i>

00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,600

But I can't prove that the recorder is his.

Okay! Okay!

123
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,400
No way, that's too expensive.

124
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
This is already the lowest price on the internet.

131
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,200
That's right, it's uploaded.

132
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,600
Right, right.

133
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,000
Okay then, thank you.

134
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
Oh right,

135
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,800
Don't forget to transfer the fees to us on time.

136

Thank you, thank you.

137
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
It's really uploaded.

138
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,800

142
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,200
How did you do it?

143
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,500
Your older sister left behind few charters.

144
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,820
I learned drawing before and understand her style.

145
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,200
Based on my basic knowledge, I touched up all the minor details.

146
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,400
Amazing.

147
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,000
You uploaded the webtoon and created the illusion of my older sister's return.

148
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,400
Will she really appear?

149
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,100
Right now, everything is up in the air.

150
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,800
But she's for sure with someone she's very close to.

151
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,200
Your sister's disappearance definitely has something to do with that person.

152
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,600
Then if this person knows my sister, won't they know our family address?

153
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,790
Let's do this. I'll go home and you guys wait here for her.

154
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,000
We can wait separately.

155
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,440
Teacher Lin, I didn't get the chance ask you.

156

Why are you here?

157
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:59,430
I was at the window and saw a weird person following you so I was worried something would happen to you.

158
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,630
I didn't give it any further thought and just went to find you.

159
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,800
So you were taking care of me.

160
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,400
I was taking care of my employee.

161
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,070
Still, I have to thank you.

162
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,960
Here, try this.

163
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,510
I'm not hungry. Thanks.

164
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:20,090
Of all the hot pot restaurants, this is the place Yan Luo and I like the best.

165
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,080
Teacher Lin, can I ask you a question?

166
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,670
What is it?

167
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,710
When did Yan Luo start going to you for counseling.

168
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,450
- As a psych <br> -I know as a psychologist

169
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,510
you have to keep confidentiality about your clients,

170
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,970
but you know I'm asking to find Yan Luo.

171
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,700
Can't you tell me just a little within the bounds off what you can say?

172
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,260
After Yan Luo disappeared, I've blamed myself.

173
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,350
As her best friend,

174
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,190
I didn't even know she was getting counseling

175
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:01,580
I don't know W's existence. When she was at her lowest, I didn't help her at all.

176
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,550
Most people when facing stress from their jobs or personal lives

177
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,890
will have emotional problems big or small.

178
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,850
Those who come for counseling

179
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,860
usually don't want to tell others especially those close to them.

180
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,960
If Yan Luo didn't tell you about W

181
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,620
or that she came to me for counseling,

182
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,560
it might be because you are the closest person to him.

183
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,090
I think you helped her.

184
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,600
-Really? <br> -For her to have

185
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,040
you, a friend as bright as the sun, is a sort of happiness.

186
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,830
I think you can bring her laughter and positivity

187
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,520
even if you talk a lot.

188
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,690
Your conversation can bring brings to her life

189
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,630
something special.

190
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,290
You're complimenting me, right?

191
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,300
I just don't want you to blame yourself too much.

192
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,010
Let's talk about something you can discuss. Like, does hypnosis really work?

193
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:17,460
Even though I tried it before, I still don't think it makes sense.

194
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,400
Hypnosis can open the door between conscious and subconscious mind.

195
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,920
To delve into your deeper desires, traumas, and memories.

196
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,690
As long as the client is willing to work with the hypnotist,

197
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,340
then they can continuously explore these.

198
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,790
The problem is not the focus but rather how to solve the problem is the focus.

199
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,610
I feel like our jobs are pretty similar.

200
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:44,070
We're the emotion trash can for other people, turning negative emotions into positive ones.

201
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,310
-You've finished asking your question?<br>-Yes.

202
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:53,440
Then let me ask you. How did you become an emotional blogger?

203
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,700
This. It started in college.

204
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,900
In college, I entered the broadcasting station by chance.

205
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,330
I hosted a female thoughts program.

206
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,930
Welcome to the female thoughts program. I'm your host, Xiao Xiao.

207
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,990
I'm about to go on a first date with him, but I'm very nervous.

208
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,680
Recently, I've been in a bad state because of puling all-nighters. I even got pimples.

209
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,100
Should I just reschedule?

210
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,100
The first date is unavoidable.

211
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,570
If you back up now,

212
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:30,060
then your date might think you don't like him and are rejecting him.

213
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,120
All you got was a small pimple.

214
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,370
Someone who really likes you won't care.

215
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,470
-Quickly, put on make up and go. <br> -I heard my boyfriend is pursuing another girl.

216
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,680
I'm just his back-up. I love him,

217
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,240
but I don't know how to go on.

218
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,240
The most important thing in a relationship is to avoid damage. A long heartache is worse than a short heartache.

219
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,420
You need a good car, and he's just a bad one.

220
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,920
Only bad cars need a backup tire. <br> - <i>When I see them listen to my small suggestions</i>

221
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,610
<i>To learn during relationships and grow from it makes me feel satisfied as well.</i>

222
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,460
<i>I hope to continue providing a platform where everyone can voice their problems freely.</i>

223
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:07,780
<i>So I created a public account, Xiao Beibei. Starting from the alumni group, </i>

224
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:12,720
<i>I've slowly gained fans amongst the young women population.</i>

225
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,580
Can I ask you another question?

226
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,130
We're behind on electricity payments...I forgot to pay...

227
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,690
Go find the payment slip. What are you sitting around for?

228
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,240
T-Then can you look around the table?

229
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,800
C-Check if it's here.

230
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,840
The password is wrong. Please return your password.

231
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:18,000
The password is wrong. Please return your password.

232
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,460
0, 2. Unlocked.

233
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,060
Luo luo.

234
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,140
Luo luo.

235
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,810
You're finally back.

236
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,360
What are you doing? Stay there.

237
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,310
Quickly, chase him.

238
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,850
<i>Police</i>

239
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,780
When did the intruder arrive?

240
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,240
We uploaded a comic. He came after awhile. It was about...

241
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,510
It took 1 hour and 15 minutes.

242
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,150
He also wore a cap.

243
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,000
Baseball cap. Dark blue.

244
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,910
-He had a piercing on the back.<br>-He ran really quickly and was very tall.

245
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,610
Roughly 1.9 meters.

246
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,860
His clothes seemed to have a picture.

247
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,150
-It's like this... <br> -A line on top of the letters KC.

248
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,090
I check it previously. Give me a second.

249
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,950
It shuold be this company.

250
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,980
I never thought you would remember this much. This information will help us a lot to find the cuplrit.

251
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,140
-We'll prepare for his portrait to be drawn immediately.<br>-Ok.

252
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,610
<i>The bus to Yellow Sand Harbor Village stop leaves in 15 minutes.</i>

253
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:07,410
<i>Please check in and board the bus.</i>

254
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:18,070
Found him. He's Yan Luo's ex-boyfriend, Wang Fu.

255
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,480
We checked Yan Luo's phone records and discovered that he contact her frequently,

256
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,650
so we questioned him. According to him,

257
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,020
they broke up 2 weeks ago. Yan Luo also blocked him

258
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,540
so he's been unable to reach her.

259
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,640
But we found

260
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,800
that Wang Su just bought a ticket to Yellow Sand Harbor Village.

261
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,740
Yellow Sand Harbor Village...

262
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,030
The guesthouse Yan Luo often visits to collect folksongs is there.

263
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,800
Yan Luo likely went there to hide from Wang Su.

264
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:50,040
But there's two buses heading to Yellow Sand Harbor Village. One at 11 AM in the morning and the other at 5 PM in the afternoon.

265
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,530
I'll immediately have the closest police force head towards Green Vine Bus Station.

266
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,320
The next bus will leave in 10 minutes.

267
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,380
We still have time.

268
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,940
-Yan Luo, it's me!<br>-Xiao Xiao?

269
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
Here, drink some water.

270
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,390
Thank you.

271
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,200
-Come in. <br> - Hello. <br> -Hello.

272
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,550
May I ask if you are done with recording?

273
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,510
We finished. We understand the situation with Wang Fu.

274
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,430
We'll educate and punish him afterwards.

275
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,630
Ok, thank you.

276
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,440
Your welcome.

277
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,580
How did you catch him?

278
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,400
Hello. Can I check your ID?

279
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,500
Hey, wait a second.

280
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,530
Two tickets in the return direction.

281
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,630
Did you buy it for Yan Luo?

282
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,940
I hope you can cooperate with us.

283
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,400
If you know Yan Luo's whereabouts, please tell us.

284
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,250
Her family and friends are worried for her.

285
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,210
Let me check the phone.

286
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,870
I really don't know what program he downloaded on my phone.

287
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,850
As long as I turned it on, he was able to find my location.

288
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,120
Just like today, I was hoping that he wouldn't be able to, and

289
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,300
I opened it for les than 5 seconds, and he found me.

290
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:11,250
I was afraid to contact anyone over this period of time.

291
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,890
I thought I'd come to the guesthouse to hide for awhile.

292
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,890
Maybe once he calms then, it will get better.

293
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,180
The more you avoid him

294
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,630
-the worse it'll become.<br>-Dr. Lin, where did you go?

295
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,430
I didn't see you.

296
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,510
I went to look for Wang Su.

297
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:32,160
Dr. Lin, don't you think Wang Su's controlling behavior is almost psychotic now?

298
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,270
Shouldn't he also go to counseling?

299
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:42,040
If a person refuses to go to counseling, nobody can force them.

300
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:48,200
But, he just agreed.

301
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,290
Teacher Lin, can you help me.

302
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:03,170
I also know I did the wrong thing. I don't want to hurt Luo Luo.

303
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,120
I can't control myself.

304
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,670
I don't know what's wrong with me recently.

305
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:12,150
Teacher Lin, can you help me?

306
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,800
Teacher Lin

307
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,400
we will depend on you from here on.

308
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,960
Thank you.

309
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,390
After our professional psychological evaluation, you do not have any psychological illness or mental blockage.

310
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,460
You can undergo psychological consultation.

311
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,750
<i> His hearing is so sensitive, he can even hear the ringtone outside the door.</i>

312
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,960
In the last few days, you haven't rest much, have you?

313
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,550
How about this? You go take a nap,

314
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,590
we will catch up again after you wake up.

315
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,810
Okay.

316
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,440
<i> There are lots of types of ringtones.</i>

317
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,590
<i> But you are more sensitive to few particular.</i>

318
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,020
<i> First, take a deep breath.</i>

319
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,960
<i> I'm sorry, I left my phone here.</i>

320

<i> The phone has been raining and woke you up.</i>

00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,660
<i> Who are you sending messages to?</i>

322

<i> Editor. He is urging me to submit my drawings.</i>

323

<i> You lie to me.</i>

324

<i> Every time when your editor asked for your drawings, you looked upset. </i>

<i> Show me your cell phone.</i>

327

<i> Give me your cell phone. Give it to me!</i>

328
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,940
<i> Stop there!</i>

329
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,550
<i> Come back here!</i>

330
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,340
<i> Where is she going? Have to find her.</i>

331
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,010
<i> Wei Wei?</i>

00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,380

<i>(Wei Wei)</i>

335
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,190
What is the number

336
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,370
<i>How come you are afraid of contacting this person?</i>

337
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,090
<i>You must really want to contact her. Who is she?</i>

338
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:24,220
<i>This dress is to expensive. I used up credit card limit.</i>

339

<i> It's fine. I will send you some money. Do not worry.</i>

<i>Dear, the bag that my best friend bought is super pretty. I want one too.</i>

<i>Okay. I will buy you a better one.</i>

342

<i>Dear, will you be back tonight?</i>

343
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,100
<i>I can not. I have to work over time to make money.</i>

344
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,710
<i>If not where would I get money to buy you purses.</i>

345

<i> When I earn enough money, I will buy you a car.</i>

348
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,470
<i>Let us break up. I fell in love with someone else.<i></i></i>

00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,670
<i>We been together for such a long time. Can you not leave me?</i>

<i>Wei Wei, answer the phone.</i>

00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,380
Wei Wei is your ex-girlfriend?

358
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,030
<i> If you are willing, Wei Wei will can appear right infront of you.</i>

359
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,990
<i>She is still wearing that skirt?</i>

360
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,300
<i> What do you want her to say to you?</i>

361
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,810
Sorry.

362
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:09,800
<i>Actually, you have a inner strength that you did not even realize.</i>

363
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,920
<i>These strength can help you.</i>

364
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,820
<i>Say good bye to your first love.</i>

365
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,820
<i> And resolve it.</i>

366
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:38,480
Teacher Lin, you said that Wang Su is a control freak in his relationships.

367
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,160
Is it just because of the beyrayal from the first love?

368
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,640
In a relationship, a sign of

369
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,000
strong desire of control can be consider a lack of personality.

370
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,340
The deep reason for insecurity in intimacy in relationship is due to attachment problems.

371
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,460
It is different than other couples who break up due to personality conflicts.

372
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,400
The betrayal from a first love

373
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,370
to Wang Su is enexpected

374
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,100
and without a sign.

375
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,920
That's also to say, for subsequent romantic loves,

376
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,760
regarding uncertain matters, Wang Su

377
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,440
will develop hostilities.

378
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,280
He will panic, treat everyone as enemies and transfer the inferiority complex of his first girlfriend to everyone?

379
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,000
Yes. His distrust of others

380
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,760
is a distrust of himself.

381
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,190
-And. <br>-And what?

382
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:28,180
-Do not forget you promise. <br>-What promise?

383
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,930
I want to meet Yan Luo.

384
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,770
Yan Luo might not want to see you right now.

385
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,180
Tell her that I am sorry.

386
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,730
I should not transfer those hate to her.

387
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:01,710
Thank you and Teacher Lin for unlocking the lock that is in my heart.

388
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,630
I resolved it with her when I was hypnotised.

389
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,250
I should let it go.

390
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,830
The betrayal from a first love to you is hard to accept and is unexpected.

391
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:16,430
And the reason for your strong reaction is the attachment problem within your heart.

392
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:21,070
Whether this preoccupation can be resolved or not, it's really not too late.

393
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,990
Thank you.

394
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,490
<i> Thank you for providing Wang Su's psychological assessment.</i>

395
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:31,280
<i> He didn't violated the law and the plaintiff understood the situation. </i>

396
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,560
<i> He will be fine after dissolving the charge at the policy station.</i>

397
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,620
<i>Alright. Thank you.</i>

398
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,370
<i>Is Wang Su's case finish?</i>

399
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,950
Let us go.

400
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,380
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

401
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,930
I am fine.

402
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,380
You drive the car back. I will take the subway.

403
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,040
You are still not able to take a car?

404
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,460
I am your partner for many years. And is your senior and friend.

<i>It is so nice right?</i>

410
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,840
<i>Who are you talking to that make you so happy?</i>

411
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,830
<i>Who is this man?</i>

<i>-This is my...<br>-Did I not tell you to delete all men contact information? Who is this?</i>

<i>You will not turn into your current state.</i>

416

<i>Now that I look back, the things that I have done.</i>

417
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,670
<i>I really regret it.</i>

418

<i>After a truma, it is not that you do not believe in love.</i>

419
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,090
<i>It is that you do not believe you can fall in love again.</i>

420
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,300
<i>We all forgot that the sense of security in a relationship.</i>

421
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,630
<i>Comes from believing in yourself and believing in the other person.</i>

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Yes.

477
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:21,000
So, do you...

478
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,400
So when are you quiting?

479
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,200
Lin Shen, you're tricking me?

480
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,800
Didn't you trick me before?

481
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,000
This time I tricked you. We're even.

482
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,200
Horus' eye...

483
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,000
<i>(Letter of Resignation)</i>

484
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,600
Don't you want to fire me?

485
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,800
If you help me find W, I'll take the initiative and resign.

486
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,200
Don't forget your promise.

487
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,000
Isn't this what you wanted?

488
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,600
If it wasn't for Yan Luo, we wouldn't never crossed paths.

489
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,200
Then we'll see each other around, Dr. Lin.

490
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,000
Where did such an oddball come from?

491
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,600
Come in.

492
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,200
Teacher Lin, your next client is almost here.

493
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,500
Ok.

494
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,800
Zuo Yan.

495
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,800
Help me clear up the flower and grass in this office.

496
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,200
Isn't this all what Xiao Xiao has raised? They look great. Throwing them out would be such a pity.

497
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,300
Clean it up.

498
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,700
Ok.

499
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,700
Driver, I'm waiting for you by the road.

500
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,000
Ok.

501
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,400
<i> They don't even want such nice succulents. </i>

502
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,230
You got someone to thrown them out.

503
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,000
The construction of this path is under heavy attention.

504
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,600
The current subway used in Green Vine City

505
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,600
has only two lines, yet the population within Green Vine City

506
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:17,000
has already reached approximately 4,000,000 in 2017 already.

507
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
With the current subway lines,

508
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,600
cannot support people's everyday transportation.

509
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,100
The construction of the third subway line

510
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:30,000
will allow for better transportation of 6,000,000 people within the city.

511
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,200
The third line is about to be complete.

512
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,400
The construction of the third subway line took 5 years.

513
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,800
It has finally reached completion.

514
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000

00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,400
Lin Shen.

519
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,000
Knock.

520
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,200
It's Teacher Lin.

521
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,600
Teacher Lin.

522
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,800
What do you need?

523
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,600
I thought the weather was nice, so I'm giving the succulent some sunshine.

524
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,400
Or else it'll die of suffocation with you.

525
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,400
Why does the office need so many succulents?

526
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,700
They're easy to grow, and they're so cute? See? Nice and plump

527
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,200
and it can purify the air.

528
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,800
More importantly, it's cheap.

529
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,200
Why do you even like taking shortcuts with growing plants?

530
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,200
Take shortcuts?

531
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,900
Pass me that pot.

532
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,400
That one.

533
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,600
Thank you.

534
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,800
Just like you...with your minimal knowledge of subtle expressions,

535
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,400
you'd actually go on TV as some relationship advisor.

536
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,200
Let me tell you, pyschology is not like taking care of plants.

537
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,600
People's thoughts are a mysterious garden.

538
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,000
How can you determine what sort of person the owner of this garden is through subtle expressions?

539
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Good morning, Teacher LIn.

540
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,000
Oh...

541
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Did you need something?

542
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,800
Yes.

543
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:13,000
Uh...go find Ms. Zheng's file from yesterday.

544
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,600
And hurry.

545
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Isn't the case right here on the side?

546
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,800
Let's look at the newest episode of Heartbeat.

547
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,600
First, we want to welcome back these two to our Heartbeat program.

548
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,800
To be honest, many people do not view your relationship in an optimistic light.

549
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,400
However, we've come across a surprising outcome today. The both of you have once again returned to our program together.

550
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,600
So we want to ask, why you made the decision

551
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,600
to stay together?

552
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,600
I think it's a habit.

553
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,800
I'm used to living together after so many years.

554
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,800
We also have feelings for each other.

555
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,800
In the time apart, we were both struggling.

556
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,400
So, he came to look for me.

557
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,400
We want to say

558
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,000
that we want to try again to see if there will be good results.

559
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,200
Welcome back everyone who is watching. Hello.

560
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:42,800
You are watching Heartbeat. I am everyone's old friend, Qing Che.

561
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,800
Everyone has just finished viewing the interview above.

562
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:50,000
I believe everyone is quite familiar with the two interviewees in the video.

563
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,770
In our last episode,

564
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:54,800
our guest Xiao Beibei has once again guessed this result,

565
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,000
but unfortunately she has left our program.

566
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,400
Even our professional psychologist,

567
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,400
Lin Shen, guessed that these two had already broken up.

568
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,630
Then it seems psychologists

569
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:09,400
can't understand love either.

570
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:14,600
As for whether our lovebirds' relationship can reach a fulfilling end,

571
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,500
we'll have to ask-

572
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,400
<i>Good morning, Teacher Lin.</i>

573
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,000
<i>Teacher Lin, here's your coffee.</i>

574
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,800
<i>Teacher Lin. Teacher Lin.</i>

575
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,600
<i>)Xiao Bei...cancel...delete?)</i>

576
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,400
<i>(Add this person to blacklist)</i>

577
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,800
Teacher Lin, here's your coffee.

578
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,700
Leave it here.

579
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Teacher Lin, are you okay?

580
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,400
I'm okay?

581
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,590
Hello. I'm today's interviewer, Yin Yin.

582
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:28,590
Right now, I'm at Zhou Ran's fanmeeting venue.

583
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:33,120
The fans are very passionate, and the atmosphere is very lively.

584
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:43,340
Hey, Teacher Lin, I heard Yan say you don't really want my succulent.

585
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:47,080
Then I can go pick it up today. I'll take my succulent away with me.

586
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,830
Is that okay?

587
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,240
This Lin Shen deleted my WeChat!

588
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,250
<i>Xiao Jia delivered the wrong coffee again.</i>

589
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:08,090
Only you can drink a coffee this sweet.

590
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:13,090
I have a question. How do you

591
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:16,110
add subtly add back a deleted WeChat contact?

592
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:18,340
Can't you just add it back?

593
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:21,440
Secretly add it back.

594
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,780
Why did you delete someone's WeChat?

595
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:28,990
I was browsing my friend moment and thought it was a seller.

596
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,390
I'm asking you. Is there a way?

597
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:37,570
There is. It's fate.

598
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,590
Su

599
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:58,210
Hey, Lu Lu. If I remember correctly, it's your last time going to Lin Shen's for advising right?

600
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:00,570
Yes, I just arrived.

601
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:03,350
When you're done, I'll pick you up.

602
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:07,560
You sure. Didn't ou say you weren't happy when you left?

603
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,210
That's right, but he's the unhappy one. I'm quite happy.

604
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:13,800
Then this is the plan. I'll pick you up later.

605
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:25,780
In your drawing, your tree canopy is very big.

606
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,870
The trunk is thin and small. It seems like

607
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:31,080
Wang Su's impact on you isn't completely gone.

608
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:36,520
Recently, I still don't dare to close the lights when I sleep.

609
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,590
<i>There are wither leaves falling.</i>

610
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,060
But there are also new leaves.

611
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:47,010
You seem to have found a new breakthrough.

612
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:51,710
Teacher Lin, I plan on moving.

613
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:55,040
Today is my last day of counseling.

614
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,330
I'm really thankful for your help.

615
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:01,030
I want to change my environment.

616
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:03,400
Maybe have a new relationship.

617
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,660
Even though I don't recommend you

618
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:11,650
stop going to counseling, but I respect our decision.

619
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:16,100
Later Xiao Xiao is going to pick me up. She's planning coming with me to look for a house..

620
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,080
Once we find one, we will move immediately.

621
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,040
<i>(Humming)</i>

622
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,450
Hello.

623
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:39,760
Xiao Xiao!

624
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,290
Why are you here?

625
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:44,800
I'm here to see Yan Luo and grab my succulent.

626
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,060
Thank you, sister Yan.

627
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:49,270
I told you to dispose of my succulent, yet you left it for me.

628
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:53,000
It is a easy task. I will get a box for you to put it in so it is easier to carry.

629
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,230
Okay.

630
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,060
Here's your succeulent.

631
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:04,190
-Thank you. <br>-Your welcome.

632
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:05,900
Here you go.

633
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,020
Ta da!

634
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:11,190
-This is? <br>-I saw your laptop background.

635
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:14,930
Also, the author's autograph.

636
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,990
-Thank you. <br>-Your welcome.

637
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:22,970
Hey, sister Yan, why am I missing a newly bought one?

638
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:26,410
I saw Teacher Lin take it to his office this morning.

639
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:31,050
Even if there's anything you want to talk about, feel free to reach out.

640
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:33,300
Teacher Lin.

641
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,670
If you really like that succulent,

642
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:38,080
I'll gift it to you.

643
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,690
Are you two free today?

644
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:47,440
Maybe I can treat you to lunch.

645
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,160
I didn't get to properly thank you last time, Teacher Lin.

646
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,510
I... I...

647
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:55,510
He has plans at noon. He won't be eating with us.

648
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:10,580
If I knew playing with him would be so interesting, I wouldn't have resigned.

649
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,660
You dressed so nicely today.

650
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:16,740
-Just to respond to him. <br>-Take a look at what he did.

651
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:20,180
If the business failed, there's still benevolence.

652
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:23,530
Deleting someone's Wechat is like cutting your hair and ending friendships in the dynasty period.

653
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:25,320
Cutting hair? You two aren't

654
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,300
married.

655
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,020
Sister Yin, I'm going to head out.

656
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,350
Bye.

657
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,140
Alright, give those to me.

658
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,650
Slowly.

659
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,850
<i>(Shocking News! A fan entangles with famous entertainer Z in broad daylight.)</i>

660
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:02,110
<i>(Shocking News! A fan entangles with famous entertainer Z in broad daylight.)</i>

661
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,290
<i>(She's crazy if she thinks this will bring her popularity!)<br></i><i>(She's too brave!)</i><br><i>(That's some realistic acting right there.)</i>

662
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:10,460
<i>(Delusional)</i>

663
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:34,310
Shan Shan, open the door.

664
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:37,420
How long do you plan on locking yourself in there?

665
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,090
Shan Shan.

666
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:44,080
Open the door.

667
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:47,330
Ran Ran, can you meet with me?

668
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,930
<i>-Can you go back with me to meet...<br>-Why are you here again?</i>

669
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:51,710
<i>-Stop causing trouble.<br>-I am not causing trouble.</i>

670
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:53,270
<i>Zhou Ran</i>

671
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:55,580
<i> I will repeat it again. We have never been together.</i>

672
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:58,120
<i>You are just an old fan of my fan club.</i>

673
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,880
<i>No. It is not like that. You know I am not like that. </i>

674
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:05,020
<i>Zhou Ran, you can not treat me like this.</i>

675
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:08,040
<i>Zhou Ran, you can not treat me like this.</i>

676
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,880
<i>Enough! Zhou Ran, get in the car.</i>

677
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,990
<i>-Zhou Ran, listen to me. <br>-Stop it.</i>

678
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:18,290
<i>Zhou Ran, come back with me to meet my parents.</i>

679
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:22,200
<i>Zhou Ran</i>

680
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,560
Hello, Teacher Lin?

681
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,540
I want to schedule a time with you tomorow morning.

682
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,640
<i>If you suspect that your daughter has symptoms of delusions.</i>

683
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:37,320
<i>I suggest you take her to a hospital's psychiatric department for professional treatment.</i>

684
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:41,300
<i> You can come over for a assessment.</i>

685
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,460
Why are you still reading this gossip?

686
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:55,180
I wanted to jump on the hype train and write an article,

687
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:57,300
but who knew there's only insults being hurled around on the net?

688
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:00,470
There's nothing reliable!

689
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,150
The relationship between fans and idols is really mysterious.

690
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:05,290
Are idols that charming?

691
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:09,840
The fans believe that they are dating the idol.

692
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,170
Do you want to ask Teacher Lin about this?

693
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:14,930
He's more knowledgable about this stuff?

694
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:16,890
I might as well ask Shao Ning.

695
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:19,810
Boss Shao is so much closer to me then a certain someone.

696
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,440
-Miss Yan, sorry. There a bit of traffic. <br> -No worries.

697
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,420
-This is your friend? <br>-yes.

698
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,330
-Let's go upstairs and take a look. <br>-Alright.

699
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:28,230
Let us go.

700
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:31,020
It's the third time this week.

701
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,320
I'm sorry, Mr. Shao. Something came up, so I arrived late.

702
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,010
W-What a second for me. Give me 2 minutes.

703
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:47,460
Let me settle down.

704
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,180
1 minute is about to pass.

705
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:54,730
I'm very fast. I just need to fix my makeup.

706
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:56,970
You have dark circles.

707
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:58,830
Did you go hunting last night?

708
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:00,750
I was staying up all night for the hot topic.

709
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:03,790
The one where idol Z

710
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:06,490
dated a fan or a fan directed and acted out the play.

711
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:08,720
This issue really is quite popular. I also saw it.

712
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,650
The Z is my idol Zhou Ran.

713
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:16,000
There is even a video saying that he dated his fan, San San Yao

714
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,490
We are really famliar with this San San Yao.

715
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,670
Among the fans, she's been there for a while.

716
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:24,980
Her real name is Zhang Shan Shan. She is the one who founded Zhou Ran's fan club.

717
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:29,380
I heard that the manager kicker her out for harassing Zhou Ran.

718
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,760
She is just a diehard fan.

719
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,980
I think she directed and acted it out. People online are saying that it is true.

720
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:38,730
This is really boring.

721
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:42,880
-There is another possibility for this situation. <br> -What is it?

722
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,520
This fan... What's she called?

723
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,910
-San San Yao. <br> -Yes, this Yao.

724
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:52,600
In her mind, she thought that she was dating her idol.

725
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,600
Eventually, she can't tell the difference between imagination and reality.

726
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:59,160
You mean...delusional disorder?

727
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,960
You got it right.

728
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,160
Lend me the manga there.

729
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,900
I won't count what you know.

730
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:10,270
No, I'm not lending it to you.

731
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:12,730
Then I can only deduct your bonus.

732
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:20,750
Cheap.

733
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,410
Zou Yan<br>-Yes, Teacher Lin.

734
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:27,320
Help me schedule this person for tomorrow at 10 a.m to 11 a.m.

735
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,970
Thank you.

736
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:32,510
Zhang Shan Shang?

737
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:39,160
Also, can you help me

738
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:43,030
gather news about Zhang Shan Shan and Zhou Ran.

739
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:46,220
Oh, okay. Thank you.

740
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:47,860
Why are you thanking me?

741
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:49,700
Oh, nothing.

742
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:02,100
The neighborhood is really nice. It faces the ocean.

743
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:06,190
Being able to see the ocean in the morning after getting up will put you in a good mood.

744
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:09,200
The amenities within our neighborhood are quite nice as well.

745
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,410
Let's go inside and take a look.

746
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:16,470
What do you think about the house?

747
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:19,770
I think it is pretty nice, but it is over my budget.

748
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:22,890
Why not live with me? Why are you renting apartment?

749
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:25,320
No, my own place

750
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,120
has drawings covering half the room...

751
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:30,900
And my schedule is irregular. I'd definitely bother you.

752
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:33,460
Hello?

753
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:35,650
<i>Is this Xiao Beibei?</i>

754
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:38,040
That's me. Who are you?

755
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:41,490
Hi, I am Zhou Ran's agent, Fang Lin.

756
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,030
Hi. Hi.

757
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,480
Okay.

758
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,160
Okay. Okay.

759
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:57,040
Then, tomorrow. Depends on you. Yes. You can choose the location and time.

760
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:00,250
Oka. Okay. See you tomorrow.

761
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:06,800
The manager of a hot news network asked me to write a draft!

762
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,350
Manager? Zhou?

763
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:11,230
This is great..

764
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:17,970
That's amazing!

765
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:29,130
Teacher Lin, this is

766
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:30,480
Thank you.

767
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,440
Can you come with me outside to wait.

768
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,840
Okay.

769
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:54,000
Hello, Shan shan.

770
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,910
I came willingly today.

771
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:00,860
I know I'm sick, so you don't need to waste time.

772
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:04,650
From now on, I will listen to my parents and focus on work.

773
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:06,810
I won't look for Zhou Ran anymore.

774
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:15,180
I heard that when you aren't happy,

775
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,700
you like to lock yourself in a room without light.

776
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:25,180
As far as I know, you have always denied that you have illusions.

777
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:28,430
You even said that you really interacted with Zhou Ran before.

778
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,820
Why did you suddenly change your story?

779
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,930
I heard your father say

780
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,220
that you used to want to learn music.

781
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,650
Because of your relationship with your mother,

782
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:53,180
you changed your major to business administration.

783
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:57,080
How about this. Is there any music you want to listen to?

784
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:01,820
So that you can feel better and be relax.

785
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:05,250
Then we can start the hypnosis.

786
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,540
As long as my parents are satisfied,

787
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:16,590
I will do it.

788
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:33,360
-Your pen. <br> -Thanks.

789
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:58,770
You also like to listen to Gothenburg Variations.

790
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:01,480
Yes. When I'm in a bad mood,

791
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,640
I like to listen to some light music to adjust myself.

792
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,580
Oh, right. There's another song I like listening to.

793
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:11,980
- It's called Brandenburg— <br>-Brandenburg, second movement.

794
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:16,180
Didn't expect you to have such extensive knowledge on classical music.

795
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,510
It's a shame you didn't study music.

796
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,960
Can I make a wild guess?

797
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,980
When you first like Zhou Ran,

798
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:31,250
it was because he was different than other fast raising idols.

799
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:34,720
He had his own unique insight into music, right?

800
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:43,940
Shan shan, don't worry.

801
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:46,340
The stuff we talked about today is confidential.

802
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:58,600
-Hello. <br> -Hello.

803
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,220
-Hello. <br> -Hello.

804
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:02,310
Please, take a seat.

805
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:08,080
Do you mind if we record this conversion for our files and records?

806
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,700
That's fine.

807
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,700
Then let's start.

808
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:17,320
Can I ask you

809
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:22,690
How did you meet Zhou Ran?

810
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:33,840
About one year ago, Zhou Ran signed with an agency company.

811
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,990
The company arrange for an audition.

812
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:41,990
At that time, I entered his management company

813
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:43,900
as an intern.

814
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:50,630
Brother, come help her.

815
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:03,690
♫ <i> Black and white, spread and scattered. No how matter bitter or salty, don't give up, don't leave </i> ♫

816
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:06,690
♫ <i> Stumbled and fell, yet not surprising</i> ♫

817
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:08,440
♫ <i> Mind fill with myriad of thoughts</i> ♫

818
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,310
Let me sweep the floor.

819
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:11,700
Go ahead.

820
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:15,550
♫ <i> Your presence can't be replaced</i> ♫

821
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:19,590
♫ <i> Everything about you intently wander </i> ♫

822
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:22,550
♫ <i>clearly and are </i> ♫

823
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:26,170
♫ <i> unforgettable</i> ♫

824
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,180
♫ <i>You are the supporting role</i> ♫

825
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:35,320
Do you know when he was playing the piano,

826
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,700
he was glowing?

827
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:50,540
He first entered the company to make music.

828
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:54,310
But everyone knows,

829
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,550
making music doesn't make money.

830
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:00,680
The management company wanted him to become an actor,

831
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:03,650
but he still insisted on doing music.

832
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:08,320
The management company thought he was disobedient, not willing to work with them.

833
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,140
They didn't event get him an assistant.

834
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:14,230
For certain reasons, when I first entered the company, there were a lot of resources.

835
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:17,760
During my hard times,she became by first fan.

836
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:22,320
<i>She also helped create my fan club, so I cherish her very much.</i>

837
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:26,410
<i> I gathered all my friends.</i>

838
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:29,240
to buy tickets for his concert.

839
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:36,890
<i>I shared it in my friend moment so more people are aware of him. </i>

840
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:40,960
<i>That's how I watched him step by step.</i>

841
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,900
<i>As he made his debut.</i>

842
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:46,860
During this period of time, you both had a idol-fan relationship.

843
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:51,790
Then when did she misunderstand this relationship?

844
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:56,200
Probably when I invited the senior members of my fan club

845
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,470
to watch my first movie appearance after debut.

846
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:03,740
Extremely excited that everyone came to Zhou Ran's fanmeeting. Please welcome Zhou Ran.

847
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,670
<i>Let's welcome him!</i>

848
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:09,910
Although it was a supporting role in a low-budget film

849
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:13,600
<i>but we highly value Qing Qing Company for specially booking the venue</i>

850
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,790
<i>to invite my fans to watch the movie.</i>

851
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:21,220
<i>During the group photo session, she almost fell.</i>

852
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:24,380
I let her go right after.

853
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:28,720
<i>She seemed to have a misunderstanding towards me. Even her percepton of me had changed too.</i>

854
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,900
<i>Do you remember how many people were there that day?</i>

855
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:36,090
<i>Probably around 4, but I didn't count.</i>

856
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:39,090
40 people. The venue was probably pretty chaotic.

857
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:41,930
You are sure that you let go as soon as possible?

858
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:46,310
He was actually just afraid that I would fall. I misunderstood.

859
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:51,400
You are sure after that he quickly let go?

860
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,130
Of course.

861
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:55,500
Yes.

862
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,350
And then what?

863
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:10,940
Then...

864
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,810
Shan shan, please trust me.

865
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,320
Slowly control your breathing.

866
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:28,900
Take a deep breath.

867
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:32,020
Take a deep breath.

868
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:34,540
Good.

869
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:48,330
You can now slowly,

870
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:52,150
slowly close your eyes.

871
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,920
<i>Let yourself relax.</i>

872
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,980
<i>Go back to that day.</i>

873
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,250
<i>You are standing on the stage.</i>

874
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,190
<i>The light is very bright.</i>

875
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:13,130
<i>3, 2, 1. Cheese!</i>

876
