00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,800
Iron tree, iron tree

157
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
finally blossoms. (Things that are seldom seen occur.)

158
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
What is an iron tree?

159
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,000
Hey, help out here. It's heavy. Quick.

160
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,600
I'll help you.

161
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,500
Where are you putting it?

162
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,200
I can do it myself.

163
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,800
- Hey. <br> - It's fine I can do it.

164
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,030
Something big happened.

165
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,900
<i>(When I met her, I was not an idol, I was just an aspiring singer who plays piano...)</i>

<i>But sometimes the road we walk will lead us to a detour.</i>

171
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,400
<i>I was afraid of losing my fame and fortune so I didn't want to acknowledge my past.</i>

172
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
<i>In order to protect my fame,</i>

173
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,600
<i>I denied all the beauty she bought to my life.</i>

174
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,000
<i>I did many bad things.</i>

175
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,600
<i>I pushed her off the edge and let internet attacked her.</i>

176
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,000
<i>I not only denied our love,</i>

177

185
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,000
I am sorry.

190
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Okay.

191
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Then... From now on, the business side of Xaio Beibei's social media

192
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,000
will be owned by my company.

193
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,600
But you can rest assured that all employees of our company will do their best to help you.

194
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,000
Thank you so much, Director Fan.

195
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,800
I should be the one thanking you, if it wasn't for you,

196
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,000
I wouldn't know how to move forward.

197
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,200
Before any posting,

198
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,000
I would like to understand Zhou Ran's situation.

199
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,600
- Regarding the ban? <br>- Yes.

200
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,000
It's not impossible to do but it's not the most important.

201
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,200
The most important thing is that Fang Lin and Zhou Ran terminated their contracts.

202
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,100
In fact, Fang Lin is demanding Zhou Ran to compensate for the all the damages.

203
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,200
How much?

204
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,400
I don't know the specifics of the amount.

205
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,800
However, Zhou Ran is selling all his assets. The amount must be significant.

206
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,100
All right.

207
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,000
- Today is a happy occasion. Let's not talk about them. Let's talk about you.<br>- Me?

208
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,400
Actually, I think you have a talent for psychology.

209
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,700
We feel that if we want to go up a notch with your socia media account contents,

210
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,800
we should add some psychological insight to it.

211
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,400
In my personal opinion,

212
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,900
if Xiao Beibei has a psychologist title,

213
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,200
it would be great help with Xiao Beibei's persona.

214
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,700
So now I have to ask you for your opinion.

215
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,600
Would you like to be part of a professional psychological counseling center?

216
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,700
If you are willing, I will help you find a center.

217
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,900
You really know what I want to do, Director Fan.

218
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,400
In this aspect of career planning,

219
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,800
I already set my heart on a particular center.

220
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,900
It's okay. No matter what, we both have the same goal.

221
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,200
Director Fan also suggested that you should do psychological counseling?

222
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,600
I also think Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center is quite good.

223
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
Do you know what Counselor Lin said?

224
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,000
That I'm just working for him to make money. He's not willing.

225
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,900
He's avoiding you like the plaque?

226
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,200
I can't anymore. Let me rest for a bit.

227
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,000
- Rest up. <br>- Oh, my old waist.

228
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,200
- Let me make you a cup of coffee. <br>- Can I have a passion fruit flavor one?

229
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,800
All right.

230
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,800
Quickly!

231
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,600
Here.

232
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
For you, I've prepared

233
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,600
a big surprise. It will be online at midnight tonight.

234
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,500
What kind of surprise? Give me a spoiler.

235
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,600
No, no, no.

236
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,000
You'll find out tonight.

237
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,310
<i>We all once thought that</i>

238
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,400
<i>idols are the epitome of our dream life,</i>

239
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,400
<i>distant, imaginary, and perfect.</i>

240
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,400
<i>We're obsessed with participating in the entire idol's process of growth.</i>

241
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,600
<i>We hope that we would know everything about them.</i>

242
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,800
<i>We won't allow ourselves to miss any chances.</i>

243
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,800
<i>We'll blame ourselves for not spending enough to support their dreams.</i>

244
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,600
<i>He would even resist being possessed by anyone.</i>

245
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,400
<i>But the more we try, the more we blur our own faces.</i>

246
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,600
<i>We've been stripped of the labels that belong to us, the bright spots of our individuality,</i>

247
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,400
<i>our unique preferences, our persistent dreams.</i>

248
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,200
<i>But now we only have one name, fans.</i>

249
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,600
<i>In fact, we like our idols essentially because we like their charm,</i>

250
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,800
<i>which we also yearn for.</i>

251
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,800
<i>These beautiful qualities can be beacons in front of us,</i>

252
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,000
<i>navigational markers or companions on the same road.</i>

253
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,800
<i>But we have to be at the helm of our life.</i>

254
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,600
<i>Idols are like a sun.</i>

255
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,200
<i>When you are far, you feel the warmth of the sun.</i>

256
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,400
<i>Bro, please come here to help her.</i>

257
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,800
<i>When you are too close to them,</i>

258
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,300
<i>your eyes might be hurt by the dazzling light.</i>

259
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:16,000
<i>For fans, they might have fantasized to fall in love with an idol.</i>

260
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,800
<i>They think it is romantic and dream-like.</i>

261
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,800
<i>In reality, they fall into a humble</i>

262
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,200
<i>and unequal relationship. Even more so, they might be hurt badly.</i>

263
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,000
<i>In the era of pan-idols,</i>

264
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
<i>Idols cannot and should not use their halo</i>

265
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,800
<i>to gain affections from their fans.</i>

266
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,400
<i>When you are enjoying the benefits of fame,</i>

267
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,800
<i>you must also have a higher moral standard to ask yourself</i>

268
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,600
<i>not to be in front of the stage and fall into the dark.</i>

269
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,800
<i>Finally, I want to say that the only thing worth going crazy with</i>

270
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,200
<i>is your own youthful dreams.</i>

271
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,800
<i>And only you can take care of your dreams.</i>

272
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,400
<i>Chase your dreams.</i>

00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,850
You are back!

311
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,600
Where are you here? Aren't you cold?

312
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,280
I'm not cold. I'm bored at home all day.

313
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,100
I came down to take a walk because of the express mail delivery.

314
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,090
Silly, how can you be more tired than me working all day?

315
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,050
That's right. I just received invitation.

316
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,820
It's from a social media feed host who I worked with before.

317
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,530
Our relationship is pretty good.

318
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,010
She is hosting a fans appreciation event.

319
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,890
She wants me to help her organize the event few days ago.

320
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:56,230
Of course, it will be a paid job.

321
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:00,160
With you current condition, can you do it?

322
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,230
No matter what, I used to be a manager at a big PR firm.

323
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,370
For this event, it will be 20 people max.

324
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,900
It shouldn't be a problem for me.

325
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,500
Qian Qian, it has been a year since you resigned.

326
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,660
Your professional skill might be rusty.

327
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,740
Also, all your previous jobs were done with a large group of people.

328
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,980
Honey, having a job is very tiring.

329
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,300
I'm don't want you to suffer.

330
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,250
Also, it's not that we need you to bring in money from a party-time job.

331
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,910
Isn't it?

332
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,280
You might be right.

333
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,690
It has been a while since my last job.

334
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,320
What if I couldn't do a good job and ruined the event?

335
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,700
Very good. Let's go home.

336
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,390
Let's go.

337
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:52,490
<i> It's amazing, Xiao Xiao. You have already finished your basic training for being a psychologist, and earned the certification. </i>

338
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,600
Welcome back to Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center.

339
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,020
Thank you, Boss Shao. And for my position...?

340
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,960
I believe Counselor Lin needs an outstanding assistant.

341
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,880
Look!

342
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,760
<i>I can't believe <br>(Xiao Xiao, Assistant)</i>

343
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,850
as a Counselor's assistant can has my own office.

344
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,120
The second floor of our company has four offices. Each boss Shao and Counselor Lin occupy one office.

345
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,570
Another one is for Boss Shao's assistant, Xiao Rui.

346
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,670
The one has been emptied. Since you finished the interview that day,

347
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,920
Boss Shao told me to clean it up for you.

348
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,520
Boss Shao is the best.

349
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,420
Being Counselor Lin's assistant is not that easy.

350
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,620
<i> My parents wanted to get divorced recently. My mom has been pressing me to make a decision. </i>

351
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,340
<i> Said once they are divorced, whether I want to follow my dad or her. </i>

352
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,450
<i> If I said something nice about my dad, she would scold at me.<i></i></i>

353
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,900
She said she shouldn't give birth to me. If I'm a boy, I can protect her.

354
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,850
- All I know...<br> - What's good about your father?

355
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,530
You need to get the source of information from the visitors and their family members,

356
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,890
in order to understand the visitors emotional issues and psychological depressions.

357
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:08,220
Do you have your heart? You will follow whomever give you money?

358
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,130
Why are you threatening the kid with our adults' matters?

359
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,200
This causes her play on her cellphone all day without eating and drinking.

360
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,770
Also, you need to do a full assessment on the visitors' psychological development,

361
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,070
personality development, socialization, intelligence,

362
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,380
and their marital and family life.

363
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,330
All you can think of is money, do you even care both of us?

364
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,330
- I have been working all day, I don't have time to take care of our kid.<br> - That's right.

365
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,330
- Got it. <br> - All I going to say is, you can do it.

366
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,020
I will work hard!

367
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,280
- You play Mahjong all day long. Who is keeping her company?<br> I play mahjong.

368
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,360
Everyday you came home drunk.<br> <i>(Bomb)</i>

369
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,880
How dare you call me crazy?

370
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,300
What are you doing?

371
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,470
You bitch!

372
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,660
- Stop fighting! <br> - It's all your dad's fault!

373
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,930
What are you trying to do!

374
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,240
What are you doing?

375
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,170
Can you sympathize me just a bit?

376
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,240
Once you get used to it, you will be fine.

377
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,810
Just that "You will used to it"?

378
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,700
I think your parents need counseling more than you.

379
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,910
I know. I told them I'm here to do counseling

380
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,610
is to bring them here to check on their brains.

381
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,850
<i> (Here is...)<br>(Dream you can't wake up...)</i>

382
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,660
You call at a perfect time.

383
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,400
What do you want to eat for lunch? I can ask Xiao Rui to place the order.

384
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,180
No need. I just left the sanatorium, will go home after.

385
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,140
I thought you will come back because of Xiao Xiao.

386
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,130
Xiao Xiao? What happened to her?

387
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:18,560
Don't you know? Today, there was a couple here for counseling.

388
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,240
They fight with each other, at the end hit Xiao Xiao by accident.

389
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,910
She is injured?

390
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,570
How is it possible? I was there earlier.

391
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,740
To what I heard, she was irritated by the visitors?

392
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,760
Hi! Hi!

393
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,390
Let's eat.

394
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,890
I'm picking up this call.

395
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,590
Hello?

396
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,750
Kele? What's up?

397
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,810
I sent the message to her for few days now, she hasn't contacted me.

398
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,480
Are you sure this Chai Qian is reliable?

399
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,910
She still hasn't contacted you?

400
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,290
What contact? She hasn't even replied my texts.

401
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,630
Is it possible that she is looking down this kind of small scale event?

402
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,560
How is it possible? She is a nice person.

403
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,660
She also reached out to me few times and told me she is bored at home,

404
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,140
and she wants to do something.

405
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,780
Let me remind you.

406
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,710
I did a rough calculation. If she still hasn't replied back,

407
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,760
our event will not happen.

408
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,640
I'm seeking for your advise.

409
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,610
If this doesn't work out, we will find a small event planning company to do this, what do you think?

410
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,330
That's fine. Just do it accordingly.

411
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,140
Where is Counselor Lin?

412
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,200
He typically won't come back once he is out on the Fridays.

413
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,000
You eat two lunch boxes?

414
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,550
I got big appetite lately.

415
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,120
Xiao Xiao, you still care about Counselor Lin as usual.

416
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,520
I'm his disciple, it's pretty common to think of him.

417
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,290
So, Counselor Lin will not come back in the afternoon?

418
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,260
Counselor Lin has outside appointments every Mondays and Fridays.

419
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:53,270
On Monday, he goes to Shen Jiang University as the Guest Professor as you know.

420
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,690
As for Friday's appointment, it's a secret. Nobody know what he does.

421
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,770
Also, once he left, he won't come back.

422
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,400
I bet most likely he goes on a date.

423
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,050
Once on Friday, Counselor Lin ordered a bouquet of flowers and took it with him. I saw it.

424
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,750
Perhaps, he has a secret girlfriend.

425
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,640
He hides her very well.

426
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,920
You are too nosy. Go eat!

427
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:26,360
I even bought you lunch, I should feed the dogs instead.

428
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,000
Counselor Lin, why are you here?

429
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,230
Do you want Chicken or Beef?

430
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,890
Whatever.

431
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:54,890
Then take the beef, it's more expensive.

432
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,010
Let me do it.

433
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,770
Counselor Lin, I heard you went on a date in the morning.

434
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,150
Who would go on a date early in the morning?

435
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,920
You might be right.

436
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,920
I will give this to you .

437
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,700
Are you done asking questions? Then it's my turn.

438
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,330
I'll say everything I know.

439
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,770
Who agreed to take you as a disciple?

440
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,180
From now on, do not use me as a topic of conversation.

441
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,410
I wasn't using you as a topic of conversation.

442
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:36,650
I genuinely want to take you as my teacher.

443
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,640
I even found out which classroom you teach in.

444
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,790
- How did you find out? <br> - I have eyes all over Shaolin.

445
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:54,110
You won't forbid me from going to class, will you?

446
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,460
Where are you going? Counselor Lin?

447
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,770
So much for your eyes, you couldn't even find out which floor my classroom is really on.

448
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,890
Please switch next Monday's class from the fifth floor to the sixth floor. Thank you.

449
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:26,560
The central idea in Erickson's model of hypnosis is utilization.

450
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,950
He believes that every characteristic of the visitor

451
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,700
can be utilized

452
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,060
to bring change for the visitor.

453
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,530
- Utilization means using to your advantage. <br> - Excuse me.

454
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,900
A hypnotist must utilize many complex individual, interpersonal, and environmental factors.

455
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,170
They must then try different ways to combine them in order to influence the visitor's responsiveness.

456
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,480
Before formally understanding the effect of hypnosis,

457
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,840
we can first try a small experiment to get the idea.

458
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,740
Which student would like to volunteer?

459
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,380
- Me. <br> - I'll do it!

460
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,020
Jump from this line to this line.

461
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,960
This line and this line?

462
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,530
Jump one more time.

463
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,530
Jump from this table to this line.

464
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,470
It's so high, what if I fall?

465
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:34,660
The distance from the table to the line is not even a meter. It's not a problem for you.

466
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:41,500
Let's give this student a round of applause as encouragement.

467
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,840
Don't be scared. I'll protect you.

468
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,140
I'm getting up.

469
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,910
Counselor Lin, is it this line?

470
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,850
Yes.

471
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,510
One.

472
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,010
Two.

473
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,490
Three!

474
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:37,010
This is what happens when willpower and fear come into conflict.

475
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:42,120
When you face danger and fear, your subconscious will immediately apply judgment and tell you

476
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,590
there is a danger of falling from the table, even though I told you

477
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,780
it's very safe. But your subconscious has already drawn a conclusion.

478
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,290
So the most probable result is that you think you will fall.

479
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,950
Teacher!

480
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,950
Then in this process, what effect can hypnosis have?

481
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,550
Hypnosis can increase one's self-efficacy,

482
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,710
as well as integrate the two forces of willpower and fear

483
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,500
to achieve the best result.

484
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,540
Thank you.

485
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,060
Okay, you may return to your seat.

486
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,380
Let's continue discussing the effect of hypnosis.

487
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,390
Are you okay?

488
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:26,480
- Get up. <br> - Are you okay?

489
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,690
What happened?

490
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,150
I think I twisted my ankle.

491
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,000
This student has just shown us another great demonstration.

492
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,410
When people are in an absent-minded state,

493
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:46,220
there will be a separation of mind and body.

494
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,540
Falling serves as a reminder

495
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,170
to have your thoughts catch up to your steps.

496
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,650
Oh.

497
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:01,250
Counselor Lin, does this count as an injury suffered on the job?

498
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,770
I'll buy you a crutch.

499
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,840
That would be inconvenient. I have to take the subway everyday.

500
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,250
There are so many people on the subway

501
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,930
going to and fro. I'd only make my injury worse.

502
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:15,950
Fine, I'll have the financial department reimburse you for taxi fare.

503
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,870
My foot

504
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,900
was sacrificed for your teaching.

505
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:25,630
If you made the company reimburse me, that would be so unfair to Mr. Shao.

506
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,380
You sure know how to separate public and private interests.

507
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,300
Fine, I'll reimburse you myself, okay?

508
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,310
Then I'd feel embarrassed.

509
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,180
Counselor Lin, how about this?

510
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:41,550
I have a fan appreciation party for my WeChat official account.

511
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,250
I'll have to trouble you to be my human crutch for a day.

512
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:48,040
I mean, my temporary assistant. We'll just exchange identities.

513
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,820
Then I'll exempt you from reimbursing me.

514
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:55,870
Counselor Lin, look at my foot. I just have this one request.

515
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,920
Just think, there will be so many fans onsite.

516
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,670
If I were on crutches, it would affect my image.

517
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:05,080
I'm not your fan. What does it have to do with me?

518
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,400
Is that so? I remember someone

519
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,860
following my official account a few days ago.

520
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,950
<i>- Who are you? <br> - We are roses.</i>

521
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,880
<i>(Public Relations Introduction)</i>

522
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,650
<i>Are you crying? I tamed you.</i>

523
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,940
<i>But it hasn't done you any good.</i>

524
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,160
<i>I'll tell you a secret as a gift.</i>

525
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,130
<i>It is only with the heart that one can see clearly.</i>

526
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,250
<i>What is important is invisible for the eyes.</i>

527
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,390
Were you asleep? Did I scare you by turning on the light?

528
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:39,570
I just took melatonin and feel a little dazed.

529
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,890
Did you finish your work?

530
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,940
Not quite.

531
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:50,530
Honey, I want to drink milk. Can you heat a glass of milk for me?

532
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,630
Wait a moment.

533
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,420
Let's go.

534
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,230
Counselor Lin.

535
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,620
Assistant Lin.

536
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,180
What do you think of these photos?

537
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,010
Do they look nice?

538
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,660
There is no difference between the photos and the real person.

539
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:00,040
The colors match well. Come, let's see what they prepared for me.

540
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,380
Be careful.

541
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,000
Faster!

542
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:06,910
- Thank you, this way. <br> - Thank you.

543
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,190
- Hello. <br> - Hello.

544
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:21,240
You're Chai Qian?

545
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,430
Hello, hello. I'm Xiao Beibei's operations manager, Sun Kele.

546
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,930
- Hello. <br> - Xiao Beibei often speaks of you.

547
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,500
She says you come from a big company.

548
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,030
Originally we wanted you to plan this event.

549
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,870
I said, she comes from a big company,

550
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,450
she must have high expectations and good taste.

551
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,520
So if there are any problems with today's party,

552
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,570
please be forgiving.

553
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:47,200
Not at all. It's my fault for not valuing this opportunity, please excuse me.

554
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,010
You're too polite.

555
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:51,460
Please sign here.

556
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,230
Thank you.

557
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:59,480
<i>(Xiao Beibei Fan Appreciation Party)</i>

558
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:11,510
Hello. I am Hongquan Advertising Co's sales account manager. If you have any business needs,

559
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:14,500
- please contact us. <br> - Thank you.

560
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,210
Alright, wait one moment.

561
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,670
- Does that look okay? Let's take one together. <br> - Hello.

562
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,470
I am Hongquan Advertising Co's sales account manager.

563
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:26,080
May I ask what you do?

564
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,740
One, two, three.

565
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,710
- Xiaoxiao. <br> - Chai Qian!

566
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,570
Find a place to sit.

567
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,780
Enjoy yourselves. I'll see you in a moment.

568
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,160
Okay, bye.

569
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,710
This way. Support me.

570
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,530
Chai Qian.

571
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,320
Xiaoxiao, what's wrong with your leg?

572
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,920
It's nothing, just a small injury.

573
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,160
It's a good thing I found an assistant in time. Otherwise, I'd have to come see you on crutches.

574
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,140
Be careful.

575
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:56,090
Assistant, I'm going to talk with my friend. You can rest.

576
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,010
How have you been lately?

577
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:03,340
I'm doing pretty well.

578
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:06,630
- I'm sorry for not helping you plan this event. <br> - Xiao Beibei.

579
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:09,050
- Can I take a picture with you? <br> - Sure.

580
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,140
- Thank you. <br> -Thank you. Please take a seat.

581
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:19,320
It would have been a waste of your talent to work for me. Don't feel pressure, okay?

582
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,360
Hello. You're Xiao Beibei's assistant?

583
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:27,150
I'm Xiao Beibei's true fan.

584
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:30,730
Can I add you on WeChat?

585
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,620
Should I scan you, or you scan me?

586
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:43,600
Sun Kele.

587
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,290
Go over there and check on Counselor Lin. Hurry.

588
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,690
Hi there, Miss.

589
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:54,640
I am the WeChat official account's operations manager. If you need anything, you can just come to me.

590
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,840
I'll add your WeChat.

591
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,440
We haven't seen each other in so long. I feel like you've changed a lot.

592
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,630
Whenever I saw you in the past,

593
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,880
you were always dressed like a very capable career woman.

594
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,980
This time, you're radiating with

595
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:13,110
the aura of a homemaker.

596
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:16,140
After resting for so long, I've started to envy you.

597
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,520
You're able to strive hard in the career you enjoy.

598
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:22,590
Don't even start, I'm exhausted. I have to work by day and write by night.

599
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:26,190
If my posts are even a little late, Sun Kele is ready to hold a knife to my throat.

600
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:28,810
I'm telling you, I'm as exhausted as a person can be.

601
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:43,170
Please sit where you are assigned. We are about to begin.

602
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,980
Take good care of yourself.

603
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,780
Thank you.

604
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,630
Sun Kele...

605
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:56,880
Switch seats

606
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,030
Okay, Teacher Lin sit here.

607
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:01,930
Please, Assistant Lin.

608
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,380
Everyone please quiet down and let me say something.

609
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,930
I am Xiao Beibei's operations manager, Sun Kele.

610
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:15,710
I hereby announce that our appreciation party starts now.

611
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:18,060
Now you guys should applaud.

612
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,590
It's like this, I know everyone doesn't know each other.

613
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:25,830
I have a suggestion. We can start with a game called Pass the Flower.

614
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:30,150
Whoever the flower is passed to can share their story with Xiao Beibei's official WeChat account.

615
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,210
-How is that? <br>-Okay!

616
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:36,380
Okay let me play a song, please give me a moment.

617
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:42,000
Thank you for being my crutch today, Counselor Lin. I know you don't drive,

618
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,650
so I especially ordered this restaurant's reserved red wine.

619
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:48,610
It's the most expensive part of the meal.

620
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,240
Okay, let's start.

621
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,040
You start first.

622
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:01,030
I'm going to start.

623
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:04,340
3,2,1, start.

624
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:25,320
When I was a senior in college, I discovered Xiao Beibei's account.

625
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,840
At that time, I just broke up with my significant other and was not in a good space.

626
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:35,490
When I saw your paper,

627
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:41,180
it was with me during my darkest time, so I am extremely thankful for her.

628
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:45,680
Thank you! Thank you for sharing. Let's continue.

629
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,220
3,2,1, Start.

630
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,210
Please share with us.

631
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,380
To speak of my fate with Xiao Beibei,

632
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:16,080
I guess I'm her first advertiser.

633
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,340
At that time, I was working at a public relations company.

634
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:23,210
There was a business exhibition aimed towards female consumers.

635
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,590
I needed to shoot a commercial.

636
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:28,800
I really liked the essay she wrote, so I found her.

637
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,980
That's right. At the exhibition, Chai Qian even

638
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:35,620
advertised my WeChat official account. My fans shot up.

639
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:43,370
You used to be so good at your job. How come you quit?

640
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,320
Because my boyfriend wanted me to return to the household.

641
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,860
After we married, I decided to stay home and rest.

642
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:59,140
That's such a shame. It was just for a man?

643
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,170
It—it wasn't just for a man.

644
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:11,240
At the time, I faced a bottleneck at work.

645
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:16,760
I was very anxious. Working in public relations, I had to constantly face the media.

646
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,490
My phone was on 24/7.

647
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:22,910
As long as it rang, I wouldn't be able to sleep all night.

648
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:26,770
Then I made it to the position of Media Director.

649
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:30,170
But I was getting more and more work.

650
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:33,150
There was no way I could finish it.

651
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:36,100
So that's why I wanted to rest.

652
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,830
In our circle, every woman faces a lot of pressure.

653
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:42,280
Returning to the household seems like an excuse.

654
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:46,770
Don't you know? The ability to withstand pressure has to be developed in the workplace.

655
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:51,400
<i>But can you handle it right now?</i>

656
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:54,760
<i>It does seem like an excuse.</i>

657
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,260
<i>Who talks of households in this day?</i>

658
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,990
Everyone has the right to decide how to live.

659
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:03,500
Chai Qian was tired and wanted to rest for a while.

660
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,720
And she met a boyfriend she loved.

661
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,630
I think that's her choice.

662
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:11,050
I want to thank Chai Qian for supporting me when my account was in its starting stage.

663
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:13,310
Thank you!

664
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:20,340
Let's continue with our game.

665
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:24,220
3, 2, 1, start.

666
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:38,160
<i>It's been over a year since you quit.</i>

667
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,940
<i>Is it possible you've gotten rusty at your job?</i>

668
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,360
<i>Returning to the household seems like an excuse.</i>

669
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,250
<i>The ability to withstand pressure has to be developed in the workplace.</i>

670
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,090
Are you crazy?

671
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:52,410
- Please don't! <br> - Stop!

672
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,220
- Stop! <br> - Chai Qian!

673
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:57,200
- Stop! <br> - Don't be angry, don't be angry.

674
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,340
- Chai Qian! <br> - Don't be angry.

675
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,720
B*tch!

676
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,860
- Just try coming at me again! <br> - Stop, don't be angry.

677
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:27,920
What right do you have to look down on me?

678
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,670
Hello? Luoluo?

679
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:51,700
<i>Xiao, are you free after work today? Come shopping with me.</i>

680
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:55,610
<i>I need a new set of pots and pans. I also want a bedside lamp—</i>

681
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:59,720
Sorry Luoluo, I have a meeting with my investor.

682
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,910
I'm in his office now.

683
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:04,040
I'll call you back later.

684
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,750
<i>Okay, take care of your business.</i>

685
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,290
Thank you.

686
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:08,710
Miss Xiao, this way.

687
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:10,100
Okay.

688
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,250
Next, number 17.

689
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,160
<i>Hello, I'm Xiaoxiao.</i>

690
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,610
<i>Hi Xiaoxiao. I'm Chai Qian.</i>

691
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:33,950
<i>The first time I met Chai Qian,</i>

692
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:36,880
<i>she was the perfect career woman.</i>

693
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,130
<i>The first point is the cleanliness of the teeth.</i>

694
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:41,140
<i>Second is oral health.</i>

695
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:43,780
<i>Third is how to show off confidence and beauty.</i>

696
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:47,080
<i>I hope you can address all three points in your essay.</i>

697
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,120
<i>How long will you need?</i>

698
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,480
<i>Probably around seven days.</i>

699
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,980
<i>Seven days?</i>

700
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,820
<i>Because I have to write an advertorial that fits with it.</i>

701
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,610
<i>Two days.</i>

702
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:03,910
Sit.

703
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,170
We've worked together for a long time now.

704
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:10,170
You are familiar with our workflow and our mode of operation.

705
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:11,890
I still have to thank you, Mr. Fan.

706
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:14,630
Since we've worked together, my advertising revenue has indeed doubled.

707
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:18,550
Then comes the question. Have you thought about moving our collaboration

708
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:22,050
from an advertising representative to a full contract?

709
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:27,220
There's a piece of news I can share with you.

710
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,160
All of the leading bloggers

711
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,250
with whom our company has full contracts,

712
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:33,380
they all have over a million followers.

713
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,210
Each advertisement gets over 250,000.

714
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,720
If you agree, then this

715
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,090
will be my minimum guarantee to you.

716
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,380
I am a casual person.

717
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,350
I don't want to make my account too complicated.

718
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:52,630
Are you turning me down?

719
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,060
You previously gave me a recommendation.

720
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,960
I have already started working at a psychological counseling center.

721
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,980
I want to develop in the direction of psychological counseling.

722
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:05,100
That will also substantially help our account's content creation.

723
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,300
Good marketing is of course very important.

724
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:13,240
But I started my account with the intent of succeeding on the basis of my content.

725
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,660
If we sign a full contract,

726
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:20,050
it's inevitable that I will lose some autonomy. I also want to be responsible to my current partners.

727
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,940
So I will be a bit more conservative.

728
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:25,470
I would like to maintain our current mode of collaboration.

729
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,890
Alright, I won't force you to do something you don't want.

730
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:37,760
Then let me ask, which psychological counseling center is it?

731
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,860
- Shaolin. <br> - Shaolin?

732
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:42,560
Do you still remember last time at the movie theater?

733
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,460
You met a partner at Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center, Lin Shen.

734
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,980
I remember. I remember.

735
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:56,320
<i>(One Mall)</i>

736
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,250
- Luoluo! <br> - Yes?

737
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:04,320
Look, this thermos is not bad, right? It's a good brand.

738
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,700
It looks super cool too. What do you think?

739
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:10,950
Mom, thank you. It's over ¥300, I don't need it.

740
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,770
It's for Xiao Feng.

741
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:15,800
He needs it for class.

742
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:20,450
This one? We don't need this, we have one at home.

743
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:22,450
Put it back.

744
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,820
Let's go.

745
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,140
Luoluo, wait a moment. Let me see.

746
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:45,910
This bamboo light costs ¥529? That won't do.

747
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:48,260
Mom, I need this.

748
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:51,530
I have to look at fan comments every night. I need a bedside lamp.

749
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:54,590
A lamp just has to be bright.

750
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:58,220
Look, this one is ¥48.

751
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:01,860
I'm sure this lamp is bright. Plus, it's Nordic blue.

752
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:04,670
It's perfect for a young woman like you.

753
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:07,260
Let's go check out.

754
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:12,120

I—

757
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,200
Here is the membership card.

758
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,000
How much?

759
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,000
¥469.

760
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,600
Look! We got so much stuff and it only costs ¥400.

761
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,700
Good value. Luo Luo.

762
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,700
Let me pay.

Are you interested in Psychology of Emotion?

773
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:01,220
Do you still remember Chai Qian?

774
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,200
The person who caused disturbance at your fans appreciation event.

775
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,600
Do you think her emotion was very unusual?

776
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,600
In a regular argument, it's either two people with very bad temper,

argument ignited right away. Or during the argument slowly escalated.

The verbal fight got ugly and turn to be physical fight.

779
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,800
Those two scenarios didn't fit the situation that evening.

780

Chai Quian is usually calm and gentle.

781
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,500
She knows when to pull back. She is not the kind of person who explode right away.

01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,000
However, during that argument, the situation didn't get escalated,

783
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,600
she suddenly transformed to another person.

784
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,800
Human emotion has a rib as ignition.

785
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,600
Perhaps the other party's word triggered her most hidden

786
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:42,600
side of her emotion. Her explosion is very possible.

787
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,200
Please come in.

788
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,400
Counselor Lin.

789
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,000
Xiao Xiao, there is a lady here to see you.

790
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,000
I might have studied psychology, but at this point,

791
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,600
I can only execute simple counseling.

792
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,400
I'm not a formal psychologist yet.

793
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,800
Director Fang. Thank you for your supports all these years.

794
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,800
This is what I can do.

795
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,200
Mr. Lin, we have received some equipment donation.

796
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,700
we are going to upgrade our surveillance systems.

797
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,800
- Hi!<br> - Hi!

798
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,200
Do you know each other?

799
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,500
Director Fang is the donor this donation.

800
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,800
- Thank you very much.<br> - It's my pleasure.

801
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,800
It will be great if we can put all these products in good use.

802
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,800
- You should go ahead.<br> - Okay.

803
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,200
Director Fang, you guys go ahead.

804
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,400
Will see you later.

805
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,000
Are you sure you couldn't find the vehicle information under his name?

806
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,200
But this is what I found.

807
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,800
If you are in a hurry, I can give you a ride.

808
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,200
No. It's not necessary.

809
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,800
Our boss likes more eco friendly vehicle.

810
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:24,400
<i>I hear Xiao Xiao always mentioned about you. She said you are a renowned counselor in the industry.</i>

811
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,000
<i>Recently, our company has the need to plan for employee psychological assistance.</i>

812
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,400
If you have time today, can I buy lunch and talk about it in details?

813
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,000
I'm sorry. For employee psychological assistance area, it is managed by partner, Shao Ning.

814
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,400
<i>- I will give you his name card.<br> - Okay.</i>

815
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,600
<i>Here.</i>

816
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:45,000
<i>- If you need anything on this area, you may contact him.<br> - Okay. </i>

817
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,400
<i> Today, I have another appointment. I better go now. <br> I won't keep you here.</i>

818
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,600
<i> - Thank you.<br> - Good bye.</i>

819
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:01,000
