I suddenly heard a pack of wolves biting at one another.

There were butterfly specimens all over the walls.

98
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,610
It felt like I was a specimen too.

99
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,510
My wings were pinned to a wall by someone.

100
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,960
No matter how much I struggled, how much I shouted,

101
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,470

Silly, I haven't said anything and you're already a little angry.

110

<i> and you can't withstand the pressure, what will we do then? </i>

What were you thinking about just now?

120
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,070
Each of us is the director in our own dreamworld.

121
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:06,490
Look. In your dream, there were wolves tearing at each other.

122
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,060
There were butterflies pinned down.

123
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,550
Actually, I think you know what you're worried about.

124
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:20,870
You know very well that this is your own subconscious thoughts that you've blocked out.

125
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,550
You don't want to admit it; so you go round and round.

126
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,280
But often, we have to break through on our own,

127
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,880
and bravely face our inner selves.

128
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,450
Only in that way can you gradually emerge from your dreamworld.

129
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,590
If you're willing, you can come here and formally see a psychologist.

130
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,470
Where have you been?

131
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,730
- I went to have a meal with a friend. <br> -A friend?

132
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,360
My emotions haven't been stable recently. I can't sleep.

133
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,480
So I went to a psychiatrist's office.

134
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,510
I talked with a friend there to relax a little.

135
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,380
I didn't want to bring my bad mood home.

136
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,840
What did you and that friend talk about?

137
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,220
Call your friend and tell her you won't be coming to see her again.

138
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,740
Qian Qian, haven't you always done as I asked before?

139
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,300
Here. This is good. Fuzhu (dried rolls of bean-milk cream).

140
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,280
I want to toast you, Teacher Lin.

141
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,130
This time when Chai Qian came to talk to me,

142
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,100
I felt my potential to become a psychologist.

143
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,360
Congratulations.

144
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,920
I'm even introducing you to a new client.

145
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,760
Teacher Lin, you should eat more.

146
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,100
Today, there's plenty of meat and wine. You don't have to worry about the cost at all.

147
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,270
This evening, Boss Xiao is paying the bill.

148
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,640
Okay. Thank you, Boss Xiao.

149
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,480
Hello, Sister Qian.

150
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,030
What's up?

151
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,600
What's wrong?

152
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,010
Chai Qian says that she doesn't want to come to see a psychologist.

153
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,750
Teacher Lin, I can't reconcile myself to it.

154
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,620
Sister Qian was such an outstanding, independent woman.

155
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,590
But these days, there's no light in her eyes at all.

156
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,100
I can understand your feelings.

157
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,800
But there's a principle in our profession; refuse no one, compel no one.

158
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:45,180

there is an outsider who is here distributing flyers. Also disturbing classes.

I am a guest lecturer. I'm not responsible for admissions.

If you want to be a graduate student, you have to depend on your own effort. Stop relying on shortcuts.

I will study hard and prepare seriously.

198

Originally, I was planning to come to your class every Monday.

199
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,270
But now I've caught the notice of the security guards.

200
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,650
I don't think I'll be able to come to class in the future.

201
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,940

that I'm not able to help Chao Qian.

203
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:44,790
That's why I want to apply to be a part-time graduate student.

204
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:48,200

Theory of self-authorship.

221
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:46,890

What's wrong? You've given up after just the first day of studying?

240

I want to talk to you about Chai Qian.

241
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,710
I'm not saying she has to come to you for psychological counseling.

00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:05,170
I just learned about something in this area and wanted to discuss it.

243
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,860
In analyzing Chai Qian as a use case, I realized

244
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,970
many of her important decisions have been influenced by her boyfriend.

245
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,910
Quitting and turning down an offer from a big company were all her boyfriend's decisions.

246
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,970
Do you think her current lack of self-confidence, indecisiveness,

247
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,700
and weak will are also because of her boyfriend?

248
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,790
Do you still remember what you said to me before?

249
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,810
Chai Qian once dreamed of a pack of wolves tearing into each other?

250
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:35,240
Wolves are pack animals. They share a very deep bond and trust.

251
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,640
Dreaming of a pack of wolves tearing into each other

252
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,900
may indicate that in real life, there is a crisis

253
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,280
of deception or trust with your partner.

254
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,580
What about you? How did you start suspecting her boyfriend?

255
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:53,170
A healthy romantic relationship should have mutual respect and understanding.

256
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,830
But it's clear that Huo Lang does not.

257
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:58,720
He routinely uses obscuring language like "I'm doing it for your own good" and "My heart aches for you"

258
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,580
to psychologically pressure her.

259
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,910
If your girlfriend experiences setbacks at work, a boyfriend should be like you were to me,

260
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,140
encouraging me, complimenting me, helping me.

261
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,970
Poor choice of words. Be more mindful.

262
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:19,640
That's not what...

263
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,470
Master Lin, are you free tomorrow?

264
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,040
What is it?

265
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:33,830
Chai Qian was grateful for my help in working through her emotions. She invited me to her house for a meal.

266
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,570
Can you come with me to check out the situation?

267
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,590
If you don't say anything, I'll take it as you agreeing.

268
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:49,260
- Xiao Xiao. <br> - Sister Qian.

269

Come.

271
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,970
Please come in.

Please make yourselves at home.

- Eat. <br> - Thank you, Sister Qian.

275
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:08,210
Sister Qian, I remember you used to live downtown. When did you move here?

276
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,290
This place is a bit far.

277
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:15,080
Huo Lang wanted to build a new house himself, so we moved here.

278
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,220
It's yummy.

279
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,640
Sorry, Xiao Xiao, for neglecting your kindness.

280
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,190
I canceled the psychological counseling.

281
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,410
Not at all, please don't mention it.

282
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,690
I think you seem like you're doing quite well today.

283
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,970
I am happy to see that you're recovering on your own.

284
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,350
Huo Lang proposed to me.

285
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,440
I don't know why

286
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,950
ever since he proposed, my emotions have been very stable.

287
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:51,650
I can sleep well without melatonin.

288
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:56,000
But I remember the last time you called me, it sounded like you were crying.

289
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,880
Did he do something to you?

290
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,590
Not at all.

291
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,800
How could that be? He's always been good to me.

292
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,280
It was me who was unable to control my emotions.

293
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,860
But he always says things to make me feel better.

294
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,960
Oh right, the day I called you was the day he proposed to me.

295
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,190
I think I was just really moved.

296
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:22,490
<i>Xiao Xiao, thank you for your help.</i>

297
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,880
<i>But I don't think I can accept your suggestion to go to psychological counseling.</i>

298

299
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:42,070
<i>There's something I've been thinking about for a long time.</i>

300
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,660
<i>Qianqian, marry me.</i>

301
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,110
<i>Let's keep our promises to each other.</i>

302

304
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,750
<i>Okay?</i>

305
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,410
<i>Did you know, ever since I met you in the library,</i>

306
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,200
<i>I've felt like the little prince in The Little Prince</i>

<i>I'll be your little prince. Okay?</i>

311
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,180
<i>I'm sorry, I didn't even prepare a birthday present for you.</i>

312
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,870

00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:33,240
- Congratulations, Sister Qian. Marriage is a wonderful thing. <br> - Thank you.

315
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,050
I remember you telling me you two were a campus romance, right?

316
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,710
That's right.

317
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,100
<i>Your glasses lenses are dirty.</i>

318
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,910
<i>Let me.</i>

319
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,860
<i>That was the first time I saw him.</i>

320
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,810
<i>He was gentle, attractive, and considerate.</i>

321
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,200
<i>His scent and voice,</i>

322
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,020
<i>his act of cleaning my glasses,</i>

323
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,240
<i>all matched my idea of a perfect man.</i>

324
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,960
<i>I fell in love with him at first sight.</i>

325
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,870
<i>Help me with two more questions.</i>

326
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,970
<i>Do you not listen in class?</i>

327
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:59,890
<i>Now that the test is coming up, I may have to come to you again.</i>

328
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,540
<i>- Right. <br> - Qianqian?</i>

329
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,210
<i>- We'll leave first. <br> - Bye.</i>

330
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,740
<i>Bye.</i>

331
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,530
<i>A'Qian. It's my birthday today.</i>

332
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,020
<i>Can you spend my birthday with me?</i>

333
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,430
<i>Just for a little while.</i>

334
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,770
<i>Sure.</i>

335
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,670
I wish you a happy birthday.

336
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,440
Thanks for celebrating my birthday with me.

337
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,890
Did you know?

338
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,310
When I was very young,

339
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,450
my parents got divorced.

340
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:02,560
Ever since my mom left,

341
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,330
there was never anyone to celebrate my birthday with.

342
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,770
Qian Qian, will you be with me?

343
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,970
I want you by my side for every birthday in the future.

344
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,640
Alright?

345
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,920
Look,

346
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,540
the stars in the sky

347
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,610
are so beautiful.

348
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:49,640
Every star is so close together.

349
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,530
So beautiful that it makes me feel lonely.

350
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,690
Do you know that to me, you

351
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,390
are the brightest star?

352
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:09,450
<i>I won't be afraid of the long journey and will slowly look for your planet.</i>

353
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:14,510
From now on, I won't be as lonely as before.

354
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,420
Oh, yeah. Have you heard the story, The Little Prince?

355
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,050
Of course I've heard it.

356
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,930
Do you know what? Since I met you in the library,

357
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,650
I've thought that I'm like that little prince in The Little Prince.

358
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,630
That met his one and only rose

359
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,540
Qian Qian, I want to be tamed by you;

360
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,130
To be tamed by one another.

361
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,400
Will you be my one and only rose?

362
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,740
I'll be your king.

363
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,790
Okay?

364
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,710
Even though it's my birthday today, I still want to give this to you.

365
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:00,040
So that it's with you everyday. Everytime you hear the sound,

366
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,130
you'll think of me.

367
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,290
Sorry I didn't even prepare a birthday gift for you.

368
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:09,820
Dummy. You've already given me one.

369
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:15,250
Staying by my side is already the best gift ever.

370
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:19,880
At that moment, I felt that even if a thousand people like me

371
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,820
He was the only one that made me feel special

372
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,150
The most treasured person.

373
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:43,230
Huo Lang, there's something I want to discuss with you.

374
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:48,380
But I don't know it'll be a good or bad suprise.

375
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,080
I knew you were going to meet up with me for a suprise.

376
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,810
Say it. What is it?

377
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:56,710
The company has a great opportunity for anyone to pursue an MBA degree.

378
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,910
I really want to go.

379
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,960
This is amazing news for our Qian Qian.

380
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,530
Congratulations.

381
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,370
It's at a business school in Beijing. Considering that,

382
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,840
It seems like the company cares about me.

383
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,440
Beijing.

384
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,870
But there's no free meals in this world.

385
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,910
Are they going to make you sign a contract?

386
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:25,890
Like after going, you can't leave the company for 10 years.

387
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:30,310
You're right but it's not 10 years only 5 years.

388
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,760
But right now the biggest problem is

389
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,350
if I want this opportunity,

390
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,000
then every weekend I have to go to Beijing for class.

391
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,330
I won't be able to accompany you.

392
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,690
So I'm still thinking about it.

393
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,650
Qian Qian

394
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,530
Right now we're only able to hangout as the two of us on the weekends.

395
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:58,040
If you go to Beijing to study for an MBA,

396
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,380
then we won't be able to meet every weekend.

397
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,340
It's not that I don't have faith in us,

398
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,580
I just care too much about you and I don't want any chance of something bad happening to us.

399
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,830
Also now a lot of MBAs

400
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,600
are just used to showcase and not able to gain any knowledge from it

401
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:26,820
Qian Qian. Maybe you shouldn't go.

402
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,220
If you leave,

403
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,470
I'll be very lonely

404
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,990
You won't abandon me right?

405
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,300
-Let's eat. <br>-<i>Though because of him,</i>

406
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,090
<i>I gave up an amazing opportunity</i>

407
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:55,160
<i> But in life you give and you take </i>

408
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,020
<i> We were able to gain each other </i>

409
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:08,890
<i>Later on, I gave birth to a child and was promoted to manager</i>

410
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:12,110
<i>Sometime I'd be working on several big projects </i>

411
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,640
<i> My performance at work began to decrease </i>

412
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,020
<i> I began to question my abilities. </i>

413
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:21,170
<i>I started to have insomnia, not eating and suffer hair loss.</i>

414
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:25,380
<i>Thank god for Huo Lang. He stayed by my side.</i>

415
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,130
<i>He said that I shouldn't stress too much with work.</i>

416
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,510
<i>Just quit. I'll take care of you. </i>

417
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,620
<i>He's always there for me. </i>

418
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,590
<i> You'll always be my little fox. </i>

419
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,200
<i> I'll always be your little prince. </i>

420
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,310
Also I wanted to ask. Since you don't have work,

421
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,350
Where do you get the money for daily essentials?

422
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,200
Did you have a severance pay?

423
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,500
All the expenses are carried out by Huo Lang.

424
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,620
I would record down the daily expenses for him.

425
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,370
Then what about when you go out?

426
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,660
Like going out with friends or home to visit your parents.

427
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,180
He would give me money.

428
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,210
My daily expenses aren't very expensive.

429
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,790
I don't like to buy name brand items.

430
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:19,000
When resting, I like to stay at home.

431
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,130
Qian Qian.

432
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,700
How come you're home?

433
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,750
These two are?

434
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,160
These two are my friends. I invited them over for dinner.

435
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,130
- This is Xiao Beibei, who've I've mentioned to you before. <br> - Hello.

436
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,140
This is her colleague... <br> - Qian Qian,

437
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,460
Unexpectedly, I have to go on a business trip. Could you pack a bag for me?

438
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,560
- I... <br> - Don't worry. I'll entertain your guests.

439
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,660
- Then, please entertain them for me. <br> - Go ahead.

440
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,000
- Excuse me. <br> - No problem.

441
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,850
- Xiao Bebei. I've heard a lot about you. <br> - Hello, Mr. Huo.

442
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:57,850
- Hello. <br> - Hello.

443
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,420
Please sit down.

444
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:05,860
I'm very curious. How did you and Qian Qian meet?

445
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,150
The two of us? She was my first advertisement consultant. The two of us met at work.

446
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:13,330
When I met her, she was a well-known public relations manager in the business.

447
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,360
So, I've always thought it was such a pity

448
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,910
that she isn't working.

449
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:26,290
I think you might have misunderstood.

450
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,370
It's not me that won't let her get a job.

451
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:31,880
It's because of her inability to take the pressure that she can't go back to her previous position in the workplace.

452
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,050
The reason I hope she stays at home

453
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,520
is simply for her own good. I want to protect her.

454
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,270
Protect? I don't think that's protection.

455
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,780
You're just placing restrictions in the name of love.

456
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,570
Those words are rather extreme.

457
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,610
That's simply malicious conjecture.

458
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,020
I restrict her? Wait, you two.

459
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:54,550
What have you come here for today? To find fault?

460
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,420
We...

461
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,540
Excuse me. I have to catch a flight soon.

462
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,410
Since you two have finished eating,

463
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,680
you can leave if you please.

464
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,780
- Xiao Xiao. <br> - Your clothes...

465
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,290
What's this?

466
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:15,590
Ah, Sister Qian, it's nothing. Something's come up for us, so we're leaving.

467
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,930
You're leaving?

468
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,400
I'm really sorry. I didn't look after you well.

469
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,970
- It's nothing. <br> - It's fine.

470
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,220
Take it easy, Xiao Xiao.

471
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,450
- Bye bye. <br> - I'll see you next time.

472
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:30,550
- Bye-bye. <br> - Bye- bye.

473
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,430
- Are you okay? <br> - Is everything ready?

474
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:35,830
Not yet. I want to ask you exactly how many coats you need?

475
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,700
Let's go. We'll pack it together.

476
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,970
It's fine. Sister Qian isn't in good shape right now.

477
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,750
Let's go.

478
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,720
Hurry, let's go take care of that.

479
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:06,060
So, you now come into my office as you wish, just like going home.

480
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,350
Mr. Shao said. Adding maple syrup to coffee

481
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:12,530
is your favorite. I made it especially for you.

482
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:16,190
It's all because of Chai Qian again, right?

483
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,970
You saw it at Huo Lang's place.

484
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:21,270
He himself said he loves Chai Qian; does this for her own good; feels bad for her.

485
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,820
But he actually uses those words to attack her confidence.

486
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,740
You can see they have a strange relationship.

487
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,080
Aren't you a professional whose emotions doesn't affect your objectivity?

488
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,340
You even come to me for this question. I will see if you can get into the program.

489
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:36,070
As my teacher, shouldn't you help your student resolve an issue; but you attack me instead.

490
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,730
Look This is the difference between you and Chai Qian.

491
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:42,840
When you encounter a verbal attack, you will instinctively resist it.

492
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,440
Most likely, when Chai Qian first started, she was the same.

493
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,910
Then why has she come to be in the state she's currently in?

494
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:51,460
When she encounters a verbal attack, she doesn't instinctively resist.

495
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,080
Moreover, she finds the reason from within herself.

496
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,250
Do you still remember how Huo Lang rushed us out?

497
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,320
Of course I remember. My hand still hurts.

498
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:15,560
Do you like old movies?

499
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,870
"Paula inherits a great sum of money from her aunt.

500
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:22,580
A man named Anton pursues Paula and becomes her husband.

501
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:26,040
In order to inherit this money as quickly as possible, Anton starts planning

502
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,150
to psychologically manipulate Paula.

503
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,210
By using psychological suggestion techniques in different occasions,

504
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:38,640
he slowly destroyed a very healthy, confident female protagonist's consciousness,

505
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,060
making Paula gradually doubt herself.

506
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,580
The psychological phenomenon of gaslighting came out of this movie.

507
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,020
To put it simply, it's using a close relationship

508
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:53,780
to slowly destroy the other person by poisoning their mind.

509
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,710
Any behavior that uses close relationships

510
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,210
to suppress someone else's confidence and individualism

511
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,140
and limits their thinking

512
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,090
are all forms of purposeful emotional manipulation.

513
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:12,980
- Luoluo, the lamp in your bedroom is nice. When did you buy it? <br> - It was given to me as a gift.

514
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,460
- Who gave it to you? <br> - I don't know.

515
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,740
You don't know?

516
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,470
That day when I went to the furniture store, this lamp caught my eye.

517
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:23,110
But my parents thought it was too expensive and wouldn't buy it for me.

518
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:26,850
Then when I finished paying, I suddenly saw

519
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:30,630
<i>that lamp had already appeared in my shopping cart.</i>

520
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:34,780
<i>Fold over.</i>

521
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:44,320
I've only heard of river snail girl(character from chinese folktale). Why? You're the long legged uncle straight from the book?

522
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,370
I'm telling you, someone must have a crush on you.

523
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,590
They're doing this to secretly pursue you.

524
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:53,860
Could this person really have walked out of a painting?

525
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,680
Look how giddy you are. Come, come.

526
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,880
Today, let's toast to Luoluo officially starting a new life!

527
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,560
- Cheers. <br> - Cheers.

528
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,430
How come you're only now arriving?

529
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:10,800
-We were waiting for you!<br>-Congrats, Luo Luo-chan!

530
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,990
- Thank you. <br> - Cheers! <br> - Congratulations.

531
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:16,370
Thank you.

532
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:18,740
Luo Luo-chan, try this first.

533
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,990
Life changing duck. From now on,

534
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:24,890
-you'll be someone completely new.<br>-You sure know how to talk!

535
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,540
Come on.

536
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,030
Um...I have some bad news for you.

537
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:38,960
Can my life...become any worse?

538
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,860
As a psychiatrist, I'm still an assistant and can't take my own customers.

539
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:47,660
I want to do the post-graduate entrance exam. All my reading materials stack up like a mountain, I can't finish them even if I stay awake all night.

540
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,490
And my ace life saver, Xiao Bei Bei.

541
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:53,020
I don't have any inspiration lately.

542
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:56,480
I know I haven't release anything.

543
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,620
Tell me! What other bad news? I think I can resist.

544
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:04,030
I am going to say it.

545
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:06,980
Xiao BeiBei successfully retract from the top 10.

546
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,340
I also discovered this social media feed named

547
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:13,570
Roaming around the word. They kicked us out from the list.

548
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,640
What is that?

549
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,900
Wandering the World？

550
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,520
-What is this? <br>-Let me take a look.

551
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,810
Why are you rich and still can't find someone that loves you?

552
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,300
Someone that truely love you do not care about your money.

553
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,390
The mistake they make when they pursuing a girl.

554
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:37,050
-All these girls' phycological status are...<br> - I did a survey.

555
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:40,600
This account teaches people how to chase women.

556
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,180
Chase women?

557
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,500
Is it possible that only men can register?

558
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:05,170

Xiao Qi, Big Brother is dead.

570
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:47,520
Teacher, I am here to offer my apology.

571
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,210
What thing to apologize?

572
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:52,700
I want to clarify that this is for work.

573
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:58,280
I suspect that when Huo Lang was dating Chai Qian, he used someone of mind manipulation methods on her

574
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:03,320
Sun Kale recently found this very popular social media feed called Roaming around the world.

575
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,610
I signed you up to one of their course.

576
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:11,610
Only man can enroll. They do not accept females.

577
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,640
How can you confirm Huo Lang is controlling Chai Qian's mind?

578
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,600
Chai Qian mentioned her love story with Huo Lang,

579
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,400
it's as beautiful as a fairy tale.

580
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,400
Also, Huo Lang always use the Love and responsible

581
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,440
taming theory in the Little Prince to brain wash Chai Qian.

582
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,590
When I heard that, that's disguised replacement concept.

583
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:36,060
Of course, I still can't confirm at this stage.

584
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,780
That's why I need you to listen to the course.

585
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,230
Teacher, look at this. I've already brought you the wipe,

586
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,160
and apologized. If you want to punish me, you can...

587
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,970
Didn't you say you will help me out all the way?

588
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:52,030
If you can't help me, I will find my way to get in.

589
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:56,770
Aren't you worry about this beautiful, cute and sexy disciple

590
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:59,220
will be tricked by the players?

591
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:03,020
Show me your hand.

592
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,870
I 'm not worry, you are Xiao Beibei.

593
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:19,300
I'm worried those players will be tricked by you.

594
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,000
Hey, Sun Kele, I sent you the location.

595
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,140
Can you come and attend the course?

596
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,940
Teacher, you are here.

597
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,350
Hi everyone, today, let's understand

598
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:21,140
what is PUA.

599
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:24,760
Before we understand what is PUA . We need to know PUA has four points.

600
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:29,210
Warm up ahead of time, focus on communication, treat each other truthfully and practicality.

601
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:40,790
Imagine how do you meet in order to show off your confidence.

602
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:44,080
You can find a stranger to rehearse.

603
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,400
- Are you alone? <br> - Yes. I'm on my own.

604
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:51,460
- Can I sit here? <br> - No problem.

605
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,000
- You are on your own?

606
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,770
My friend is in there for a meeting, I'm here to get some fresh air.

607
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,820
When you face her, do not get too close.

608
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:06,410
When you look at each other, you need to show a natural smile. Focus on you visual exchange.

609
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:09,080
Do not look her up and down and size her own body.

610
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,120
Do not get too close. You have to stay like this.

611
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,940
There are so many people inside, what are they doing?

612
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,400
Tonight, couple of my buddies are going to the club to make few rounds.

613
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,640
- What kind of club? <br> - Racing car club.

614
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,180
I heard there are a lot of race car clubs has minimum entry requirement.

615
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:27,490
For example, the race car cannot be less than ¥2.000,000.

616
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:30,410
Or you need to pay few thousand dollars in a lump sum for the entrance fee.

617
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:34,440
Before she asked you something, tell her something she is interested to know.

618
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,480
Our club's entrance requirement is even higher.

619
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,400
Not only look at our car's value,

620
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:42,850
we need to show them our respective assets.

621
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:44,890
That's amazing.

622
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:47,810
Look at this. Most of the women are passive.

623
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:50,190
They are looking forward for men to make the move.

624
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:51,930
A lot of women will respond to this.

625
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:56,610
If you want to know more, I can take you a ride tonight.

626
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:59,010
Have you tried speeding on the highway

627
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:01,610
and felt the feeling of swift as the wind and fast as the lightning?

628
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:04,050
It sounds good.

629
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,280
Next, we are going to talk about actual combat.

630
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,890
What's the core of PUA? It's to attract the person.

631
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:11,000
Based on the Law of large number, we will add

632
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,950
exquisite and attractive methods into it.

633
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,860
I am hungry right now. How about we find a spot to eat.

634
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,160
Sounds good.

635
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,570
<i>Okay. I will take you to a restaurant.</i>

636
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:26,500
<i>If you get a date with her, you are successful.</i>

637
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:31,510
<i>Later, you make up a story to keep her in the game.</i>

638
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:34,860
Hey, aren't we going to go eat?

639
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:38,860
Hey!

640
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:43,260
We just met. Isn't this going too quickly?

641
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:49,100
It's fine, you can pick up the call.

642
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,090
My ex-girlfriend. I actually just broke up not too long ago.

643
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,980
She is still contacting. I later found out

644
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,280
that what she likes is my money. She doesn't love me at all.

645
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,040
So that's what happened.

646
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,380
Recently, my mom got sick. It's stomach cancer.

647
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:08,830
When she was in pain, she couldn't even eat. My ex-girlfriend used to be very clinging.

648
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:12,360
After my mom was admitted to the hospital though, she refused to go to the hospital with me.

649
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,660
- Really? <br> - Yes.

650
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:17,280
However, when I first met you,

651
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,650
I felt that you are different than my ex-girlfriend.

652
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,560
Hey, your mom is in the hospital with stomach cancer.

653
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,180
Yet you are still in the mood to flirt here.

654
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,720
You really are a filial son. <br> <i>(sarcasm)</i>

655
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,510
What do you mean?

656
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:38,430
Could it be that your PUA class send all the students

657
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:40,210
the same sayings?

658
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,300
One is the departure of a mother and the longing for a warmth home.

659
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,480
The other is that even when your mom is dying, you feel that no one loves you. What is it?

660
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,040
Do you men only know the lie that your mom is dying?

661
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,690
- Where are you going? Come back. <br> - What?

662
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:54,080
Let me tell you. There are cameras everywhere here.

663
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,760
So what is there are cameras and surveillance?

664
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,480
Just try and touch me. It will all be recorded.

665
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,310
- I will touch you, what about it? <br> - Wait, wait, wait.

666
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:04,080
Why are we tugging and pulling in public for? Stand there.

667
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,780
Who are you? What does my coaxing my girlfriend have to do with you?

668
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,480
Wait, did you say you are talking to your girlfriend?

669
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,030
- That's right. So what? <br> - Is she your girlfriend?

670
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:15,320
- If I say so, then that's what it is. <br> - Then trying calling her girlfriend. See if she'll answer you.

671
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,060
Call her.

672
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,360
Fine. Just leave.

673
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:35,540
- How are you? Is your arm all right? <br> - I'm fine.

674
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,060
Director Fan, how come you are here?

675
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,410
I was talking to friends about something. It just ended.

676
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:43,350
I was just walking around. I didn't expect to see this.

677
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:47,020
A hero saving the beauty, right? You owe me a favor.

678
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,710
Thank you so much for today, Director Fan.

679
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:52,250
As long as you are all right. It is time for dinner.

680
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:55,920
If you are free, then let's eat something to you can relax.

681
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:08,390
Let's hear it. Why were you in a dispute with a strange man in public?

682
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:11,530
It's a long story.

683
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:16,030
I have a friend whom I suspect is being controlled by his boyfriend via PUA.

684
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:18,930
I applied for a PUA class online.

685
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:22,930
-I want to spy on it. -Risk yourself.

686
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:29,480
Did you want to hear me praise you, saying you are capable or...

687
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,680
No. Originally, it was going well and I wanted to just get information from him before I leave.

688
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,320
Then I couldn't hold it in any longer and he started to make a scene.

689
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,010
- You couldn't hold it in? What did you say? <br> - He lied to me, saying that his mom has stomach cancer and is dying.

690
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:44,020
I was so confused and said, "Do you men only know the lie that your mom is dying?"

691
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:47,410
Oh gosh. You were don't spare others.

692
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:49,290
My speech is pale in comparison.

693
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:51,830
Pale in comparison. Who is better than you?

694
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:55,990
My teacher is better. You met him before, his name is Lin Shen.

695
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:58,440
Him?

696
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:16,260
I think today's experience is a live case.

697
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:19,030
I plan to write about today as a public post.

698
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:21,570
To expose the evil doings of the PUA classes.

699
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:26,300
To remind all the girls to stay far away from these manufactured b*stards and to not be tricked.

700
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:31,450
I didn't expect that a love expert would accumulate experience over time.

701
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,790
I have gained new knowledge. However, speaking of that.

702
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:38,710
Although work is important, you are a girl after all so be careful.

703
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,960
Thank you for your concern, Director Fan.

704
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:48,020
I am actually quite curious. As a relationship expert, is your experience in relationship very profound?

705
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:54,990
- Well, my experience is not as much as yours for sure. <br> - Mine?

706
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:03,860
As my investor, if you have any questions about love,

707
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:07,520
you can consult me. Free of charge.

708
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:11,060
I'm a single man, what relationship problems could I have?

709
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:18,320
However, being single may be my biggest problem.

710
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,730
Be careful, it's hot.

711
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,950
- Master? <br> - What a coincidence, Mr. Lin.

712
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:42,470
Hello.

713
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:45,700
Why didn't you answer my calls?

714
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,800
I'm sorry, Master. My phone was on silent mode.

715
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,420
I won't disturb you two. Continue eating.

716
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:06,510
Director Fan, I'm s-so sorry. I'll treat you next time.

717
