Xiao Qi, I already took care of those who are related to Zhou Rui.

24

Now, there's just one person left.

After you go back home, Remember to shut your door and windows.

29
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,300
When you have time, find a technician

to install a security alarm.

31
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,520
Okay.

32
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,510
I saw the news lately that a girl in the neighborhood

33
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,970
was being stalked and in danger.

34
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,750
What I mean is that when you see a suspicious person,

35
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,270
you have to remember to contact me first. Okay?

36
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,060
Okay.

37
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,330
Thanks for your concern.

38
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,630
Teacher Lin, Xiao Xiao

39
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,270
Sister Yan, why are you here?

40
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,830
I'm sorry. My phone ran out of battery and I came here without notifying you in advance.

41
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,810
Can I stay at your house for a few days?

42
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,290
Of course, you can.

43
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,780
Thank you.

44
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,220
What's the matter? Is this the danger a single lady living alone would have?

45
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,220
Let's go home!

46
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,900
Xiao Xiao, are you asleep yet?

47
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,640
Not yet.

48
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,810
What's the matter?

49
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,600
I...

50
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,850
I want to ask you for a favor.

51
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,910
It'll be my moral obligation to help.

52
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,200
I want to find myself back.

53
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,420
Even though I also learned psychology,

54
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,920
when it comes to my mother, I don't have a single solution.

55
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,020
I understand. It's difficult for a healer to heal himself.

56
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:31,320
Before I came to find you, I argued with my mother.

57
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,240
<i> Do you know what time it is?</i>

58
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,260
<i> Where have you gone the past few days?</i>

59
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,340
<i> You even turned off your phone.</i>

60
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,080
<i> I told you we had a team development. </i>

61
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,400
<i> You have to turn off your phone during the team development? </i>

62
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,890
<i> Didn't I tell you not to go?</i>

63
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,520
<i> Which is more important, matchmaking meeting or team development? </i>

64
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,900
<i> He's a good man.</i>

65
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,700
<i> You actually stood him up?! </i>

66
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,860
<i> Have all the years I spent teaching you</i>

67
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,810
<i> gone to waste?</i>

68
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,530
Mom, I don't even want to go.

69
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,050
Why do you have to force me?

70
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,670
I force you?

71
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,180
It's for your future and happiness.

72
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,240
Mom! Do you think I am living happily right now?

73
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,470
Are you saying you aren't?

74
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,800
If you don't think so, it's because you didn't listen to me.

75
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,360
Everything I do is for your own good!

76
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,060
For my own good?

77
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,520
Right. Perhaps in your perspective, you think it's for my own good,

78
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,280
but have you thought about what type of life I really want to live?

79
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,610
Now, the life I'm living isn't even what I want.

80
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,490
<i> Why you forced what you wanted upon me? </i>

81
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,760
What nonsense are you speaking about?

82
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,080
Why can't you understand?

83
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,940
Perhaps all the years I spent

84
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,820
to raise you has gone to waste.

85
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,330
<i> That's right! I'm heartless and ungrateful! <i></i></i>

86
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,490
I fought on purpose.

87
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,070
And I purposely left without saying good-bye.

88
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,530
My mom will certainly go to Shaolin to find me,

89
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,630
so I hope that you and Dr. Lin can help me.

90
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,800
Help my mom.

91
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,550
We both need to leave the past behind.

92
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:39,310
I beg you and Dr. Lin to give this diary to my mother.

93
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,870

95
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,310
After returning from the team development, my daughter uncharacteristically had a big fight with me.

96
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,200
Was she being irritated by something

97
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,970
that caused her mood to change so drastically?

98
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,970
Before I answer your question,

99
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,670
could you please first answer a question?

100
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,710
Ask ahead.

101
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,260
Do you really understand Zuo Yan?

102
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,860
What do you mean by that?

103
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,420
I have taken care of her since she was young.

104
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,990
How could I not understand her?

105
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,730
Is that my daughter's diary?

106
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,950
The key is still with me.

107
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,090
Do you know that Zuo Yan has another diary?

108
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,680
Just like how you don't understand her other side.

109
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,850
Today, I skipped class and didn't attend tennis class.

110
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,650
My mom found out

111
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,160
and was very diappointed.

112
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,740
<i> I just wanted to make you to be more superior. </i>

113
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,840
<i> Back then my classmate was exceptional in tennis so she was admitted with extra credits and studied abroad. </i>

114
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,540
<i> If your mom had this little extra credit, I would have been admitted by that university. </i>

115
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,600
<i> Why can't you understand your mom's intentions?</i>

116
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,460
<i> I said I dislike tennis!</i>

117
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,830
<i> Why do you have to force me to go learn it?</i>

118
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,440
<i> Unlike you, my father would never force me to do things I hated. </i>

119
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,870
<i> In the future, I won't care about you.</i>

120
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,150
<i> - I will not force you ever again. Go find your father!</i> <br> - Mom!

121
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,750
<i> I argued back for the first time.</i>

122
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,700
<i> She locked me outside the door and said she didn't want me anymore.</i>

123
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,820
<i> she told me to go find my father.</i>

124
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,880
It's impossible for me to say those words.

125
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,260
I cannot.

126
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:19,310
A lot of times, verbal abuse from the closest family member could be hidden.

127
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,430
but it will hurt them even more.

128
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:27,200
Those unconscious words could stuck in Zuo Yan's heart.

129
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,100
I know that this is very hard to accept for you.

130
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:00,660
<i> I kept crying, apologizing, and begging her.</i>

131
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,680
<i> I know that she really loves me, and I really love her,</i>

132
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,000
<i> But I am suffocated by her love..</i>

133
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,750
<i> If love can make someone feel upset and hurt,</i>

134
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,820
<i> is that the right kind of love?</i>

135
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,140
<i> Come in.</i>

136
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,060
<i> Do you understand what you did wrong?<br>- Yes</i>

137
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,650
Mother's love can be unconditional but it can also be selfish.

138
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,980
I understand that you worked very hard

139
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,480
to bring up Zuo Yan. You are definitely a very responsible mother.

140
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,180
but a child is also an independent life.

141
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,260
We cannot demand her to achieve your life regrets.

142
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,710
That would be extremely unfair to her.

143
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,810
Auntie, you must live your own life.

144
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,470
<i>From young, we have been taught to listen to our parents.</i>

145
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,570
<i> Has your upbringing also been influenced by your parents</i>

146
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,350
<i> and there is moments that you wanted to escape .</i>

147
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,420
<i>Come home with me!</i>

148
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,530
<i>They also use their own experience to avoid us getting into any obstacles. </i>

149
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,100
<i> Drink one vegetable juice before you go to bed. It's go for your stomach and your figure.</i>

150
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,600
<i>From now on, don't buy these viscose rayon fabric.</i>

151
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,610
<i> They use their value to shape up our value in life. </i>

152
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,500
<i> I took so much effort to cultivate you is because I don't want you to suffer with him. </i>

153
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,760
<i> Whether it work or not, your mom will be your gatekeeper.</i>

154
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,470
<i> Everything I do is for your own good!</i>

155
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,850
<i> But it's this 'own good' that</i>

156
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,890
<i> makes us want to escape even more.</i>

157
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,480
<i> Because of this, we will have more stress and pressure.</i>

<i> Or build up a wall to cover up the others.</i>

159
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,980
<i> Completely fall apart and break down seems to be the only solution. </i>

160
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,900
<i> Let me tell you: I have my own abilities to chase after my own dreams.</i>

161
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,400
<i> Why do you have to force me?</i>

162
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,790
♫ <i> My self-hypnotism comes around full circle </i> ♫

163
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,200
♫ <i> There are many blocked paths in the direction I want to find </i> ♫

164
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,690
<i> I said I dislike tennis. Why must you keep forcing me to learn it?</i>

165
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,040
<i> This isn't even the life I want to live.</i>

166
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,790
<i> Why are you forcing your wishes onto me?</i>

167
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,970
<i> But we have all forgotten,</i>

168
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,630
<i> no matter whether you are the parent or the child,</i>

169

<i> you only come across this once.</i>

170
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,920
<i> You must learn and grow from the experience.</i>

171
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,330
<i> Since this is both of your first time,</i>

172
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:14,390
<i> shouldn't we use our own methods to teach others?</i>

173
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,820

Good Morning, Sister Yan.

180
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,540
Good morning, Xiao Xiao!

181
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,620
Hey, Xiao Xiao. You have a package.

182
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,610
<i> (Teng Hushi - Shengjiang University Student Administration Office)</i>

183
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,640
What do you want to eat later? I'll treat.

184
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,830
- The express mail you received this morning is your university acceptance notice?<br> - Yes

185
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,640
Isn't it Counselor Lin is the guest professor at Shenjiang University?

186
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,930
Now you will become his student?

187
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,040
Post graduate level one classes are all foundation courses.

188
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,410
Based on my professor's training schedule, I don't have his classes. But I could listen to his lectures.

189
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,370
It looks like you have already figured it out.

190
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,470
Hi!

191
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,640
How come there are so many good food?

192
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,760
Xiao Xiao is treating us all to good food and drinks. She has some news she wants to tell everyone.

193
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,810
Boss, white peach flavor.

194
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,450
Thank you.

195
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,980
Are you calling it official?

196
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,110
Xiao Xiao, you aren't dating now, are you?

197
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,720
Don't guess randomly!

198
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,460
Xiao Xiao has received the post graduate acceptance notice.

199
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,190
I will become a post graduate student.

200
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,990
Then we should all go celebrate tonight.

201
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,780
I will make the table reservation to celebrate Xiao Xiao becomes a post graduate student.

202
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,870
- <i> How come he isn't here yet? </i> <br> - I cannot make it tonight.

203
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,450
I can reimburse your expenses.

204
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,160
Thank you, Boss.

205
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,850
<i> Where do you want to go celebrate?</i>

206
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,850
I'm sorry everyone, but I have plans for tonight!

207
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,230
- What? <br> - But, I've already

208
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,490
booked a restaurant.

209
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,530
Teacher.

210
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:45,770
Anything is okay. You can pick whatever you want to eat.

211
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,050
Then, let's go.

212
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,480
Let's go!

213
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,560
- Slow down! <br> - I'm so happy!

214
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,590
Teacher, you even booked a private room?

215
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,350
If it's just us, we can just sit at the main dining room.

216
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,330
- Surprise! <br> - Surprise!

217
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,460
Are you surprised?

218
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,340
Why are you all here?

219
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,120
Dr. Lin sent us the address for the restaurant,

220
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,910
and told me to have everyone come here.

221
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,270
As soon as you left, we left right after you.

222
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,190
Surprise! Xiao Xiao!

223
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,650
Coesunelor Lin invited me here.

224
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,500
Sister Yan, let me help you order food.

225
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,980
Sure, you understand what Xiao Xiao wants to eat more.

226
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,690
Sit.

227
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,640
You sit there, I sit here.

228
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,240
Where do you think I'm taking you?

229
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,440
<i> (Anywhere is good. Where do you want to eat?)</i>

230
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,770
<i> How about this dish?</i>

231
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,490
<i>That's good! Is there anything else? </i>

232
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,470
Then, let's get this.

233
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,480
Sun Kele, you are still here?

234
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,280
I'm waiting for Xiao Xiao.

235
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,400
Bye. Counselor Lin.

236
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,030
- Then, how will Zuo Yan go home? <br> - What?

237
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,650
Xiao Jia and Xiao Rui are on going to the same direction.

238
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,190
Zuo Yan is alone.

239
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,750
I suddenly realized that I go the same way as her.

240
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,730
Then, please take care of Xiao Xiao.

241
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,530
Sure, hurry and go.

242
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,620
You go first.

243
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,910
Sun Kele has something and he left first.

244
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,090
How will you get home?

245
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,850
My home is close by. I can walk home.

246
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,850
Also walk off my food.

247
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,190
Sure.

248
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,030
What's the matter?

249
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,830
What are you doing? Hey!

250
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:14,140
Counselor Lin, Counselor Lin! I'm your student Ling Xin.

251
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,570
I am Counselor Lin, when I walked into the mall,

252
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,790
I saw someone who resembled you,

253
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,010
so I wanted to come and make sure.

254
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,070
I didn't actually think it would be you.

255
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,720
I thought someone was following me.

256
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,050
Counselor Lin, I have somethings to do.

257
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,960
I will go first. I'll see you next time.

258
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,630
<i> Xiao Xiao!</i>

259
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,970
<i> Xiao Xiao!</i>

260
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,120
Teacher, are you too anxious lately?

261
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,200
You captured your student thinking she was a thief?

262
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,710
I read some news recently.

263
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,900
There is something stalking single women in the dark.

264
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:16,160
How come there are so many similar news lately? Didn't you said in the community,

265
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,300
there was someone following you?

266
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:26,540
Just pretend like I'm worried about you looking like this. It's dangerous to go out alone.

267
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,560
Are you praising my beauty?

268
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:58,110
<i>Let me tell you, at the professor's office I bumped into our psychology professor,</i>

269
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,500
<i>I can't believe it. </i>

270
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,780
<i> How is he? Does he look fierce?<br> How can it be? He is super handsome.</i>

271
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,410
Look! Isn't he really handsome?

272
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:10,510
My God!

273
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:14,450
Gosh, remember to send it to me!

274
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:33,160
Hi everyone! Today is the first class of the new semester. Did you read the text book before the class?

275
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,730
- Yes! <br> - From the third to the fourth exam question,

276
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,500
please discuss it with your peers. We will all discuss it after.

277
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:54,880
<i> Teacher. Since when you start teaching foundation course?</i>

278
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,190
<i> That pom pom head is you. I thought I missed it.</i>

279
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,490
<i> It looks too young, it doesn't suit you.</i>

280
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,040
Alright, everyone, settle down. We will begin class now.

281
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,160
Clinical hypnosis is not the same as Stage hypnosis.

282
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,350
Only someone who has systematic training,

283
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,160
academic certification, professional qualification

284
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,410
and follow the ethical rules can practice.

285
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,360
Professor! Wait a moment!

286
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,840
You need to behave at school.

287
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,860
Professor Lin!

288
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,470
- What is the matter? <br> - I want to ask you something.

289
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,460
What do you think the difference between disciples and students?

290
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,020
<i>Li YiXin, how can you be so shameless!</i>

291
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,600
<i> - You randomly stole someone else's boyfriend? <br> - It's your boyfriend who messaged me first. </i>

292
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,790
<i> I just wanted to respectfully reply back to him.</i>

293
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,570
<i> If he messaged you, why didn't you block him?</i>

294
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:04,660
<i> - You are just shameless.<br>- What's happening here?</i>

295
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,170
<i>- Classmate, be nice to each other.<br>- What's the matter?<br>- You are shameless!</i>

296
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,800
What are you doing?

297
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,260
Are you okay?

298
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,440
Li Yixin, do you see that?

299
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,270
If you communicate with my boyfriend one more time, I will claw your fake face apart.

300
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,430
Just wait and go back to fix your face.

301
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,900
Whether someone has plastic surgery or not is none of your business.

302
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,400
Your face has been melted by 10 bottles of hyaluronic acid.

303
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,950
What do you want to do?

304
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,980
You want to be a hero and save the beauty?

305
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,650
Stop meddling!

306
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:40,810
Professor Lin, I really didn't tempt her boyfriend. It's her boyfriend that messaged me first.

307
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,630
- Look at that. <br> - Let me see.

308
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,920
Look at her. If you are not feeling well just said you are not feeling well.

309
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,870
Why would you pretend to be pitiful in front of my boyfriend?

310
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,820
You are shameless.

311
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,510
<i>(No need to say thank you.)(You must be hungry, do you want me to order take out?)<br> (I have eaten. Thanks.)</i>

312
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:57,190
"No need to say thank you." In this situation, it should say "No need to thank me" or "You are welcome".

313
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,870
You don't need to say "No need to say thank you", they don't seem to be close.

314
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,400
Would your boyfriend speak like this?

315
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,010
But why he has to say those words?

316
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,660
She wants to seduce him.

317
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,860
Here is even more obvious. "Why would you say Thank you again", "You don't need to say Thank you to me.".

318
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,040
Then, what do you want her to say?

319
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,650
If you're so amazing, why don't you go ask your own boyfriend?

320
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,550
Xiao Xiao.

321
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,660
Okay, go away.

322
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,450
Go back to class!

323
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,240
Go back to class!

324
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,280
Are you okay?

325
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,940
I'm fine. Here's your phone back.

326
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,600
Where did Professor Lin go? I didn't get the chance to thank him.

327
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,130
He is like that. He is warm inside but look cool not he outside.

328
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,020
Are you familiar with him?

329
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,860
You could consider it so.

330
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,500
Right, since we already met twice before, I forgot to ask you for your name.

331
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,960
My name is Xiao Xiao. I'm a first year student of the post-graduate program.

332
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,980
- I'm Li Yixin. <br> - How about we add each other on WeChat?

333
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,730
Okay!

334
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,060
Did you go to buy bandages?

335
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,520
If not, where would I have gone?

336
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:07,290
- Does it hurt? <br> - Of course!

337
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,380
If it hurts, that's right.

338
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,920
Only pain can make you remember.

339
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,960
You were right in stepping forward to help a classmate being bullied,

340
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,920
but the way you speak was full of offense.

341
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,690
The other person would think that you are trying to get on her nerves.

342
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,420
That way, you will make the other party even more angry.

343
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,620
I was wrong.

344
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,300
If you want to be a psychologist,

345
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,940
you need to know language is also a weapon.

346
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,820
so you should control your emotions.

347
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,650
Okay.

348
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,280
Stop checking out yourself. It's going to be the same.

349
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,450
<i> (Test what are you lacking in your emotional energy),<br>(Test whether he likes you or not),<br>(Enter test zone)</i>

350
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,300
<i> (When you become hyper and he can feel it too?)<br> (Yes)(No)</i>

351
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,990
<i> When you become hyper and he can feel it too?<br> </i>

352
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,810
<i>Yes! Another article with 100,000 read.</i>

353
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,650
<i>(No)</i>

354
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:32,580
Does he act cute in front of you?

355
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,820
<i> I have a question about the data collected from the previous class. </i>

356
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,830
<i> If self-reporting is an important method in collecting data, </i>

357
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,920
<i> then how can one be sure the accuracy of self-reporting? </i>

358
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,030
<i> This is an office, not a classroom. I will discuss this content in the next class. </i>

359
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,760
<i> Don't let a problem sit overnight and pass around. This has always been my study criteria. </i>

360
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,480
<i> Just teach me, guide me slightly for just 5 minutes, otherwise I won't be able to fall asleep tonight. Okay? </i>

361
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,640
<i> Please? I cannot wait until the next class!</i>

362
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,240
<i> I'm a fast learner. Why are you doing this, Lin Shen?! </i>

363
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,800
<i>(No)</i>

364
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,110
<i>( A test to determine if the person really likes you ) </i>

365
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,960
<i>(He only treats you like a friend. Do not overthink it.)</i>

366
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:35,550
<i> - Brother Xiao Qi! </i> <br> - You are here. Come sit down.

367
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:39,810
Haven't seen you for less than a month and what did you do to your face?

368
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,910
It's nothing. I carelessly got a scratch from somebody in school.

369
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:48,090
- You going to school now? <br> - Yes. I'm now in the graduate program and attend classes on weekends.

370
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:50,670
I've forgotten.

371
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:54,480
Time sure flies by quickly. You're already back at school.

372
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,450
How long has it been since we last met?

373
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,360
I was busy working everytime you asked to see me.

374
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,000
Luckily, today is Friday.

375
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,690
My teacher is out on a regular basis, otherwise I won't even have this little free time.

376
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:12,240
Hey, how did you end up in a fight on your first day of class? Didn't your professor care?

377
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,550
Do you know who our professor is?

378
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,780
- Who is your professor? <br> - Lin Shen.

379
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,610
What a coincidence.

380
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,700
Let's order!

381
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,360
Waiter!

382
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,880
What about your other classmates? Is it all going well?

383
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,820
It's all going well.

384
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,740
Okay, thank you.

385
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
What is the matter?

386
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,400
I don't know who, but

387
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,800
this person spread my WeChat around.

388
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,400
Now, random people keep trying to add me.

389
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,200
They're not even in my class.

390
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Might they be your admirers?

391
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
I have a friend.

392
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,600
She found out her admirer.

393
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Could you use your male perspective and explain?

394
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
Of course I can.

395
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,000
This man

396
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,400
is very anxious about his safety. Sometimes, his reaction is a bit too much.

397
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,600
As a friend,

398
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,100
every time I ask him to go out,

399
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,300
Clearly, just two friends can meet alone,

400
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,300
but he brings out a bunch of other people.

401
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I was just thinking.

402
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,200
I am flattered.

403
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,600
I promised I would help my friend,

404
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,700
so I have to do my best to help.

405
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,700
I already analyzed it for her from a woman's perspective.

406
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,900
so I wanted to ask for a man's opinion.

407
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,400
Right, that's true.

408
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,200
On the other hand, what you told me

409
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,300
still has a subjective view.

410
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,600
I don't know nor understand your friend.

411
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:15,000
My judgment might not be the best for that person,

412
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,200
but I can say

413
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,000
to share my experience as references.

414
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Perhaps you will have some

415
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
opinions or realization.

416
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,200
It's like this. Recently, I've taken a liking to this girl,

417
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,100
but I don't know what to do,

418
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,400
so I want to ask Xiao Bei Bei if she has any opinions.

419
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,000
Do you know what is the most important during ambiguous period?

420
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
What is it?

421
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,800
It's the push and pull that makes her interested in you.

422
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,600
Push and pull? Do you mean playing hard to get?

423
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,800
You can say that, Director Fan.

424
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,200
Playing hard to get is the typical strategy during ambiguous period.

425
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,400
People have stronger impression on

426
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,600
incomplete tasks than those completed.

427
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,400
What about after that?

428
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,600
That way, she will think that she

429
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,500
cannot touch or guess you clearly.

430
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
So you are saying that all the times before,

431
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,300
I have homework and work.

432
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,000
Okay, I'm kidding!

433
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,400
Eat up!

434
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,100
Okay, we've arrived.

435
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,400
Today, I really have to thank you.

436
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,000
Thank me for what? I wanted to treat you, but turns out, you treated me again.

437
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,600
I have to thank you.

438
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,200
When you meet a girl you like, you have to chase after her bravely.

439
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,300
Okay, I will be brave.

440
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,300
What is the matter?

441
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,000
Okay.

442
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
- Thank you! I'll get going now. <br> - Bye!

443
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,200
Drive safely on the way back!

444
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,200
- This is pretty good! <br>- What is the matter with you recently?

445
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,000
Why are you buying so much things?

446
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,000
What about this one?

447
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,500
This is too mature. It completely goes against your personality.

448
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,100
What type of personality do I have?

449
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,700
Something like this. It's pretty good.

450
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,400
Personality can be changed.

451
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,100
I think that this

452
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,800
mature woman personality fits me now.

453
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,300
Luo Luo, how about this?

454
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,500
Do I look good?

455
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,900
Auntie.

456
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,000
Is there such a sexy Auntie?

457
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,300
Yes, of course!

458
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,600
Yixin!

459
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,400
Xiao Xiao!

460
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,000
I didn't recognize you with this outfit!

461
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,600
What a coincidence. You've also come here to buy clothes?

462
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,000
I haven't found anything that suits me.

463
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,200
Oh, let me introduce. This is my new school friend, Li Yixin.

464
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,600
This is my best friend, Yan Luo.

465
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,300
- Hello. <br> - Hello.

466
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,000
Hey, Yixin. Do you want to eat dinner with us?

467
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,600
How about next time instead? I have some matters later.

468
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,200
Okay, sure. I'll see you back at school then.

469
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,700
Okay! Bye bye.

470
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,400
Bye bye!

471
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:18,800
Xiao Xiao, she looks pretty and kind.

472
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,800
She is a perfect lady.

473
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,960
Everyone wants to put their

474
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,380
These two students there. Do you have any questions?

475
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,200
I- I have a question, Professor.

476
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,700
Go ahead.

477
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,800
Professor, do you have a girlfriend?

478
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,600
We are in class right now.

479
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,600
In class, may you please ask questions related to the course?

480
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,200
<i> This is the office, not classroom. </i>

481
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,000
I apologize, Professor. I am late.

482
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,400
Okay, we will continue class.

483
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,600
Xiao Xiao!

484
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,900
- What a coincidence. You are wearing the same outfit!<br> - You have also brought it?

485
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,000
Yes, I wanted to try it after seeing you wear it.

486
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,000
but you won't mind if we are wearing the same outfits, right?

487
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,400
We are not celebrities. Why would we mind?

488
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,400
It's no problem.

489
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,800
Then, I will get going first, Professor Lin.

490
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,200
Bye bye!

491
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,820
When did your relationship with her become so good?

492
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,200
You two look like twins.

493
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,800
I was buying clothes at the mall, and I bumped into her.

494
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,600
Even your hair has changed.

495
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,880
Let's go.

496
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,200
<i> (The author is my good friend.)</i>

497
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:21,950
<i>(Thank you for helping me promote it!)</i>

498
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,600
I see his Moments has your cartoon.

499
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,600
When did he start reading your cartoons?

500
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,800
After reading it, he said he really liked it.

501
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,800
We both talked a lot, so I added him on WeChat.

502
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,930
Of course you should.

503
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:35,060
She loved your comics, didn't she?

504
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,910
Ask her. Ask her.

505
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,780
<i>(Today: The author of the amazing recommended comic is a good friend of mine.)</i>

506
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,740
Pause.

507
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,010
As you can see, the chameleon is an amazing animal.

508
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:38,850
It changes color depending on its surroundings.

509
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:42,370
This will protect it and help it catch prey.

510
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:44,340
People are sometimes like chameleons.

511
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,250
Depending on the social context

512
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:51,810
they will imitate other people's actions, expressions and even behavior.

513
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:56,210
Doing so has evolved into a very specific psychological phenomenon

514
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:58,350
known as the chameleon effect.

515
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,030
In 1999, psychologists Bargh

516
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:04,710
and Chatron observed in experiments that,

517
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:07,680
in the course of a natural conversation between the experimenter and the subject,

518
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,630
when the experimenters appropriately increased the number of times they touched their face or shook their legs,

519
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:17,570
interestingly, the behavior of the subjects increased.

520
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,600
The subjects were unaware of their behavior.

521
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,040
People always like people who are like themselves.

522
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,850
So you get acceptance in social groups through imitation

523
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:30,720
which is very much like Bandura's theory of learning imitation.

524
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,400
But let's not forget that chameleons

525
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,730
change their colors by themselves

526
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:47,090
to capture prey.

527
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:49,180
But let's think about it.

528
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,540
Properly imitating everyone has a certain range,

529
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:57,050
it will evolve into a kind of pathological behavior.

530
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:20,680
Xiao Xiao. Are you free?

531
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,570
I'm sorry, Xiao Xiao.

532
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:37,210
I'm... I'm not good.

533
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:40,050
Why are you crying?

534
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:42,460
What's going on?

535
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,620
You told Mr. Lin

536
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,340
to tell me what he said in class.

537
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,970
- Don't get me wrong. I can— <br> - I'm really sorry.

538
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:54,360
I had no idea I was causing you this much trouble.

539
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,790
I meant no harm.

540
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,220
You helped me last time.

541
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:04,250
I like you a lot and you have a great personality.

542
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,680
But in class and in the dorm

543
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:11,340
I don't have any close friends, you know.

544
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,150
But I really want to fit in

545
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:17,750
and be really good friends with them.

546
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:22,060
But the more I fit in, the more they turn against me.

547
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,680
I keep wondering

548
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:31,990
if they're treating me like this because I'm not really cute enough.

549
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:35,670
So I want to be like you,

550
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:39,260
with confidence and charisma.

551
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,840
But I think I made a mistake this time.

552
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:46,890
Xiao Xiao, can you forgive me?

553
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,370
You're thinking too much about things that don't exist.

554
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:52,230
I never blamed you for anything.

555
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:55,790
Don't let it make you cry.

556
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,000
Do you really forgive me?

557
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,300
I don't blame you at all. There's nothing to forgive.

558
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,990
Stop thinking so much and stop crying, okay?

559
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:10,730
Hi Kele.

560
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,320
I sent you a WeChat. Why don't you answer?

561
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,570
Check out the link I sent you.

562
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:20,530
Casually seducing someone else's boyfriend!

563
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:23,800
You are so shameless, why don’t you go back and take care of your own boyfriend?!

564
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,200
You better melt those ten hyaluronic acid balls on your own face first!

565
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,190
What's wrong with you?

566
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,830
<i>Why don't you go back and take care of your boyfriend?</i>

567
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,760
<i>She is hypocrite!</i>

568
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,160
<i>No wonder this Xiao meets so good at teaching people to fall in love.</i>

569
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,440
<i>I didn't know life was all about stealing boyfriends.</i>

570
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,090
<i>Don't comment until we know the whole story. Let's be reasonable.</i>

571
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,690
Who is it?

572
00:49:57,690 --> 00:49:59,570
I'm coming.

573
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,930
Master, why are you here?

574
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:50,840
I read all that stuff on the Internet.

575
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:53,890
What are you doing with this?

576
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:57,330
I thought it was an Internet friend who just gave me a gift.

577
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:00,740
A gift? What kind of gift?

578
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,280
This is what you said.

579
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:20,450
Do you mind if I sleep here tonight?

580
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:24,380
I'm afraid you'll get another gift later.

581
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,440
All right.

582
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,890
Tidy up a bit.

583
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:38,690
I'm usually very busy at work and I have to write an official account.

584
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:41,720
Correct. Then I...

585
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,320
I'll get you a quilt.

586
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,490
I don't want a pink one.

587
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,680
Master.

588
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:52,150
Let me tell you that

589
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:55,630
you care about me since you came to my house.

590
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:58,400
And you said you wouldn't try with me.

591
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,210
Good night, master.

592
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,420
Good night.

593
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,440
Don't live at your home for a while.

594
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,230
Move to a hotel.

595
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:45,010
I don't think you have the nerve to live there alone.

596
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,650
That's what you say.

597
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:50,740
But it's not like I'm gonna move into a hotel and I'll just lock the doors and windows.

598
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,700
<i>(Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center)</i>

599
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:01,760
- Sister Yan. Little Jia. <br> - Xiao Xiao. <br> - Please wait, Xiao Xiao.

600
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,550
Suan Kele told me that you received a threatening parcel last night.

601
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:08,350
He has such a big mouth.

602
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:12,100
If he doesn't tell us, how would you handle it?

603
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:17,120
- Good morning. <br> - Good morning.

604
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,860
Don't worry, Zuo Yan.

605
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,300
It's like a nightmare.

606
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:29,270
I've seen it all, all these years. Also, the netizens nowadays move on quite quickly.

607
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:32,910
After the storm has passed, who would remember this? Don't worry.

608
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:45,240
Come in.

609
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:49,570
Did you hear about Xiao Xiao's situation?

610
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:54,510
Since it's unsafe for her to live at home, do you want to reimburse her and let her stay at a hotel?

611
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,270
No need.

612
00:55:56,270 --> 00:56:00,490
'No need' as in there's no need to reimburse her or 'no need' to stay at a hotel.

613
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,910
No need for you to worry.

614
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,860
Are you working overtime today?

615
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:14,870
Yes, I need to finish the case. I also need to go school the next day.

616
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:17,550
Looks like you haven't been affected by the gossip online.

617
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:19,430
This way, I feel reassured.

618
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:21,820
Then, I'm leaving first. Don't stay too late!

619
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,090
Bye bye.

620
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:24,670
Bye bye.

<i>Li Yixin, if you dare bother my boyfriend anymore, I will claw your fake face apart.</i>

<i>Just wait to get it fixed again!</i>

623
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,390
You scared me to death. You haven't left yet?

624
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:27,280
That's right. I'm not leaving yet.

625
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,990
How come the electricity has stopped?

626
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:33,720
There's probably been a short circuit. We'll get someone to repair it tomorrow.

627
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,860
Don't work overtime now. I'll bring you home.

628
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:39,030
Sure, then let me tidy up.

629
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,300
I'm at my stop now. I should leave.

630
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,500
- Let's leave at the next stop? <br> - What?

631
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:13,190
In this time, it should be safer if you stay at my place.

632
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:35,010
Mentor, does that mean that we'll be together going to from work now?

633
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:40,730
Before we catch the culprit who sent the parcel,

634
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:45,590
as your superior, I am obligated to keep you safe.

635
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,840
Have you thought about who this culprit might be?

636
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,970
It's probably an anti-fan.

637
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:57,170
Even though there aren't many people who are yelling at you online,

638
00:58:57,170 --> 00:59:00,780
But who would dig for your address because of a video?

639
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:04,390
They even risked being caught to threaten you.

640
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:09,070
That's true. I'm not even that big a celebrity to even get anti-fans.

641
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:11,290
Perhaps it's a person you know.

642
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,360
<i> If you bother my boyfriend one more time, I will ruin your face.</i>

643
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,910
<i>What's it to you if someone had plastic surgery?</i>

644
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:20,340
<i>You just melt the hyaluronate injections on your face first!</i>

645
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,900
<i> What else do you want to do?</i>

646
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,750
I forgot to buy toiletries.

647
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:56,970
<i> How does he even know I like this color?</i>

648
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:38,920
Hello, I am Li Yixin. I am here to replace Suan Xiaoxue as assistant for teacher, Lin Shen.

649
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,260
Oh yes, Li Yixin? Xiaoxue told me already.

650
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:43,750
This is the information on the students of Xiaoxue's class.

651
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,590
Thank you, professor.

652
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:55,590
Thank you. I will leave first.

653
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:58,790
Professor Lin's requirements are very strict. Be careful.

654
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:00,550
Rest assured.

655
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:09,370
You just finished your surgery a few days ago.

656
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:12,220
Before you finish your recovery period, why are you here again?

657
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:16,140
After the previous surgery, I wasn't satisfied with my face.

658
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:19,890
I was thinking and I have a new suggestion.

659
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:22,850
I want the same chin as her.

660
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:50,370
