Maybe because you've lacked attention, lacked love that you've felt lonely

00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,060
It has 2 curling styles, right?

158
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,190
- Okay, then. Give me a new one. <br> - Okay.

159
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,800
Thank you.

160
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:30,230
<i> Ms. Zhou Yun. Ms. Zhou Yun. </i>

<i> Mr. Lin Shen. Mr. Lin Shen. </i>

162

Your granny is waiting for you at the information desk.

163
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,770
<i> Mr. Lin Shen, your granny is waiting for you at the information desk.</i>

164
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,820
<i> Please come to the information desk. </i>

165
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,790
- Lin Shen? It couldn't be Teacher Lin, could it? <br> - <i> Mr. Lin Shen. </i>

166
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:55,170
<i>Your granny is waiting for you at the information desk.</i> <br> - No way. How could there be such a coincidence?

167
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,120
Teacher Lin, you're at the supermarket too?

168
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,120
You came on your own to buy groceries.

169
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,440
We are going to the hot pot restaurant, are you coming to join?

170
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,200
If you do, leave me a text.

171
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,400
Your granny is here.

172
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,350
Come on, get in.

173
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,690
- What are you doing? <br> - Excuse me, can we use your office? It's an emergency.

174
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,790
- I'll get an invoice. <br> - Okay.

175
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,500
That Teacher Lin didn't return my text.

176
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,820
Wait for me at the exit. I'll give him a call.

177
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,590
Please get me an invoice.

178
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,990
They're all here too.

179
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,050
- Hello. <br> - Hello.

180
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,750
Was there a granny just here looking for someone?

181
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,180
Yes.

182
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,720
Did she find him?

183
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,290
She has already gone.

184
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,780
She has gone.<br>Yes.

185
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,020
That is fine, thanks.

186
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,770
No problem. Is there something else I can help you with?

187
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,560
There's nothing else you can help me with.

188
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,200
Then, I wish you happy shopping.

189
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,240
I am leaving.

190
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,050
The invoice?

191
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,640
He's gone.

192
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,100
He knew.

193
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,010
What could we do?

194
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,850
Keep it, I will handle it.

195
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,320
Alright.

196
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,880
- It's all bagged up. <br> - Done.

197
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,250
Let's go.

198
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,010
Teacher Lin, it really is you.

199
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,870
It really is you, Teacher Lin.

200
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,530
I just heard from the announcement, granny is looking for you, she found you?

201
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,180
She is back for resting.

202
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,070
So sorry.

203
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,230
Then, will you come eat hotpot with us tonight?

204
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,690
Right. come have hotpot with us.

205
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,950
Come eat hotpot together.

206
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,620
He has to go to spend time with his elders.

207
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,100
That's true.

208
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,260
Why don't I ask her for advice?

209
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,810
I have her Weixin account number.

210
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:35,480
Hey, Granny, we've commandeered Lin Shen.

211
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,520
Uh, don't be mad.

212
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,710
<i> Hey, Granny, we've commandeered Lin Shen. </i>

213
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,670
<i>Uh, don't be mad. </i>

214
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,280
Cheers.

215
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,380
- Thank you, Boss Shao. <br> - Thanks for treating us, Boss Shao.

216
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,220
Thanks for coming to my home.

217
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,320
Come more often in future.

218
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,030
Has something come up, Teacher Lin?

219
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,570
Nothing much. <br> - Maybe Granny sent some news.

220
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,170
News? She can't even use a cell phone. Send news?

221
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,540
Granny hasn't eaten yet, should we go to get her here to have a meal together?

222
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,650
No need, she has eaten at home already.

223
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,350
I go to washroom.

224
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,320
Washroom? Sit down.

225
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,630
Grab some duck. It's fun with 5 people. It's no fun with 4.

Do you want to run?

230
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,400
What do you want?

231
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,800
Your granny is here.

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,400
I'm the cleaner from 58 Home.

233

Auntie, please come in.

Okay.

Come on in.

What's the matter between you two?

237
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,500
Which two?

238
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,000
Do you really thought that I wouldn't know who was the person behind the broadcast room door

I'm telling you, Lin Shen. As your partner,

241
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,400
as Xiao Xiao's boss, I have the right to know about the office romance.

242
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,000
It's not what you think.

243
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,400
It's not what I think?

244
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,600
Then tell me where you are now?

245
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,800
We live together.

246
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,000
We are very patient, you guys are living together?

247
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,500
I'm begging you, please let me go.

248
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,600
You just move in together, and she is setting a certain time for you to return?

249
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,300
Thank you! Please forgive me.

250
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Counselor Lin is taking off?

251
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600

<i> Every look and every smile, it lingers in my heart for a long time. </i>

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,000
Anyways, self sentimental is my forte.

279
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,200
What is this, Sun Kele? You are such a douchebag. Overbearing Monster?

280
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Hello. I couldn't hear you. I'm still here.

281
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,500
Counselor Lin is here.

282
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,800
You are on the phone?

283
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,000
Sun Kele wants to confess to Sister Yan.

284
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,400
This is his confession statement.

285
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,000
Look at this? It won't work.

286
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,400
Okay, you two carry on. I'm not going to interrupt you.

287
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,600
<i>Don't be! Counselor Lin! Counselor Lin!</i>

288
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,000
<i> Can you help me out here?</i>

289
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,000
If you haven't shown any nice gestures to Zuo Yan and rush to confess,

290
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,200
she will only find it awkward.

291
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,800
No matter how beautiful your statement is, she be embarrassed.

292
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,400
I agree. Talking about how to create fondness to your love interest,

293
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,900
this is the biggest question in love psychology.

294
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,600
You need to do something to move her.

295
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Then, as the psychology specialists, can you tell me what to do.

296
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,000
Let me explain it with neuroscience, our brain generates the feeling of love.

297
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
When people encounter love, their brain will generate this chemical substance

298
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,800
that stimulate the happiness area.

299
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,000
It will create the illusion of love.

300
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
This chemical can release through psychology hints to the opposite person.

301
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,600
It's the darkness effect, cross bridge effect, including intermittent reinforcement

302
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,600
can also stimulate the love adrenaline.

303
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,400
But Sister Yan studied psychology and she was a top student.

304
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,400
She can easily tell by the small tricks.

305
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,000
That's why I suggest you to go with the flow.

306
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,800
Am I right?

307
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,000
Let's go get a coffee.

308
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,500
Let's me go with you.

309
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,600
Hello? No sound again? Hello? I'm still listening. Hello?

310
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
First, you need to create opportunities.

311
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,300
Pop up in front of her under different scenarios.

312
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,200
When she sees you more, she will know you more.

313
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
This one is good.

314
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,000
In psychology, this is called Frequency effect.

315
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,500
When she sees you more often, the chance of her liking you will be increased.

316
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,400
- However, you need to come up with a good First Impression Effect.<br> - First Impression Effect?

317
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,200
That's her first impression toward you.

318
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,500
People typically determined their like and dislike based on their first impression.

319
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,800
That's it. I don't think I have any advantage.

320
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,610
You have to keep sending Sister Yan your love signals.

321
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,200
When you received those signals, it will be easier for her to like you.

322
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,700
How to send her signals?

323
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,200
Talk to her with the topics she is interested in.

324
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,400
<i> Give her the feeling of love. Create this habits and sense of security. </i>

325
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,200
<i> Also the affection of missing each other.</i>

326
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,200
People can in fact easier to fall in love to the person they like.

327
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,400
This is a Love Compensation Effect. But the actual case study need actual analysis.

328
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,600
If you use hints and ways to cater her interests,

329
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,000
and create this love illusion.

330
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,600
In fact, you are doing it to cater her but not the real you.

331
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,200
When the real you show up in front of her,

332
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,800
she might no longer interested in you.

333
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,800
If that's the case, love will become an illusion and then an imagination.

334
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,200
Just like bubbles. When you touch it, it bursts.

335
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,400
Counselor Lin, can you explain to me in plain language?

336
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,800
It means don't put up an act for too long, it will reveal your true intension.

337
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,200
Why don't we set up one or two incidents,

338
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,600
and let Sister Yan realized that you might leave her and stimulate her.

339
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,600
In this case, she will realize

340
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,500
that she has been deeply in love with Sun Kele.

341
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,400
G.K. Chesterton has said before, the fastest way to fall for anything

342
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,600
is let the person realized that they might lose them.

343
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,800
To my understanding on Zuo Yan, if you did that,

344
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,200
she might give up on you right away.

345
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,400
Let's set up couple of scenarios,

346
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,000
and let Sister Yan realized that Sun Kele is also very popular.

347
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,800
But you need to show your heart can only accommodate Zuo Yan.

348
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,200
What Xiao Xiao said is the Veblen Effect. It means when the price

349
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,400
of a product costs higher, the demand for it will be higher.

350
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,200
Let me set an example, just like property prices.

351
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,600
If the price of the property drops, people will hold on and wait.

352
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,000
When the property price increased, people will start grabbing it.

353
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But Sun Kele, do you think you are the property price in the eye of Zuo Yan?

354
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,700
What do you mean? You mean Sun Kele is no chance on Sister Yan?

355
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,100
In the contrast, Zuo Yan might have studied psychology,

356
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,500
but she can still fall into these

357
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,000
psychology traps.

358
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,600
Even you, so call Love Expert.

359
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,400
How can I be trapped?

360
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,500
When people interact, our brain uses seven to sixteen areas.

361
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,000
When they are in love, only four to five areas are more active.

362
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,900
Meaning,

363
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,600
when people is in a relationship,

364
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,200
their thinking ability is worsen compare to other situations.

365
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,000
It will let people sunken into unconsciousness

366
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,300
similar to hypnotization.

367
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,600
Based on this theory, you can find a private location

368
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,200
where people won't find it alarming.

369
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,600
For example, while you are waiting for a coffee. Give it a try.

370
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,100
Eye look at each other. Pay attention, you need to control the timing.

371
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,000
You need to stay two seconds longer than you typically do.

372
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,800
You only need two additional seconds.

373
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,500
More than two seconds, the person might ask you

374
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,500
"What's wrong? Do I have something on my face?".

375
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,400
When you ask her in her conscious status, then you can no longer lure her into the unconscious stage.

376
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,700
However, if that person doesn't ask,

377
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:10,600
meaning she might like you as well.

378
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,600
It might not be the case. What if that person has a stern mind?

379
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,200
Xiao, give this a taste.

380
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,200
It's a new product I discovered, it's very good.

381
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,500
Come.

382
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,000
What happened to you two?

383
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,600
Something wrong between you and Counselor Lin.

384
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,000
There is nothing wrong.

385
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,200
Are you guys in a fight?

386
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,400
Tell me about it.

387
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,060
They must have fought.

388
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,470
A few days ago, you looked like you were about to move into his house.

389
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,320
You said you were moving the moment I came back.

390
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,170
You even told me that you were moving in the morning and didn't want to waste one moment.

391
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,410
Xiao.

392
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:05,070
Actually, Dr. Lin isn't the kind of guy to please girls with sweet words.

393
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,930
But, it's always this type of guys

394
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,590
- who are the most reliable and practical. <br> - Who said he's not good with words?

395
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,900
<i> I've noted that. And then?</i>

396
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,550
<i> Hello?</i>

397
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,570
<i> What were we talking about just now?</i>

398
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:52,390
He had the mind to ask Sun Kele what they were talking about just now.

399
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:55,240
Then? Then?

400
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,040
Then...

401
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,640
Then, there's no "then".

402
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,950
- No way. <br> - It's true!

403
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,020
Some guys are more passive and like girls to be more assertive.

404
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,640
I'm already assertive enough. Am I supposed to confess to him?

405
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,690
In the push-and-pull war of love, confession

406
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:24,000
is the most important key point. Whoever says it first loses.

407
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,590
I've read that article too.

408

This is how I teach my fans too.

409
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,710
Could it be that my kissing technique is terrible?

<i> Do you think I want it to be like this? I can sit and wait around after all.</i>

468
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,670
<i> As a man, I need to make a gamble!</i>

469
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,340
<i> But, I'm really sorry, Mr. Sun.</i>

470
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,780
<i> You had a physical store before.</i>

471
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,780
<i> Your medical machines have problems.</i>

472
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,450
<i> We used to sell medical machines.</i>

473
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,410
<i> The concept of an online medical app caught in a recall turmoil</i>

474
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:40,920
<i> - did not pass our risk assessment. <br> - Stop bothering me!</i>

475
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,960
How do you feel, Mr. Sun? Are you still feeling okay?

476
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,400
Did I wake up prematurely?

477
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,000
I don't know what happened to me today.

478
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,460
It was quite successful the previous few times.

479
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,210
Today...why can't I relax?

480
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:09,480
Actually, I just saw that part of you were already relaxed,

481
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,440
yet the other part of you were still stiff and nervous.

482
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,900
Did something happen recently that made you stressed?

483
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,530
Dr. Xiao.

484
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,030
You...are you feeling unwell?

485
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,090
No, no.

486
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,820
Dr. Xiao, there is something that I wanted to discuss with you.

487
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,400
Go ahead.

488
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,080
Your customer service department called me.

489
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,660
They said that your senior psychologist, Lin Shen, has some free time.

490
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,310
I think my current situation is a bit complicated.

491
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,480
How about you transfer my sessions over to him?

492
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,450
Mr. Sun, your situation is not as serious as you think.

493
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:06,740
How about we stop here today? I'll inquire about your situation with Dr. Lin later

494
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,050
to see if you should continue with the current session plan

495
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,220
or to transfer you over, okay?

496
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,170
I'll call you to notify you, if you would like.

497
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,790
Okay.

498
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:22,430
We'll end it here today.

499
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,940
Xiao Xiao moved from your house?

500
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,140
I saw you two going around like a couple just a while ago.

501
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:33,250
You went to work together and went home together. Your relationship fell apart in just a short time?

502
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,030
No.

503
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,950
- "No" to the relationship or "no" to it falling apart? <br> - The former.

504
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:44,010
No way. I saw you two in the tea room.

505
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:54,670
I didn't mean to watch on purpose, I was passing by.

506
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:57,520
I didn't expect you

507
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,980
to only take advantage of the situation without taking responsibilities.

508
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:03,460
- Do I look like someone like that? <br> - Let me have a look to see if you are.

509
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,690
You do.

510
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:20,450
- What? <br>- It's not that I'm not taking responsibility.

511
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:23,860
I just haven't thought about how to confess.

512
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:27,410
You've already kissed her. How else do you want to confess?

513
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,440
She has already said on her public account.

514
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:34,810
To a girl, a ceremonial confession is very important.

515
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:39,180
It means that the other person places a lot of importance on this relationship.

516
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,950
<i> Friendly advice from Xiao Bei Bei:</i>

517
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:45,260
<i> Boys, you mustn't think that just a hug or a kiss means that you're now dating the girl.</i>

518
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,170
<i> Girls needs a ceremonious feeling.</i>

519
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,490
<i> Ceremonious represents the importance you place on the beginning of a relationship.</i>

520
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,370
There's logic in her words.

521
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:57,090
- Have a good think then. <br> - Do you have any advice?

522
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:00,700
Advice...I don't have any.

523
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,810
But, I have create opportunities for you.

524
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,560
Didn't Yan Luo just come back from a signing tour?

525
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,300
Yeah. She helped Xiao Xiao with moving house last week.

526
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,310
When I invited Xiao Xiao to dinner last time, she didn't come. This time,

527
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:18,450
we will invite the both of them and no one else, so it's just the four of us.

528
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:21,560
We'll say that it's for celebrating the sellout of Yan Luo's "Dream Garden".

529
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:34,480
Are you really trying to create opportunities for me?

530
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,500
I am.

531
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,950
Why do I feel like you're not the more I listen?

532
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,730
Tell me honestly.

533
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:45,480
One shouldn't verbally reveal it even if they have seen through it.

534
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,470
Give it to me.

535
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,810
If your stomach is unwell, don't drink cold water.

536
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:55,160
I have no appetite.

537
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,430
You need to take some food even no appetite, it is late for meal already.

538
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,780
When did you start having stomachae?

539
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,140
I pulled a few allnighters recently because of Sundong's situation.

540
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,100
I didn't eat breakfast in the morning either.

541
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,690
Is his case that complicated?

542
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:23,040
Tell me the general situation.

543
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,110
This Mr. Sun works as a medical agent.

544
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,460
He used to be Lejian's national agent.

545
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,390
- Lejian? <br>- Yeah.

546
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:34,570
Even though he started off with nothing from that,

547
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:38,830
because a recent batch of medical machines had problems,

548
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:41,650
on top of the recent bad reputation of Lejian,

549
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,610
nobody is willing to invest in him.

550
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,720
Anybody would feel difficult in this situation.

551
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,400
His condition was improving after a few sessions,

552
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,540
but I don't know what happened lately,

553
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:03,010
his condition has become worse again. He even displayed behaviours of self-harm today.

554
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,740
I really want to help him.

555
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:09,150
But, I haven't thought of a better idea.

556
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:12,330
After all, I've only just started as a psychology intern.

557
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,150
You've already finished your clinical psychology class.

558
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:18,220
His condition has also previously improved,

559
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,550
which means that you're doing exceptionally.

560
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:28,210
I'm thinking, could he have encountered something unexpected lately?

561
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:31,910
How about this,

562
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,090
you and your supervisor should investigate his case again.

563
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:39,720
But, this visitor of mine thinks that I don't have enough experience.

564
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,120
He said he wanted to be transferred to you today.

565
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,330
- Really? <br> - Yeah.

566
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:47,170
Let's not talk about this, let's talk about something lighter.

567
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:50,350
Boss Shao is inviting us to dinner tomorrow night, let's invite Yan Luo too.

568
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,490
- Invite Luo Luo? <br>- You don't know this,

569
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:55,750
but Shao Ning is now Yan Luo's...

570
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:58,990
biggest fan.

571
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:01,800
Alright. I didn't go to dinner when the three of you went last time.

572
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,940
When she came back, Xiao Rui said Boss Shao's house had many bottles of good wine.

573
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,470
I'll be the decider of that this time.

574
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,900
<i> Master.</i>

575
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,560
<i> Thank you.</i>

576
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:23,250
No. You can't drink.

577
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,570
Why?

578
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:27,020
Your stomach hasn't gotten better yet, listen to me.

579
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,180
Why should I listen to you?

580
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,210
Because I am your–

581
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,340
Your master.

582
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:43,020
It's great to be having this gathering today.

583
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,950
It's to celebrate the publishing of Yan Luo's "Dream Garden".

584
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,890
Let's hope it can sell better and better in the future.

585
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,900
Let's cheers to this wine.

586
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,780
- Cheers! <br> - Cheers. <br> - Cheers.

587
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,360
Xiao Xiao, you can't drink. Hey–!

588
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,900
The last glass. We shouldn't waste wine.

589
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,050
Enough, enough. I brought the thing you like to drink.

590
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,610
Don't leave any wine.

591
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,350
- Is your stomach okay? <br> - I'm fine.

592
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:19,220
<i> (Saturday menu:)</i>

593
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:34,120
<i> (Saturday menu: <br> Pasta, burger)</i>

594
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,090
I'll clean these things up.

595
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:58,040
The two of you, sit. Keep talking.

596
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,910
Thank you.

597
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,840
You're welcome.

598
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,600
I'll clean up with you too.

599
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,080
- Thank you. <br>- Me too. <br> - I'll clean up too.

600
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,020
No, no. The two of you don't need to.

601
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:20,350
Xiao Xiao's stomach isn't well. If you need to, the two of you can go home first.

602
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:21,690
I'll clean up with Yan Luo.

603
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:23,760
We don't have any plans. I'll clean up with you.

604
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,160
You really don't need to.

605
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,460
- You really don't need to. Who asks their guests to clean up? <br>- Okay.

606
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,230
Then, you clean up with Yan Luo.

607
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:32,930
Let's go.

608
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:37,010
- We're leaving. <br> - We'll take our leave then, Boss Shao.

609
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,390
Bye bye.

610
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,690
- Drink more warm water since your stomach is unwell. <br> - Got it!

611
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:47,340
- Where are they? <br>- They have plans, they left first.

612
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:52,600
- I'll clean up with you. <br> - No, no. Just let me clean up.

613
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:00,290
Luo Luo, you're a guest in my home.

614
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:03,300
You really don't need to tidy up, just let me do it.

615
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,120
I came to your home because you wanted to celebrate with me.

616
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,980
You even made a whole table of tasty dishes.

617
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,230
In the end, you even washed the dishes. How unsuitable of me.

618
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,330
These are things I should do.

619
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,940
And Xiao Xiao too,

620
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:19,570
they left without telling me.

621
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,760
Mr. Shao.

622
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:33,450
Are you creating opportunities for them to be alone?

623
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,950
Yeah.

624
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,480
Let me do it.

625
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,860
- I'm sorry, Yan Luo. <br> - Let me clean up.

626
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,760
I'll do it, I'll do it. No, no, I'll do it. Don't hurt your hands.

627
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,580
- I should do it. <br> - I should do it, really.

628
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,020
Mr. Shao, I'm sorry.

629
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:31,700
It's getting late, I'm heading home.

630
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,290
Luo Luo.

631
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:51,930
Young man, buy a bouquet.

632
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,230
Buy a bouquet.

633
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:02,440
Young man, your friend is quite pretty. Buy her a bouquet.

634
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,630
There's no need, Auntie. Thank you.

635
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:07,750
Buy one, young lady. It's a token from your boyfriend, take it.

636
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:11,360
Auntie, you've misunderstood. I'm not his girlfriend.

637
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:16,290
Right, Auntie. She's not my girlfriend.

638
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:25,180
- Auntie, I'm going to buy all of these. How much are they? <br> - You, you...

639
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,910
She's not my girlfriend now, it doesn't mean she won't be in the future.

640
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,960
I'll scan your code. How much are they?

641
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,230
I'll give you a discount since you're buying all of them. It's ¥105.

642
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:35,450
Okay, ¥105.

643
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:38,380
I've finished scanning. Thank you.

644
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,420
Come in.

645
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,050
Boss Shao.

646
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:58,440
Dr. Lin, this is your schedule for next week.

647
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:03,710
Okay, thank you.

648
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:12,840
Let's eat lunch together later.

649
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,760
I'm sorry, I have plans at midday.

650
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,280
I'm sorry, I was asking Shao Ning.

651
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:25,210
I'm sorry, I have paid leave in the afternoon.

652
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:28,200
If there's anything you need, ask Sister Yan. Don't ask me.

653
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,630
What a blatant office romance.

654
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:38,820
It's even filled with tension. I want to fire the both of you.

655
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:41,700
What office romance? Let's continue.

656
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:45,700
You talk first. What did you do to her last night?

657
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:48,330
What do you mean?

658
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:50,070
Xiao Xiao never wears rings.

659
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:52,820
Today, not only did she wear a ring, she has one on each finger.

660
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:56,650
She is announcing that she is single. What do you think?

661
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,260
We do not discuss private matters in the office. Let's continue.

662
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,800
But mine is private matter too.

663
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,140
Okay, okay. I won't scatter salt on your wound.

664
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,040
Let's get back on track.

665
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,230
I'm now suspecting that Yan Luo has attachment issues.

666
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,200
<i> Mr. Shao, I'm sorry.</i>

667
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,700
<i> It's getting late, I'm heading home.</i>

668
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:32,660
I probably need you and Xiao Xiao's help.

669
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,760
<i> Yan Luo!</i>

670
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,230
<i> Yan Luo!</i>

671
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,100
<i> Yan Luo.</i>

672
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,980
<i> Stop hiding from me, Yan Luo.</i>

673
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:09,320
<i> Yan Luo. Don't hide from me, Yan Luo.</i>

674
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,690
<i> Luo Luo, give me another chance. Luo Luo. Yan Luo.</i>

675
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:13,990
<i> Yan Luo. Yan Luo, don't hide from me anymore, okay?</i>

676
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,020
<i> Luo Luo. Where are you going? Don't hide from me anymore, okay?</i>

677
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:22,580
<i> Yan Luo. Stop hiding from me, Yan Luo. Yan Luo!</i>

678
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:23,850
<i> Don't hide from me anymore, okay? Yan Luo!</i>

679
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,900
<i> Yan Luo! Yan Luo!</i>

680
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,490
<i> Where are you going? Yan Luo, I'm begging you. Okay? Yan Luo.</i>

681
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:31,500
<i> - Yan Luo! <br> - Leave! Stop following me!</i>

682
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,310
Brother...

683
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:45,180
Who?

684
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,840
Coming, coming!

685
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:54,940
Who is it?

686
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,680
- Why are you here? <br> - Didn't we agree to get lunch together?

687
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,730
You don't pick up my call nor reply my text.

688
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:01,450
I come to see what happens.

689
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:04,500
I am sorry, I just overslept.

690
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,440
I was rushing for the deadline last night.

691
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,520
I slept until just now.

692
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,400
Wait for me, I just get changed and can go.

693
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,800
No problem. Let me do it.

694
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:30,670
Didn't you cut out reliance on sleeping pills after breaking up with Wang Su?

695
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:32,820
When did you start again?

696
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,340
It's nothing.

697
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:40,010
Yan Luo, I'd be even more worried about you if you don't tell me.

698
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:49,000
I'm so tired.

699
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,740
What's wrong?

700
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:05,910
Every time I want to start a new relationship,

701
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,380
or if I have any new ideas,

702
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,230
he will definitely appear in my dreams.

703
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:18,020
In the dream, no matter where I go,

704
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:21,040
wherever I escape to, he'll always find me.

705
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,080
He doesn't want me to start over again.

706
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:26,840
Luo Luo,

707
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,490
I think I don't deserve love.

708
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,920
Nonsense! You're so talented.

709
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,360
I know Wang Su hurt you really badly.

710
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,640
But it doesn't mean that all the men in the world are like that.

711
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,530
We're fine.

712
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:41,300
Don't go into self denial.

713
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:45,590
Don't think too hard.

714
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:47,770
We're fine.

715
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,290
It'll get better.

716
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,030
It'll get better.

717
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,680
Come in.

718
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,690
- Boss Shao. <br> - Yes.

719
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:16,760
I thought you were adjusting your schedule? How comes you're here?

720
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,350
Boss Shao, I remember you received an attachment injury case before.

721
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:23,890
Could you tell me more about it?

722
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:26,660
Why are you suddenly interested in attachment injury?

723
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:29,930
I have a potential patient who has been struggling with this.

724
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:32,340
You're talking about Yan Luo, right?

725
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,560
How do you know?

726
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,390
I can interpret.

727
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:39,520
Yan Luo condition hasn't been great recently.

728
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,520
It might be because she has the intention to start a new relationship.

729
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,590
That's why she's been experiencing frequent nightmares.

730
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:46,510
She dreams that Wang Su wants to hurt her.

731
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:48,820
To stop her from starting her new life.

732
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:52,400
These symptoms you mention are quite present.

733
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,900
Boss Shao, since you have so much experience, how about you take it on?

734
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,280
I can't help you with this.

735
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,270
Why?

736
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,410
You should know that in this line of work there is a rule.

737
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:18,200
A consultant cannot have any feelings

738
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,900
- with the consultee. <br> - Yes.

739
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,720
What does this have to do with Yan Luo?

740
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:38,820
Unless you want to break off the relationship between the two of us–

741
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:42,040
No need. No need. Just giving me some tips will be fine.

742
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:46,440
Oh right, I think you can watch a movie called,

743
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,910
'The Heart is a Lonely Hunter'. That should help with Yan Luo's case.

744
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:54,160
The main characters in the movie have fearful avoidant attachment and dismissive avoidant attachment respectively.

745
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,900
The psychologist's trauma therapy is strongly rejected by the main character's main consciousness.

746
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:03,060
The obstacles that come from the subconsciousness shields consciousness

747
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,950
from directly facing the hurt and emotional stress.

748
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:09,290
Okay, I won't give you any more spoilers. You should watch it yourself.

749
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:11,700
- Two tickets? <br> - Go with Lin Shen.

750
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,580
We'll also need everyone's strength after that.

751
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:18,710
This is about Yan Luo.

752
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:20,990
I will definitely go.

753
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:28,240
<i>(Tengqing Road Station)</i>

754
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:35,910
<i>(Teng Yuan Movie City)</i> <br> - It should be this place.

755
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:43,540
- Hello. <br> <i>- Hello, is this Mr. Lin?</i>

756
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,660
<i>This is from Jia Ren Nursing Home.</i>

757
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,600
Why isn't he picking up?

758
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,170
Hello?

759
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:11,860
The situation with the nursing home is done.

760
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:14,500
It is going according to plan.

761
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,220
I will leave to rest to you.

762
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,990
Okay. Got it!

763
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:26,480
Be careful.

764
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,060
Don't take any rash actions before the next move.

765
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:30,760
Wait for my call.

766
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:34,150
<i>I'll be responsible for Xiao Xiao's side. Don't interfere.</i>

767
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:35,970
Okay.

768
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:38,810
<i>She's an important part of our plan.</i>

769
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:41,920
<i>Don't fall too deep and ruin the bigger picture.</i>

770
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,440
<i>Otherwise, I won't hold back.</i>

771
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,560
He didn't even turn up. How can I fulfill my dream?

772
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:18,120
It's all rigged, how could there be plane tickets to Bali?

773
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:36,420
Don't torture it any more. If you have any wish, I'll make it come true.

774
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:38,330
