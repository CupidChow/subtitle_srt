My dear princess, are you willing to let me take care of you 'til death do us part?

16
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,910
You're so annoying!

17
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,930
- Is there anything burnt? <br>- Something burning?

18
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,500
What is it burning?

19
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,120
It's my flaming heart toward you.

20
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,720
You!

21
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,450
- Is there something wrong?<br> - Nothing is wrong.

22
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,980
Do you like this one or that one.

23
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,860
I think this one is really pretty. What do you think?

24
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,010
I think whatever you wear is pretty.

25
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,810
I'm going to take this call.

26
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,630
Hi, Director Chen.

27
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,400
Right now?

28
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,810
I'm with my girlfriend picking out the wedding gowns. Can you find someone else?

29
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,240
No, don't please. Okay, I'm coming now.

30
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,200
What's the matter?

31
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,210
Director Chen. He wants to change the proposal and I need to go back.

32
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,440
If you have something urgent, you can go first.

33
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,120
But you'll be alone.

34
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,600
I'm fine. You can go.

35
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,260
Then I'm really going.

36
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,630
I'm leaving.

37
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,420
My cellphone is on silence mode.

38
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,890
Look, not only that I didn't receive your phone call,

39
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,040
I didn't get any else's calls.

40
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,350
President Chen, I am sorry. I will be there right away.

41
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,190
Huo Lang.

42
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,860
They are already preparing the wedding?

43
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,760
Sister Qian!

44
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,750
Xiao Xiao, what a coincidence?

45
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,180
- Counselor Lin.<br> - Hello.

46
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,890
You look beautiful.

47
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,110
You're trying on dresses already. Have you set the wedding date yet?

48
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,590
Not yet. I'm looking for a suitable venue.

49
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,910
When it's all decided, I'll send you guys an invitation right away.

50
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,360
Take a seat.

51
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,260
Are you guys... going on a date today?

52
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,850
No, we participated in a training course.

53
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,710
A training course? What's the subject?

54
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,010
It's about the relationship between genders.

55
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,660
Two you attending the course together?

56
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,110
No. It is a PUA course.

57
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,520
PUA?<br><i>(T/N: a person who studies the art of manipulating women by using sophisticated tactics, lies, and psychological tricks to seduce them)</i>

58
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,940
Is it the PUA that has a bad reputation online?

59
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,250
What are you attending the course?

60
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,310
The truth is Counselor Lin has to write a paper

61
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,970
about mind control in a relationship.

62
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,610
He has been researching online for the information.

63
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,370
We didn't expect there to be someone having a course about relationships

64
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,640
and it turns out to be a PUA training course.

65
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,740
If you don't believe me, ask him. When we were there

66
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,380
we saw a man in the advanced class. His girlfriend has better quality than him.

67
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,350
Then he slowly set up ways to suppress his girlfriend's confidence.

68
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,340
He doesn't allow his girlfriend to work or segregate her from society.

69
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,950
His ultimate goal is to not allow the girlfriend to leave him.

70
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,750
- This is too scary, isn't it? <br> - That's right.

71
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,780
But then it depends on the person.

72
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,910
Some man loves his girlfriend too much.

73
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,050
He doesn't want her to work too hard,

74
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,070
that's why they don't allow them to work.

75
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,030
Just like Huo Lang.

76
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,140
Mentor, do you think Chai Qian got my message just now?

77
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,010
I don't think she gets it. What should I do next?

78
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,910
I can't tell her Huo Lang is using PUA, so don't marry him.

79
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,070
They have been dating since college, she will not believe me.

80
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,300
Chai Qian should be familiar with wedding planning.

81
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,530
Of course. Wedding is considered a micro-events for PR firms.

82
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,110
Didn't you ask me what should we do next?

83
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,420
When someone is having two contradicted perceptions.

84
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,710
The person will feel uncomfortable with the contradiction.

85
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,720
At the same time, the person will try to change one of the perceptions,

86
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,750
to dissolve the discomfort. Chai Qian is doing this.

87
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,250
If you want to completely change someone's perception, you need to do it step by step.

88
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,100
We can use hypnosis to wake up the true desires in her heart.

89
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,910
Mentor, are you not mad at me anymore?

90
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,930
Mentor, I'm sincerely apologizing to you.

91
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,020
I'm sorry.

92
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,780
I'm sorry, I won't do it again in the future. Mentor, I swear!

93
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,850
You are such a short-tempered person!

94
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,790
<i>Hello, Sister Qian, I've found a hotel that would be great for your wedding banquet.</i>

95
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,480
<i>- Why don't you come and take a look. <br> - Where is it?</i>

96
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,930
I'll text you the address. You'll see when you get here.

97
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,280
You're... on the 2nd floor?

98
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,190
Yes, yes.

99
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,660
- Chai Qian. <br> - Xiao Xiao.

100
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,540
I know something at the hotel and asked about the booking schedule.

101
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,370
Next month, there are a few good dates that are still available.

102
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,880
- I think this is a really nice setting. <br> - Be careful.

103
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,730
But, for such a big event, you have to see it for yourself.

104
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,280
Thank you, Xiao Xiao.

105
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,690
But there is going to be an event tonight at this banquet hall.

106
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,960
There's a public relations company team inside making arrangements.

107
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,720
The two of us can just look at the basics of the banquet hall.

108
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,290
Okay.

109
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,510

Do you something, Xiao Xiao?

119
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,120
The very first event I arranged after I got a job

120
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,160
was right here.

121
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,730
Really?

122
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,560
Oh, I remember now. The first time the two of us first met back then

123
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,920
you were arranging an exhibition here.

124
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,890
I specifically came to see you there, right?

125
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:51,210
When I saw them, it took me back to those days.

126
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,440
But, afterward, I never got the chance

127
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,270
to continue doing public relations work.

128
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,680
How can that be?

129
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,690
Hey, how about this? Why don't you arrange your own wedding banquet?

130
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,800
Me?

131
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,690
But...could I really do that?

132
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,230
Of course you can. You can plan your own wedding.

133
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,340
It will be more meaningful that way.

134
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,970
The theme for the wedding ceremony is The Little Prince.

135
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,450
Look. The professional art designers at our company

136
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,030
especially designed this for the two of you. For the arrangement of each table,

137
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,460
we plan to use green and yellow colors for the tablecloths, as well as roses,

138
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,090
to emphasize the theme of The Little Prince.

139
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,290
This is very creative.

140
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,110
Actually, all of this came from your wife's personal creative input.

141
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,820
For our part, we've just carried out her ideas.

142
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,170
You could say that your wife's abilities, compared with our company's own designers,

143
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,990
- are on the same level as our senior managers. <br> - Thank you.

144

Let's continue looking at the main color tones for the wedding.

We have a few choices for you to make, Mr. Huo.

<i> My dear, you're a consumer. </i>

160
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,060
<i> What you're paying for is their work and their creativity. Why do you have to tire yourself out doing it yourself? </i>

161
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,190
<i> Wait. In our lifetimes, we'll only have one wedding. </i>

162
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,240
<i> What's wrong with taking care with the planning? </i>

163
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,970
<i> Do you think they're complimenting you for the work you've done? </i>

164
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,400
<i> You're a consumer. The consumer is god. </i>

165
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,000
<i> These perfunctory compliments are so you'll buy more of their creativity. They're only too glad to do that. </i>

166
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:32,210
<i> Huo Lang, I can distinguish very clearly sincere compliments from forced kindness.</i>

167
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:36,130
<i> Besides, before you knew that I was the one who designed the wedding, you also praised it. </i>

168
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,980
<i> Why is it that as soon as you heard that I was the one who designed it, you...</i>

169
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,680
<i> Why couldn't you hear that I was also just praising it in passing. Huh? </i>

170
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,970
<i> I think that this time it's not that others won't acknowledge me. </i>

171
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,950
<i> Instead, it's you that won't acknowledge me. </i>

172
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,440
<i> I spent my heart and time on this </i>

173
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,550
<i>because I wanted to create a unique wedding for us. </i>

174
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,960
<i> Even if I didn't do well, I still worked very hard on it. </i>

175
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,800
<i> Why do you have to use other' people's standards to judge me? </i>

176
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,750
<i> Qian Qian. </i>

177
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,440
<i> How have changed to become like this? </i>

178
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,630
<i> That warm person I know...where did she go? </i>

179
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,650
I don't know what's wrong with me lately?

180
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:51,730
I admit that I was the one who brought up resignation back then.

181
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,650
Huo Lang has helped me all along the way.

182
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:57,940
But, yesterday when he said those things,

183
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,420
it sounded so loud in my ears. I couldn't stand it.

184
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,130
During the time when I've been working on the plans for our wedding,

185
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,460
coming up with ideas, designing,

186
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,390
Running to the hotel to take measurements; consulting with the team about materials.

187
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,400
To my surprise, these have been my happiest days recently.

188
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,420
Sister Qian, do you remember that course on relationships

189
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,150
that I mentioned to you before?

190
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,000
Are you talking about mind control?

191
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,070
PUA is using this so call "Gas Light Effect".

192
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,180
They will often using the negative words to tell you ou can't do it, or you have a problem

193
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,760
in order to brain wash the person.

194
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,710
After a long period to time, any outstanding woman will become low esteem.

195
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:48,210
When you think back, you can remember what Huo Lang did to you.

196
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,670
Have you missed any minor details.

197
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,880
Recently, there is an extremely popular online forum called "Roaming the world".

198
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,860

209
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,800

222
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,440
I didn't sleep well these few days.

I'm fine, you sleep a bit longer. I will make you breakfast.

My baby is so domestic.

228
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,460
Babe, I checked the calendar.

229
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,330
Tomorrow is a good day. I also took the day off.

308
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,730
Then can I be cheeky and ask you to give her another chance?

309
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,890
She is indeed very experienced and strong in execution.

Curation is definitely her strength.

311
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,890
I didn't expect that you and our HR said exactly the same thing.

312
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:05,670
- So even your HR staff praise her, too?! <br> - That's right, they think highly of her!

313
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,000
Since you all think so highly of her,

314
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,690
it looks like I'll have to give her a chance.

315
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,370
Thank you, Director Fan!

316
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,810
Oh, that's right,

317
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,540
Last time you caught by your boss for having dinner with me, is everything okay?

318
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:21,080
No, everything's fine. It was really my fault for not answering his calls and made him worry about me.

319
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,190
Not your fault. I was the one to be blamed. It was me who dragged you along to have dinner with me.

320
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,040
What?! That jerk I ran into last time got me so scared!

321
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,820
Luckily you showed up just in time and saved me.

322
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,160
No matter what, I'll have to thank you.

323
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,600
I said that I'll treat you to a meal. It ended up that you paid again.

324
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,790
Today, no matter what, this meal is my treat.

325
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,290
Okay, okay. Then it's on you today.

326
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,760
Let's go to another restaurant.

327
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,290
I was wondering why you wanted to come to such an expensive restaurant.

328
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,800
So it's like this.

329
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,720
So you've heard them now. Those two aren't ambiguous with each other. You're can feel at ease now.

330
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,240
I just suddenly remembered that I don't like French food.

331
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,140
- Let's go. <br> - But I suddenly remembered that I quite like French food.

332
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,750
I'd like to order!

333
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,540
Sir, what would you like?

334
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,630
- Boss Shao! <br> - Hi, Xiao Xiao.

335
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,730
- What a coincidence. <br> - Yes.

336
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,150
They're looking at us.

337
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,010
Mentor, it was such a coincidence today.

338
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:49,350
You and Boss Shao were both at that restaurant.

339
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,340
Oh yes, mentor.

340
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,680
What are you doing?

341
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,290
Shanshan created this after coming back from studying abroad.

342
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:11,220
She's the really popular anonymous creator, Si Rui.

343
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,240
- She's quite talented. <br> - Yes.

344
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,300
It's good that her talent hasn't been buried.

345
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,760
The thing with Shanshan taught me a lot.

346
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,820
Oh, no, I mean it was mentor who taught me a lot!

347
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,210
Don't act so humble.

348
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,710
You also have the ability to self teach.

349
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:32,630
Oh right, Sister Qian has finally decided to return to the workforce.

350
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:36,230
She can turn over a new leaf. It's really good for her.

351
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,600
Yes, it's all good.

352
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:43,280
Mentor, I'm here. You don't need to walk me back anymore. I'm home.

353
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,140
Oh, right. Mentor, can you call my phone?

354
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,230
- Why? <br> - Hurry and call me.

355
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,050
Hurry.

356
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,950
<i>Boss is calling you. If you don't pick up he'll be angry with you.</i>

357
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:07,120
<i>Boss is calling you! If you don't pick up he'll be angry with you! </i> <br> - Change it!

358
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,510
Sounds good right!? You're not allowed to be angry anymore!

359
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,530
Thank you for walking me home! Bye bye!

360
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,260
Here, Xiao Xiao. Here, sit here.

361
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,040
Have a look at what you want to order.

362
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,730
- I arranged to meet with you so last minute. I hope I haven't interrupted your work. <br> - No problem.

363
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,230
I ordered this.

364
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,220
I ordered one of this...

365
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,160
This one looks quite delicious.

366
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,690
- I heard you called Dianfan's HR again. <br> - Yes.

367
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:49,090
I called Dianfan Group hoping that they would give me another chance.

368
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,620
This morning, I passed their last interview.

369
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,540
Next week, I can start work.

370
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,500
That's great! Congratulations!

371
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,380
You finally started a new chapter in your life.

372
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,750
It's a shame.

373
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,190
I sneaked out during lunch so I can't–

374
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,150
Then I will drink water in place of alcohol!

375
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,580
- Cheers! <br> - Cheers! Congrats!

376
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,840
<i>(Chai Qian, you won't succeed even if you have a new job.)</i>

377
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,090
<i>(Only I understand you the best. You can't handle the pressure.)</i>

378
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,160
What's wrong?

379
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,350
Nothing.

380
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,170
Then let's order this spaghetti.

381
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,670
Either way you can't gain weight eating lunch.

382
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,590
Hello.

383
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,580
I am.

384
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,280
How could it be?

385
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,340
- You must be Chai Qian? <br> - Yes, I am.

386
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,990
He hasn't come to work for many days.

387
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,040
I was worried something might have happened so I came by to visit.

388
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,960
I found that he tried to commit suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills.

389
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,000
It's lucky we got to the hospital in time for gastric lavage.

390
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,350
Since you're here, I'll leave now. Please take care of him.

391
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:40,500
- Sorry to have troubled you. Thank you. <br> - It's nothing.

392
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,650
You're finally willing to see me.

393
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,940
Why did you do this to yourself?

394
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,050
Can we sit down and have a conversation?

395
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,190
Actually, I never told you that I have depression.

396
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,830
For a long time, I haven't been able to feel happy.

397
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:36,710
That was until you appeared in my life. I was then able to feel happiness.

398
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,290
But now you want to leave. How can I go on?

399
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,100
Do you still remember this music box?

400
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,380
The past few days, whenever I feel like I'm in pain,

401
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,810
I would listen to it to go to sleep.

402
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,730
Qian Qian,

403
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,060
do you still remember our promise?

404
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:14,600
<i>Even though it's my birthday today, I still want to give you this music box.</i>

405
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
<i>Let it stay by your side.</i>

406
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,820
<i>Whenever you hear it's music, you'll think of me.</i>

407
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,820
<i>Sorry, I didn't prepare any birthday presents.</i>

408
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,540
<i>Silly, you already gave me one.</i>

409
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:33,250
<i>It is God's greatest gift that you are by my side.</i>

410
00:39:54,430 --> 00:40:00,110
Qian Qian, please don't leave me? I really can't lose you.

411
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,700
I love you.

412
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,900
You wouldn't want to see me die, right?

413
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:13,780
Don't think about these things. You should rest.

414
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,260
Then can you stay and keep me company?

415
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,590
Here.

416
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,120
Go to sleep.

417
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,790
Hello, Xiao Xiao?

Come in.

421
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,070
Chai Qian contacted me and said Huo Lang attempted to commit suicide.

422
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,610
Because Chai Qian broke up with him?

423
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,680
Chai Qian leaving him caused his depression to relapse.

424
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,590
Depression? Huo Lang?

425
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:20,460
Then we can help Mr. Huo.

426
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:29,940
Sister Qian, can you persuade Huo Lang to come Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center to get counseling?

<i>(Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center)</i>

Counselor Lin is a highly experienced psychology specialist. Listen to me

429
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,410
and try hypnosis.

430
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,630
Alright, I'll listen to you.

431
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,300
Let's go.

432
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,450
- Sister Qian. <br> - Xiao Xiao.

433
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,300
Mr. Huo, welcome. This way please.

434
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,720
Counselor Lin is waiting for you inside.

435
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,350
Come in.

436
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:10,970
Mr. Huo is here.

437
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,720
Hello.

438
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:16,710
Hello.

439
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,010
Sister Qian, let's wait outside.

440
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:34,120
Sister Qian, can you take me to Huo Lang's house for me to take a look?

441
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:51,020
Mr. Huo, I originally thought you would be really resistant.

442
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,280
I never thought you would be so cooperative.

443
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:57,220
I have depression. It's normal for Qian Qian to ask me to get treatment.

444
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,330
What is there for me to resist?

445
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:06,410
If you really have depression, I recommend you go receive specialized psychotherapy from the psychiatric department at the hospital.

446
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:11,090
However, you can do that while also receiving psychological counseling. Let's begin.

447
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:21,090
You should be very familiar with this song, right?

448
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,590
Do you still have the bottle of the sleeping pills he took that day?

449
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,440
I threw out the bottle while cleaning out the room.

450
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,830
But I've been busy taking care of him, so I haven't had time to throw it out.

451
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,490
It's here.

452
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,480
- Is it there? <br> - Yes.

453
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:23,250
<i>The pills don't dissolve in water yet dissolves in edible alkali. It really is a sleeping pill. </i>

454
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:26,270
<i>So he really wanted to commit suicide. </i>

455
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:41,130
- Can you tell me what happened that day in the living room? <br> - I was sitting on the couch

456
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,630
holding sleeping pills.

457
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:00,870
How did you get a hold of so many sleeping pills?

458
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,260
Sleeping pills are a prescription medication. Typically, doctors can only prescribe a week's worth at a time.

459
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,550
- I collected them. <br> - How long did you collect them for?

460
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,650
Around a month.

461
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,920
Starting from when Chai Qian broke up with me.

462
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,250
That must be about 30 pills.

463
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:34,990
After an hour, call Chai Qian and say what I told you to.

464
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:38,550
I helped you again. How do you plan to repay me?

465
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:44,520
Mr. Huo, when Chai Qian didn't pick up your call,

466
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,970
how did you feel at that moment?

467
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,840
Chai Qian, get back here!

468
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,240
Actually, all hypnosis is self-hypnosis.

469
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,690
Tell me clearly, what hypnosis?

470
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:56,440
If you don't want to, then you can truly enter the hypnotic state.

471
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,510
Chai Qian, where did you go? I loved you so much.

472
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:02,970
Why did you abandon me?

473
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,660
First,

474
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:07,010
take a few deep breaths.

475
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,790
Relax.

476
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:12,660
Are you willing to first remember

477
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,230
when you and Chai Qian first met each other?

478
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:18,210
Why do I need to go back to the past?

479
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,800
I don't want to go back to the past. Chai Qian, where are you?

480
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,800
Chai Qian! Chai Qian!

481
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,840
<i>PUA is actually story telling. Do you have any stories you like? </i>

482
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,240
<i>My favorite story is The Little Prince. </i>

483
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:04,090
<i>The little prince? Then let's tell a story about taming and domestication. </i>

484
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,340
The little prince and the fox became companions because

485
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:19,430
the little prince respected the fox's natural tendencies.

486
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,710
If the little prince didn't let the fox go to the forest

487
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:24,010
and made the fox follow him everyday

488
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:27,760
and live according to his will,

489
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,560
then would he still be the prince's fox?

490
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,440
What would their relationship look like?

491
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:44,550
Mr. Huo, I can understand that you want to use whatever strategy to keep Chai Qian by your side.

492
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,920
Even if you need to use shock, control, and lies.

493
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,470
But such a beautiful fairy tale like The Little Prince,

494
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:53,090
shouldn't become your tool for psychologically controlling Chai Qian.

495
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:56,730
If your willing, you can come find me again next week.

496
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:09,730
Looks like I need to fix the lights in my office.

497
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,740
Let me tell you. You can brainwash Chai Qian, but don't even think about brainwashing me.

498
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,920
Silly stuff like hypnosis,

499
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,920
I don't believe at all.

500
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:32,160
Qian Qian, let's go home.

501
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:41,960
Were you worried that I won't be hypnotized

502
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,160
so you went home to get sleeping pills?

503
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,000
I don't need it. Counselors are all liars.

504
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,240
Wifey, ever since we were together, I...

505
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,730
Did they tell you something?

506
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:01,740
Qian Qian, why are you trusting these liars?

507
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,800
Who's the liar?

508
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,720
When you tried to suicide,

509
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,960
did you know how many sleeping pills you ate?

510
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,610
She thinks he had at least 30 pills.

511
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:19,400
Crazy. Come, let's go home.

512
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,510
Qian Qian. We've been together for five years.

513
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:25,640
How can it compare to a few sentences from these outsiders?

514
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,850
Huo Lang, nothing that comes out of your mouth is true.

515
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:31,780
You even photoshopped your stomach pumping receipt.

516
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:35,860
<i> Sister Qian, do you still have Huo Lang's medical receipt from the other day?</i>

517
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,040
<i> There's a stomach pumping receipt.</i>

518
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:53,190
<i> (1:5000 Pumping Solution) <br> (Pumping Fluid Amount: Around 10,000mL)</i>

519
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,880
<i> This amount doesn't seem accurate.</i>

520
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,000
<i> Sister Qian.</i>

521
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,790
1 to 5000. 5000mL of pumping solution.

522
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:31,540
Your amount of solution is the exact same as this person.

523
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:34,160
- Isn't it a bit too coincidental? <br> - There's a lot of coincidental things.

524
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,030
This is the problem. I have a friend that consumed around 10 sleeping pills.

525
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,640
At the time, she used more than 5000mL of solution.

526
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,040
You ate more than 30 pills. Is 5000mL enough?

527
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,020
I...I can't talk to you!

528
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,910
Chai Qian, are you coming with me or not?

529
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,330
I'm asking you one last time.

530
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:56,140
- Are you coming with me or not? <br> - No!

531
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:07,350
Huo Lang, I'm begging you. If you loved me,

532
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:11,850
let me go.

533

534

<i> (When he went to the supervisor, he pointed out that the meeting was unsuccessful because he didn't stay calm or understand the motive of his visit.)</i>

535
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:44,620
<i> (He didn't come because he wanted to change himself, he didn't trust anyone either.)</i>

536

Qian Qian.

538
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:06,540
Qian Qian, listen to me. Don't leave. It was my fault.

539
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,390
Please give me another chance. Okay?

540
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:12,390
It was my fault. Really, it's all my fault.

Don't come looking for me.

Hey, Xiao Xiao, where are you going?

You clearly forced me into agreeing to that.

A letter to my mentee Xiao Beibei,

My mentee, Xiao Xiao,

- She has a once in 10,000 years god– <br> - Ah!

Louder. I can't hear you.

My mentee, Xiao Xiao, has a once in 10,000 years god-like looks

Every day at work, I have to carefully consider why God has favored her so much.

636
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:10,440
He actually allowed her to so easily pass graduate exams.

Does a person like her truly exist?

Good morning, Xiao Jia.

660
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:20,940
Good morning, Sister Yan. That angique shop you recommended to me yesterday was great to browse through.

661
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,510
Really? What did you buy?

662
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,950
- I bought an antique dress... <br> - Wait a second.

663
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:29,060
- Hello. This is Shaolin...<br> - <i> For the appointment at 4:30 pm, there are a few things I'd like bring up before then. </i>

664
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:30,010
Okay, no problem.

665
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:33,060
<i> - Every afternoon, I have to have a Vitamin C supplement at that time. <br></i> - Okay.

666
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:36,690
<i> I need you to prepare a fresh-squeezed juice 5 minutes ahead of time. </i>

<i> It must be from strawberries without the seeds and Chinese Hawthorne without the pit. </i>

668

<i> Squeeze California oranges without the membran 5 minutes beforehand and that's it. </i>

669
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:46,630
<i> Because, the way I see it, what's the difference between fresh juice squeezed over 5 minutes ahead of time and food past the sell date? </i>

670
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:48,180
<i> - Is that too much trouble? </i>

671
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,830
No trouble. Do you have any other requirements?

672
01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:53,780
<i> Also. The air conditioner must be maintained at 26 degrees Celsius. </i>

673
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:56,540
<i> Otherwise, I may feel chest discomfort. Also, please place 3 humidifiers </i>

Okay, then. Please, what's your last name?

<i> My last name is Xie. Let's leave it there. I'll contact if I think of other details. </i>

Sure enough. Our Sister Yan's clients are unpredictable.

- Hello. <br> - Hello.

680
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:26,230
Love is like at a very deep level.

681
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:30,430
It's an emotional output by humans that is freely given by oneself

682
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:34,830
or with self aware hope for satisfaction and happiness.

683
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:37,430

Mr. Lin, you have to go?

Yes.
