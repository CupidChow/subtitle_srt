3
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,200
Li Yixin, who do you think you are?

4
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,820
<i>Episode 11</i>

5
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,460
Teacher, I won't be home for dinner tomorrow. <br>Li Yixin asked me out.

6
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,440
She said that there is a newly-opened tasty restaurant near the northern door of the college.

7
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,830
You were not that close before.

8
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,840
Why do you become close now?

9
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,040
She is pitiful.

10
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,080
She doesn't have a friend while growing up.

11
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,650
She was bullied in school.

12
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,890
I can understand her. She is like Sister Yan.

13
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,920
Even though she was bullied, she went through it all by herself.

14
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,910
She really treats me like a good friend.

15
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,400
She even said she will collect the evidence to prove that Sun Rui was the one who posted the message anonymously.

16
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,970
-Why do you smile? <br> -You lost because your reaction is slow.

17
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,270
I can play the game for you. You go to the kitchen.

18
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,470
No. I can handle it.

19
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,380
<i>You must be tired. Drink some water.</i>

20
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,400
Take it.

21
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,590
Why do you sweat so much?

22
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,260
I will do it myself. Thanks.

23
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,950
I didn't seduce her boyfriend. He sent me texts first.

24
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,800
Look.

25
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,610
There is no need to say thanks.

26
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,480
<i> This situation you would normally say "Don't thank me" or "You are welcome".</i>

27
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,270
<i> "Don't need to say thank you" sounds like they are very close.</i>

28
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,760
<i> Does your boyfriend has the status to say that? Should he talk like that?</i>

29
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,240
<i> Then why would he say something like that? He wants to seduce her.</i>

30
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,840
<i> That's right! He wants to seduce her.</i>

31
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,600
This is even more obvious.

32
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,530
<i> "Why would you say thank you again? You don't need to say thank you to me."</i>

33
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,620
<i> What else would he want her to say?</i>

34
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,290
<i> If you are so amazing, why don't you manage your boyfriend?</i>

35
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,960
Xiao xiao.

36
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,930
<i>(You don't need to say sorry if you are unwell. Do you want me to take your attendance?)<br>( It's not necessary, thanks!)</i>

37
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,590
<i> That guy looks like Sun Rui's boyfriend profile picture on WeChat.</i>

38
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,710
You wait for a long time, right?

39
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,080
It is fine.

40
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,960
We are going to play for another set, will you watch me play?

41
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,560
The guy just now is Sun Rui's boyfriend?

42
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,120
Xiao Xiao, please do not misunderstood the situation just now.

43
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,460
It's your personal matter. Why would I misunderstood?

44
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,580
You still misunderstood it.

45
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,690
There is nothing going on between me and Peng Xu.

46
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:35,170
I am approaching him is because I want to know Sun Rui's computer login password.

47
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:39,280
I suspect that those malicious messages on Weibo were orchestrated by Sun Rui.

48
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,110
If she is the anonymous user who sent the video,

49
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,200
then she must have those processed video clips on her computer.

50
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,930
Perhaps we could even find evidence for those personal attack messages on Weibo.

51
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,140
Then, you are clear your name.

52
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,590
To be honest, you don't need to do this for me.

53
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:01,680
If Sun Rui saw you guys just now, you will bring yourself to another rumors.

54
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,860
It is not just because of you.

55
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,980
It's also for myself.

56
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,970
As you know, I don't have a lot of friends.

57
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,110
And, you are the first one who stepped up for me.

58
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:23,500
I don't want to lose you. Also, I don't want you to be attacked because of me.

59
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,610
"The wise man knows he knows nothing, the fool thinks he knows all."

60
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,870
I don't care what people online.

61
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,270
I have been self maintained blogger for a while, I can still endure this kind of public pressure.

62
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,520
Also, you are trying to trick him for Sun Rui's password,

63
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,560
that's consider invasion of privacy.

64
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,940
It's because of that, that's why I want to be up front with you.

65
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,630
You are the most important person to me.

66
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,110
I don't want you misunderstood me.

67
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,590
I'm telling you the truth,

68
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,810
I'm not interested in Peng Xu.

69
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,760
No matter he is Sun Rui's boyfriend or not.

70
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,260
I believe you.

71
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,640
Because I have someone I love.

72
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,140
Is it?

73
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,690
<i>Chen Ziran! Don't leave me. I beg you!</i>

74
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,570
<i> Chen Ziran!</i>

75
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,390
He is someone full of charisma.

76
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,950
Xiao Xiao, do you want to have lunch with me at Beimen?

77
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,900
How about tomorrow? I have classes in the afternoon and I left my books at home.

78
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,710
I need to pick it up from my home.

79
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,490
You live at Dongdu Tianrun?

80
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,190
It's not where I live, I'm currently staying with a friend.

81
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,390
A friend? Is it boyfriend?

82
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,410
It's not. Just a regular friend.

83
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,440
Are you guys in the flirting stage?

84
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,770
My car is here, I'm leaving first.

85
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,600
Bye, Yixin.

86
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,460
That's right, driver.

87
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,920
I have classes in the afternoon, that's why I'm meeting you here.

88
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,520
You even ordered a coffee for me?

89
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,220
You rarely initiated any meeting, I'm very surprised.

90
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,780
Brother Qi, please don't tease me. I really need your help.

91
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,300
Don't forget. You are my investor.

92
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,120
I won't forget. If there is something I can do, I will definitely help you out.

93
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,910
Have you heard about me being attacked by an anti-fan on Weibo?

94
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,200
I know. I was about to reach out to you and see if you need help.

95
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,260
I need help.

96
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,170
It will be a lot of trouble if this anti-fan come to your house.

97
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,560
That's why I wonder if I should move you to another apartment temporarily.

98
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,900
Don't worry. I've already moved out and staying at my friend's place.

99
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,630
That's fine.

100
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:32,570
I wonder if I should ask but I will ask you if you've recently offended someone?

101
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,390
There is a suspect.

102
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,790
But I'm going to find out from another way.

103
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,470
That's why I think of you.

104
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,300
It's because you have an extensive social network.

105
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,360
Perhaps you might able to find out who is that person, Da V on Weibo.

106
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,790
We can find out from another source the background information of this whistleblower.

107
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,060
Okay. I will ask around.

108
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,260
Thank you, Brother Qi.

109
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,990
Don't be happy so soon. I won't help you for nothing.

110
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,250
Please coming this way.

111
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,560
- Xiao Xiao. <br> -Brother Qi.

112
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,110
I'm not seeing you out.

113
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,390
I hope I will work with you next time.

114
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,050
Please walk him out.

115
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,150
Teacher Xiao, you are on time.

116
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,700
Don't tease me, I'm not Councelor Xiao.

117
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,340
If I hire you as a psychologist, I have to call you with a respective title.

118
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,380
If that's the case, I should call you Director Fan.

119
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,450
- Counselor Xiao, this way.<br> - Thank you, Director Fan.

120
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,090
Hi everybody at Dianfan Group. <br><i>(Dianfan Group Mental Health Seminar)</i>

121
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,820
My name is Xiao Xiao from Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center.

122
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,920
I'm very happy to be here today.

123
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,360
I'm here to share some of my personal experience and hopefully it will able to help some of you.

124
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,760
Although I haven't been studying psychology for a long time,

125
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,340
I am now seeing people and situation in a new perspective.

126
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,920
For example, stress exists in our daily life. How should we handle them?

127
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,850
We are not trying to resist stress, but to accept it.

128
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,100
When I'm working at the social media, I have received a lot of pressure.

129
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,330
For example when I realized readers don't like my blog,

130
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,080
or when I have no inspiration for my articles,

131
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,950
I will have insomnia, pimples and even cried.

132
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,060
They are all negative energies.

133
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,430
It order to de-stress, I would do exercises and competitive games.

134
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,800
I also like to read mangas before I go to bed.

135
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,030
For example I'm recently following the very popular series Dream Garden.

136
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,090
Do you have any questions?

137
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:39,420
Counselor Xiao, I heard hypnosis can de-stress, is that true?

138
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,220
You are very familiar with the practice.

139
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,970
That's correct. There are a lot of places offer hypnosis.

140
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,790
For example when we have bad experience when we were a child.

141
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,990
Or there is knot in your heart that bothers you and you don't know how to untie it.

142
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,020
In this case, you can come to Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center.

143
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,840
We have specialists who can resolve your issues.

144
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,750
In many cases, clinical hypnosis can work with the resistance,

145
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,980
and manage to speak with your subconsciousness.

146
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,420
<i> (Thank you!Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Center)</i>

147
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,600
Toward the end of this seminar, I can do one on one interview, please feel free to come to me.

148
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,360
Thank you everyone.

149
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,530
Thank you so much for your hard work today.

150
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,610
- We are welcome. That's it for today. <br> - Thank you.

151
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,860
- If you have any questions, please contact me. <br> - Thank you.

152
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,860
Director Fan.

153
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,320
Brother Qi, do you have questions for me?

154
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,520
I'm not here to ask questions but I'm here as your assistance.

155
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,800
You can't do that. Which employee would dare to speak their heart out in front of their bosses?

156
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,680
That why I'm trying to understand my employee through your work.

157
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,910
In order to see if my job is on point.

158
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,020
Let me see who has issues with me?

159
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,680
Thank you so much for your hard work.

160
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,110
It's not hard at all. I really want to thank you

161
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,100
for the opportunity that allows me to practice.

162
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,710
Is it true?

163
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,450
Can you help me one more thing?

164
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,150
What favor?

165
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,420
Can you tell everyone I want to say a few words.

166
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,040
Attention everyone.

167
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,150
Our Director Fan wants to say a few words.

168
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,160
Lately, I heard few crazy rumors.

169
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,330
Some people has complaints for

170
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,170
working overtime.

171
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,300
But we need to take few things into consideration.

172
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,150
If we look at things in different perspective,

173
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,270
the result might be different. Everything has a two sides.

174
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:02,200
I must admit, there is a lot of work and it's exhausting to work overtime.

175
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,620
However, if you work harder, you will get rewarded.

176
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,010
I want to announce from this now on,

177
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:11,560
the year end bonus will be increased and distributed.

178
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,980
<i>Very good!</i>

179
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,230
I believe through our hard work,

180
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,220
our company came be the industry leader. Do you have confident?

181
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,280
Yes!

182
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,850
Next, I want to say thank you to Counselor Xiao.

183
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,280
Come on, Counselor Xiao.

184
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,990
I hope we can work with each other again in the future.

185
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,250
It's my pleasure. Thank you.

186
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,350
- Thank you. <br> - Thank you everyone of your corporation.

187
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,290
Okay. Thank you.

188
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,620
Thanks.

189
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,400
- Thank you.<br> - You are welcome.

190
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,940
Thank you.

191
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,290
Xiao Xiao!

192
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,290
Are you all right?

193
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,280
I'm fine.

194
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,300
Where do you feel sick, let me know.

195
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,280
No, nothing.

196
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,290
What's the matter?

197
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,720
What's the matter?

198
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,330
That's it!

199
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,160
What late?

200
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,520
I must go home before midnight.

201
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,680
Xiao Xiao!

202
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,740
Be careful!

203
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,270
Teacher.

204
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,620
Thank you!

205
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,310
Bye!

206
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,130
Teacher, was I drunk last night?

207
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,990
I know.

208
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,480
Then, last night...

209
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,530
What, do you want me to remind you what had happened?

210
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,330
No, please don't.

211
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,160
At least tell me what have I done to you. What if I need to take responsibility.

212
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,490
What are you mumbling about? Let's go.

213
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,930
Teacher,

214
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,580
I am going to cook tonight in order to apologize to you. What would you like to eat?

215
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,620
I can't do anything complicated. I do know how to do hotpot.

216
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,870
See what ingredients do you like, I will get them from the supermarket after work.

217
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,370
Pork brain.

218
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,630
You are a special palate.

219
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:34,070
Teacher, since when you like peculiar food like pork brain?

220
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,400
It's for someone who needs to boost her brain, she constantly forgets things.

221
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,460
Xiao Xiao?

222
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,210
Have I mistaken?

223
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,750
You are back!

224
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,620
You have been home?

225
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,750
Where else can I go?

226
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,310
Have you eaten yet? I haven't. Let's eat together.

227
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,920
You haven't eaten yet ?

228
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,370
I ate already. I misspoken.

229
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,360
That's what I thought, what time is it now?

230
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,350
Don't worry, I ate this alone and will clean this up.

231
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,920
Let me help you.

232
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,930
It's okay. I can do it.

233
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,560
I can wash them.

234
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,990
Let me do it.

235
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,870
Why are you so nice today? Help me washing dishes?

236
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,100
What are you thinking?

237
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,510
I think I saw Li Yixin downstairs.

238
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,130
What is she doing here at this time of the night?

239
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,480
I think you make a mistake.

240
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,500
For someone who dresses up just like you, who else could that be?

241
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,640
Perhaps she has other friends who lives in this neighborhood?

242
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:23,210
That's right. If she is looking for me,

243
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,720
she could see me at school.

244
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,130
It's possible that I make a mistake.

245
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,380
I will ask her tomorrow at school.

246
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,350
Take a break.

247
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,120
- There? <br> - Just go.

248
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,040
- Professor Lin. <br> - I brought the stuff.

249
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,810
We've agreed to give you my picture before surgery.

250
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,810
and you will provide me the video clip in return. Where is the video?

251
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,550
Give me the pictures and I will send you the video.

252
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,840
Li Yixin, what's the relationship between you and Xiao Xiao?

253
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,030
In order to clear her negative comments online, you have been busy doing this and that.

254
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:35,260
She got attacked is because she stood up for me. She did nothing wrong.

255
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,720
Everything happened since you edited the video that causes the misunderstanding.

256
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,130
Give it to me!

257
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,040
Li Yixin, who would bother to do surgery if she looks like you?

258
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,710
Don't fool me with someone else's picture.

259
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,040
If you do that, see I will do next.

260
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,970
I will delete all the videos.

261
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,980
- Give it to me! <br> - Let go of me!<br> - What are you guys doing?

262
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,530
Are you all right?

263
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,770
- Yixin, are you okay?<br> - Xiao Xiao, why are you here?

264
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,240
Professor Lin told me you are injured, that's why I'm here right away. Your...

265
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,820
Xiao Xiao, let's go.

266
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,040
Doctor, sorry to trouble you.

267
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:02,010
Li Yixin said she has been begging Sun Rui

268
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,760
to hang over the video clips in order to clear your name.

269
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,920
At the end, Sun Rui use this excuse to threaten her.

270
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,010
She was going to see you last night to talk about this matter.

271
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,400
Why didn't she call me ahead of time?

272
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,690
Also, she didn't say a word and left.

273
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,580
She said she was contemplating,

274
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,610
couldn't make up her mind whether she should seek of your help.

275
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:31,170
When she arrived at the neighborhood, Sun Rui sent her a message.

276
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:35,170
She suggested a ridiculous exchange requirement.

277
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,870
She thought she could handle it herself.

278
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,310
That's why she didn't contact you ahead of time.

279
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,960
At the end, the hidden culprit is

280
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,280
Sun Rui.

281
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,060
Don't worry. I've really contacted the school,

282
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,620
they will talk to Sun Rui.

283
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,270
This kiddo,

284
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,500
always wanted to clear my name,

285
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,110
but at the end, she is the victim of the saga.

286
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,760
What's the matter?

287
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,380
Oh dear, how are you doing?

288
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,800
What did the doctor say? Will it leave you a scar?

289
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,230
I'm sorry, Yixin. It's because of me...

290
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,540
The person who should say sorry is me.

291
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,420
You stood up for me,

292
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,640
but take on the consequence. I should be the person to blame.

293
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,570
Don't worry.

294
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,650
We can find a dermatology to take a look. I'm sure there won't be a scar.

295
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,220
You keep talking. I'm going to pick up the medication.

296
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:23,190
Yixin, the person you said you like

297
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,810
is Professor Lin, isn't it?

298
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,590
<i> Chen Ziran, please don't leave me!</i>

299
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:35,580
<i> Chen Ziran, please don't leave me. I'm begging you.</i>

300
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,950
<i> Let go of my hand!</i>

301
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,190
<i> Chen Ziran!</i>

302
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,320
At that moment, I found Professor Lin was very strange.

303
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,150
Do you know how he comforted me?

304
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:31,320
He said breaking up is the most common negative experience.

305
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,380
But it is just a very short experience.

306
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,760
Human being's understanding is very narrow.

307
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,440
Not only they can feel their personal emotion.

308
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,180
They can even only feel their emotion at that particular moment.

309
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,390
No matter how painful you are at this moment,

310
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:51,600
you need to tell yourself it will be over soon.

311
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:02,740
It sounds like his style. He is as cold as a textbook.

312
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,290
It's because of those words, I didn't like it at that moment.

313
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:09,740
But when I calm down, I realized that

314
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,000
those are the word that comforted me.

315
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,680
Earlier on,

316
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,930
I never thought I can have this kind of interaction with Professor Lin in my lifetime.

317
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:31,950
No matter is inside or outside classrooms, he is always cold.

318
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:36,680
All the classmate said he is as pure as lotus, don't go close to him.

319
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,810
With a person like him,

320
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:44,980
he was the one who approached me when I broke my heart,

321
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,520
he also comforted me.

322
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,700
I always think if I'm considered as special

323
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,750
in his heart.

324
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,800
Do you find my strange?

325
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,400
Other girls like those boy-nextdoor.

326
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,100
But I like those guys being cold.

327
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You can't really say it that way.

328
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,100
Xioa Xiao, aren't you a "love expert"?

329
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,000
Can you teach me

330
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,200
How should I make my first move?

331
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,800
- Me?<br> - Once my wound has been healed.

332
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,400
I thought

333
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,980
I would confess to him.

334
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,400
- For that...<br>- Xiao Xiao.

335
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,400
You are my only friend at school.

336
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,000
For me, Professor Lin has a special place in my heart.

337
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,800
I can met you both at school,

338
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,700

339
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,400
my life is no longer that bad.

Boss Shao, what is this way to drink coffee?

373
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,200
It's new, a trendy special.

374
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,200
It's green grape coffee. It can calm your anxious soul.

375
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,800
I think it will suit you well.

376
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,300
Let me try one.

377
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,400
I will try this one.

378
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,000
I am adding water.

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
- Are you free his weekend?<br> - I am.

380
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I have discovered a special restaurant.

381
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,800
You can invite Yan Luo and Lin Shen, all four of us can try it.

382
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,400
Boss Shao, what makes you suddenly invite Yan Luo?

383
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Is it because you want to be alone with Lin Shen/

384
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,800
It's not. What are you talking about boss?

385
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,500
I think Yan Luo has something in the weekend.

386
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,100
Is it? Who is she meeting?

387
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,000
I think she is meeting a fan, but can also consider as a friend.

388
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,400
She is Teacher Lin's student and also my classmate.

389
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,700
It's alright, we will find some other time.

390
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,230
What are you thinking?

391
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,600
Tell me, is there anything bothering you?

392
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,000
Teacher,

393
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,500
if there is something is between

394
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,000
suppressive and dramatic,

395
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,800
should I say it or not?

396
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,300
My suggestion is

397
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,900
drink something sweet will change your mood.<br> - Okay.

398
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,600
This way.

399
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,000
That way.

400
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,000
I cannot imagine Counselor Lin is so opened.

401
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,300
Me either.

402
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Don't look, let's go.

403
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,800
What were you saying earlier that bothered you?

404
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,200
It's nothing.

405
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,400
I think drank something sweet really changed my mood.

406
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,300
Director Qi, you are here to see Xiao Xiao?

407
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,600
She is having a morning meeting right now.

408
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,600
Morning meeting? I can wait for her.

409
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,800
Why don't you take a seat. I will bring you a coffee.

410
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,800

Director Fan, why are you here?

413
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,400
You left the earring in my car, I brought it over.

414
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,350
<i> - Okay. I'm leaving. <br>- Bye Bye.</i>

415
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,600
- I'm sorry to make you bring it over.<br> - No worries.

416
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,400
You are blocking him.

417
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
I'm going to get a coffee.

418
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,650
Do you want me to prepare?

419
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,600
It's fine.

420
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,800

What's the matter?

425
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,400
I suddenly remember I have some unfinished business.

426
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,000
Me too!

427
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,200

About twenty more minutes, Mr. Fan.

Why did you make this video?

00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:45,690
Enough. Go with me the students' affair division.

476
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,280
Let's go. Don't hover.

477
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,150
Stop looking. Go.

478
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,650
What razor?

479
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,800
It's her.

480
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,500
Teacher found it in her place.

481
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:08,350
<i>I know Xiao Bei Bei is not a bad woman.</i>

482
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,200
<i>We follow her for such a long time. She always has correct values. </i>

483
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,340
<i>Sun Rui and her had run in in the past.</i>

484
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,370
<i>She did it out of revenge.</i>

485
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:17,220
<i>We will see how the school going to punish her.</i>

486
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,990
Hi, Luo Luo!

487
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:23,880
Xiao, I'm so glad.

488
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,710
I saw the video on the website.

489
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,880
The truth is finally out.

490
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,460
I keep worrying about you when I'm on my trips.

491
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,140
Afraid that people would sent you weird things.

492
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,520
Worry no more.

493
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,430
The comments are now mostly positive.

494
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:38,580
Sun Rui has been suspended.

495
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,670
<i>She will be asked to resign as the next step.</i>

496
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:44,900
Online bullying is a double edge sword. Everyone should be responsible for what they say.

497
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,890
I'll have a coke.

498
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:52,750
After this is over, are you moving out from Mr. Lin's house?

499
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,720
Hi.

500
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,190
- You are? <br>- You are Xiao Xiao, right?

501
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,860
I'm Sun Rui's boyfriend.

502
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:12,100
The school asked Sun Rui to resign. Can I ask you a favor?

503
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,450
Give her a second chance. Say you will forgive her.

504
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:18,920
Everyone should pay for their own action.

505
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,690
She deserves her punishment.

506
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:24,990
If she doesn't, she may commit bigger mistakes in the future.

507
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,440
Miss, please. Resigning will affect her future a lot.

508
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,420
She is studying under combined Bachelor and Master degree program. Resigning will forfeit her diploma.

509
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,530
Although Sun Rui has a temper, she is not a bad person.

510
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:40,590
She uploaded the video simply to vent.

511
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,800
She didn't know it would blow up like that.

512
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,210
She didn't know you are not someone she can mess with.

513
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,840
I'm not. What about the razor.

514
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,660
She accidentally sent it to my house, too?

515
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,180
She said she didn't sent it.

516
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:59,520
Forget it. I didn't believe it either.

517
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,660
But she is the kind of person who doesn't use her brain. I apologize for her.

518
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,090
If you need any compensation, I can satisfy you.

519
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,350
Now you are worrying about your girlfriend?

520
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,150
Why did you try to hook up with Li Yi Xin?

521
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:13,390
That is the cause of this whole conflict.

522
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:20,730
Fine. I admit that

523
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:23,070
I was interested in Li Yin Xin.

524
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:28,080
But later I started to feel strange.

525
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,740
When I was on the offensive, she would be cold to me.

526
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,280
But when I wanted to give up, she would send me messages.

527
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,900
Do you know what her most effective method? It's message recall.

528
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,330
She would send me messages late at night. But before I could read it, she would delete it.

529
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:42,160
She has me on a rope.

530
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,760
I...

531
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,530
Of course, I have seen through her tactic.

532
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,610
She's treating me this way just because she and Sum Rui are not in good terms.

533
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,970
She uses me to make Sun Rui angry.

534
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:55,480
Some people find excuses for their indecisiveness.

535
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,730
Their words are so convincing.

536
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:02,110
Why don't you say you are indecisive so you think they all try to seduce you?!

537
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:05,300
You saw it, too! That day she came herself to watch me play basketball.

538
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,010
After that, we didn't contact each other for a long time.

539
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:14,070
<i> - Here! <br> - Thank you! <br> - You're sweating!</i>

540
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:17,660
<i> I'll do it myself. Thank you! </i>

541
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:23,700
<i> I went to see him just because I wanted to trick him into telling me Sun Rui's password to the computer.</i>

542
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,420
<i> I suspect those criticism against you on Weibo, </i>

543
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,750
<i> are all done by Sun Rui.</i>

544
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,750
Yes, I saw it.

545
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:35,490
She went to see you just to get you to tell her Sun Rui's computer password.

546
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:39,650
- So she could clear all those criticism against me; she didn't mean to hook up with you. <br> - Password?

547
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,730
Sun Rui never set up any passwords on her computer.

548
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,240
That is strange!

549
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,710
Li Yixin and Sun Rui used to be very close.

550
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:52,180
Before they broke up, she even used Sun Rui's computer to grab a course.

551
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,540
Why suddenly they are not in good terms?

552
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:58,310
Can you please be a broad-minded person and be forgiven,

553
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,240
help her and plead to the school.

554
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,500
Otherwise, if she's really being expelled,

555
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,910
what will it do to her career later on?

556
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:09,660
So Li Yixin look for you first?

557
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,710
She sent me texts during the night

558
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:20,510
but recalled them right away.

559
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:22,520
I only have the records of text-recalling.

560
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,640
That night, she sent me four selfies but recalled all of them.

561
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,090
There was one selfie left on my phone because she couldn't recall it. They all look like this.

562
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:32,760
She explained that she wanted to send to her best friend.

563
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,270
She wants her friend to select one as her avatar.

564
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:40,130
Listen. <br><i>I am sorry. I intended to send to my best friend.</i>

565
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:44,250
<i>And let her pick one as my avatar. I sent to you unintentionally</i>

566
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:48,700
<i>I cannot recall the last selfie because it was sent too long ago</i>

567
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,680
<i>Luckily, I haven't been fallen asleep. I saw them.</i>

568
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,520
<i>I think the second selfie looks the best.</i>

569
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,950
Look at her avatar.

570
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:59,310
It is the one I selected.

571
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:02,270
If Li Yixin didn't mean it,

572
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:05,910
why would she choose the selfie I selected?

573
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,230
Come in.

574
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,120
How are you?

575
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,920
-Are you...? -I am Li Yixin's friend.

576
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,570
I brought her some fruits.

577
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:50,030
-Are you Xiaoxue? -Yes.

578
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,240
I am allergic to peaches. Can you take it away?

579
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,860
I am sorry. I didn't know. I am sorry.

580
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:02,420
I didn't know you are allergic to peaches.

581
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:06,220
Didn't Li Yixin tell you? Peaches cannot be in the dormitory.

582
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:10,110
Besides, Li Yixin doesn't like peaches.

583
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,670
Do you know where Li Yixin is?

584
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,890
I called her many times but she didn't pick it up.

585
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:37,090
Wait. Let me take medicine. Please sit.

586
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,110
-I don't know. I am not close to her. -Are you not close to her?

587
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:01,730
Do you know Lin Shen?

588
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:04,030
He is the visiting lecturer in our college.

589
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:08,380
People are fighting to be his teaching assistant.

590
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,420
I don't know why, right before the semester starts,

591
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,520
I suddenly cough due to allergy.

592
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,560
I am afraid that Mr. Lin will change his TA.

593
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,880
I was worried who can substitute for me.

594
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,050
Originally, I want Sun Rui to help me.

595
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:26,240
But she fought with her boyfriend those days.

596
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,420
She didn't have mood to go to class. Let alone substituting for me.

597
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,420
At the end, Li Yixin offered her help.

598
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,480
She said that she had time. Because of pressing time,

599
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,140
I couldn''t find others. I let her substitute for me.

600
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,160
Can I ask you

601
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,790
what is wrong between Sun Rui and Li Yixin?

602
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:55,810
Grudge? Perhaps is related to Little orange?

603
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:57,300
Little orange?

604
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:01,390
At Year one, Li Yixin brought back a little stray cat.

605
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,860
She wants to keep her at the dormitory and named it Little Orange.

606
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:06,910
But the cat didn’t adopt well here.

607
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:09,820
Once you close the door, it would scratched the door like crazy and screamed.

608
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,670
It sounded pitiful. Sun Rui couldn’t stand it.

609
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:16,710
And yet Li Yinxin pretended she didn’t hear anything.

610
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:18,720
Therefore, Sun Rui complained to the dorm management office.

611
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,560
When the staffer came to examine, Little Orange ran away.

612
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:27,520
We couldn’t find it since. That’s why Li Yixin has a fist with Sun Rui.

613
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,390
It’s because of this incident.

614
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:31,590
Honestly, Sun Rui has this carefree personality.

615
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:35,990
That’s why they got along pretty well

616
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:41,280
Li Yixin liked to be alone.

617
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,400
Their relationship was okay but

618
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,020
at the end we are all adults, it’s pretty common if you don’t wanted to hangout together.

619
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:52,100
But we still got along fine in daily bases. Out relationship was pretty peaceful.

620
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:08,330
<i>Dear School Principle,</i>

621
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:12,460
<i> My name is Xiao Xiao. I’m the victim of the video clip posted by Sun Rui.</i>

622
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,990
<i> Sun Rui has already </i>

623
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:16,800
<i> publicly apologized to me in writing.</i>

624
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,020
<i>She also promised she will not do anything violating the school regulation,</i>

625
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,230
<i> and public orders.</i>

626
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:24,850
You want to beg for leniency for Sun Rui?

627
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:28,280
Because her boyfriend told me today if she got dismissed from by thy school, she will not receive her graduation certificate.

628
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,840
It will affect her job searching process in the future.

629
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:36,160
I cannot you would be easily kidnapped by emotion.

630
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:42,590
In fact, there is another reason.

631
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:47,280
I heard of another version.

632
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:02,980
It is likely...

633
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:05,150
Li Yixin lied.

634
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,790
There is a hidden agenda

635
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:10,590
behind this.

636
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:14,840
Or, a Li Yixin that we don't know.

637
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,600
Right. Last time, Li Yixin came to my house late at night

638
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,010
I don't think it is not unreasonable

639
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:32,540
because her real purpose is not to see me.

640
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:37,270
After all, she didn't need a reason to see someone.

641
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,540
Teacher Lin.

642
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:57,080
What happened?

643
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:09,490
Now people in the dormitory think that

644
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:13,260
I am the cause of the incident.

645
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,460
Teacher Lin, I...

646
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:19,060
I couldn't breathe for this.

647
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,580
Don't rush. Relax and take a deep breath.

648
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:25,820
Then the whole thing...

649
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:28,590
Can I go to you?

650
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:33,300
I feel better after hearing your voice.

651
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:46,360
Teacher Lin. Is it not convenient for you?

652
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:51,550
If it is not convenient for you, it is fine. <br>Just think that I didn't call you.

653
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:02,380
OK. Come to my office when you have time.

654
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,320
OK. Thank you, Teacher Lin.

655
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,330
OK. Bye.

656
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,230
Look. I am correct. It is your damn charm.

657
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,130
Write your report.

658
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:48,430
<i>Shaolin's Psychological Counseling Cente</i>

659
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:50,700
<i>Lin Shen, Psychological Counselor</i>

660
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:54,920
Teacher Lin. Thank you for listening to me.

661
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:58,820
I simply think too much.

662
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:03,790
The cause of your insomnia is anxiety. Do you want to try hypnosis?

663
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:07,250
It can help you to find the reason of your anxiety.

664
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,670
So it helps you to relax and get a good sleep.

665
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:21,760
Because of our relationship, I cannot hypnotize you.

666
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,610
But I can teach you how to hypnotize yourself.

667
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:26,880
OK. I can try.

668
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,040
Imagine. You stand in the dormitory by yourself.

669
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,770
Nobody is there.

670
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,900
What do you hear?

671
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:10,180
I heard water dripping from the faucet.

672
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,900
Good.

673
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,340
You heard the dripping water.

674
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,190
Every dripping sound

675
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:23,620
you

676
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,070
