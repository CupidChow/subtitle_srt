00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,900
[Please Remember Me]
[Episode 9]

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:14,890
Coming.

3
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,490
There's more?

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,850
That's all.

5
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,140
Not bad.

6
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,710
You told me to cook for my family

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,710
and care for them.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,700
I've tried my best.

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,340
Let's eat.

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:37,970
Xiaoman,

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,390
you used a wish

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,680
to make this meal, right?

13
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,380
Isn't it a waste?

14
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:46,660
Yeah.

15
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,110
At least ask him for something valuable.

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,040
Let's eat.

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,050
Eat.

18
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,200
Although it doesn't look good,

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,530
but it tastes good.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,360
Xiaoshu tried the dishes for me.

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,150
-Xiaoshu?
-Xiaoshu?

22
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,150
Where's Xiaoshu?

23
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,670
Xiaoshu! Xiaoshu!

24
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,580
Coming.

25
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,530
Xiaoshu.

26
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,450
Coming.

27
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,390
Xiaoshu, what's wrong?

28
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,410
You are...

29
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,140
General, can I say something?

30
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,039
Say it.

31
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,810
Doesn't it taste good?

32
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:22,610
The taste?

33
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,190
It tastes good.

34
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:26,210
Delicious!

35
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,110
Delicious.

36
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,110
No.

37
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,610
I have something to do.

38
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,440
You guys eat first.

39
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,630
You eat first.

40
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,560
General.

41
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,070
I remember I have something to do in the kitchen.

42
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:48,870
I have to go.

43
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,630
Eat up.

44
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,970
What's the matter?

45
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:52,690
Eat more.

46
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,259
What is it?

47
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:53,780
You eat.

48
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:55,690
You eat.

49
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,350
What is it?

50
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,600
Aunt Qiu.

51
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,090
What are you busy with, Aunt?

52
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,020
Let's eat first.

53
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,330
General.

54
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,170
Xiaoman, I think I have something to do too.

55
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,800
You guys eat first.

56
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,509
Eat first.

57
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,110
Dashu.

58
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,530
Dashu.

59
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,040
Can I... also leave to deal with some matters?

60
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,570
Sit down.

61
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,840
This is your first wish.

62
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,880
Curses!

63
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,170
Aunt Qiu, what are you doing?

64
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,130
Why are you covering your eyes?

65
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,310
I'll take you to see your second wish.

66
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,930
It's so scary.

67
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,120
He got away with the last wish.

68
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,800
What is he going to do this time?

69
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,450
This time,

70
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,980
General put a lot of effort.

71
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,910
He and Xiaoshu

72
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,750
worked at it for a whole morning.

73
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,170
Worked at it for a whole morning?

74
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,170
Let's take a look.

75
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,530
Come, let's take a look.

76
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,520
Be careful.

77
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,970
Where is this place? Why are they so secretive?

78
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,920
We're almost there.

79
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,960
Take your time.

80
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,500
The General is not here, right?

81
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,360
Let me tell you.

82
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,400
I don't dare to believe in him now.

83
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,360
Last time...

84
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,970
My stomach still hurts now.

85
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,640
Here.

86
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,590
Be careful.

87
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,579
Here.

88
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,560
Here, Xiaoman.

89
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,420
Sit down.

90
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,970
Sit down.

91
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,320
Okay.

92
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,770
Put your hands here and hold it.

93
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,220
Sit here.

94
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,060
What is this?

95
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,660
You'll know soon.

96
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,040
You said you wanted to fly.

97
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,620
I can't do that,

98
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,110
but

99
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,370
this can...

100
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,840
They look so happy.

101
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,860
General.

102
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,330
What is this?

103
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,020
Higher.

104
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,130
They're a perfect match.

105
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,070
Your smile looks like someone I know.

106
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,710
Who?

107
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,810
Just like our Aunt.

108
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,030
What's wrong with Aunt?

109
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,320
She's such a good person.

110
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,900
Yeah.

111
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,120
General.

112
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,020
How is it?

113
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,220
Are you satisfied?

114
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,460
Yes!

115
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,290
I want to go higher.

116
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,380
I'll make you fly higher.

117
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,940
I'm flying!

118
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,060
They're really flying.

119
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,040
I want to go higher.

120
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,140
Xiaoman!

121
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,440
Did she really fly out?

122
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,920
Help her!

123
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,940
Xiaoman!

124
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,220
Xiaoman!

125
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,140
Xiaoman!

126
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,440
[The Lord's Mansion]

127
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,830
I heard that Zisu has asked for leave.

128
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,650
Why?

129
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,300
I heard that he's been

130
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,340
trying to make that girl happy recently.

131
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,680
He played the flute and built a swing.

132
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,790
He doesn't know how to play a flute.

133
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,520
He's always been playing with weapons.

134
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,690
As for the swing.

135
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,260
It's possible.

136
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,500
When he was young,

137
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,110
I made it for him.

138
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,490
Your Lordship treats General Xiao well.

139
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,120
By the way,

140
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,800
the Princess of Liang State

141
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,100
will come here for dinner tomorrow.

142
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,580
Go to Zisu's mansion

143
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,490
and ask him

144
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,210
bring that girl along.

145
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,170
Yes.

146
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,710
There's only one rat left.

147
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,750
What do you want to wish for?

148
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,120
The third wish.

149
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,610
Let me think about it.

150
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,040
I'll tell you when I figure it out.

151
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,820
Okay.

152
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,490
Higher.

153
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,530
Aunt Qiu.

154
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,659
Dashu!

155
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,560
Swing her higher.

156
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,890
Okay.

157
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:43,510
Coming.

158
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,870
Higher.

159
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,780
Higher.

160
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,930
Come on.

161
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,690
This is nice.

162
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,510
If I had a home, I would've been like you.

163
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,330
Higher.

164
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,140
Steady.

165
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,270
You can consider this place as your home.

166
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,330
Well...

167
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,720
I want to go back to my home more.

168
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,950
Fine.

169
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,140
When you recover your memories,

170
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,270
I'll take you back.

171
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,370
Really?

172
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,890
It's a deal.

173
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,370
Deal.

174
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,420
Three, two, one. Go.

175
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,250
Aunt Qiu.

176
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,370
Dashu!

177
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,330
Fly higher.

178
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,530
Okay.

179
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,570
Here.

180
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,530
I trust you

181
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,010
will help us.

182
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,920
I will be back.

183
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,370
Deal.

184
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,140
What’s wrong, General?

185
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,350
Actually, I've always thought

186
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,760
that you look like someone in my memory.

187
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,260
Who?

188
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,490
I don't remember.

189
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,920
I even doubted

190
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,870
if she really existed.

191
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,980
Don't you remember anything about her?

192
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,150
I only remember...

193
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,850
Xiaoman.

194
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,650
Xiaoman!

195
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,700
Xiaoman.

196
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,620
It turns out that I'm only a replacement of someone else.

197
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,770
His Lordship sent a message this morning

198
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:09,030
to invite the Princess of Liang State to the mansion today.

199
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,060
Got it.

200
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,610
I'll tell Aunt Qiu

201
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,170
not to cook for you tonight.

202
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,330
And for you too.

203
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,830
Because

204
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,980
His Lordship asked me to take you with him.

205
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,410
No way, it's not appropriate.

206
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,760
I can't go to these exquisite banquets.

207
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,290
What can I say when I'm there?

208
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:35,970
Aunt Qiu.

209
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,450
Coming.

210
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,460
This is

211
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,730
the Head of the Etiquette Department before I worked here.

212
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,810
She's now working in a flour shop.

213
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,690
General specially invited her

214
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,490
to dress you up.

215
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,860
No.

216
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,020
This is so formal.

217
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:55,980
It's scary.

218
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,820
Come on, Xiaoman.

219
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,140
Come on, Xiaoman.

220
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,330
I'm uncomfortable with being so formal.

221
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,170
No, Aunt Qiu.

222
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,870
Let's go.

223
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,840
This is really scary.

224
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,990
It's really scary.

225
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,130
Everyone, Xiaoman is ready.

226
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,820
Look.

227
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,590
Goodness.

228
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,380
Goodness.

229
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,800
If you go out with our General dressed like this,

230
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,980
our mansion would be full of prestige.

231
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,650
Xiaoman

232
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,780
is the most beautiful girl in Lin State.

233
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,870
She and our general

234
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,640
are a perfect match.

235
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,640
Yes.

236
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,010
A perfect match.

237
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,810
Isn't this a phrase for describing married couples?

238
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,470
Members of the Feilian Troop can’t get married.

239
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,770
You can’t get married.

240
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,980
Stop talking.

241
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,550
You Little Trash! Shut up!

242
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,710
You can't get married!

243
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,600
You Little Trash! Shut up!

244
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,610
Do I look good?

245
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,580
Xiaoshu.

246
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,290
This is mine?

247
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,580
Yours.

248
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,790
We don't know much about women's preferences,

249
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,420
so we bought the most expensive one.

250
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,630
It's really expensive.

251
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,430
They were all bought on account.

252
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,570
Again?

253
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,610
Put it on and show us.

254
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,210
Alright.

255
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,710
New shoes are hard to wear.

256
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,020
You have to walk in them to make them soft.

257
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,090
Don't move.

258
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,350
All good.

259
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,380
Is it pretty?

260
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,180
Yes.

261
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,210
Yes.

262
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,310
Beautiful.

263
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,780
Just so so.

264
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,730
I meant the shoes.

265
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,210
The shoes are so pretty.

266
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,150
Why does he not think so?
