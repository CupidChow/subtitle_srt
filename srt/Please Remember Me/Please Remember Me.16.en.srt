00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,990
[Please Remember Me
Episode 16]

2
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:40,730
Nian.

3
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,750
Soon,

4
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,400
the Xiantang tree will die.

5
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,320
After the Xiantang tree dies,

6
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,820
Sushui will become

7
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,010
a wasteland.

8
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,330
We should figure out a way

9
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,610
to find a place to live in the five states.

10
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,110
Are you worried about Xiao Zisu?

11
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,130
If he is dead,

12
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,870
his death can be considered the price he paid for Ji people.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,800
Yes.

14
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
The price he paid.

15
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,230
The price he paid.

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
The price he paid.

17
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,980
Kong,

18
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,730
I'm a little tired.

19
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,150
I want to go back to rest.

20
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,310
Okay.

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,020
Wang.

22
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,390
Wang, contact Chang Yuan.

23
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,070
Ask our spies in Lin State

24
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,640
to ask about Xiao Zisu.

25
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:50,590
Okay.

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,440
Why?

27
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,070
Why do I increasingly feel this matter

28
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,200
is very strange from beginning to end?

29
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,310
Would memories change a person's personality?

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,890
Don't be afraid.

31
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,100
I'll fulfill what I promised you.

32
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,610
General.

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,770
Did Xiao Zisu really do that

34
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,980
to Sushui and my clansmen?

35
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,100
How come he didn't remember anything?

36
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,410
Xiao Zisu!

37
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,380
Don't go there!

38
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:50,930
Let's go!

39
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,720
Let's go!

40
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,800
Xiao Zisu!

41
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,520
Coincidentally, I have also completely forgotten

42
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,590
what happened during that period.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,490
Is the truth really what I found out later?

44
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,100
Qi?

45
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,260
[Love Qi]

46
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,120
So these came from them.

47
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,950
First, I wish the weather can be good and everyone can be safe and healthy.

48
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,250
Second, I wish Grandma can recover soon

49
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,280
and Jiuye and the others can grow up safely.

50
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,470
Third, I wish Qi can love me too.

51
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,250
Because I love Qi.

52
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,710
We should raise a little bird in the future.

53
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,690
Qi?

54
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,810
We'll call it... Little Trash.

55
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,150
Who is Qi?

56
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,860
I want to fulfill my promise to Grandma.

57
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,120
I want to take everyone back to the shore.

58
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,090
I want to tell you... my feelings for you.

59
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,550
I also want to tell you my name, Xiao Zisu.

60
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,180
Qi?

61
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,900
Xiao Zisu?

62
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,830
He really...

63
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,880
If Bixi is complete, you can be together forever. If not, you'll forget each other.

64
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,480
After a mortal leaves Sushui,

65
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,140
the only way to remember this place

66
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:20,090
is to leave with the half piece of Bixi willingly given by someone from the Ji tribe.

67
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:26,350
But the mortal has to come back within seven days.

68
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,620
Otherwise, the memories of both of them

69
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,930
will disappear.

70
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,610
I can give this to Grandma.

71
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,060
What's this? It's so heavy.

72
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,590
Jiuye can use this to carry items.

73
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,760
A big treasure!

74
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,840
What big treasure is this?

75
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,530
I saw a living water guest.

76
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,670
Living water guest.

77
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,370
Water guest, you're so lucky.

78
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,490
You didn't die.

79
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,550
Who are you?

80
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,110
What do you want?

81
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,950
Listen.

82
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,320
A long time ago, Grandma said

83
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,040
there will be a living water guest

84
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,960
with Bixi's totem on the body

85
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
coming to Sushui.

86
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,490
They don't believe it.

87
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,660
Only I believe it.

88
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,460
I knew you would definitely come.

89
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,130
Sushui?

90
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,040
Water guest, can I take a look at the totem on your body?

91
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,510
Let me have a look.

92
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,570
Don't come near me!

93
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,170
This...

94
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,340
This place is Sushui?

95
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,080
Yes.

96
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,210
Where's my sword?

97
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,360
Are you looking for this?

98
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,160
No.

99
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,280
What is a water guest?

100
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,000
A water guest?

101
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,720
A water guest is...

102
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,290
someone outside Sushui.

103
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,310
A guest from the other side of the river.

104
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,020
There were other guests before.

105
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,280
But they were all dead.

106
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,020
Dead? Is she implying that she's going to kill me?

107
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,530
How do you deal with dead water guests?

108
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,960
Do you only eat

109
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,440
dead water guests?

110
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,800
Why would we eat them?

111
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,770
Eat water guests?

112
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,140
Stop pretending.

113
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,490
Aren't you Ji people monsters who eat raw meat,

114
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,090
drink blood, do evil things,

115
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,970
and bring disasters to the world?

116
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,870
We are not close to each other.

117
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,620
Grandma said

118
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,970
we can't joke with someone not close to us.

119
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,190
Why do you keep mentioning your grandma?

120
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,400
Who on earth is she?

121
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,280
Grandma?

122
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,070
My grandma is the chief.

123
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,260
I'll also be the chief in the future.

124
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,670
I have to go.

125
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,860
I went back very late last night.

126
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,580
If I go back late again today,

127
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,180
Grandma will scold me again.

128
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,990
Here, I made some mushroom soup for you.

129
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,850
Drink something hot to warm your body.

130
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,000
I finally got here.

131
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,030
I need to investigate their defenses and see

132
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,360
how many soldiers they have as soon as possible,

133
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,530
so that it'll be convenient for us to attack them in the future

134
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,630
to get Bixi successfully.

135
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,010
Here.

136
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:36,910
Don't move.

137
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,390
I don't want to drink it.

138
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,860
Really?

139
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,180
It's humid in Sushui.

140
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,710
The mushrooms here smell very good.

141
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,820
I don't want to drink it.

142
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,630
No?

143
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,420
Really?

144
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,610
It smells so good.

145
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,120
Do you want some?

146
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,980
We can go back to the village to rest early after drinking it.

147
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,240
She really wants to kidnap me and kill me.

148
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,030
With my current strength, I don't think I can defeat her.

149
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,790
Drink some first.

150
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,490
I just drank that.

151
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,310
It's very delicious, right?

152
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,330
What did you make me drink?

153
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,740
Well...

154
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,100
Well, water guest, don't pass out!

155
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,230
I've never seen a living water guest before.

156
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:47,830
Water guest.

157
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,690
Water guest.

158
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,030
Don't pass out.

159
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:51,960
Water guest.

160
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,670
It's been a long time since I ate a water guest.

161
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,660
Water guest,

162
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,870
do you think you can escape from us Ji demons?

163
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,090
I'm going to stew you and fry you now.
