[Please Remember Me Episode 25]

2
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,830
General Xiao.

3
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,970
Don't wait anymore, your body can't handle it.

4
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,830
She saved me but didn't want to see me.

5
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,150
She must have her reasons.

6
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,470
I can't let anything happen to her again.

7
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,810
I'm fine. Go back.

8
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,030
Your Highness.

9
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,539
General Xiao has been standing in the snow for two days.

10
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:10,539
I'm afraid he can't take it anymore.

11
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,460
You can't fool him.

12
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,470
Are you really not going out?

13
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,610
I envy you.

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,340
Even without speaking, you can understand each other's hearts.

15
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,410
Xiaoman.

16
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,120
Don't be like me and Chang Yuan.

17
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,960
Once you miss each other,

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,400
there's no turning back.

19
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:54,590
Your Highness,

20
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,530
don't leave any regrets in your life.

21
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,010
If one day you near the end of your life like me,

22
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,590
it'll be too late to regret.

23
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,540
General Xiao.

24
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,380
General Xiao.

25
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:31,690
Your Highness.

26
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,860
Did something happen to the General?

27
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,670
General Xiao,

28
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,150
ever since he fainted at the gate of the Residence,

29
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,510
when he was half awake, he has been wanting to see the Plum Blossom Drawing.

30
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,510
He kept mentioning

31
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,390
Nian, Grandma and other things.

32
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,460
After he woke up,

33
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,590
he asked me to bring this Plum Blossom Drawing here.

34
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,459
Did he say anything else?

35
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,390
General Xiao...

36
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,160
also said that he doesn't wish for eternity,

37
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,380
but only for Xiaoman.

38
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,210
Go home.

39
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,210
What did Xiaoman say?

40
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:45,930
You should go back now.

41
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,909
She said to go home.

42
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:47,409
Go home?

43
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,250
Farewell, Your Highness.

44
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,390
Are you really going back?

45
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,380
He has been looking for me.

46
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,130
If I keep avoiding him,

47
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,790
he will die.

48
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,690
But you will die too.

49
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,030
Officially,

50
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,200
Xiao Zisu has done a lot for us.

51
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,110
In the future, he will also help our people to settle down.

52
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,250
Compared to me, a leader only in name,

53
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,750
he is more important.

54
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
Personally,

55
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,260
I love him.

56
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,130
Now all the misunderstandings are cleared.

57
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,960
Compared to being so close yet unable to meet,

58
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,020
I'd rather love again without regret.

59
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,750
Whether it's a year,

60
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:34,590
a month,

61
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,700
or only one day.

62
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,909
I'll bury this needle

63
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,090
into your acupoint at the top of your head.

64
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,480
It can help you recover your original form temporarily.

65
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,140
But your depleting life force

66
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,840
can't be cured.

67
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,070
And you have to bear a great pain.

68
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,370
Can you bear it?

69
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,550
You agreed?

70
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,760
People are soft-hearted

71
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,630
and it needs to be shown.

72
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,360
That's why our hearts are grown inside

73
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,950
while our fists are outside.

74
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,350
You and him

75
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,880
have put your hearts in each other's fists.

76
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,080
You trust each other

77
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,640
and are not afraid of being crushed.

78
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,230
This should be the beginning of our trust

79
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,630
and it's also Grandma's wish.

80
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,600
Thank you.

81
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,720
Close your eyes.

82
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,340
Xiaoman!

83
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,570
You're awake.

84
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,100
Nian.

85
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,780
Nian.

86
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,770
Nian.

87
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,120
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,520
I didn't uphold our promise.

89
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,810
You remember everything?

90
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,770
Yes.

91
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,230
When I came back,

92
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,040
the bell broke.

93
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:34,900
I...

94
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,540
I forgot everything.

95
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,550
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,120
It's my fault that Sushui was attacked.

97
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,870
I'm guilty.

98
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,190
It's not your fault.

99
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,820
I know

100
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,070
you won't forget your promise to us.

101
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,100
Nian,

102
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,940
I know whatever I say now

103
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,220
can't make up for my mistake.

104
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,230
But trust me.

105
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,530
I will

106
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,560
fulfill my promise in Sushui.

107
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,640
I trust you.

108
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,010
I've always trusted you.

109
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,070
Qi.

110
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,620
A few days ago,

111
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,090
you saved me with the Bixi.

112
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,760
Are you affected?

113
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,710
No.

114
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,100
Don't keep it from me.

115
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,030
When I was in Sushui,

116
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,560
I know the power of the Bixi.

117
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,140
Don't think too much.

118
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,500
You should be happy

119
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,080
that you recovered your memories.

120
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,340
Why are there so many things on your mind?

121
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,200
I don't know why,

122
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,330
I have a feeling

123
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,800
that I'm about to lose you.

124
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,970
Nian,

125
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,880
no matter what happens,

126
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,630
please tell me, okay?

127
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,820
No matter what,

128
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,770
we'll bear it together.

129
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,760
Okay?

130
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:46,930
Okay.

131
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,090
I promise you.

132
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,030
You have to promise me too.

133
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,830
If there is something, you must tell me.

134
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,060
Don't make me worry.

135
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,830
Okay?

136
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:58,990
Okay.

137
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
Aunt Qiu.

138
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,970
Don't worry, I'll take of the Ji people's matters.

139
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,450
Thank you, General.

140
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,700
Shu, take care of the General.

141
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,260
Don't let him work too hard.

142
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,410
Got it, Xiaoman. Don't worry.

143
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,570
Xiaoman is back.

144
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,060
General Xiao has recovered.

145
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,610
Our family is all here.

146
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,900
I'll leave now.

147
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,680
Okay.

148
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:20,900
My Lord.

149
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
What's wrong with the Crown Prince?

150
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,550
Someone...

151
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,290
-Someone is trying to harm me.
-Your Lordship.

152
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,390
Your Highness.

153
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,500
Who is this?

154
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,870
I invited him here.

155
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,620
He's here to treat you.

156
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,190
Your Highness, how are your eyes?

157
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,490
Very good.

158
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,600
Your Highness, you just told me...

159
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,260
What was it?

160
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:55,790
Well...

161
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,520
Ever since I got injured,

162
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,490
I felt dizzy.

163
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,040
After using this crystal,

164
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,650
I felt someone seems to be swaying in front of me.

165
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,650
I must be seeing things.

166
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,660
Your Highness, this is a good thing.

167
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,270
It proves that you are getting better.

168
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:25,770
Here.

169
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,810
Have a crab.

170
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,150
This crab...

171
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:31,850
This crab...

172
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,350
The crabs are tied up

173
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,000
they can't speak.

174
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,350
Crabs can't speak at all.

175
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,550
Let me pick the crab meat for you.

176
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,400
Here, Your Highness.

177
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,920
Here, Your Highness.

178
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,510
Here, Your Highness.

179
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,280
Are you comfortable staying here recently?

180
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,630
My Lord.

181
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,510
Don't stand on ceremony, here.

182
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,280
Here, Your Highness.

183
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,690
Have another piece.

184
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,950
General Xiao.

185
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,880
[Fanglin Garden]

186
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,910
General left you behind again?

187
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,800
Yes.

188
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,640
Listen.

189
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,920
Get a horse for General tomorrow.

190
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,470
He goes home as soon as he finishes work these days.

191
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,200
I can't catch up with him at all.

192
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,690
Buy a horse?

193
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,550
How can I afford a horse?

194
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,480
A donkey will do.

195
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,260
Be careful.

196
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,590
Why are you climbing the tree?

197
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,470
Aunt Qiu said the persimmons are the best now.

198
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,580
I want to pick some

199
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,790
to make dried persimmon.

200
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,790
Dried persimmon?

201
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,430
Put it down.

202
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,090
Let me do it.

203
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,320
Xiaoshu! Xiaoshu!

204
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:18,990
Come here.

205
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,380
How is it?

206
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:51,790
Brother.

207
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,650
Awesome, right?

208
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,480
Xiaoshu, come here.

209
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,280
What's wrong?

210
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,830
You're just brimming with energy aren't you?

211
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,890
What are you doing?

212
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,030
Aren't they picking persimmons?

213
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,620
Pick...

214
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,970
Pick them up.

215
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,320
General, I have a question.

216
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,700
What?

217
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,080
When the persimmons are ripe,

218
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,950
why do they fall onto the ground

219
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,580
instead of flying up the sky?

220
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,460
Maybe the persimmons are attracted to the earth.

221
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,180
Just like home.

222
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,670
Yes.

223
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
You're right.

224
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,160
I don't ask for everything to go smoothly,

225
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,580
I just hope to have a home to return to.
