00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,950
[Please Remember Me
Episode 8]

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,300
Did you catch those missing people?

3
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:17,930
No.

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,320
Are you hiding something from me?

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,440
Chang Yuan,

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,990
don't threaten Xiao Zisu with the lives of the people.

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,790
You will only irritate him more.

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,110
You've only stayed in his mansion for a few days,

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,770
but now you're defending him.

10
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,730
It's more important to find Bixi.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,110
I just...

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,770
I'm worried you and he would be back together...

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,330
Be back together again? What do you mean?

14
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,140
Nothing.

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,770
Let me ask you.

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,270
If he falls in love with you,

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,970
will you choose him or us

18
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,130
in the decisive battle?

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,060
Us.

20
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,340
A remedy for Firethorn has been developed.

21
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,270
I'll ask someone

22
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,050
to deliver it to you in a few days.

23
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,570
Search carefully.

24
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,850
We must find the people

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,470
who went missing in the city today

26
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,750
and take care of their family members.

27
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,370
Yes.

28
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,550
Look, General.

29
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,180
That is Xiaoman, right?

30
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,870
Come with me!

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,410
General.

32
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,020
After him.

33
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,460
Yes.

34
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,050
Get in.

35
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,310
General, I didn't see him.

36
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,000
What are you going to do, General?

37
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,510
Princess, it's you.

38
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,230
I'm going after a bad guy.

39
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,170
I need to search the carriage according to the rules.

40
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,480
Please forgive me, Your Grace.

41
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,079
Xiaoshu.

42
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,680
Wait!

43
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,470
I'm your future sister-in-law.

44
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,730
It's not proper for you to search

45
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,470
my carriage, right?

46
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,130
It's my duty.

47
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,460
Please forgive me, Your Grace.

48
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,590
I do have an old friend from Liang State in my carriage.

49
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,750
If there is anything you want to know,

50
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,860
just ask me.

51
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,200
You and His Lordship are about to get married.

52
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,550
But now you allow your old friend to stay in your carriage.

53
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,150
It's not proper, right?

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,530
General,

55
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,790
you let the person who hurt my brother's eyes

56
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,090
stay in your mansion.

57
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,510
Is it proper?

58
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,810
Besides, that person has something to do with Ji people.

59
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,010
My apologies.

60
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,810
Sorry to disturb you.

61
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,630
I'll take my leave.

62
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,420
Let's go.

63
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,340
How have you been?

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,630
Pretty good.

65
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,340
I heard that you're about to marry the state lord.

66
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,710
Congratulations.

67
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,860
Princess.

68
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,960
What are you doing?

69
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:17,700
Nothing.

70
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,040
Goodbye.

71
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,690
The big one is for you.

72
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,980
I'll keep the small one.

73
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,640
Consider this our love token.

74
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,650
Do you like it?

75
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,250
General, I've asked around.

76
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,810
That doctor is the director of Qingfeng Clinic.

77
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,900
He came from Liang State half a year ago.

78
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,900
He is handsome.

79
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,640
He's very attractive to girls.

80
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,400
Xiaoman likes to go out these days.

81
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,220
Does she also...

82
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,290
Say no more.

83
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
General's these clothes are so old.

84
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,340
Why does he still keep them?

85
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:39,810
So frugal.

86
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,330
Well, General, why are you standing here without saying anything?

87
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,370
It's scary.

88
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,410
Why did you leave the mansion today?

89
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,820
Didn't I tell you not to go out

90
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,880
since you're sick?

91
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,050
I'm sick,

92
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,850
so I needed to get some medicine.

93
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,750
Did you buy your medicine successfully?

94
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,260
I still need two ingredients.

95
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,830
So I need to go out for a few more days.

96
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,090
Why did you touch men's clothes if you went to buy medicine?

97
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,110
Touch men's clothes?

98
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,790
General, these clothes of yours are dirty.

99
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,250
I need to wash them for you.

100
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,390
Is what Xiaoshu said true?

101
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,550
She and that man really...

102
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,220
[Silk]

103
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,960
You have a slender waist and broad shoulders.

104
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,060
You have a nice figure.

105
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,640
This kind of clothing is perfect for you.

106
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,350
Let me hug you

107
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,680
and see if the waist is suitable.

108
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:51,130
Oops.

109
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,950
The belt seems a bit long.

110
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,280
Did I get the wrong size with General's shabby clothes yesterday?

111
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,660
How dare you!

112
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,190
General.

113
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,020
You are...

114
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,990
The wedding of His Lordship

115
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,020
and Liang State's princess will take place in a few days, right?

116
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,530
I want to make a set of new clothes for you

117
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,750
so that you can wear them at the wedding.

118
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,450
I wanted to give you a surprise,

119
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,050
but you...

120
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,830
General!

121
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,370
I've searched everywhere.

122
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,740
I didn't see anyone suspicious.

123
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,150
Anyone suspicious?

124
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,049
General, you're still suspicious of me?

125
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,039
I thought there were no grudges between us anymore

126
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,789
after I drank the welcome wine.

127
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,110
No.

128
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,789
We think

129
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,780
there's something wrong with the doctor you met before.

130
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,270
Yes.

131
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,559
You've been following me for a few days?

132
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,570
I heard that man...

133
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,800
So you just pretended

134
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,170
to trust me in the past few days.

135
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,210
Even though I'm sincere to you,

136
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,390
in your eyes,

137
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,580
I'm just a...

138
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,730
prisoner.

139
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,610
How can General possibly trust an outsider who just came here?

140
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,640
Xiaoshu... told me...

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,590
that...

142
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,270
that man is a playboy.

143
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,860
I was worried you'd be deceived.

144
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,660
Very good.

145
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,370
You thought I was one of the Ji people at first. Now you think I committed adultery.

146
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,480
So in your eyes, I'm such...

147
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,740
a shameless person.

148
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,870
No.

149
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,630
Xiaoman.

150
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,270
I...

151
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,400
General, she... she ran away.

152
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,540
Go back to receive punishment.

153
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,510
Xiaoman!

154
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,920
Receive punishment?

155
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,320
General! Wait for me!

156
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,210
Don't be angry.

157
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,110
I'm not angry.

158
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,480
That's good.

159
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,820
Where are you going?

160
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,820
To the wing-room.

161
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,630
When you find evidence,

162
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,520
you can put me in prison anytime.

163
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,800
-What happened today is Xiaoshu...
-Also...

164
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,960
You've even learned to make others take the blame.

165
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,480
But let me ask you.

166
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,180
Did you ask Xiaoshu to follow me today?

167
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,280
Then what's there to say?

168
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,630
You're so good at passing the buck.

169
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,750
It's a pity that you're not a cook.

170
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,140
You must be tired today.

171
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,960
General, you should rest early.

172
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,410
Didn't she say she is not angry?

173
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,150
Considering her behavior just now,

174
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,390
is she angry or not?

175
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,990
I was just worried she would be deceived by that man.

176
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,110
Why is she angry?

177
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,550
I am angry.

178
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,550
Xiao Zisu is a jerk.

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,100
Xiao Zisu is petty.

180
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,780
No wonder I've been experiencing back pain recently.

181
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,290
General is very paranoid.

182
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,090
You...

183
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,890
You made him even more paranoid.

184
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,420
General is narrow-minded,

185
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,450
but you made him misunderstand.

186
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,970
General is inflexible,

187
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,750
but you... you made it worse.

188
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,190
What?

189
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,140
Listen to me.

190
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,110
Listen.

191
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,570
It's a beautiful night today.

192
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,100
General.

193
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,580
General.

194
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,110
General, don't get me wrong.

195
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,190
I was just...

196
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,090
scolding Xiaoshu.

197
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,470
Right,

198
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,640
help me think of a way

199
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,800
to stop a girl from being angry.

200
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,780
This...

201
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,630
is what I'm good at.

202
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,520
General,

203
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,110
you...

204
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,300
What is it?

205
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,920
I wanted to remind you to keep the flute sound down.

206
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,250
Looks like the flute

207
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,570
was not played by you.

208
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,190
Wait.

209
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,590
If you want to vent your anger,

210
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,390
why don't you give me three rats?

211
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,830
Then cast a spell

212
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,430
and put them under my pillow.

213
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,640
For each wish fulfilled,

214
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,900
I'll return one to you.

215
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:28,970
What do you think?

216
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,230
Okay.

217
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,180
Any wish is okay?

218
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,830
Any wish is okay.

219
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,520
As long as...

220
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,490
As long as it's not very expensive.

221
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,190
General's salary has been reduced a lot this year.

222
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,230
Don't...

223
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,660
Leave.

224
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,850
I should think carefully

225
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,440
about the three wishes.

226
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,260
Give me your hand first.

227
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,460
It's been stamped.

228
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,260
So you can't break your promise.

229
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,900
You want to break your promise now?

230
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:15,470
No.

231
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,270
Someone else also stamped my hand like this.
