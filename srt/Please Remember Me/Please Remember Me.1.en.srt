00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,940
suddenly bring a few girls back?

136
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,550
And one of them is staying in his chamber.

137
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,720
These maids were trapped

138
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,450
in the cave by Crown Prince Cui during the ritual.

139
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,800
General was worried that they'd take revenge,

140
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,400
so he brought them back

before making plans.

142
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,350
But the rule of the five States

143
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,030
is that soldiers of the Feilian Troop

144
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,980
can't get married

145
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,260

148
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,910
Trouble for what?

149
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,740
To the General, these girls are

163
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,470

164
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,050

Are you going to tell me you can't read?

167
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,150
Let me explain it for you.

168
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,070
River God Temple is under the jurisdiction of Feilian Troop.

Cui Ya suddenly

173
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,580
took the servants

174
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,010
on duty that night.

175
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,490
I've compared the portraits.

176

You're not one of them.

177
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,500
So, who are you?

178
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,070
Why did you sneak into the temple?

179
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,670
General,

180
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,290
when I woke up, I was locked up with the other maids.

181
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,630
I don't remember my past

182
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,350
or where I came from.

183
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,350
They said a maid had run away,

184
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,470
so they captured me to replace her.

185
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,380
General,

186
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,660
actually...

187
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,260
Still not telling the truth?

188
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,050
Don't play tricks with me.

189
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,740
Tell me if you don't want to die.

190
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,180
How did you get here?

191
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,670
I'm telling the truth.

192
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,790
I woke up in the River God Temple.

193
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,090
I don't care how you got to the temple.

194
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,880
I just want to know

195
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,380
where the bell came from.

196
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,470
I might have

197
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,050
bought it,

198
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,070
or maybe I found it.

199
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,920
Still pretending, huh?

200
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,240
Let me tell you,

201
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,610
this bell

202
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,540
is unique to Ji people.

203
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,190
It's hollow inside,

204
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,550
also called the "Heartless Bell."

205
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,380
How do you know?

206
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,490
Because I specialize in killing Ji people.

207
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,510
And you…

208
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,690
are one of them.
