00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,390
I...

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:13,750

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,220

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,690

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,580
Dashu.

No, I can explain.

Tell me!

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,320
Last month, Her Ladyship went to the River God Temple to pray,

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,800
and she was frightened somehow,

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,610
saying Ji people barged in and startled her.

21
00:00:58,730 --> 00:00:59,450
No.

22
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,080
It couldn't have been the Ji people.

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,880
No way.

24
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,570

There must be more to the sister-in-law's death.

26
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,840
It can't be the Ji people.

27
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,330
Why are you defending them?

28
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,550
No, it's because I know them.

29
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,750
I lived with them.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
They're not like the rumors say.

31

They're pure and kind,

32
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,230
and they would never harm anyone.

33
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,410
The so-called red spots on Ji people

34
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,030
are just a result of poor

00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,640
Enough!

39
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,610
Are you also blinded by them?

00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,789
Xianchen,

41
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,190
they trusted me enough to give me their sacred object,

42
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,600
just to ensure my safe passage from Sushui.

43
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,190
Could such people be evil?

44
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,870
This is the Bixi.

45
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,250
Bixi.

46
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,570
They trust us.

47
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,040

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,870
By the way,

54
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,660

But remember,

58
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,680
don't do it here.

64
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,740
Yes.

65
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,460
I'm going up. Go ahead.

66
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:57,940
You came so fast.

67
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,250
I came as soon as you sent me the message.

you won't harm the people no matter what.

71
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,280
Right?

72
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,850
Since you can't get the Bixi anytime soon,

73
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,810
just come back for now.

74
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,210
Let's take the long view.

75
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,600
It's the Dongzhi Festival soon.

76
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,070
I'll be back after the festival.

77
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,820
I'd like to have a farewell dinner with them.

78
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,240
Why are you still so attached to there?

79
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,120
Don't tell me

80
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,850

81
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,620
I know.

82
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,700
I'll come back after the festival.

What's your relationship with the Liang State Princess?

84
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,240
Just an old friend.

85
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,440
Don't think too much.

86

88
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,070
The big one's for you.

89
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,150
The small one's for me.

90
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,630
This is a token of love.

Do you like it?

92
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,910
Did you spend two months' salary

93
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,480
just to buy this?

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,820
I picked it out

95
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,510
carefully, taking me a long time.

96
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,830
It's too casual.

97
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,340

99
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,530
so I'm not sure what to buy.

100
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,680
So, Princess,

101
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,800
what do you think

102
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,500
can be considered sincere?

103
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,380
On the night of the Dongzhi Festival,

104
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,240

Proceed as planned.

But I'm worried, if we keep this from her,

114
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,830
will she blame you?

115
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,320
If the State Lord or Xiao Zisu dies,

116
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,860
Lin State will be in chaos.

117
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,630
It doesn't matter whether she blames me or not.

Lin State

119
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,150
doesn't matter either.

00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,890

I'll do

127
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,120
as you say.

I'm the Crown Prince's doctor. I can vouch

192
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,530
that he's not involved.

193
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,150
General,

194
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,420
finding her is the priority.

195
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,680
Don't waste time here.

196
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,070
Why would you speak for me?

197
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,850
You...

198
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,430
You searched the carriages first,

199
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,490
now the residence.

200
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,270
You're giving me a hard time.

201
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,200
Aren't you afraid it'll affect your reputation?

202
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,710
Reputation?

203
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,430
Do you think I care?

204
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,930
General,

205
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,260
I have news about Xiaoman.

206
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,590
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,970
Why is there no sound at all?

208
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,980
Is she dead?

209
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,870
Dead or alive,

210
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,980
you two go check.

211
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,350
Let's go, San.

212
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,680
Let's go.

213
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,910
Not breathing.

214
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,080
San,

215
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,300
make sure she's dead.

216
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:01,990
Got it.

217
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,440
Young lady, you're quite tough.

218
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,130
Didn't expect you'd survive the pain.

219
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,080
San, kill her!

220
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,030
Sorry,

221
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,740
I'm too late.
