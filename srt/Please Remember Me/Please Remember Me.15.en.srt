00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,950
[Please Remember Me
Episode 15]

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,050
Come on.

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,780
It won't hurt after you take the medicine.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,710
Be good. Come on.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,330
Come on. Let me apply the medicine for you.

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,680
Come on.

7
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,560
It won't hurt after I apply the medicine for you.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,360
Little girl.

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,460
If you let her apply the medicine for you,

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,630
I'll give you a toy.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,720
Okay?

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,280
Look what this is.

13
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,030
A little rat.

14
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,220
Let her apply the medicine.

15
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,010
Are you okay?

16
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,190
I'm sorry

17
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,250
for being rude.

18
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,110
General.

19
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,250
What's the matter?

20
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,810
General, I received news.

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,870
The doctor we brought here said

22
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,930
some citizens did have erythema like that of Ji people.

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,479
Why do they have erythema?

24
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,759
They have the Firethorn poison in their bodies.

25
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,289
General,

26
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,180
should I take some men to arrest them?

27
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,110
No need for that.

28
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,850
Find a courtyard for them in the north.

29
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,740
Ask the doctor named Chang Yuan to treat them.

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,370
Keep it a secret.

31
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:56,840
This...

32
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,050
General,

33
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,940
you... you are covering for them.

34
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,680
Don't let anyone else know.

35
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,580
Yes.

36
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,770
I've checked them just now.

37
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,280
Most of them have fully recovered.

38
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,050
If there's nothing else,

39
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,050
we plan to pack our things and leave.

40
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,740
Thank you.

41
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,680
Nian, get ready to leave.

42
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,150
Since we know each other,

43
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,390
I'll leave this

44
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,310
to you as a souvenir.

45
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,340
I think he has recognized you.

46
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,800
I think so.

47
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,830
Luckily, most of our clansmen left last night.

48
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,730
But we still haven't found Bixi.

49
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,630
It's still not safe to go back to Sushui now.

50
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,340
-Bixi?
-Bixi?

51
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,130
General,

52
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,620
he was frozen after his death and then thrown into the well.

53
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,900
Indeed, someone applied poison on his wounds.

54
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,230
There is much dirt under his fingernails.

55
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,460
It looks a lot like...

56
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,720
It looks a lot like the dirt in the imperial prison.

57
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,060
I think this man from the Ji tribe

58
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,659
died in the imperial prison.

59
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,870
So...

60
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,970
it was His Lordship?

61
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,040
Keep it a secret for now.

62
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,570
Don't let anyone else know.

63
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,710
-Yes.
-Yes.

64
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,330
General!

65
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,870
His Lordship left the palace with the Huqi Troop.

66
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,730
I think he went to catch Ji people.

67
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:22,970
Xiaoman.

68
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,560
After them!

69
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,760
We can't let these Ji people escape.

70
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,420
After them!

71
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,400
Stay away!

72
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,500
You'll be cast a spell if you get close to them.

73
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,530
How come our dream divination technique

74
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,750
doesn't work on them?

75
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,960
I saw needle marks between their thumbs and index fingers.

76
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,560
They can offset some effect.

77
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,350
Ring the bell when they get close.

78
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,080
Chang Yuan,

79
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,840
leave with Bixi and them first.

80
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,470
It's more important to stay alive.

81
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,490
I'll catch up with you soon!

82
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,420
I'm not leaving!

83
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,450
I was not there when the massacre happened in Sushui.

84
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,480
This time, I must fight side by side with you.

85
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,350
Ji people can't do without a leader.

86
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,390
The princess is waiting for you to go back.

87
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,450
Do you want her to be regretful again?

88
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,510
Leave!

89
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,500
I'm not leaving.

90
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:26,660
Leave!

91
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,050
Okay, take care.

92
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,660
Release!

93
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,430
No!

94
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,730
You knew I'm one of the Ji people long ago,

95
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,670
right?

96
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,030
You're very brave.

97
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,930
No wonder Zisu has fallen for you.

98
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,840
Since you know he cares about me,

99
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,290
you should know

100
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,960
he won't easily let it go

101
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,120
if you hurt me!

102
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,310
Xiaoman,

103
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,570
you overestimated

104
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,330
your importance in his heart

105
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,500
and underestimated

106
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,190
our brotherhood.

107
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,720
In relationships,

108
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,800
there are also right and wrong.

109
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,870
As the lord of Lin State,

110
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,230
you've been using a lie that Ji people are guilty to maintain Lin State's position.

111
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,630
Do you still think Zisu will be on your side?

112
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,530
He won't!

113
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,330
Don't be afraid.

114
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,430
I will fulfill

115
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,800
what I promised you.

116
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,230
General.

117
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,890
Zisu,

118
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,400
what are you doing?

119
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,370
Brother,

120
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,690
you can't kill her.

121
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,960
I gave Bixi to her.

122
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,050
I let them go.

123
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,870
I just returned it to its owner.

124
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,930
Xiao Zisu!

125
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,000
I think you really are crazy.

126
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,570
You want the Feilian Troop's soldiers

127
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,130
to die with you.

128
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,180
Is that so?

129
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,340
I haven't remembered much,

130
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,560
but I know

131
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,560
it's a rumor that Ji people are guilty.

132
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,490
They are not evil ghosts who are vicious.

133
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,950
They are ordinary people,

134
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,280
just like us.

135
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,810
Xiaoman,

136
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,740
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,930
This is all I can do.

138
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,720
I'm useless.

139
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,610
General, what are you going to do?

140
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,750
No matter what happens later,

141
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,700
you must move forward.

142
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,040
Don't look back.

143
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,300
Chang Yuan,

144
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,340
take her away!

145
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,960
General.

146
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:12,740
Let's go.

147
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,910
General!

148
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:16,730
General!

149
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,590
Chang Yuan, let go of me!

150
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,290
General, what are you going to do?

151
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,100
General!

152
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,470
Xiao Zisu!

153
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,820
Soldiers of the Feilian Troop, listen to my order!

154
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,420
Yes!

155
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,970
No matter what happens later,

156
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,080
you have to stand

157
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,330
where you are firmly. Don't move an inch!

158
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,130
Do you hear me?

159
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,130
General.

160
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,620
Do you hear me?

161
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,010
-Yes!
-Yes!

162
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,430
Xiao Zisu,

163
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,500
I can't believe you are standing against

164
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,200
Lin State and me

165
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,490
just for a woman!

166
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,640
I'm not doing this for a woman,

167
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,780
but for the justice in my heart!

168
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,330
I must let her go today!

169
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,140
Bastard!

170
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,230
Wuchui!

171
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,790
Yes!

172
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,580
Take him down!

173
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,000
Yes!

174
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:09,850
Wuchui,

175
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,690
how long has it been since we had a competition?

176
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,570
General,

177
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,400
it's been about ten years.

178
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,940
It's been ten years.

179
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,900
How time flies!

180
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,430
Today,

181
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,610
let's have a proper competition.

182
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,470
Qi Gui.

183
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,040
Kong.

184
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,220
Have you found Chang Yuan and Xiaoman?

185
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,150
Not yet.

186
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,300
They were right behind me just now.

187
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,590
They disappeared in the blink of an eye.

188
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,280
Have you sent Wang and the others away?

189
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,340
They already left.

190
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,130
Okay.

191
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,650
Hide yourselves well.

192
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,120
I'll wait for them here.

193
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,060
Okay. You should also be careful.

194
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,840
Enough!

195
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,340
Your Lordship,

196
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,500
I'll take responsibility

197
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,060
for what I did.

198
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,840
It has nothing to do with the Feilian Troop's soldiers.

199
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,230
To Sushui,

200
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,170
I'm Yama who killed many people.

201
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,790
To Lin State,

202
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,770
I'm a traitor.

203
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:48,880
To you,

204
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,770
I'm an ungrateful brother.

205
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,440
I, Xiao Zisu,

206
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,750
committed heinous crimes.

207
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,310
I'm unforgivable.

208
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,580
I deserve to die!

209
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,270
Now,

210
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,100
I'm going to kill myself as an apology.

211
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,230
Zisu!

212
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,370
General!

213
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,510
Xiao Zisu!

214
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,450
When you regain your memories,

215
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,260
I'll take you there.

216
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,600
It's a deal.

217
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,680
Deal.

218
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,320
Actually, I've always thought

219
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,840
that you look like someone in my memory.

220
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,310
After you go back,

221
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,770
you won't remember me.

222
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,070
You must come back on the day of Grain Buds.

223
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,110
Nian.

224
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,860
-General!
-General!

225
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,850
General!

226
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,000
Xiao Zisu!

227
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,840
Don't go there!

228
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,190
Let's go!

229
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,010
Let's go!

230
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,620
Xiao Zisu!

231
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,090
Let's go!

232
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,620
Let's go!
