[Please Remember Me]
[Episode 2]

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,070
And you are one of the Ji people.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,670
General, what are you talking about?

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,280
How could I be one of them?

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,190
I'm not.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,390
Still denying it?

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:18,750
Admit it.

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,130
Are you not going to admit?

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,260
There's no way I'm one of the Ji people.

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,020
I said I'm really not.

11
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,390
General, bad news.

12
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,110
What is it?

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,810
The Crown Prince of Liang State, Cui Ya, is here to make trouble.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,380
General.

15
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:54,930
Open the door!

16
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:55,450
Yes, sir!

17
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,640
[General Ma’s Mansion]

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,340
General.

19
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,370
Your Highness.

20
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,570
General Zisu is here.

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,690
You may leave.

22
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,780
Yes.

23
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,530
You must not be here just to see me

24
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,950
with so many soldiers this late at night.

25
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:28,890
Xiao Zisu,

26
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,070
don't play games with me.

27
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,490
I heard you brought the servant girl

28
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,950
who tried to assassinate me

29
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,280
back to your residence?

30
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,680
Your Highness, it's here.

31
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,670
I know.

32
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,770
Get lost!

33
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,370
Now I suspect you're hiding someone from the Ji people

34
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,210
and attempted to murder me.

35
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,890
You must be joking.

36
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,080
The Feilian Troop is the sworn enemy of Ji people.

37
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,180
I'll do no such thing as hiding them.

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,610
Cut the crap.

39
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,380
Hand her over now!

40
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,490
My sister married your brother

41
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,660
in exchange for the Bixi.

42
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,900
I didn't expect you to treat guests like this in Lin State.

43
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,350
I’ll report it to my father.

44
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,820
It's fine if we cancel the marriage.

45
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,990
Your stupid Bixi

46
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:11,440
will belong to Liang State sooner or later.

47
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,020
Attack!

48
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,970
Who wants their legs removed?

49
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,660
Let me help you remove them.

50
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,120
You losers!

51
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,420
Attack together!

52
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,190
Yes, sir!

53
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,760
Why is no one moving?

54
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,310
Why don't you attack them?

55
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,490
Attack!

56
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,270
Where are my soldiers?

57
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,110
Attack them!

58
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,840
These maids will be investigated by the Feilian Troop from now on.

59
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,320
I’ll let you know when I get the result.

60
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,400
Your Highness, please leave.

61
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,320
Get lost!

62
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,510
Stop!

63
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:19,690
Hya!

64
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:20,850
Hya!

65
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,760
Stop!

66
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,430
Hya!

67
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,690
Hya!

68
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,120
Here is His Lordship's decree.

69
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,600
His Lordship has ordered...

70
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,960
Read. Read it!

71
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,480
The assassination of the Crown Prince

72
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,470
is related to the Ji people.

73
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,670
It cannot be ignored.

74
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,210
The Feilian Troop has to cooperate with the investigation.

75
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,210
Tomorrow noon,

76
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,170
in the side palace,

77
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,570
make all the maids enter the Firethorn Water

78
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,970
and examine if they are Ji people publicly.

79
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,400
Public examination?

80
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,660
Doesn't that mean we have to bath

81
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,750
in public?

82
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,290
What should we do?

83
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,900
If a Ji person is found,

84
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,870
they'll be executed on the spot

85
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,370
in order to bring justice to the Crown Prince.

86
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,700
If there are no Ji people,

87
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,130
you can release all the maids,

88
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,730
and stop investigating the hunting incident.

89
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,660
What?

90
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,240
That's it?

91
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,890
These maids are not married yet.

92
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,690
It's inappropriate to examine them in public.

93
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,570
I disagree.

94
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,460
You don't agree?

95
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,380
I also don't agree!

96
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,330
General Zisu,

97
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,490
please understand His Lordship

98
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,680
and think about the overall situation.

99
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,400
We agree.

100
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,120
General.

101
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,270
We agree.

102
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,900
Who let you come out?

103
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,040
Go back.

104
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,420
General.

105
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,310
We thank you

106
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,860
for taking care of us maids.

107
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,170
But our chastity

108
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,610
compared to the innocence of the Feilian Troop

109
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,650
and the whole Lin State,

110
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,080
is not worth mentioning.

111
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,560
General Zisu, please accept the decree.

112
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,480
Please accept the decree.

113
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,260
I...

114
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,890
accept the decree.

115
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,500
I heard you led them to agree

116
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,220
to the public inspection.

117
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:06,810
Yes.

118
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,330
Compared to the innocence of Lin State,

119
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,440
our chastity worths nothing.

120
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,730
Besides, there is no Ji people

121
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,040
among us.

122
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
I advise you to stop playing tricks.

123
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,130
Confessing your identity now

124
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,020
is your last chance to live.

125
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,240
You brought us back

126
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,720
but left me here alone

127
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,930
just because you suspect I'm one of the Ji people?

128
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,630
Yes.

129
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,280
If you really suspect me,

130
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,070
why didn't you hand me over just now?

131
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,520
It would've saved us a lot of trouble.

132
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,400
The Crown Prince of Liang State has no right to take people from me.

133
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,930
And you have even less right

134
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,710
to teach me how to do my job.

135
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,810
You are right.

136
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,270
But I’m afraid I’ll let you down.

137
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,210
I'm not one of the Ji people.

138
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,130
You're so persistent.

139
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,610
The plan has changed.

140
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,350
I have to find a way to stay beside Xiao Zisu

141
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,780
in order to find the Bixi.

142
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,470
And then...

143
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,450
kill him.

144
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,710
[River God Temple]

145
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,840
Bring those maids here.

146
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,630
Hurry!

147
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,500
Add some Firethorn Water.

148
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,470
Add more!

149
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,830
Stinky servants!

150
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,730
Take your clothes off. What are you waiting for?

151
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,220
Wait.

152
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,510
Your Lordship.

153
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,600
Xiaoshu.

154
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,520
Yes.

155
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,260
Feilian Troop.

156
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,490
Put up the screens.

157
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,030
Close your eyes.

158
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,300
What are they doing?

159
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,070
Your Highness, they've surrounded the area with fabric screens.

160
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,420
We can't see anything now.

161
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,110
They're all covered up.

162
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,040
Then what are you still looking at?

163
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,520
Let's begin.

164
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,670
Everyone,

165
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,520
please enter the water to test your identity.

166
00:09:59,010 --> 00:09:59,870
Your Highness.

167
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,400
Can Liang State's Firethorn

168
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,960
really cause red spots to appear on Ji people?

169
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,050
Of course.

170
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,200
Firethorn is Liang State's unique exorcism herb.

171
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,920
When Ji people touch it,

172
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,880
their whole body will feel like they're struck by a strip.

173
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,210
The pain is unbearable.

174
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,620
In less than half an hour,

175
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,990
they will grow red spots.

176
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,260
After one joss stick,

177
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,070
when the medicine enters the internal organs,

178
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,230
their body will rot.

179
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,510
It's excruciating.

180
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,440
Burying a needle on the Zhongfu acupoint

181
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,000
can seal the blood flowing to the heart

182
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,530
and suppress the red spots.

183
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,500
Remember,

184
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,370
don't bury the needle for more than two days.

185
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,760
I will find half of the Bixi

186
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,490
in order to seek justice for us

187
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,560
and bring everyone back to Sushui.

188
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,260
Go home.

189
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,680
Your Lordship,

190
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,700
please let Nanny check inside.

191
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,400
Okay.

192
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,100

193
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,950
How long has it been?

194
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,070
Why is there no movement?

195
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,150
Your Highness, the joss stick is burned out.

196
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,610
Nanny is checking inside.

197
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,670
Your Lordship, Your Highness,

198
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,790
there are no red spots on them.

199
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,940
What?

200
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,950
Impossible.

201
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,860
Absolutely impossible.

202
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,790
Let them come up.

203
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,890
No, absolutely not.

204
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,570
Let me tell you.

205
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,390
They must be one of the Ji people.

206
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,350
Your Lordship.

207
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,400
Since no spots are found,

208
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,690
and it's winter now.

209
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,690
They must be weak after soaking in the medicinal water.

210
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,210
Let them leave first.

211
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,210
Permission granted.

212
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:21,760
No.

213
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,330
It must be because we didn't put enough Firethorn.

214
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:24,910
Your Highness.

215
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,370
Your...

216
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:25,890
Your Highness.

217
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,620
Pour in more Firethorn water.

218
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,310
Your Highness.

219
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,570
Get me more.

220
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,210
Do you hear me?

221
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:29,890
-Yes.
-Yes.

222
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,950
There must be something wrong with the Firethorn.

223
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,850
Get me some new ones.

224
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,460
Stop!

225
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,660
Get me some new ones.

226
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,150
Your Highness, slow down.

227
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,110
Cui Ya, are you done with your antics?

228
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,850
Caiyi, how dare you hit me?

229
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,680
If you disgrace my father again,

230
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,920
and ruin Liang State's reputation,

231
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,090
[Liang State's Princess Cui Caiyi]

232
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,170
you should get lost!

233
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,330
You, take him away.

234
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,370
Treating his eye disease is more important.

235
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:56,940
Yes.

236
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,190
General, please take these maids away

237
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
and comfort them.

238
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,740
State Lord, my brother is young.

239
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,720
He has been spoiled by his parents.

240
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,250
He has suffered embarrassment today,

241
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,930
so it's understandable that he's acting childish.

242
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,130
Please forgive him.

243
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,610
It was our negligence that the Crown Prince

244
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,450
got into an accident in Lin State.

245
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,250
I will find a famous doctor

246
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,420
to treat his eyes.

247
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,640
Listen.

248
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,250
This is not over.

249
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:26,950
Your Highness.

250
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,540
Ladies, sorry to have made you suffer.

251
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:32,570
You...

252
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,430
Put it on.

253
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:48,930
Here.

254
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,500
Put it on.

255
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,790
Go and rest.

256
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,390
The Cui family make it up to you in the future.

257
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:02,990
Let's go.

258
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,820
Xiaoshu.

259
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,110
Yes.

260
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,910
Send the maids on the records back to where they belong.

261
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,340
Those who are not on the records, send them back to the residence.

262
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:10,900
Yes.

263
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,980
Everyone, follow me.

264
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,080
[Tranquil Court]

265
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,560
What is this?
