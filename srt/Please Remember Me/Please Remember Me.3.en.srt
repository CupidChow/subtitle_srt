00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,870
[Please Remember Me
Episode 3]

2
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,450
What is this?

3
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,050
I got bitten by a mosquito.

4
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,410
What?

5
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,410
I have already gone through the trials of the Firethorn Water.

6
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,940
You still don't believe me?

7
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,050
Ji people are skilled in dream divination and acupuncture techniques.

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,980
Have you used these methods to seal your vital points

9
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,050
and avoid the verification?

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,490
It seems you really has studied the Ji people quite thoroughly.

11
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,150
But I don't have needles here.

12
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,610
If you don't believe me,

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,450
you can check it yourself.

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,110
General, you're brave and invincible.

15
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,770
But you feare touching women?

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:18,970
No need to remove your inner clothing.

17
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,010
Just go in.

18
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,160
There's no one else here.

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,420
I'll check you myself.

20
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,110
Looks like you won't give up until you achieve your goal.

21
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,690
You can check me again if you want.

22
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,729
But...

23
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,030
But what?

24
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,100
But how is what you are doing

25
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,979
any different from what Crown Prince Cui did?

26
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,530
Wait.

27
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,690
Put it on.

28
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,210
Before I find out who you are,

29
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,660
stay in the General's Mansion.

30
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,670
[Fanglin Garden]

31
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,780
The precious sapling is blooming!

32
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,840
The precious sapling is blooming!

33
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,250
Aside from finding the Ji people and clarifying the truth,

34
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,630
you are the only thing

35
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,430
that can help me recover my memories.

36
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,530
This...

37
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,840
It has fallen again.

38
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,260
Good morning, General. Good morning, Dashu.

39
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,690
What is she doing?

40
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:40,940
I don't know.

41
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,240
She has been eagerly working around the mansion since early this morning.

42
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,130
Keep a close watch on her.

43
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,820
Yes.

44
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,570
By the way,

45
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,590
we have news from the lord.

46
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,450
It says

47
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,420
they have captured a Ji person.

48
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,020
A Ji person?

49
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,650
Yes.

50
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,000
Dashu.

51
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,089
You scared me.

52
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,050
Why are you here?

53
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,399
From now on,

54
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,899
if there's anything you need me to do in the mansion,

55
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,120
just tell me.

56
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,710
I'm very diligent.

57
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,090
Whatever you need me to do, I can handle it.

58
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:26,710
Let me take care of this.

59
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,460
This...

60
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,100
Stop!

61
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:29,810
Stop.

62
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,170
Go away.

63
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,600
You nearly made me damage the General's precious item.

64
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,350
The General's precious item?

65
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,610
With so many valuable flowers and plants in the General's Mansion.

66
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,690
Why does the General care so much

67
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,620
about this worthless dead branch?

68
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,470
Worthless?

69
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,880
Let me tell you.

70
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,100
When the General returned from Sushui,

71
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,830
he had this pinned to his placket.

72
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,070
Sushui?

73
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,650
Is it the loot he brought back from my hometown?

74
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,940
The General has been waiting for it to bloom.

75
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,520
It's been so many years.

76
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,720
I don't know why...

77
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,850
Tell me.

78
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,750
What are you doing?

79
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,520
It's my fault.

80
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,570
Why am I telling you this?

81
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,660
Nothing.

82
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,320
I just think this withered branch

83
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,130
seems to have a heavy aura of grievance.

84
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:21,970
Grievance?

85
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,110
I don't see it as grievance.

86
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,310
I think it's a bit sad,

87
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,900
like the General,

88
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,520
as if

89
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,450
it has forgotten something important.

90
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,290
I'll go check if Aunt Qiu

91
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,520
needs any help.

92
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,030
OK.

93
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,290
I'm so diligent.

94
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,550
I certainly won't eat and drink for free.

95
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,090
Tell me.

96
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,530
Where is the other half of the Bixi?

97
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,290
Kill me! Kill me!

98
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,810
Wuchui.

99
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,050
General.

100
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,330
Lord of the Continent is interrogating the prisoner.

101
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,170
You can't go in.

102
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:08,770
Move!

103
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,470
General.

104
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,360
General!

105
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,930
No!

106
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,010
Qi.

107
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,110
Qi.

108
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,300
Qi.

109
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,290
Qi.

110
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,159
Qi.

111
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,930
We can't get any more out of him.

112
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,720
[Lord's Mansion]

113
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,670
So I gave him a quick end.

114
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,250
Who is Qi?

115
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,250
Why am I crying?

116
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,520
Qi.

117
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,800
I want to find my memory in Sushui.

118
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,050
How many times have I told you?

119
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,540
You lost your memory of the Sushui campaign

120
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,790
because of injuries sustained in that battle.

121
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,590
What use is asking the Ji people?

122
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,310
From now on,

123
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,430
don't bring up such things again.

124
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,980
One must look forward.

125
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,910
Where could the Bixi be hidden?

126
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,100
If all else fails,

127
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,670
I will...

128
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,159
What are you doing?

129
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,670
I'm cleaning, Aunt Qiu.

130
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,610
Good. Change the bedding for General.

131
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,470
Yes.

132
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,380
The charcoal is finished.

133
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:46,980
Just in time.

134
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,830
Let me use dream divination to ask her.

135
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,130
Aunt Qiu.

136
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:06,270
Is there anything else?

137
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,890
Where is the Bixi hidden?

138
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
Aunt Qiu.

139
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,690
What's wrong with you?

140
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,930
I just felt dizzy.

141
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,850
I forgot what I was supposed to do.

142
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,540
Right, buy eggs.

143
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,740
Yes, buy eggs.

144
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,010
Buy eggs?

145
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,570
We still have eggs at home.

146
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:27,970
Gosh.

147
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:31,970
Oh dear.

148
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,700
What are you doing?

149
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,919
Why did you break the vase?

150
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,780
Look at you.

151
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,850
You're not good at anything

152
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,650
and can't even get enough to eat.

153
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,169
Do you know how much this vase...

154
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,500
Cost?

155
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,530
Where is the Bixi?

156
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,530
Dashu.

157
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,650
What's wrong?

158
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,580
I just felt dizzy.

159
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,860
I think I forgot something.

160
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,870
Don't follow my example.

161
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,490
I suspect you might have infected me.

162
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,620
I hope it didn't get passed on to the General.

163
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,550
-No way.
-Hurry.

164
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,260
Quickly boil some eggs for the General to replenish his energy

165
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,740
Where is the Bixi hidden?

166
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,880
I don't know.

167
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,310
Where is the Bixi hidden?

168
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,890
I don't know.

169
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,660
These two are Xiao Zisu's trusted subordinates.

170
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,370
I can't get any information out of them.

171
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:36,970
Looks like

172
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,740
I have no choice but to ask him directly.

173
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,390
Aunt Qiu, the eggs you bought are here.

174
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,110
Aunt Qiu.

175
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:46,470
Let me do it.

176
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,490
Put it there.

177
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,780
Aunt Qiu, Dashu.

178
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,650
Please take good care of me in the mansion.

179
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,670
Xiaoman, let me tell you.

180
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,670
The General's Mansion doesn't have many rules.

181
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,140
I understand.

182
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,170
Only by working well

183
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,100
and not making mistakes can I stay.

184
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,130
Please help me

185
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,210
become more familiar with the mansion.

186
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,170
If I'm dismissed by the General

187
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,630
for not doing things well,

188
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,190
I won't have any way to make a living.

189
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,620
As long as you have no ulterior motives toward the General,

190
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,410
we won't make things difficult for you.

191
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:19,810
Yes.

192
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,230
Take it slow.

193
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,210
I am devoted to the General

194
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,190
just like the yolk is to the egg,

195
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,850
with a single-hearted focus.

196
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,040
-Two hearts.
-Two hearts.

197
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,180
What's going on?

198
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,830
Aunt Qiu,

199
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,660
where did you buy the eggs?

200
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,430
Brother.

201
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,090
The General is back.

202
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,030
He wants to see you.

203
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,630
Okay, I got it.

204
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,030
Why are there so many yolks?

205
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,090
Two hearts.

206
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,460
Two hearts?

207
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,250
Two hearts.

208
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,910
Two hearts?

209
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,590
They are good for stir-frying.

210
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,410
Good for stir-frying.

211
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,750
Two hearts?

212
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,700
The General is back.

213
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,960
May you be prosperous!

214
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,590
The General is truly handsome.

215
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,300
This is...

216
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,860
It's called Little Trash.

217
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,900
That maid

218
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,070
somehow got it from somewhere.

219
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,320
After teaching it for a while,

220
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,930
it can actually speak human language now.

221
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,380
We were just playing with it earlier.

222
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,430
It is said that the Bixi from Sushui can summon the dead

223
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,660
and bring people back to life.

224
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,400
Having it

225
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,550
is equivalent to having the power to control the world.

226
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,950
But that's just a legend.

227
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,850
Is the Bixi really that magical?

228
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,720
You'll only know if it's true

229
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,450
once you find the other half to complete it.

230
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,200
The only thing you need to do now

231
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,710
is to find the other half of the Bixi.

232
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,510
Shall I take it away?

233
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,270
No need.

234
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,290
It can add some vitality

235
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,040
if left in the courtyard.

236
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,990
Alright.

237
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,370
By the way,

238
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,710
how has her condition been these past few days?

239
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,270
According to your order,

240
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,420
I let her inquire about everything in the mansion.

241
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,770
She can move around freely.

242
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,770
No unusual behavior has been found.

243
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,940
She cleaned the corridors at 9 a.m.,

244
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,150
the bedroom at noon,

245
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,270
then watered the flowers.

246
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,850
At 1 p.m., she started washing vegetables.

247
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,640
She is

248
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,870
cooking now.

249
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,870
Get to the point.

250
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:05,890
The point?

251
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:06,820
Right.

252
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,510
She worked while taking notes in a book.things.

253
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:10,820
She...

254
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,970
What did you just say?

255
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,680
I said she worked while taking notes.

256
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:17,850
No.

257
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,010
She cleaned the kitchen at noon.

258
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,410
Right.

259
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,050
Then?

260
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,210
Then she watered the flowers.

261
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,410
Watered the flowers?

262
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,130
Run!

263
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,420
The General is angry.

264
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,130
Run!

265
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,210
General.

266
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,080
Food is ready.

267
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,850
I made scrambled eggs for you.

268
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,050
I even added some chopped green onions.

269
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,200
General, what are you...

270
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,690
Take it out.

271
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:08,940
Take it out!

272
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,340
The notebook.

273
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,410
The notebook you were writing in.

274
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,210
General.

275
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,610
Are you interested in my journal?

276
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,030
Where are

277
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,550
my flowers?
