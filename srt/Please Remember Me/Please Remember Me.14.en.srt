[Please Remember Me: Episode 14]

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,520
[The Lord's Mansion]

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:17,850
My Lord.

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,810
General.

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,790
My Lord, are you alright?

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,350
The ones who attacked us last night were not Ji demons,

7
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,190
but the people who went missing last time.

8
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,710
They were just manipulated by Ji people

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,750
and lost their mind.

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,380
But we still can't let them stay alive.

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,180
They've already been infected.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,330
We have to kill them.

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:39,900
Don't kill them!

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,130
As long as the spell is broken, they'll come to their senses.

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,990
Are you speaking up for Ji people?

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,830
Killing puppets is not a good idea.

17
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,690
If you do this, it will only make our citizens panic.

18
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,090
As a military officer,

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,470
you're holding a sharp sword,

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,000
but you are quite merciful.

21
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,170
If you do a good job,

22
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,190
you'll become the hero of the people.

23
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,590
If you can't do a good job,

24
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,970
you'll become the sinner of the people.

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,160
Why do you have to choose the hardest path for yourself?

26
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,910
This is my duty as the General of the Feilian Troop.

27
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,390
Fine.

28
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,980
You can decide

29
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,710
how to deal with this matter.

30
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,710
Then let me ask you.

31
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,550
Who broke their spell?

32
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,270
It was...

33
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,370
It was someone who helped us.

34
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:32,910
Zisu.

35
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,110
Even though you are my younger brother,

36
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,979
I still can't let you keeping

37
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,610
taking a guess randomly without any reasons.

38
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,680
Do you understand?

39
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,140
It doesn't matter if you didn't eat it.

40
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,230
I'll give each of you a Lucky Pouch.

41
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,020
Here you are. Xiaoman, this is for you.

42
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,420
This is for you, General.

43
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:32,910
Xiaoman.

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,090
Xiaoman!

45
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,690
Xiaoman!

46
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,870
Xiaoman!

47
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,580
General.

48
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,060
Dashu.

49
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,220
Xiaoshu.

50
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,840
And Aunt Qiu.

51
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,610
Thank you.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,330
The weather in the Lin State was very cold,

53
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,770
but you guys made me feel the real warmth.

54
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,970
I have to leave here.

55
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,140
May the winter snow in the General's Mansion melt soon,

56
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,900
and may the weather there become warm and sunny in spring.

57
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,420
Xiaoman.

58
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,230
Thank you

59
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,110
for leaving us a whole spring.

60
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,829
When we see each other next time...

61
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,100
I hope that we won't be enemies anymore.

62
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,550
[Feilian Troop]

63
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,590
Can you think of anything else?

64
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,850
We all stayed in the cave after we woke up.

65
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,980
Only these several people

66
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,570
delivered food and drinks to us regularly every day.

67
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,700
But the echo in the cave was quite loud.

68
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,620
It sounded like there were many people every time.

69
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,230
Did they say anything before casting the spell?

70
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,800
No, they didn't say anything.

71
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,380
General.

72
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,130
They've been checked.

73
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,270
They are the same as normal people now.

74
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,460
Inform their family to take them back home.

75
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,090
Yes.

76
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:06,860
Yes.

77
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,060
Everyone,

78
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,780
come out to see your family.

79
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,630
Thanks for your great kindness, General!

80
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,159
Thanks for your great kindness, General!

81
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,290
Everyone, please go back.

82
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,940
Try not to go out recently.

83
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,220
Pay attention to safety.

84
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,620
-Thank you, General.
-Thank you, General.

85
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,210
Let's go.

86
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,180
Among these people, maybe there are still some Ji people.

87
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,650
Pay close attention to the movements of each of them.

88
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,700
Follow up their subsequent situations.

89
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,930
We have to be more careful recently.

90
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,390
Yes.

91
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,970
I can't believe that Xiao Zisu let them all go.

92
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,790
So you concealed it from me as you wanted to assassinate him?

93
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,770
You are merciful.

94
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,370
But he won't show mercy to us.

95
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,070
But even if we kill him,

96
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,230
the members of our clan still can't

97
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,600
live a peaceful life.

98
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,050
What's more, Xiao Zisu has also agreed that

99
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:40,909
he'll let us go.

100
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,870
What do you mean?

101
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,810
What do you mean by saying that?

102
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,760
Are you starting to pity him?

103
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,870
Don't worry.

104
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,680
I won't see him again.

105
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,560
You had better do so.

106
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,650
Let them all go.

107
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,560
Yes.

108
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,550
Zisu is still too merciful.

109
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,090
As for that corpse...

110
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,710
It's time to use it.

111
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,560
Among the five continents,

112
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,940
you seem to hate Ji people more.

113
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,950
My and Zisu's mother

114
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,740
died because of something related to

115
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,620
Ji people.

116
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,250
Although Zisu was in the Side House,

117
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,130
he could see our mother every day.

118
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,770
And I

119
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,620
thought that I could save our mother out after I grew up.

120
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,020
But she killed herself in order to seek justice for Ji people.

121
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,890
Both my wife and child

122
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:42,200
died of Ji people's erythema, too.

123
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,110
Speaking of the past always makes me sad.

124
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,940
Let's not mention it.

125
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,080
Let's not mention it.

126
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,300
My Lord.

127
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,540
You lost this chess game.

128
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,800
Miss Caiyi,

129
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,230
you're good at playing chess.

130
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,550
Our town is not big.

131
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,850
In the village in the south of this town,

132
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,710
everyone shares a well together.

133
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,830
Last night, someone found that a person died in the well,

134
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,150
so we took him out of the well.

135
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,880
It turned out that he was a member of the Ji Clan.

136
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,160
His body was full of red rashes.

137
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,970
The people in the north of the village

138
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,410
also drank that water when they had dinner in the evening.

139
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,810
They also got those red rashes in the second half of the night.

140
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,860
Xiaoshu, tell the soldiers

141
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,580
to let the healthy people stay in the north

142
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,000
and let the sick people stay in the south.

143
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,810
Yes.

144
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,410
Guys, come with me.

145
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,870
Fumigate the place over there, too.

146
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
General, please.

147
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,340
What are they doing?

148
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,950
This morning,

149
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,100
two doctors happened to pass by our town,

150
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,620
so they came here to help us.

151
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,120
Luckily, they're here.

152
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,780
If we had only relied on ourselves,

153
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,240
it would have been a mess.

154
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,480
Where are they now?

155
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,480
In the yard in the north.

156
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,130
Take me there to have a look.

157
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,720
Okay. This way, please.

158
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,710
This is the place.

159
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,370
Check on him.

160
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,880
Doctor.

161
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,180
What are you doing?

162
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,320
This kind of wound surface is very itchy.

163
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,470
I'm afraid they might break it,

164
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,070
so I'm bandaging it up first.

165
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,100
It's you?

166
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,200
Why are you here?

167
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,370
I went out of the city to collect herbs this morning

168
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,600
and happened to pass by this place,

169
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,060
so I came here to help them.

170
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,710
That's my cousin.

171
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:05,700
Nian.

172
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,730
Say hello to the general.

173
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,560
My cousin is an introvert.

174
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,600
General, please don't blame her.

175
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,730
Please forgive her.

176
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,080
Miss, you look delicate with a small figure.

177
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,140
But you're still trying to help them

178
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,940
and have put yourself in danger.

179
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,850
I thank you on behalf of everyone.

180
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,150
She's just fulfilling her duty as a doctor.

181
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,940
Please be more careful, Miss.

182
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,100
Doctors.

183
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,700
Why are you all working without wearing gloves?

184
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,540
Aren't you afraid of getting infected with Ji people's erythema?

185
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,800
Ji people's erythema?

186
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,590
This disease is obviously caused by poisoning.

187
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,530
Poisoning?

188
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,450
Poisoning?

189
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,040
How would be it poisoning?

190
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,340
How would be it poisoning?

191
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,640
Then you have to ask this corpse in front of us.

192
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,390
General.

193
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:35,890
No!

194
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,050
Qi.

195
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,690
Someone applied poison to this rotten corpse on purpose.

196
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,380
Then he used the water source

197
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,070
to infect the people in the town.

198
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,390
If you don't identify this kind of poison carefully,

199
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,160
it does look like Ji people's erythema.

200
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,560
But...

201
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,310
But he's a member of the Ji Clan.

202
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,810
What's wrong with that?

203
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,210
Are Ji people very scary?

204
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,840
Ji people are not scary.

205
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,320
But the one who uses Ji people is scary.

206
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,650
Besides,

207
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,590
Ji people's erythema is just a rumor.

208
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,050
Has anyone really seen it?

209
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,450
Have you seen it?

210
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,240
No, I haven't.

211
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,690
Take the corpse back to the official residence

212
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,950
and ask the coroner to examine it carefully.

213
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,710
Without my permission,

214
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,820
no one is allowed to come close to it.

215
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,210
Yes.

216
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,060
I'll go ask someone to do it.

217
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,340
I will investigate this matter thoroughly.

218
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,740
Everyone, please keep it a secret.

219
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,800
Yes.

220
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,540
Someone applied poison

221
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,390
to this rotten corpse on purpose.

222
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,650
Ji people are not scary.

223
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,890
But the one who uses Ji people is scary.

224
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,320
Someone is trying to make trouble by using Ji people.

225
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,140
It looks like

226
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,590
it's time to let these Ji people go home.

227
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,780
Let me do it.

228
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,580
Is there anything else?

229
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,930
Do you need to wash all these things?

230
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:02,930
Soldier!

231
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,440
General!

232
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,760
What are you doing?

233
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,400
I'm doing the guard duty.

234
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,060
Guard duty?

235
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,620
There's no need to do the guard duty here.

236
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,350
Wash all these things.

237
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,280
The weather is so cold now.

238
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,860
Don't let this young lady touch cold water.

239
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,350
Yes.
