00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,920
[Please Remember Me]
[Episode 23]

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,150
I'm taking it out for you.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,310
He deserves to die,

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,500
but not by your hands.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,320
Choujia!

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,020
Choujia!

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,720
Your Highness.

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,400
Fine. I'll let him go.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,020
Let go of me!

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,920
Your Highness, I was wrong.

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,120
Please spare my life.

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,920
Choujia.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:38,920
Get lost!

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,910
Who are you?

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,120
I'm a doctor who can cure your eyes

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,470
and someone who can kill you anytime.

17
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,470
Your Highness,

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,910
stay at home for the time being.

19
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,890
Don't bother others anymore.

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,170
Otherwise, I'll cause trouble for you.

21
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,660
Although it's faster for me to kill people than to save them,

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,090
but curing your eyes

23
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,200
is a piece of cake.

24
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,140
But my patience is limited.

25
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,170
Your Highness,

26
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,770
will you listen to me?

27
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,070
Yes.

28
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,000
Of course.

29
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,030
Then I'll stay here for the time being.

30
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:22,590
I don't agree.

31
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,200
Your Highness.

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,760
Stay.

33
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,050
Just stay.

34
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,710
Princess, excuse me.

35
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,030
What are you trying to do?

36
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,240
His Highness is moody.

37
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,100
Before the deal between the Ji people and Xiao Xianchen is completed,

38
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,590
I'll keep an eye on him.

39
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,210
Don't worry. As long as he behaves himself,

40
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,800
I can heal his eyes as a return.

41
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,050
Your charms can manipulate puppets at will.

42
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,380
What else can you trade?

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,310
If I didn't want my clansmen to live a peaceful life in the Five States,

44
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,410
I would have made someone pay for it.

45
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,190
Actually,

46
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,410
I really went back to find you.

47
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,490
I want to take you back to Sushui.

48
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,730
But on the way,

49
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,570
I heard the news about the Feilian Troop attacking Sushui

50
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,090
so I immediately...

51
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:20,760
I know.

52
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:24,690
If I were you, I would've gone back.

53
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,040
You knew that,

54
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,820
then why do you keep a distance from me?

55
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,950
Because of me,

56
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,440
you went back to the cage you didn't want to stay in.

57
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,329
This time,

58
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,050
as long as you are willing,

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,540
I'll take you away.

60
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,960
Take me away?

61
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,860
Are you pitying me?

62
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,930
We can't go back.

63
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,250
Now you have your Sushui,

64
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,310
I have my Liang State.

65
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,720
Fate is a matter of twists and turns.

66
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,120
I accept it.

67
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,690
Xiaoman,

68
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,840
can you really go on like this?

69
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,300
Don't save one

70
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,980
only to put another in danger.

71
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,820
Don't worry, Aunt Qiu.

72
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,520
I know what I'm doing.

73
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,840
Really?

74
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,750
Don't lie to me.

75
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,190
Yes.

76
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,900
General Xiao.

77
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:09,900
Xiaoman!

78
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,720
General Xiao.

79
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,540
You really saved the General?

80
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,420
Xiaoman.

81
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,690
Nian.

82
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,640
Xiaoman is Nian.

83
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,400
Aunt Qiu.

84
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,240
If the General wakes up,

85
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,330
don't tell him I was here.

86
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:42,880
This...

87
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,409
How can this be?

88
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,159
Aunt Qiu.

89
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,000
Okay.

90
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,880
Xiaoman.

91
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,120
Xiaoman.

92
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,150
Brother!

93
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,940
Please let me out.

94
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,530
I beg you. I want to go back to Sushui.

95
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,560
Brother, let me out!

96
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,340
They are really good people.

97
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,600
Why don't you trust me? Brother!

98
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,570
Let me out!

99
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,780
Let me out!

100
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,470
Let me out!

101
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,970
Brother!

102
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,720
Nian!

103
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,300
Xiaoman.

104
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,440
Don't give up.

105
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,870
Xiaoman!

106
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,730
Xiaoman.

107
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,990
I'll definitely go back

108
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:42,980
to Sushui.

109
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,659
Xiaoman.

110
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,310
Brother.

111
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,909
Zisu.

112
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,220
I know you will hate me for doing this.

113
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,900
But I have to do this.

114
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,920
This is not only for you,

115
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,500
but also for Lin State.

116
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,170
Brother,

117
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,130
what are you talking about?

118
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,010
Why would I blame you?

119
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,950
Why am I in prison?

120
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,630
Well...

121
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,560
Why am I locked up

122
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,170
and being tortured?

123
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,390
Did I do something wrong?

124
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,020
Your Lordship, General Xiao has forgotten about the past seven days.

125
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,659
Okay.

126
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:39,710
Yes.

127
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,910
Zisu, in the battle of Sushui,

128
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,570
you achieved great military feats

129
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,170
and killed all the Ji people.

130
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,210
You are now the Qilin General of Lin State.

131
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,400
But you were also ambushed by them,

132
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,850
suffered delusions and lost your memory.

133
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,190
I was afraid you'd hurt yourself

134
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,250
and in order to cover it up

135
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,430
I locked you in here.

136
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,630
I massacred Sushui

137
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,840
and was ambushed?

138
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,660
Yeah.

139
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,170
Ji people are really despicable.

140
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,760
But don't be afraid.

141
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,790
I'll take you out now.

142
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,050
I massacred Sushui?

143
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,170
Xiaoman.

144
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,810
What does Xiaoman mean?

145
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,580
A few days ago, it was the solar term, Grain Buds.

146
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,670
Xiaoman.

147
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,450
Xiaoman.

148
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,530
Zisu,

149
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,670
let's never mention this again.

150
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:20,620
Xiaoman.

151
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,550
General Xiao, you're awake.

152
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,210
He's awake.

153
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,210
Xiaoman is Nian.

154
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:26,910
Xiaoman.

155
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,130
General Xiao.

156
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,390
You're finally awake.

157
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,230
General!

158
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,140
General!

159
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,440
-General.
-General.

160
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,400
General!

161
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,660
Slow down.

162
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,120
Slowly.

163
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,050
Here, General.

164
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,120
Slowly.

165
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,060
Where's Xiaoman?

166
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,770
-Xiaoman.
-Xiaoman.

167
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:53,340
Xiaoman.

168
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,940
I think I saw her coming back,

169
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:55,660
right?

170
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,890
General is so sick that his eyes are blurred.

171
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,370
Xiaoman didn't come back.

172
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,510
There are only a few of us here.

173
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,370
Yes.

174
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,170
General,

175
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,390
you must miss Xiaoman too much.

176
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,720
You just woke up. Don't think too much.

177
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,030
No.

178
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,720
She must be back.

179
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,560
General.

180
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,010
General.

181
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,510
No.

182
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,230
General, be careful.

183
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,420
Here. Be careful.

184
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,780
Be careful.

185
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,600
Xiaoman!

186
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,430
Xiaoman!

187
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,450
General.

188
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:35,980
General!

189
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,790
-Slow down, General.
-Xiaoman!

190
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,840
General!

191
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,350
General!

192
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:44,850
General,

193
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,980
you just recovered.

194
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,900
Let's go back.

195
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,760
Don't touch me.

196
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:48,930
General.

197
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,110
Xiaoman is really not back.

198
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,680
She didn't come back.

199
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:53,880
Impossible.

200
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,290
Impossible.

201
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,530
General!

202
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,900
General!

203
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,750
General!

204
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,340
General!

205
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,190
Wait!

206
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,010
Xiaoman.

207
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,280
Are you here to deliver food for us?

208
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,080
General Xiao.

209
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,570
Miss, you go first.

210
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,050
Yes.

211
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,610
General, it's windy here.

212
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,510
You haven't recovered yet.

213
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,420
Go and rest early.

214
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,230
Yes.

215
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,730
Go back and rest.

216
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,670
Let's go.

217
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:42,950
Here.

218
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,770
Xiaoman.

219
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,090
General Xiao, you're awake.

220
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,640
Have you seen Xiaoman?
