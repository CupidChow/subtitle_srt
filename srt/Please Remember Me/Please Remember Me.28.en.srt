[Please Remember Me
Episode 28]

2
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,710
Why has he been

3
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,130
lighting calming incense for me late at night these past two days and then leaving?

4
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:19,090
Xiaoman.

5
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,250
What are you doing?

6
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,030
I'm fine.

7
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,370
I'm fine.

8
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,190
Did Chang Yuan tell you

9
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,900
that the fruit of the Xiantang tree can bring people back to life?

10
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,350
Are you silly?

11
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,930
They're all just lies.

12
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,840
But this is the only way to save you.

13
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,310
Xiaoman, let me try.

14
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,550
It’s fine, let me try, okay?

15
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,580
Let me try.

16
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,730
-Let me try.
- Xiao Zisu.

17
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,350
Let me try.

18
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,000
Xiao Zisu.

19
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,389
Let me try.

20
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,479
-Let me try.
-Xiao Zisu.

21
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,289
Listen to me!

22
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:12,970
Listen to me.

23
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,350
Zisu,

24
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,079
if you hadn't come to Sushui back then,

25
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,430
if you'd stayed in Lin State and gotten married and had children,

26
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,630
none of this would have happened to you.

27
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,550
I saved you

28
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,910
because we Ji people owe you.

29
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:38,010
You don't have to do all this for me.

30
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,829
I don't want you to die.

31
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,010
I know.

32
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,530
You…

33
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,100
Listen to me.

34
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,000
Don’t do anything foolish.

35
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,829
I'll agree to anything you want,

36
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,100
okay?

37
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:00,940
Okay.

38
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,810
Then let’s get married.

39
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,210
Mhm.

40
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,560
Five days from now will be an auspicious day.

41
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,430
Brother, since you have postponed your wedding,

42
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,800
we can use what was prepared for that.

43
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,870
It seems you’ve made up your mind.

44
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,590
I will prove to the world

45
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,060
that the Ji people are not evil.

46
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,860
They are not like the rumors say.

47
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,780
And what about the matter of her poisoning me?

48
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,600
Brother, you should know in your heart

49
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,370
that you weren't poisoned.

50
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,690
I know you have great ambitions.

51
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,530
But the world isn’t won by swords and spears,

52
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,740
by shifting the disaster eastward.

53
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,400
It’s won by peace and harmony,

54
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,030
by the will of the people.

55
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,050
Shifting the disaster eastward…

56
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,450
It seems you already know.

57
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,970
There’s still time to stop.

58
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,870
If we take a different approach,

59
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,630
we can still protect our people

60
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,000
and guard Lin State.

61
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,160
Maybe you’re right.

62
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,700
[Princess's Mansion]

63
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,400
The lands of Sushui and Lin State share the same origin.

64
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,830
Like stems and beans from the same root.

65
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,750
Feilian Troop.

66
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,390
General Xiao Zisu of Feilian Troop proposes marriage to a Ji woman,

67
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,310
forming a union of good fortune

68
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,440
and happiness.

[Announcement]

70
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,790
Tied with a red string,

71
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,310
may we grow old together.

72
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,500
Our wedding is set for five days later.

73
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,200
The general of Feilian Troop is marrying a Ji woman?

74
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,950
They’re getting married in five days.

75
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,490
The general is marrying a Ji woman?

76
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,610
Isn’t this absurd?

77
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,200
Feilian Troop members are not allowed to marry.

78
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,400
Nonsense! For so many years,

79
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,190
the soldiers of Feilian Troop have fought life and death for us, the people,

80
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,950
for Lin State.

81
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,280
How can you restrict them with such rules?

82
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,050
It’s against natural law!

83
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,010
You there,

84
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,390
why are you always speaking up for the Ji people?

85
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,110
Aren’t you afraid of the Ji demons?

86
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,910
You keep calling them demons.

87
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
But have you ever actually seen one?

88
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,790
I’ve seen the Ji people.

89
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,230
And they don't look like demons at all.

90
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,140
They’re not.

91
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,540
Violence only begets more violence.

92
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,890
The people will suffer.

93
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,760
I support the General.

94
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,310
If fate led me to a Ji woman,

95
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,260
I would marry her too.

96
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,060
The Ji people saved my life.

97
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,390
They’re not scary.

98
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,610
You’ve just made them sound too frightening.

99
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,540
-Yes.
-They’re not scary.

100
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,220
What?

101
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,630
Xiao Zisu was dying, wasn't he?

102
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,170
How did he recover so quickly?

103
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,409
Yeah, that Xiaoman is a Ji person.

104
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,790
I heard he was cured with a Bixi.

105
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,190
It's only been a few days.

106
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,690
Bixi?

107
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,760
Is it really that powerful?

108
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,730
If so, then with it,

109
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,200
my eyes should have healed long ago.

110
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,250
Yes.

111
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,030
With it,

112
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,450
our Liang State's position as the top among the five states

113
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,170
can be further solidified.

114
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,850
No wonder Xiao Xianchen has been procrastinating and delaying the wedding.

115
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,740
It must be a scheme by the two brothers.

116
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,890
They don't want to give me the Bixi

117
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,560
and want to collude with the Ji people.

118
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,250
Choujia.

119
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,010
Here.

120
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:42,110
Send a letter to my father immediately.

121
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,960
Expose their treasonous acts.

122
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,950
This time,

123
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,470
none of the Xiao family will have it easy.

124
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,170
Yes.

125
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,730
What are you looking for?

126
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,340
Where did you hide the Xiantang tree?

127
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,470
I searched the entire courtyard and couldn't find it.

128
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,660
It's winter and cold, so I hid it in a warm place.

129
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,690
You need to check the wound every day

130
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,580
until it heals completely.

131
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,110
Only check the wrist?

132
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,100
Yes.

133
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,230
If you're not at ease,

134
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,530
maybe check the rest of my body...

135
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,130
Are you really taking it off?

136
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,750
I...

137
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,770
Did I hit too hard just now?

138
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,520
Are you okay?

139
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,280
What should I do?

140
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,670
Sit down and have a rest.

141
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
It's nothing. I’m just pretending.

142
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,890
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

143
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,170
Wait.

144
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,450
I'll take you to a place.

145
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,190
Let's go.

146
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,460
Haven't we been here before?

147
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,620
In our Lin State,

148
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,830
couples have to come here to pray before the wedding

149
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,030
and hang a blessing plaque.

150
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,070
Your Lin State has so many rules.

151
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,740
But I quite like it.

152
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,210
It's good that you like it.

153
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,670
She is a Ji person.

154
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,250
Run quickly.

155
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:12,740
Hurry.

156
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,400
Come.

157
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,150
Dear villagers,

158
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,270
please come over.

159
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,070
I am Xiao Zisu.

160
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,380
I want to marry this Ji woman, Nian, by my side.

161
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,520
Everyone is welcome to attend the wedding.

162
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,420
But she is a Ji demon.

163
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,590
Let's go.

164
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,800
You and my elder sister haven't married yet.

165
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,730
But your younger brother is getting married first.

166
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,770
They are in love with each other,

167
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,320
so they want to keep things simple and quick.

168
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,670
As for your matters,

169
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,970
how long do you intend to delay?

170
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,400
My Lord.

171
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,890
I want to cancel the marriage.

172
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,890
Cui Caiyi, are you crazy?

173
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,800
Why do you want to cancel the marriage?

174
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,560
I’ve heard that you have always missed your late wife,

175
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,970
showing you are a person of deep feelings and righteousness.

176
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,510
Now that you are in a high position

177
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,590
of power,

178
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,710
your partner should be a soulmate who shares your heart,

179
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,240
not just a tool for a marriage of convenience.

180
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,950
People like us

181
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,490
are indeed tools.

182
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,310
In life,

183
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,790
regardless of status,

184
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,670
who doesn’t wish to marry their beloved?

185
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,380
I believe you feel the same in your heart.

186
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,350
Alright, I agree with you.

187
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,140
No.

188
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,170
A husband is a guide of propriety.

189
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,190
According to our Liang State laws,

190
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,160
a woman who cancels a marriage must be punished with twenty lashes.

191
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,470
If you can endure it,

192
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,710
then go ahead.

193
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,570
Your Highness.

194
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,870
She is after all your legitimate elder sister.

195
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,900
Why force her?

196
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,380
But how can we let a woman disrupt propriety?

197
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,760
Alright.

198
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,820
I accept the punishment.

199
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,430
Cui Caiyi, you...

200
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,020
Elder sister,

201
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,410
I advise you not to be stubborn.

202
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,130
After twenty lashes,

203
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,020
your life might be at risk.

204
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,990
It may still be possible to change your mind now.

205
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,700
I have made up my mind.

206
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,530
Proceed with the punishment.

207
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:13,930
Someone.

208
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,560
Yes.

209
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,640
Carry out the punishment.

210
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,170
Stop!

211
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,010
The princess is of noble status.

212
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,220
She represents Liang State’s dignity.

213
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,790
How can she be humiliated here?

214
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,560
What are you making a fuss about?

215
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,890
Who do you think you are?

216
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,100
I am a guard of the princess in Liang State.

217
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,560
I have come to Lin State

218
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,500
with a mission to protect the princess.

219
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,230
It is only right to endure the punishment on behalf of the princess.

220
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,160
Chang Yuan, this is none of your business. Leave.

221
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,870
I almost forgot.

222
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,600
You are that little guard.

223
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,600
Your Highness. He is right.

224
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,800
After all, the princess is your sister.

225
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,750
If Liang State is seen whipping the eldest princess in Lin State,

226
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,680
it will be troublesome if this news

227
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,420
spreads back to Liang State.

228
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,410
Alright, alright.

229
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,580
If you want to act the hero today,

230
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,350
then it will be fifty lashes.

231
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,190
Cui Ya,

232
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,990
don't go too far.

233
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,430
Do you want the Lord and Lin State's people to know

234
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,160
that this little guard

235
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,360
is your lover?
