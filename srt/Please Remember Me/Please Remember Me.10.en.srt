1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,020
[Please Remember Me Episode 10]

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,680
The General is here.

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,600
Greetings, Your Lordship.

4
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,480
Greetings, Your Lordship.

5
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,410
It's you.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,680
No wonder Zisu has hidden you away in the house.

7
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,290
Your Lordship, don't make fun of her.

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,020
Xiaoman is easily frightened.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,190
Look.

10
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,240
You're already defending her.

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,070
This is the eldest princess of the Liang State,

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,680
Crown Prince Cui's sister.

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:45,510
This is

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,150
my brother Zisu.

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,080
On the day of the inspection, we met briefly.

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,780
We've officially met today.

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,030
Your Highness.

18
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,310
General and Xiaoman, please rise.

19
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,450
Take a seat.

20
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,830
This smell is...

21
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,270
Firethorn.

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,030
Xiaoman.

23
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,250
Where are you from?

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,820
She and Dashu are from the same hometown.

25
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,350
But she seems quite familiar to me.

26
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,000
It feels like we've known each other for a long time.

27
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,990
My Lord, what incense are you burning?

28
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,300
It's a bit pungent.

29
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:14,820
Guards.

30
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:15,630
Take this incense...

31
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,270
Wait.

32
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,630
I prepared this for the princess.

33
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,310
Since the princess married into Lin State,

34
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,840
to ease your homesickness,

35
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,450
I've specially ordered people to prepare spices with Firethorn.

36
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,790
Firethorn is only harmful to the Ji people.

37
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,420
It is not harmful to us.

38
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,030
I would have to disappoint you, My Lord.

39
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,760
Although I'm from Liang State,

40
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:40,079
since childhood, I haven't been able to smell Firethorn,

41
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,740
which causes throat disease.

42
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,630
It's my fault.

43
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,380
I'll go down and tidy up.

44
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,790
Xiaoman.

45
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,870
Can you help me?

46
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,220
Sure.

47
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,890
Xiaoman is my guest.

48
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,230
Let me go with you.

49
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,450
Brother.

50
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,670
Let the girls handle it.

51
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,070
Let's just drink.

52
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,660
I was reckless.

53
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,600
Yes.

54
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,430
It's rare that my brother is in the mood today.

55
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,830
As your older brother, I must have a few more drinks with you.

56
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,400
Here.

57
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,420
Brother,

58
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,480
It's a rare occasion that we are having fun today.

59
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,650
Let's have a few more drinks.

60
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,380
Okay.

61
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,970
This way, Xiaoman.

62
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,570
Let's sit here for a while.

63
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,750
We'll go back after the smoke clears.

64
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,550
Okay.

65
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,500
Princess, thank you for your help.

66
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,360
Just call me Caiyi.

67
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,350
How could I possibly address Your Grace by your name?

68
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,820
Someone called me by my name before.

69
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,880
It doesn't matter.

70
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,910
Someone...

71
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,110
Who?

72
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,850
An old friend.

73
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,130
The wedding is coming.

74
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,970
Why do you look unhappy?

75
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,700
Marrying someone you like makes you happy.

76
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,720
I'm just a tool for exchanging interests.

77
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,680
There's nothing to be happy about.

78
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,670
You are a princess.

79
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,980
If you don't like it, just say no.

80
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,930
Then go far away

81
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,690
with someone you like.

82
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,110
A person like me

83
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,230
is destined from birth to be an accessory to power.

84
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,600
It's not up to me.

85
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,159
When I was young,

86
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,659
my father bought a few lions from the foreign countries

87
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,470
to entertain my younger brother.

88
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,780
The male lions lay in the sun every day,

89
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,550
while the females had to hunt and take care of the cubs.

90
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,430
Day after day,

91
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,140
year after year.

92
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,800
The male lions still enjoyed the crown that their manes gave them.

93
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,040
Beasts are like this,

94
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,920
and so is life.

95
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,590
There was a time when I accepted my fate,

96
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,150
but then I met someone.

97
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,580
He gave me the courage to run away.

98
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,790
Do you know what makes me give up completely?

99
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,450
Losing?

100
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,470
No.

101
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,310
Damp squib.

102
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,230
The situation you are in

103
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,630
is like a dilemma.

104
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,790
Why don't you walk away

105
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,870
ruthlessly?

106
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,950
It is not worth it

107
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,380
for someone so uncertain.

108
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,870
You worry too much, Princess.

109
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,470
I have no improper thoughts about the General.

110
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,050
The world is shallow and the people are evil.

111
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,750
Love is complicated.

112
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,159
A single move can lead to disaster.

113
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,510
Xiaoman, you are in this situation,

114
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,880
don't fall too deep.

115
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,940
Let's go.

116
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,050
Here, Zisu.

117
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,440
Your Lordship.

118
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,630
I've finished one pot.

119
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,520
I can't drink anymore.

120
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,670
You are the hero of Lin State.

121
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,270
How can you only handle such a small amount of alcohol?

122
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,800
Hero...

123
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,660
I can't afford

124
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,770
the title of hero.

125
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,740
You can.

126
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,950
Xiaoman.

127
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,560
You don't know, do you?

128
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,390
In the battle of Sushui,

129
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,940
Zisu was invincible.

130
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,080
He destroyed Ji demon's lair

131
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,270
and relieved the people

132
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,640
of their long-standing worries

133
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,350
from the Ji demon.

134
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,420
When he returned triumphantly,

135
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,880
everyone in Lin State was out to welcome him.

136
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,680
Xiaoman.

137
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,230
They're having a good time.

138
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:45,790
Here.

139
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,980
Let's have a drink.

140
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,430
Your Lordship.

141
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,070
Why?

142
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,150
Every time you tell these stories,

143
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,590
I feel like I'm listening to someone else's stories.

144
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,510
Why can't I

145
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,190
remember anything?

146
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,710
If...

147
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,050
If there really were Ji people,

148
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,390
I would really like to ask

149
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,150
whether what you're saying is the truth.

150
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,110
Y-Y-You...

151
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,620
Why are you talking nonsense?

152
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,910
If we really found one,

153
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,600
wouldn't the young lady be scared off

154
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,460
by their terrifying appearance?

155
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:19,950
Am I right?

156
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,350
Xiaoman.

157
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,740
Terrifying appearance...

158
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,230
Your Lordship speaks as if you've seen them.

159
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,909
Xiaoman, you don't seem happy.

160
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,420
Xiaoman.

161
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,080
It is just a conversation between men,

162
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,170
don't mind them.

163
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,750
Here, a toast to you.

164
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,000
Xiaoman.

165
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,170
You can't drink anymore.

166
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,610
Xiaoman, stop drinking.

167
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,270
Brother.

168
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,910
Xiaoman.

169
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,120
You...

170
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,220
You can't drink anymore.

171
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,440
You haven't recovered from the cold yet.

172
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:26,920
Let's go.

173
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,810
Let's go home.

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,880
Your Lordship.

175
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,770
Soldiers can't drink.

176
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,400
I made an exception today.

177
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,030
After I sober up,

178
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll accept any penalty.

179
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:38,490
Goodbye.

180
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:40,340
Goodbye.

181
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,549
Are you leaving now?

182
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,970
It's still early.

183
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,520
Let's go.

184
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,780
Have a few more drinks with me.

185
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,660
Your Lordship.

186
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,560
There's still a long way to go.

187
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,270
Let Zisu and Xiaoman go back.

188
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,210
You can have a few more drinks with me.

189
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:52,890
Okay.

190
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,620
Princess,

191
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,950
are you getting used to living in Lin State?

192
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,750
Very good.

193
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,110
Xiao Zisu, stop!

194
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:05,960
Stop!

195
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,330
Leave me alone.

196
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,070
I want to sleep.

197
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,940
Come here.

198
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,620
I have something to tell you.

199
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,080
I have nothing to say to you.

200
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,530
You're being arrogant, aren't you?

201
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,320
I am.

202
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,040
Come here.

203
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,590
I'll go too.

204
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,040
Where are you going?

205
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,570
What?

206
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,510
The General is drunk.

207
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,260
Yes.

208
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,710
The General is drunk.

209
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,910
Isn't Xiaoman there?

210
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,060
Xiaoman is drunk too?

211
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,400
Yes.

212
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,720
That's why I have to go in...

213
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,010
Let these two drunkard deal with it.

214
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,640
You're ruining the mood.

215
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,470
Ruining the mood?

216
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,190
What can I do to ruin the mood?

217
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,350
Keep your voice down.

218
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,150
What are you doing?

219
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,410
You don't understand.

220
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,020
Your brother said that I am the Ji demon with a terrifying appearance.

221
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,870
Do I look like a demon with a terrifying appearance?

222
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,920
My brother is talking about the Ji people.

223
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,010
Ji people.

224
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,610
Your brother also said

225
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,850
you are invincible outside.

226
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,210
Everyone welcomed you.

227
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,760
You are really really really amazing.

228
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,880
Let me tell you.

229
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,610
I'm not drunk.

230
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,430
Help me get this table over here.

231
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,580
Do it yourself.

232
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,290
I've always wanted to ask you.

233
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,830
When you were fighting Sushui

234
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,140
and saw those terrifying Ji demons,

235
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,490
were you scared?

236
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,080
Were you afraid that they would eat you

237
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,720
or enter your dream

238
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,990
to kill you?

239
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,270
I didn't.

240
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,150
It's not me.

241
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,040
Think about it.

242
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,910
No matter how despicable the Ji people are,

243
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,630
I will only kill their leader.

244
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,450
Why would I kill so many innocent people?

245
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,940
I didn't do it.

246
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,840
I don't even remember who

247
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,150
the leader of the Ji people is.

248
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,880
I'm the leader of the Ji people.

249
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,050
Come on!

250
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,360
Kill me if you dare.

251
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,310
Kill me!

252
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,590
So,

253
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,910
you stayed with me for so long

254
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,310
just to kill me.

255
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,790
Is that so?

256
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,000
Avenge them, right?

257
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,270
Fine.

258
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,550
Since you think I did it,

259
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,930
do it.

260
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,120
Fine.

261
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,750
I'll kill you now.

262
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,200
Do you know that there are many people in this world

263
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,440
who have no family or friends

264
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,900
because they have all died?

265
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,120
They have nowhere to go.

266
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,810
They can only wander outside.

267
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,420
They don't even know

268
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,420
what they did wrong.

269
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,390
I know.

270
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,560
I know.

271
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,080
I can't kill you now.

272
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,480
I'll deal with you once I find Bixi.

273
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,490
Tell me where Bixi is.

274
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,710
In that case,

275
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,170
can you help me too?

276
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,020
Help me regain my lost memories with dream divination technique.

277
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,280
I can die.

278
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,810
I, Xiao Zisu, am not afraid of death.

279
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,820
But I have to die knowing the reason.

280
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,380
I have to die with a clear conscience

281
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,580
and without regrets.

282
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,430
There are many people and things

283
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,990
that I still can't remember.

284
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,590
I don't want to die like this.

285
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,030
Help me.

286
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,470
Please.

287
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:43,940
Lie down

288
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,260
This night,

289
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,350
nothing serious happened.

290
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,520
Someone slept soundly,

291
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,220
while others stayed awake all night.

292
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,470
Xiaoman and Zisu, after drinking, spoke the truth,

293
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,640
alleviating half of the heavy burden they had been carrying.

294
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,110
[Liang State Residence]

295
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,170
Princess Caiyi looks at the night sky,

296
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,090
thinking of herself and Xiaoman

297
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,250
that they have tacit understanding without saying a word.

298
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:26,220
With Chang Yuan, even a thousand words can't express the confusion.

299
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,010
In Xianchen's mansion,

300
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,090
there once had a new life.

301
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,950
But now, even the courage to reminisce

302
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:42,950
can only be quietly released in the stillness of the night.

303
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,220
After this night,

304
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,620
some are sad,

305
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,670
while some

306
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,800
slowly softened.

307
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,240
This scar is...

308
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,230
Grandma.

309
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,230
When I was young,

310
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,860
the High Priest said that

311
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,590
the person with a Bixi totem on their chest

312
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,730
would lead our people away from Sushui.

313
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,700
A Bixi totem...

314
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:40,720
What are you doing?
