00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,020
[Please Remember Me
Episode 22]

2
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,730
No matter how vile the Ji people are,

3
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,650
I would only kill their leader.

4
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,610
Why would I kill so many innocent people?

5
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,030
It wasn't me.

6
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,750
I don't remember.

7
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,050
It was him.

8
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,070
Xiao Xianchen.

9
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,300
Xiao Zisu.

10
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,550
Why did you do this to me?

11
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,560
Why?

12
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,789
Why did you do this to my family?

13
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,800
Didn’t you say you were coming to marry me today?

14
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,070
Why did you wear the Qilin Armor?

15
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,039
How could you do this to me?

16
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,259
How could you do this to our people?

17
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,200
Jiuye and the others are so young.

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,390
How could you...

19
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,590
How could you do this?

20
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,170
Do you know what day it is today?

21
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,000
Grain Full.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,690
Grain Full.

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,210
Qi.

24
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,280
Qi.

25
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,169
Qi.

26
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,830
Qi.

27
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,000
Qi.

28
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:16,850
Qi.

29
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:21,990
Qi!

30
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,730
I don't want to forget you.

31
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,530
Qi.

32
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,320
You haven't told me why.

33
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,050
Qi.

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,300
Qi.

35
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,640
Qi.

36
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,230
Qi.

37
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,660
Qi!

38
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,560
Qi.

39
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,020
Who is Qi?

40
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,290
Nian.

41
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,340
What are you doing here?

42
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,420
You haven't recovered yet.

43
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,550
Go back and rest.

44
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,610
Qi Gui.

45
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,530
What day is today?

46
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,710
A few days ago, it was Grain Full.

47
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,470
Grain Full?

48
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,770
Grain Full?

49
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,270
Did I forget something important?

50
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,940
Why am I dressed like this?

51
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,370
Who is Qi?

52
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,990
Xiao Xianchen did all this.

53
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,110
Not Xiao Zisu.

54
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,690
I knew it.

55
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,490
I must go back.

56
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,630
They are brothers.

57
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,000
You can't believe him.

58
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,530
Grandma said

59
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,220
Xiao Zisu can take all of us away.

60
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,159
I trust him.

61
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,630
I don't trust Xiao Zisu.

62
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,920
But I trust you.

63
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,730
Xiaoman.

64
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,960
Xiaoman.

65
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,150
Xiaoman.

66
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,090
No one is allowed to enter the General's Mansion without permission.

67
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:48,650
Dashu.

68
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,700
I don't know you.

69
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,060
Don’t try to be too close with me. Go away.

70
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,790
Nian, something's wrong here.

71
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:56,850
Don't go in.

72
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,310
I must see him, Chang Yuan.

73
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,520
You go first. If anything happens to me, you can look out for me.

74
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,000
Nian.

75
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,580
Calm down.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,400
Give me the medicine bag.

77
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,720
Give it to me.

78
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:15,840
Be careful.

79
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,600
Be careful!

80
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:17,850
Come back!

81
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,180
[Awe-inspiring Righteousness]

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,080
How dare you come back?

83
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,470
How is General?

84
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,940
He hasn't woken up.

85
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,850
I want to see him.

86
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,390
Hand over the Bixi first.

87
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,930
Do you want the Bixi

88
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,730
or your brother to be back to life?

89
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,700
Can you save him?

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,610
Yes.

91
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,900
But I have conditions.

92
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,830
I can't kill him yet.

93
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,370
Once he dies, since Zisu is still in coma,

94
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,700
Lin State will be in chaos without a ruler.

95
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,830
The Ji people hiding in the city will also be implicated.

96
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,500
What are your conditions?

97
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,380
First,

98
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,950
explain the rumors about the erythema of the Ji people.

99
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,830
Second, allow the Ji people to live on the land of Lin State,

100
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,400
ensuring they are not disturbed by the other five states.

101
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:07,940
Third,

102
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,810
I want you to pay with your life for the innocent souls of Sushui.

103
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,190
You know everything?

104
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,160
If I die,

105
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,930
how will I know

106
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,770
if you have saved Zisu?

107
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,510
Take this poison.

108
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,520
You will die within fifteen days.

109
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,030
If I save Zisu within fifteen days,

110
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,650
you complete your task.

111
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,590
If I fail within fifteen days,

112
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,340
I will give you the antidote.

113
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,250
We’ll settle old scores then.

114
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,290
Aren't you afraid

115
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,800
that I won't give you the antidote?

116
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,130
Compared to my life,

117
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,640
what you care more

118
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,150
is the lives of Zisu and your people,

119
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,590
isn't it?

120
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,230
Fine.

121
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,990
I'm a person of my word.

122
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,170
I hope you are too.

123
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,490
Now, please take your men

124
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,180
and leave the General's Mansion.

125
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,810
Wait.

126
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,170
You can't go in.

127
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,340
Xiaoshu, Xiaoman is here to save the General. Get out of the way.

128
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,010
Save the General? With their evil Ji sorcery?

129
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,330
How could the Ji people possibly save the people of Feilian Troop?

130
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,900
Considering our former friendship,

131
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,230
I allow you to leave now.

132
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,550
As long as I'm here,

133
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,340
no one can hurt the General.

134
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,980
Since he doesn't appreciate us,

135
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,200
let Xiao Zisu die.

136
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,880
How dare you curse General?

137
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,409
Xiaoshu.

138
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,409
What are you doing here?

139
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:58,940
Brother.

140
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,050
General is dying.

141
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,070
Why are you still holding onto Xiaoman's identity?

142
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,270
Is this your first day knowing Xiaoman?

143
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,410
She wants to save the General more than anyone else.

144
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,180
There was an ambush in the mansion.

145
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,830
She still broke in.

146
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,820
How could she harm the General?

147
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,560
Get out of the way.

148
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,250
Xiaoshu.

149
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,960
-Get out of the way.
-Aunt Qiu.

150
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,050
Xiaoman.

151
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,470
Go and see the General.

152
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,659
Chang Yuan.

153
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,430
He only has external injuries.

154
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,240
How can he not wake up?

155
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,390
This is mental trauma

156
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,210
and spiritual disturbance.

157
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,100
To put it bluntly, he’s a living dead with his soul out of his body.

158
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,260
Can she handle it?

159
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,170
Wait.

160
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,270
The General had more severe injuries before

161
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,740
and didn’t react like this.

162
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,620
Could it be...

163
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,870
What's wrong with you?

164
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,490
I know.

165
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,380
Using Bixi can save him.

166
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,220
To use Bixi’s energy, you need to rely on your own vitality.

167
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,570
You’re exchanging your life for his.

168
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,500
Do you know that?

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,330
Even if that's the case, I have to save him.

170
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,500
Consider it as I'm repaying his favor.

171
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,100
Your Highness, that Xiaoman is back too.

172
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,560
Be gentle.

173
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,450
What?

174
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,310
Xiao Zisu is still alive?

175
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,270
He even brought that wretch back?

176
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,050
Didn't I hurt my eyes for nothing?

177
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,160
Get out!

178
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,420
Get lost!

179
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,620
You idiots!

180
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,180
Useless!

181
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,850
-Cui Ya, are you done making a fuss?
-You idiots!

182
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:45,720
If you make any more fuss,

183
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,780
I’ll send you back to the Liang State.

184
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,880
Sending me back to the Liang State？

185
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,020
Then I’ll bring soldiers

186
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,670
and flatten the Lin State.

187
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,190
Who is it? Who else is coming in?

188
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,590
Choujia.

189
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,210
Yes.

190
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,910
Beat them out!

191
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,720
Yes.

192
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,670
