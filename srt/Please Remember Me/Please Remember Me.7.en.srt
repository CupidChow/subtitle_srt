[Please Remember Me
Episode 7]

2
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:16,930
General!

3
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,110
Why are you here?

4
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,830
Didn't I ask you to go back?

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,490
I took a shortcut and got here.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,100
Looks like I will have to beat Xiaoshu.

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,080
It's difficult to travel in the dark.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,470
I'm here to pick you up to go home together.

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,280
No need.

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,190
General, you have dust on your face.

11
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:42,960
You're injured?

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,220
I ran too fast

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,580
and accidentally fell.

14
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,830
You're so clumsy. Go back now.

15
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,660
If you drive me away,

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,610
I can only kneel with you.

17
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,540
Put it on.

18
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,030
It's snowing.

19
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,320
It has never snowed in Sushui.

20
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,110
[River God Temple]

21
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,229
This is the first time

22
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,110
that I see snow so clearly.

23
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,860
Lin State is in the north.

24
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,410
I've seen snow many times.

25
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,440
This is the first time that I feel snow's temperature.

26
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,100
Xiao Zisu,

27
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,530
are you really... the murderer?

28
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,690
River God,

29
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,590
what exactly... have I forgotten?

30
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,440
Let's go home.

31
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,090
Xiaoman!

32
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,070
Xiaoman!

33
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,480
Dead?

34
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,600
Who did it?

35
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,870
A guy said it was a female ghost before he died.

36
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,110
Except that...

37
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,320
we got nothing else.

38
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,680
A female ghost?

39
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,150
Could it be a Ji demon?

40
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,530
That means there are Ji people in Lin State.

41
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,980
That's the Feilian Troop's negligence.

42
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,330
Dashu,

43
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,240
add some hot water!

44
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,550
Yes!

45
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,110
Aunt Qiu!

46
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:02,850
Add some charcoal!

47
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,120
Yes!

48
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,330
What happened?

49
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,170
What's wrong with Xiaoman?

50
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,510
Charcoal!

51
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,640
Charcoal is here!

52
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,780
Hot water is here, General.

53
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,740
Give it to me.

54
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,740
General, please.

55
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,310
General,

56
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,480
Xiaoshu said the assassins who died on the way

57
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,870
were sent by the crown prince.

58
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,070
Their target was you.

59
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,630
They've been killed.

60
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
Where is Xiaoshu?

61
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,370
He went to investigate again.

62
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,930
No need to investigate.

63
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,680
Yes.

64
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,440
I know it was you.

65
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,220
Since you are one of the Ji people, you should hate me.

66
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,340
But why did you risk your life to save me?

67
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,190
Xiaoman!

68
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,530
Cold.

69
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,430
Xiaoman.

70
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,510
How are you feeling?

71
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,060
Cold.

72
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,210
Cold?

73
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:38,930
Here.

74
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:40,750
Warm your body.

75
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,510
Are you feeling better?

76
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,020
Cold.

77
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,430
Where?

78
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,190
Feet?

79
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,020
Are your feet cold?

80
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:51,730
Your feet.

81
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,250
Are you feeling better?

82
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,820
Feeling better?

83
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,300
You're awake.

84
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:02,590
What...

85
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,080
What are you doing?

86
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,980
I...

87
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,660
What were you doing?

88
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,800
I...

89
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,800
I was warming your feet.

90
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,250
You said you felt cold last night.

91
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,910
What on earth were you doing?

92
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,740
I really was just warming your feet.

93
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,700
Get out!

94
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,240
Get out! Get out!

95
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,510
Okay.

96
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,110
I'll go out now.

97
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,650
Hurry!

98
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,370
I'll go out.

99
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,430
Thank you for last night.

100
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,560
What a pity.

101
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,560
The day before yesterday,

102
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,290
when General carried you back,

103
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,660
he forgot his manners.

104
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,330
That was the first time I saw him cry out of worry.

105
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,520
Look at you.

106
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,950
He was already in that emotional state,

107
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,350
but you kicked him out.

108
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,870
Oh.

109
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,799
General hasn't come back for two days.

110
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,620
Is he mad at me?

111
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,730
What do you think?

112
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,900
He is a petty man.

113
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,630
He hasn't interacted with many women either.

114
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,630
Well, I...

115
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,690
It's okay.

116
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,560
After he comes back,

117
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,840
I'll talk to him.

118
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,030
Thank you, Dashu.

119
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,120
No big deal.

120
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,030
The climate is dry.

121
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,150
Be careful with fire safety.

122
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,310
A total of 13 people went missing these days.

123
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,730
The crown prince told me

124
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,050
his men

125
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,230
were attacked by Ji people outside the city.

126
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,730
His words can't be trusted.

127
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:45,980
I know.

128
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,590
But this disappearance case

129
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,570
is too weird.

130
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,230
I think there are Ji people in the city.

131
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,260
I'll investigate thoroughly.

132
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,190
No need for that.

133
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,190
Wuchui.

134
00:09:58,950 --> 00:09:59,510
Yes.

135
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,530
Pass my order. Close the city gate.

136
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,790
Burn Firethorn in every house.

137
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,410
Close all the clinics.

138
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,680
Search every house one by one.

139
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,850
Arrest everyone with erythema

140
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,400
or suffering from

141
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,890
muscle pain.

142
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,320
Yes!

143
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,770
What is he burning?

144
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,640
I heard it's Firethorn.

145
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,260
It's for catching Ji people.

146
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,990
There are Ji people in the city?

147
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,380
Who knows? I'm not one of them anyway.

148
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,200
Hya!

149
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,490
Candied haws!

150
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,820
Go home now.

151
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,210
Hya!

152
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,050
Hya!

153
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,310
Stop!

154
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,210
Stop burning it.

155
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,650
Stop burning it.

156
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,500
Stop burning it!

157
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,610
Stop burning it, Xiaoshu!

158
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,120
Stop now!

159
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:02,730
Stop burning it!

160
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,660
Everyone, stop!

161
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,840
What? Stop burning it?

162
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,540
Stop burning it, Xiaoshu! Stop!

163
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,450
Okay.

164
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,770
This needle can suppress erythema,

165
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,130
but it'll hurt a lot.

166
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,900
You'll die if you use it for a long time.

167
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,830
Be careful.

168
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,610
Whatever.

169
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,780
Survive this crisis first.

170
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,930
What are you doing, General?

171
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,460
Shut up and cover yourself.

172
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,390
If he knows I'm one of the Ji people,

173
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,110
why did he save me again and again?

174
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,680
If he doesn't know,

175
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,300
why did he allow me to stay here?
