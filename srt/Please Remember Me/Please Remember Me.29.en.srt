[Please Remember Me: Episode 29]

2
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,940
Miss Xiaoman.

3
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,810
This is...

4
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,490
the procedure of the wedding.

5
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,550
Please take a look.

6
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,210
Miss Xiaoman.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,890
These are the hair accessories for the ceremony.

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,150
Just make a selection.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,600
Aunt Qiu, Dashu.

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,170
I'll just listen to your advice on these matters.

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,330
Let's do it according to the rules of the Lin State.

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,460
By the way, Aunt Qiu,

13
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,050
before a girl gets married in the Lin State,

14
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,780
are there any other rules which she needs to obey?

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,060
These are almost all the rules to be obeyed.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,680
By the way,

17
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,860
there is another rule. The couple can't meet during the two days before the wedding

18
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,900
lest the two happy events counteract each other on that day, which is ominous.

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,890
It's ominous?

20
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,750
Then I have to obey this rule.

21
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,000
How could you also mention this kind of custom?

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,510
I said it without thinking carefully beforehand.

23
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,630
Besides, you always make up some customs

24
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,130
to tease her too, don't you?

25
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:34,680
I...

26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,020
It's fine, General.

27
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:38,490
I've asked Xiaoshu to protect Xiaoman.

28
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,460
After all, that old house also belongs to our General's Mansion.

29
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,460
That's right.

30
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,180
Thank you.

31
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,039
You're welcome, General.

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,020
The general even thanked me.

33
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,430
Thank... Thanks! I want to thank you, too!

34
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,390
You're welcome.

35
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,910
Xiaoman.

36
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,550
These several objects are all newly made for you today.

37
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,080
Besides,

38
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,530
these Poria Cakes are for you from Aunt Qiu.

39
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,110
In addition...

40
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,030
my elder brother made these roasted persimmons for you today.

41
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,830
He knows that you like eating roasted persimmons.

42
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,150
It looks like both Dashu and Aunt Qiu are afraid that I'll be starving.

43
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,950
Of course.

44
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,700
These are all your favourites.

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,620
And these ones, too.

46
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,340
I bought these candies for you.

47
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,630
Thank you, Xiaoshu.

48
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,840
Xiaoshu, can you do me one last favor?

49
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,360
[Awe-inspiring Righteousness]

50
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,070
Your Highness.

51
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,820
I'm afraid it's inappropriate for you to wear a wedding dress

52
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,950
to see this man from the Ji Clan, right?

53
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,270
The Crown Princes forced me to get Bixi.

54
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,090
I had no choice but to use this unwise tactic.

55
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,590
If I can't get Bixi,

56
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,880
both you and I know how the Crown Prince will punish us.

57
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,230
After all, I'm the Crown Prince's elder sister.

58
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,030
But you...

59
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,390
Yes, yes, yes.

60
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,360
You're right.

61
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,409
Let's do as you say.

62
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,130
Then you'd better shut up.

63
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,940
Caiyi.

64
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,760
Chang Yuan!

65
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,720

66
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:55,990
Chang Yuan!

67
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,670
Chang Yuan!

68
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,560
How did you get so badly injured from being beaten up by them?

69
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:05,990
I'm fine.

70
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,230
Caiyi, why are you here?

71
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,380
I'm here to give you one last chance.

72
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,160
What do you mean?

73
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,760
The Crown Prince gave you two options.

74
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,510
The first option is to find a way to give Bixi to him,

75
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,250
and by drinking this cup of Wedding Wine,

76
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,760
you'll become the husband of the princess of our Liang State.

77
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,410
If you don't give Bixi to him,

78
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,790
he'll keep torturing you

79
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,020
and make your life miserable.

80
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,840
Just make a choice.

81
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,440
Previously, I let you down

82
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,850
again and again.

83
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,980
I even used your money

84
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,950
to buy gifts for you.

85
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,070
I wanted to take you away,

86
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,680
but I left without saying goodbye.

87
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,860
Even when I saw you again,

88
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,960
I was also still trying to hide myself.

89
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,520
Now that you're risking your life,

90
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,400
how can I not drink it?

91
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,130
I've told you it's Wedding Wine.

92
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,480
What do you want to do?

93
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,190
There are soldiers of our Liang State outside.

94
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,790
You won't be able to run away!

95
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,780
Caiyi.

96
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,100
I'm very greedy.

97
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,000
I want to marry you,

98
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,110
but I also can't betray Sushui.

99
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,420
Now only by killing myself

100
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,140
can I stop Cui Ya from giving you a hard time.

101
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,250
Well...

102
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,530
What's going on?

103
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,230
This wine...

104
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,110
This wine contains the poison you gave me.

105
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,240
This is the Death Feigning Drug.

106
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,440
If you change your mind and don't want to get married,

107
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,700
it can help you escape.

108
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,460
If you're dead,

109
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,190
Cui Ya won't torture you anymore.

110
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,440
Poisonous wine?

111
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:40,990
He...

112
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,330
He's dead?

113
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,190
That's right.

114
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,040
I killed him.

115
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,960
You'd better stay away from that corpse.

116
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,560
I think you know that Ji people's erythema is infectious, right?

117
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,909
It was you who killed this man.

118
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,580
It has nothing to do with me.

119
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,320
I'll go back and report it to His Highness now.

120
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,040
It was you who killed him.

121
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,570
It has nothing to do with me!

122
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,010
Guards!

123
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,260
Deal with that Ji man's corpse.

124
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,440
Don't let his erythema infect others.

125

Chang Yuan.

126
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,890
We can finally leave together.

127
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:40,799
