00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,950
[Please Remember Me Episode 18]

2
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,810
This butterfly...

3
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,410
This...

4
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,910
This is the Side House.

5
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,110
Su.

6
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,550
Su.

7
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,780
Mother.

8
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,579
Su!

9
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,480
Su.

10
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,820
This little mouse is a gift for Brother Chen.

11
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,850
Can you give it to him?

12
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,100
Great.

13
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,450
Brother Chen said that

14
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,990
Mother has never made him one before.

15
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,860
He will be very happy when he sees it.

16
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,780
Okay.

17
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,870
Here.

18
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,800
Mother.

19
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,690
No!

20
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,079
Xiao Zisu.

21
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,390
Don't move.

22
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,450
I'll go get Brother Chen.

23
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,450
Stop.

24
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,800
Slow down.

25
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,450
Come back!

26
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,660
Come back, idiot!

27
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,140
If you leave, she will die.

28
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,590
Mother.

29
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,410
It's me.

30
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,620
Your son.

31
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,750
Look at me.

32
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,280
Mother!

33
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,510
Mother!

34
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,110
Mother!

35
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,340
Mother!

36
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,530
No!

37
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,960
Mother!

38
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,450
Mother!

39
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,280
No!

40
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,250
Mother, come down.

41
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,870
Come down!

42
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,410
Mother.

43
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,839
Please come down.

44
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,800
Please.

45
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,790
Your son is back.

46
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,030
Your son is back.

47
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,200
Mother.

48
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,250
Mother.

49
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,630
Qi.

50
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,570
Qi.

51
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,630
Qi!

52
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,860
Oh no, he upset the Water Fireflies.

53
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,659
Without the Bixi, he will be stuck in the illusion.

54
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,030
The Water Fireflies will eat him.

55
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,820
Qi.

56
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,120
No matter what, I have to save him first.

57
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,930
Qi.

58
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:53,950
Qi.

59
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,590
Zisu.

60
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,370
Zisu.

61
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,950
Mother.

62
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:12,900
Mother.

63
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,490
It's really you.

64
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,210
What's wrong with my Zisu?

65
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,830
You've all grown up,

66
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,570
but why are you still crying?

67
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,370
Mother.

68
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,190
I miss you so much.

69
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,390
I miss you so much.

70
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,090
Mother is always here.

71
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,040
I'm always here.

72
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,590
What's wrong with you today?

73
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,159
Mother.

74
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,550
This is my first time seeing you

75
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,090
with gray hair.

76
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,630
Qi.

77
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,040
We have to leave now.

78
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,210
Qi.

79
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,159
Qi.

80
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,500
Qi.

81
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,270
Qi, wake up.

82
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,830
Qi.

83
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,000
No.

84
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,150
I have to

85
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,190
go into your illusion to save you.

86
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,060
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,530
Qi, don't trust her.

88
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,450
This is all fake!

89
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,450
It's an illusion!

90
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,270
Qi.

91
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,920
Qi.

92
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,720
Qi.

93
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,190
Qi!

94
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,670
Don't believe her!

95
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,060
It's fake.

96
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,550
Qi.

97
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:52,980
Mother.

98
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,050
-No! Don’t trust her!
-Let her go.

99
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,310
I'll stay with you.

100
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,400
Qi.

101
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:07,930
Stop!

102
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,630
Chief.

103
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,590
Wait here.

104
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,540
I'll go there.

105
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,590
Grandma.

106
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,150
Chief.

107
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,880
Chief, you are getting older.

108
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,370
Can your body take it?

109
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,450
Water Fireflies are the guardian spirits of Sushui.

110
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,700
They sustain the Xiantang tree,

111
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,020
maintaining the vitality of Sushui for centuries.

112
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,350
But the Xiantang tree will grow old one day.

113
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,940
Just like us, it can't last forever.

114
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,060
According to the history book,

115
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,900
a young man with a totem will come here,

116
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,830
lead the tribe out

117
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,120
and build a new home.

118
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,430
I believe Qi is that person.

119
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,620
Even if he is not,

120
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,140
I will make him that person.

121
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,510
This is my destiny,

122
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,320
and it is also his,

123
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,300
as well as the fate of the Ji people.

124
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,840
Mother.

125
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,470
Grandma!

126
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:50,940
Grandma!

127
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,070
Grandma!

128
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:53,970
Grandma!

129
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,360
Chief!

130
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,010
Don't move!

131
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,430
Chief.

132
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,960
Grandma!

133
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,180
High Priest, don't stop me.

134
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,160
Grandma.

135
00:08:59,210 --> 00:08:59,820
Grandma!

136
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,310
Chief.

137
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,250
Lead the water guest out.

138
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,770
Grandma!

139
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,940
Don't go.

140
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,710
Grandma.

141
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,450
Chief.

142
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,380
Grandma!

143
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,370
Grandma!

144
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,060
Chief.

145
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,080
Grandma.

146
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,020
Don't stop me.

147
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,990
Grandma!

148
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,900
What are you doing?

149
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,320
I'm making some candy.

150
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,570
When you are feeling down,

151
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,250
eating some candy will make you feel better.

152
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,650
We, people of Sushui, don't like  candy.

153
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,800
Legend has it that

154
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,670
when a water guest with the River God totem appears,

155
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,140
it will both irritate the deities

156
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,000
and bring new life to the Ji people.

157
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,090
But he doesn't have a totem.

158
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,690
Some are not born with a totem.

159
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,750
Some fates

160
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,070
do not begin at this moment.

161
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,760
Grandma.

162
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:37,960
Nothing in this world happens without reason;

163
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,190
every encounter is determined by fate.

164
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,510
Fortune and misfortune

165
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,140
are both part of fate.

166
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,930
Grandma.

167
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,800
Grandma.

168
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,590
We trust you.

169
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,030
Let him in.

170
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,810
Okay.

171
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,030
Brother Qi.

172
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,220
Why are you sitting outside?

173
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,090
It's not sweet,

174
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,150
but a little salty.

175
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,740
Sorry.

176
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,940
Qi, it's okay.

177
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,800
As long as it's as good as the candy last time.

178
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,140
I'll go in first.

179
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,230
You punk.

180
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,790
Don't ever eat whatever others give you.

181
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,020
I'll go in first.

182
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,730
Sister Nian.

183
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,200
Grandma is calling you.

184
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,630
Did you bring me something?

185
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,020
Maybe next time.

186
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,030
The candy today is a bit salty.

187
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,080
Jiuye and the others don't eat it.

188
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,950
Give it to me.

189
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,660
I'll eat it if they don't.

190
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,280
Grandma, are these your family history?

191
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,130
Yes, we are descendants of the River God,

192
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,350
a tribe that governs water across the five continents.

193
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,250
But one year,

194
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,540
we failed to prevent the flood.

195
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,830
The people of the five continents lost their homeland.

196
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,490
The families were torn apart,

197
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,180
so they vented their anger on us.

198
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,030
In order to escape calamity,

199
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,670
we hid in Sushui.

200
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,190
With the illusion and the Water Fireflies,

201
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,550
ordinary people can't get in.

202
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,580
So you've been living here since then

203
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,820
and never gone out?

204
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,820
The world doesn't accept that we're the same.

205
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,370
They even called us monsters.

206
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,950
This is very sad.

207
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,760
Only each successive chief knows about it.

208
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,720
The rest,

209
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,820
just let them

210
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,290
live here happily.

211
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,720
Now it is a time of peace and prosperity.

212
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,310
Why don't you negotiate with them?

213
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,220
Have your people's

214
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,390
perception of us Ji people changed at all?

215
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,080
Also, why are you here?

216
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,060
I know why you're here.

217
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,170
In the face of prejudice and rumors,

218
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,250
people tend to believe in their own assumptions.

219
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,430
For their own assumptions,

220
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,990
they can bring together a group with differing interests for a common goal.

221
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,950
As the chief of the Ji Tribe,

222
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,020
I have to bear the lies to make peace for the people.

223
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,490
Nian is the future chief.

224
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,980
She has to bear the responsibility and secrets.

225
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,810
If you can help her,

226
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,060
maybe the fate of the Ji Tribe can be changed.

227
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,870
I'll help her.

228
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,770
But I'm not the one with the totem.

229
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,560
It doesn't matter.

230
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,540
You are more important.

231
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,750
I'm more important?

232
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,110
Do you like Nian?

233
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:31,950
I...

234
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,290
A totem is not a specific pattern,

235
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,230
it is a form of power.

236
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,120
When you like someone,

237
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,590
you will have power.

238
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,680
This power can be the expectation, loging, trust,

239
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,150
or sacrifice.

240
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,360
When you use this power

241
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,250
to fulfill your duty,

242
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,610
the totem will appear.

243
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,160
I see.

244
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,830
If you don't like Nian

245
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,750
and don't trust us,

246
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,300
then you

247
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,350
have already left with what you want.

248
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,640
Right?

249
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,940
If you like her, tell her.

250
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,500
That power will tell you what to do.

251
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,330
I trust that you'll help us.

252
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,170
Grandma.
