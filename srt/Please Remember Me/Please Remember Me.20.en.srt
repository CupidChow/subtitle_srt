00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,080
[Please Remember Me
Episode 20]

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:15,930
Zisu,

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,910
you're back.

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,370
Mother,

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,840
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,330
I know.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,210
This is also the last time

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,970
I'll be waiting for you here.

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,840
I'm very proud

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,680
of being your son.

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,320
You will

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,630
never come again?

13
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,410
You said

14
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,240
you wanted me

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,630
to look ahead.

16
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,090
My son,

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,270
I'm proud of you.

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,120
Do what you think is right.

19
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,340
So this is the real Xiantang tree.

20
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,040
Only someone with a pure heart can come here.

21
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,140
Otherwise, they will be swallowed by the illusion.

22
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,660
Qi!

23
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,250
It's dangerous!

24
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,270
Qi!

25
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,110
Qi.

26
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,920
I'm back.

27
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:13,970
Nian.

28
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,240
Qi really got it.

29
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,960
I got it.

30
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,530
Are you okay?

31
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:18,810
I got it.

32
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,400
I got it.

33
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,610
Grandma can be saved.

34
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,270
Thank you.

35
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,520
Qi.

36
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,980
What's wrong with you?

37
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,610
Bixi.

38
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,810
The totem?

39
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,750
It looks like it,

40
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,680
but it doesn't look like it either.

41
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,800
Nian,

42
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,110
trust me.

43
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,270
It doesn't matter if it is.

44
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,420
Let's go back to save Grandma.

45
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,550
Okay.

46
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:01,860
Grandma,

47
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,140
we've found the Xiantang tree.

48
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,050
You'll be fine soon.

49
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,620
High Priest, I took it back.

50
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,580
Great.

51
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:32,890
This...

52
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,490
How could this happen?

53
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,310
How could this happen?

54
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,860
What does that mean?

55
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,370
That little branch doesn't belong to me.

56
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,120
Grandma.

57
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,409
Where's Qi?

58
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:53,610
Qi.

59
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,159
Grandma.

60
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,570
I'm here.

61
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,659
Young man,

62
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,280
don't forget your promise.

63
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,970
Let us go back to our homeland

64
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,990
so that we won't need to hide

65
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,830
and can live a normal life.

66
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,590
I'll remember it.

67
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,240
Nian.

68
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,310
Grandma.

69
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,380
Trust is delicate.

70
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,950
It can easily be destroyed.

71
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,630
Hatred is like a fortress.

72
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,970
It's unbreakable.

73
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,110
Eliminating prejudice and resentment

74
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,110
requires a lot of efforts

75
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,900
and even sacrifices.

76
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,420
Some people

77
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,350
have been destined to be enemies

78
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,190
before their birth, or even a few hundred

79
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,409
or a few thousand years ago.

80
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,680
So, trust is precious.

81
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,980
You should cherish it.

82
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,600
Grandma, don't worry.

83
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,510
I'll fulfill what I promised you.

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,800
Thank you, Qi.

85
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,740
Hold it first.

86
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,580
Chief, please grant blessing.

87
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,880
This is...

88
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,130
Sushui is a place where new lives should be welcomed.

89
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,470
Here,

90
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,100
when someone is about to die,

91
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,900
a woman of the appropriate age

92
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,860
should pick her beloved man.

93
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,880
Then, Chief will grant blessing.

94
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,640
Grandma,

95
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,960
please

96
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,880
grant blessing to Qi and me.

97
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,170
I'm willing to let Qi become...

98
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,770
my future husband.

99
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,700
Grandma,

100
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,350
I'm willing too.

101
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,870
Qi.

102
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,010
Nian.

103
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,030
Grandma.

104
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,020
Grandma. Grandma!

105
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:30,840
-Chief!
-Chief!

106
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,590
Grandma.

107
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,130
Chief.

108
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,909
Grandma!

109
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,309
Grandma.

110
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,480
Grandma.

111
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,960
Grandma.

112
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,400
Grandma.

113
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,120
May Chief

114
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,430
sing among the stars.

115
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,920
May the dead enter our dreams.

116
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,420
May her soul return to her hometown.

117
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,570
Farewell to Chief.

118
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,140
Where will

119
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,640
Water Fireflies take Grandma?

120
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,250
They're not taking Grandma away.

121
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,570
They are Grandma's final abode.

122
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,310
They are also the final abode of everything.

123
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,940
So all of us will eventually...

124
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,860
turn into stars.

125
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,630
Nian.

126
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,230
In your culture,

127
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,590
is it always the women who pick their men to get married?

128
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,330
Yes.

129
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,950
Giving birth is very arduous for women.

130
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,540
It's also very important.

131
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,270
So

132
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,430
it's natural for women to pick their children's fathers.

133
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,290
Isn't it the same in your culture?

134
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,010
Nian,

135
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,720
I'm about to go back to Lin State.

136
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,450
I know.

137
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,830
You need to go back to fulfill your promise to Grandma and my clansmen.

138
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,630
But why so soon?

139
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,210
We just got engaged.

140
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,470
Did you agree to be engaged to me because Grandma...

141
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:26,910
No.

142
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,510
No, Nian. I...

143
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,210
I didn't agree because of anyone.

144
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,080
I like you very much.

145
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,170
I really like you.

146
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,030
But I'm sorry.

147
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,070
I lied to you and everyone.

148
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,350
Actually, my name is not Qi.

149
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,030
My name is Xiao Zisu.

150
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,570
I'm the general of the Feilian Troop in Lin State.

151
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,570
The Feilian Troop

152
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,530
exists for eliminating Ji people.

153
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,070
That's one of the reasons

154
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,580
why I came to Sushui.

155
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,040
I know.

156
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,970
I read the clan history book last night.

157
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,370
It's written in the book.

158
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,360
The Feilian Troop's soldiers

159
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,600
can't get married or have children.

160
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,360
They don't have titles or fiefs.

161
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,180
They have to guard the north for the rest of their lives

162
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,110
and can't leave.

163
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,640
Only someone with great achievements or injuries

164
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,240
can possibly be an exception.

165
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,770
But the hope is slim.

166
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,950
I have a butler in my mansion.

167
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,950
His name is Dashu.

168
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,370
He was my capable deputy general.

169
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,700
He broke a leg in order to save Qiu Chan,

170
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,230
my mother's personal maid.

171
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,470
But he was only allowed to resign and go back to his hometown.

172
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,040
Later, he became the butler in General's Mansion.

173
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,500
My mother's personal maid

174
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,300
also became a housekeeper

175
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,650
in the mansion.

176
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,870
I heard they've known each other since they were little.

177
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,520
But in the end,

178
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,470
they still can't be together.

179
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,520
Your rules are not good.

180
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,360
Your prejudice against Ji people is not good either. Neither is good.

181
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,890
That's why I should go back.

182
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,550
Nian,

183
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,440
I want to go back to change everything.

184
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,030
Nian, trust me.

185
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,350
I will come back.

186
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,340
By that time,

187
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,310
I'll come back wearing the most beautiful Qilin Armor to marry you.

188
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,790
Nian.

189
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,470
Why are you crying?

190
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,240
Why are you crying?

191
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,930
Thank you, Qi.

192
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,190
I'll wait for you to change everything.

193
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,910
But the book says

194
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,050
there are a lot of people in your hometown.

195
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,780
There must be so many beauties.

196
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,520
After you go back,

197
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,660
you won't remember me.

198
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,140
You won't come back to me either.

199
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,770
Nian.
