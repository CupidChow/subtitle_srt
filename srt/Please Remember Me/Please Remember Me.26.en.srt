00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,960
[Please Remember Me Episode 26]

2
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,190
Try this persimmon cake and see if it's sweet.

3
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,850
It's delicious and chewy.

4
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,500
I feel something is missing.

5
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,920
Try adding a bit more sugar.

6
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,320
It's different.

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,550
Maybe it was the first time I had candy,

8
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,340
so it tasted so sweet.

9
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,870
The first time is always beautiful.

10
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,390
Do you remember where you bought it?

11
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,200
I will buy it.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,800
I was just saying.

13
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,160
You don't have to be so serious.

14
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,620
Let's just buy these for today.

15
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,670
When we get back, let her try them

16
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,300
and see if they have the one she described.

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,430
Why did the General buy so many candies for Miss Xiaoman?

18
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,810
I want to find the candy she mentioned.

19
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,920
Maybe she was just saying that.

20
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,140
I don't think so.

21
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,190
Since she doesn't want to tell me,

22
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,320
I'll find it myself.

23
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,340
Maybe when I find the candy,

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,610
it will remind me of things between us.

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,979
General, do you really have to remember?

26
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,990
You two are getting along well now, aren't you?

27
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,130
I don't want her to protect me.

28
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,509
I should be the one protecting her.

29
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,190
Let's go.

30
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,870
General, wait for me.

31
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,350
Hold tight.

32
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,820
Okay.

33
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,710
I bought some candies from the City of Lin State.

34
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,390
Try it and see if it tastes like the one you mentioned.

35
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,830
You don't have to.

36
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,420
I do.

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,390
Everything you said matters.

38
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,330
I've thought about it.

39
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,120
It these candies aren't right,

40
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,970
I'll get all the candy makers from the City of Lin State

41
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,020
to make it for you.

42
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,710
You don't have to.

43
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,640
I've found it.

44
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,070
You found it?

45
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,770
Which one?

46
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,070
It's snowing again.

47
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,510
You haven't answered me.

48
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,990
You haven't told me

49
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,170
who that person is.

50
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,270
It's you.

51
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,460
I...

52
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,110
Chinese New Year is coming.

53
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,770
How about I take out to buy some New Year's goods?

54
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,820
I don't want to go anywhere.

55
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,100
I just want to stay at home with you.

56
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,510
Don't you want to experience the customs of Lin State?

57
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,840
The streets are livelier than during the Dongzhi Festival.

58
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,200
Buying New Year's goods will cost some money.

59
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,010
Do you have enough of your salary?

60
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,640
Yes. Spend as you like.

61
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,560
It's already past noon.

62
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,700
-The General and Xiaoman haven't come back yet.
-Excuse me.

63
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,400
Should I prepare lunch or not?

64
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,360
I...

65
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,300
They are back.

66
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,520
-Xiaoshu.
-Xiaoshu.

67
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,060
Where are the General and Xiaoman?

68
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,120
They haven't finished shopping yet.

69
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,250
-Are they still having lunch?
-I’m so tired.

70
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,630
Are they still having lunch?

71
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,960
They've already eaten.

72
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,030
I have stuff to move. I'm leaving.

73
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,400
It looks like

74
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,890
we don't have to prepare dinner either.

75
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,980
Fine.

76
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,040
This wonton restaurant again.

77
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,750
Don't you like it?

78
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,810
General doesn’t like to join in on the fun.

79
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,860
Why do you indulge me to buy things today?

80
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,520
I just got my salary,

81
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,500
so I have to buy you something.

82
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,020
Also,

83
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,100
we don't have to put it on account anymore.

84
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,600
What are they doing?

85
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,390
They are getting married.

86
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,130
Getting married?

87
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,540
In Lin State,

88
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,860
on the day before their wedding,

89
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,680
newlyweds hand out wedding candies on the streets.

90
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,210
It means to share the happiness and good fortune with everyone.

91
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:47,430
Come on.

92
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,010
Here's your wedding candies.

93
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,930
Congratulations.

94
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:50,920
Congratulations.

95
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,990
Thank you.

96
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,740
Your wedding here

97
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,670
is livelier than ours.

98
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,890
If you like,

99
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,780
I can take you around in the future.

100
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,280
We'll hand out wedding candies all over the street

101
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,940
and make sure everyone gets some.

102
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,430
General,

103
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,260
if you marry a Ji people openly,

104
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,190
I'm afraid the City of Lin State will be in chaos.

105
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,980
As long as you are willing,

106
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,340
others are nothing to be afraid of.

107
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,020
No need to be afraid.

108
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,289
General.

109
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,590
His Lordship wants you to go there.

110
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,290
It’s urgent.

111
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,530
Now?

112
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,200
Yes.

113
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,110
Eat with Xiaoman

114
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,710
and send her back.

115
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,790
Okay.

116
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,730
I'll be back soon.

117
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,560
Put it on.

118
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,040
If Zisu knows that I poisoned Xiao Xianchen,

119
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,890
then he will probably hate me.

120
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,150
Brother.

121
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,560
Now that you've just recovered,

122
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,360
you should not drink for a while.

123
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,580
Thank you for your understanding.

124
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,640
Because of Xiaoman,

125
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,590
I'm fine now.

126
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,070
Don't worry about me.

127
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,120
I heard that you've opened up

128
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,490
the border between Lin State and Sushui

129
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,350
for the Ji people to hole a market.

130
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,060
Yes.

131
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,620
People wary of the Ji people

132
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,670
because they don't know them well.

133
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,630
I think a place for interaction

134
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,700
will improve relations between the Ji people and Lin State citizens.

135
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,080
The Ji people are actually really good.

136
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,820
They are good at water management and fishing.

137
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,330
They also know some dream divination techniques

138
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,830
that can cure hysteria.

139
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,780
Once there's enough mutual understanding,

140
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,060
the rumors will naturally be broken.

141
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,700
Zisu, if you do this,

142
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,060
you will put our Lin State in the public's sight.

143
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,330
If I can do this,

144
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,760
I have my way to deal with it.

145
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,820
Zisu,

146
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,480
People live only for a few decades,

147
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,140
but with each generation changing,

148
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,340
no one can control the seasons.

149
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,930
Everything changes,

150
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,070
and the same goes for the mortal world.

151
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,220
People don't care about the truth.

152
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,670
They care more about their positions.

153
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,850
Trying to reestablish rules is like

154
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,670
going against the flow,

155
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,740
which is very difficult.

156
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,490
Even if it's difficult, I'm still doing it.

157
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,210
As long as the mind is righteous,

158
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,410
the path will be correct.

159
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,070
This is what mother once said.

160
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,230
You've all grown up so much that you are using mother's words.

161
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
Have you forgotten how mother died?

162
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,680
Defending for Ji people...

163
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,210
Then why are you helping the Ji people

164
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,460
and standing up for them?

165
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,400
Mother's death wasn't because of the Ji people.

166
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,640
It is because of us.

167
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,030
Because no one is on her side.

168
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,430
I think you're doing this for Xiaoman.

169
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,270
Do you really like her that much?

170
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:24,800
Yes.

171
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,020
And I've thought about it.

172
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,690
I'm going to marry her.

173
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,420
Nonsense!

174
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,700
She's one of the Ji people.

175
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,520
I disagree.

176
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,990
Have you ever thought that

177
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,140
you've misunderstood the Ji people too much?

178
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,270
I won't allow it.

179
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,520
Stop talking.

180
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,910
Members of the Feilian Troop can't get married.

181
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,330
If she is an ordinary woman,

182
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,410
I would turn a blind eye.

183
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,120
How dare you want to marry Ji people in a flagrant way?

184
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,290
I think you really are crazy.

185
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,550
Ji people aren't evil.

186
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,010
I know that and so do you.

187
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,810
Instead of deceiving ourselves,

188
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,930
we should take responsibility for our past mistakes.

189
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,210
Isn't that the quality a true leader

190
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,070
should have?

191
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,580
What is right and what is wrong?

192
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,660
The future of Lin State is the most important.

193
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,830
Are you trying to build our future on the top of lies?

194
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,880
Lies are more destructive than the Ji people.

195
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,140
I believe you understand this deep down.

196
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,900
Brother,

197
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,960
I can stop asking about my past in Sushui.

198
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:28,830
But

199
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,220
what can I do for Xiaoman

200
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,990
and the Ji people

201
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,860
are the reasons for me to live.

202
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,290
Please forgive me.

203
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,070
Zisu,

204
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,900
you are forcing me with your life.

205
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,680
Pick an auspicious date.

206
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,300
Consider it as settling the debt I owe you.

207
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:54,920
Brother.

208
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,250
Mother is gone. You have to listen to me.

209
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,890
I will protect you.

210
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,220
The Lord has issued an order

211
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,050
to send Young Master Qi to Liang State as a hostage.

212
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,180
Departure is immediate.

213
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,090
Let go of my brother!

214
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,290
Let him go! Let him go!

215
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,710
Let go of my brother!
