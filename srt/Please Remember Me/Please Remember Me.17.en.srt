[Please Remember Me]
[Episode 17]

2
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,420
Who are you?

3
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,050
Where am I?

4
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,610
It's said that Ji demons eats humans.

5
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,600
Did that girl just put on a disguise and lie to me?

6
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,070
They are transformations of Ji demons, aren't they?

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,270
Let me see.

8
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:42,890
Let me see.

9
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,070
Let me see.

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,620
I want to see the water guest too.

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,580
Don't be nervous, water guest.

12
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,310
Sushui has always been cold.

13
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,450
Let me scrape your skin

14
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,580
in case you get sick.

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,320
No need. I'll leave here.

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,280
Don't be shy. Qi is a good massager.

17
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,640
Do they clean up humans so neatly before they eat them?

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,370
Don't worry.

19
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,470
You're acting so shy.

20
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,800
Let me give you a scrape.

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,670
Don't move.

22
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,140
I'll scrape away the chill first.

23
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,450
What are you doing?

24
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,030
- Then I'll scrape away the dampness.
-What are you doing?

25
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,910
I don't taste good.

26
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,830
Three, shave off your excessive heat.

27
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,530
Help! Help!

28
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,970
Kids can't look. Kids can't look.

29
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,170
Go out and play.

30
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,860
Hurry up.

31
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,770
We inspected every inch of his body.

32
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,810
There's no tattoo.

33
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,039
Have you searched carefully?

34
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,110
We took off all his pants.

35
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:32,990
Take a good look again.

36
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:33,789
Okay.

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,970
The water guest doesn't have a tattoo.

38
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,670
Grandma.

39
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,870
What does the book say?

40
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,470
I remember it was written in the book.

41
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,840
There's even a painting.

42
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,479
Why can't I find it?

43
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,100
Maybe

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,060
it's not this water guest.

45
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,140
Without the Deity's guidance,

46
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,150
the water guest wouldn't have been able to come here alive.

47
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,840
[Nian's home]

48
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,949
Water guest.

49
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,760
Drink this bowl of porridge.

50
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,560
Go home. Everything's fine now.

51
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,610
Drink the porridge.

52
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:22,570
Here.

53
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,450
This is the second time.

54
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,820
I won't eat it this time.

55
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,960
What do you want?

56
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:31,940
Just do it.

57
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,350
Water guest, this is really edible.

58
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,850
We were fine from eating the mushrooms before,

59
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,690
but we didn't know you would get poisoned.

60
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,450
I really didn't mean it.

61
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,040
You can try it this time.

62
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,540
Really.

63
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,890
Water guest.

64
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,210
I don't even know your name.

65
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,420
I'm outnumbered.

66
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,329
I need to stay alive first.

67
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,510
My name is...

68
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,110
I'll use my nickname,

69
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,570
it would be hard to remember a made-up name.

70
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,090
Qi.

71
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,320
A trash?

72
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,600
Why are you swearing at me?

73
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,590
Please mind your language.

74
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,130
I'm not afraid of you if we fight.

75
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,460
How can you swear at him?

76
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,860
My name is Qi.

77
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,410
Qi.

78
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,890
Qi.

79
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,040
Try it.

80
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,430
It'll be fine this time.

81
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,040
He can't drink the porridge too?

82
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,290
I told you so.

83
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,610
It's not our fault.

84
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,770
Nian, what did you put in the porridge?

85
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,930
Just beans, chestnuts and almonds.

86
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,329
When you put these together...

87
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,270
It's poisonous.

88
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,579
Yes, it is.

89
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,579
Poisonous?

90
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,490
Wait.

91
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,240
Wait.

92
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,990
Nian, prick his fingers first.

93
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,530
I don't trust you anymore.

94
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,890
I won't trust you anymore.

95
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,870
This

96
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,660
is absolutely useful.

97
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,460
I don't trust you anymore.

98
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,380
That's right.

99
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,490
What are you waiting for? Come here.

100
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,240
Let him eat it.

101
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,050
Here, water guest.

102
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,750
You'll be fine after eating it.

103
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,810
No, I don't want it.

104
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,960
You can really eat this.

105
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,520
You'll recover after eating it.

106
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,870
Don't worry.

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You'll be fine after eating it.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,670
I'm not eating.

109
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,120
This is really edible.

110
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,159
You're awake.

111
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,240
Looks like you're fine.

112
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,860
I have to tell everyone.

113
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,580
Qi is fine.

114
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,700
Don't worry.

115
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,159
He's fine.

116
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,790
Really?

117
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,570
Are you feeling better?

118
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,570
The water guest has really recovered.

119
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,900
Are you feeling better?

120
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,750
Nian,

121
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,240
you must be careful in the future.

122
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,300
Don't let the water guests eat just anything.

123
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,710
He's not used to this place yet.

124
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,750
Don't worry.

125
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,940
I will be careful.

126
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,280
I won't feed him.

127
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,100
That won't do.

128
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,570
Enough.

129
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,630
It's quite late.

130
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,770
Go back and rest.

131
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,200
Go back.

132
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,980
Bye.

133
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,070
-Rest early. See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

134
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,110
Bye.

135
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,450
I don't think I need you anymore.

136
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,220
Big brother.

137
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,700
Aren't you afraid of getting wet?

138
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,790
You're all wet.

139
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,680
Sit here.

140
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,960
You can sit here.

141
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,230
What is this?

142
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,630
This is malt candy

143
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,190
for suppressing hunger.

144
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,960
This malt candy

145
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,290
is very sweet.

146
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,190
Why is it so delicious?

147
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,610
I wonder

148
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,460
if any kids

149
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,310
want to eat this candy?

150
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,990
I want...

151
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,330
I want it.

152
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,240
Then I have a question for you.

153
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,440
In Sushui...

154
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,320
what

155
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,360
is the most powerful?

156
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,350
What a pity.

157
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,600
You missed a chance to eat candy.

158
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,470
There's one left.

159
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,740
Let me ask you again.

160
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,050
In Sushui,

161
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,360
what

162
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,380
is the most powerful?

163
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,830
It's Bixi.

164
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,510
Bixi?

165
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,990
Where could it be?

166
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,260
In Dream Lake.

167
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,930
You can't go there.

168
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,150
You can't get out.

169
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,730
Dream Lake.

170
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,340
Have this bowl of porridge.

171
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,590
I didn't add anything.

172
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,050
It's a little hot.

173
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,130
When I was young,

174
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,800
there were a group of people standing outside my door.

175
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,060
He's not making a sound.

176
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,480
Do you want to go in and bring some food to Young Master Qi?

177
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,350
Even His Lordship doesn’t care.

178
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,190
Why should we?

179
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,680
If we get infected,

180
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,980
we'll be like him.

181
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,200
Let's talk about it later.

182
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,020
But they didn't want me to live.

183
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,480
They just wanted me to die.

184
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,580
That way, I won't cause them any trouble.

185
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,390
Who are they?

186
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,090
They are so evil.

187
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,840
They had no choice.

188
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,780
They just followed orders.

189
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,130
If it weren't for my brother,

190
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,130
I would have died.

191
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,880
What about your parents?

192
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,970
My father has many sons.

193
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,250
He doesn't care about me.

194
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,470
My mother

195
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,760
passed away.

196
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,350
She passed away?

197
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,350
If I had stayed,

198
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,920
would the ending be different?

199
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,140
Actually,

200
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,880
I know how you feel.

201
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,429
When I was young,

202
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,390
my parents went up the mountain in the pouring rain

203
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,330
to gather herbs to cure me.

204
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,770
Just like today,

205
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,900
the rain overwhelmed half of the mountain.

206
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,760
They were buried inside

207
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,940
and never came out.

208
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,680
Sometimes I think

209
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,180
if I were more sensible

210
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,450
and didn't get wet,

211
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,090
or chilled in the cold weather.

212
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,330
If I hadn't gotten sick,

213
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,060
my parents wouldn't have died.

214
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,370
It's all my fault.

215
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,410
It turns out that Ji people are not as described in the legends.

216
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,010
They care about their family

217
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,220
and their children too.

218
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,600
If you stand in the rain,

219
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,700
you won't get caught if you cry.

220
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,240
Right?

221
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,330
Here.

222
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,440
Come on.

223
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,650
I didn't cry.

224
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,140
Because my grandma told me

225
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,070
although they are gone,

226
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,760
their souls exist between heaven and earth.

227
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,050
Maybe

228
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,540
they're the clouds that suddenly cover the sun for you,

229
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,050
or the snow falling on your shoulder,

230
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,730
or maybe the candle that lights up

231
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,440
when you are lonely.

232
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,800
They became water fireflies

233
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,520
and the bright galaxy in the water.

234
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,070
As long as we remember them

235
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,720
and think about them,

236
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,050
we will never be apart.

237
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,270
Our galaxy

238
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,530
is not in the water,

239
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,210
but in the sky.

240
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,780
In the sky?

241
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,360
Look at the sky when you miss your mother.

242
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,020
That's just a beautiful wish.

243
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,610
But...

244
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,760
wishes also give us power to keep living.

245
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,080
Mother.

246
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,080
I miss you.

247
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,080
Father, Mother.

248
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,750
I miss you.

249
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,090
I miss you.

250
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,060
Nian.

251
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,930
When I find the Bixi,

252
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,560
I'll come back and make it up to you.

253
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,510
This is the Dream Lake.

254
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,180
Why aren't there any guards?

255
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,510
These look like fireflies.

256
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,350
But why are there so many fireflies in broad daylight?
