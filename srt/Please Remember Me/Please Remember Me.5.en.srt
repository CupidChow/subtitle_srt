00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,960
[Please Remember Me
Episode 5]

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,000
General. Xiaoshu.

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,010
So fast?

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,520
Xiaoshu.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,450
General, you make sure everyone here is safe and worry-free.

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,530
I hope you can be safe and worry-free.

7
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,590
You'd better keep yourself safe.

8
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,620
General, I've received information on the matter you asked me to investigate.

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,280
Over there.

10
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,110
Take a walk around by yourself.

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:47,890
Okay.

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,750
What is this?

13
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,390
This is a knot-tying token.

14
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,220
It's almost time for my meeting with Chang Yuan.

15
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,220
I need to find a way to get rid of them.

16
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,780
Barring accidents,

17
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,750
the person who's here to meet her is going to show up.

18
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,400
General, why are you smiling?

19
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,079
Is it because she gave herself away?

20
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,340
I'm going to catch her.

21
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:34,920
No.

22
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,020
I just think today...

23
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,390
the weather is notably nice.

24
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,520
The weather is nice?

25
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,430
Was the weather bad before?

26
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,770
Why did the lantern pillar topple over?

27
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:29,930
Hurry!

28
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,860
Are you hurt?

29
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,230
See if anyone is hurt.

30
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,329
Where is she? How come she disappeared?

31
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,520
What exactly happened when you went to the temple that day?

32
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,770
On the day of the ceremony,

33
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,290
there were all kinds of people in the temple.

34
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,130
No one found out that I disguised myself.

35
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,020
[Chang Yuan]

36
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,860
I planned to wait for an opportunity to take action after I got Bixi,

37
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,790
but I didn't expect Cui Ya to suddenly appear.

38
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,050
He caused trouble and disrupted my plan.

39
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,540
I heard Xiao Zisu say

40
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,770
he would take Bixi back to his mansion.

41
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,850
So I took the stab for him without hesitating.

42
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,520
I wanted to go to the mansion with him to look for Bixi.

43
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,839
But I didn't expect him to be so vigilant.

44
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,350
I couldn't find it at all.

45
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,060
And...

46
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,750
And what?

47
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,860
And my dream divination technique seemingly doesn't work on him.

48
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,860
I asked everyone around him,

49
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,860
but none of them knows where Bixi is.

50
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,940
Then kill him first

51
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,390
to avenge our clansmen.

52
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,520
Even if we kill him, we can't find Bixi.

53
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,560
We will only expose ourselves.

54
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,360
And we can't go back to Sushui either.

55
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,230
This is ridiculous.

56
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,420
Bixi has actually become an omnipotent divine object

57
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,780
in the eyes of the five states' people.

58
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,570
It's just a thing to suppress water demons in Sushui.

59
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,960
Also, controlling people's mind with it

60
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,360
comes at a cost.

61
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,170
I've always been very curious.

62
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,520
How did Xiao Zisu get that half of Bixi?

63
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,980
Also, when I looked at him,

64
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,490
I felt he looks a bit familiar.

65
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,330
I wonder if I've seen him before.

66
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,780
Don't think too much.

67
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,840
You have never met each other before.

68
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,710
You've only stayed in his mansion for a few days,

69
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,840
and you're already soft-hearted to him.

70
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,130
Don't forget that he's our enemy.

71
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,650
And the thing on your head...

72
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,250
I'm not.

73
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,400
Right,

74
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,310
look.

75
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,270
Does this look like the soil from the Southwest Slope of Pucao Village?

76
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,470
I think the Feilian Troop's men

77
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,730
have found that place.

78
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,800
I'll tell everyone

79
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:57,900
to leave now.

80
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:58,950
Okay.

81
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,470
General, did she really run away?

82
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,570
Send some men to keep a close eye on the sentry posts.

83
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,450
We have to find her.

84
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:18,780
Yes.

85
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,130
Also, everyone on surveillance duty today will be punished after going back.

86
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,950
General Xiao.

87
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:41,890
General Xiao.

88
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,240
General, are you on patrol?

89
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,920
Your Grace.

90
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,040
Your Grace, why did you come out alone?

91
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,470
Guards.

92
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,080
No need.

93
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,110
I came out alone because always keeping an eye on me

94
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,510
makes me uncomfortable.

95
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,380
Then be careful, Your Grace.

96
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,090
Let's go.

97
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,080
Was it you?

98
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,450
Why do I feel you're right beside me?

99
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,310
My Lady.

100
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,620
My Lady,

101
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,670
why did you disappear in the blink of an eye?

102
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,680
Let's go back now.

103
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,250
General, someone found out she went into the mountain.

104
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,110
Seal the mountain pass! I'll be right there!

105
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,610
Hya!

106
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,010
Hya!

107
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,860
General is here!

108
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,080
Hurry, go report.

109
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,600
General,

110
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,660
we've searched the mountain twice.

111
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:33,590
Keep looking.

112
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,409
The direction Xiaoshu provided should be correct.

113
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:35,980
Yes.

114
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,710
General!

115
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,400
General, look!

116
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,520
General!

117
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,930
General!

118
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,150
General!

119
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,810
Where did you go? Who asked you to run around?

120
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,600
Do you know how long I've been looking for you?

121
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,060
Were you trying to escape?

122
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,970
I saw this kind of black fruit in the mountain.

123
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,030
I remembered Dashu said

124
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,270
this kind of fruit is good for your health.

125
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,790
So I wanted to pick some.

126
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,900
I accidentally got lost.

127
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,960
Stomach problems?

128
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,980
Didn't he go see a doctor?

129
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,090
No.

130
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,760
Later, General said there is a kind of black fruit

131
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,560
that can treat abdominal pain.

132
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,090
-We found many kinds, but he said none of them was what he mentioned.
-Black fruit?

133
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,310
I...

134
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,030
I really didn't mean it.

135
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,980
You're injured.

136
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,910
When I just ran here,

137
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,510
I ran too fast and accidentally

138
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,800
fell into a pit.

139
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,870
Let's go home first.

140
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,380
Give me your hand.

141
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Let me take a look.

142
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,030
You fell accidentally and now you're crying.

143
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,640
That one.

144
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,790
General, you are so fierce.

145
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,020
You can be fierce with me after I apply the medicine.

146
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,700
Take this bottle

147
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,710
of medicine.

148
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,050
It's the Firethorn Ointment from Crown Prince Cui.

149
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,290
This is the ointment made by an old physician in the camp.

150
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,490
It's very effective.

151
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,940
But it'll hurt a lot.

152
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:24,950
Don't move.

153
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,280
Hold it.

154
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,940
I'm going to get some gauze.

155
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,440
Xiao Zisu!
