00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,970
[Please Remember Me Episode 27]

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,910
What?

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,140
What poison did Xiaoman give my brother?

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,340
Is there an antidote?

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,420
If your brother got it from me,

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,850
it would've been poison for sure.

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,910
But Xiaoman didn't

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,420
give him poison.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,040
She couldn't do it

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,490
because of you.

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,270
But your brother said

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,550
he'll atone with his life

13
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,710
when the time comes.

14
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,290
It all depends

15
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,640
on his conscience.

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,300
It's not you who's in trouble now,

17
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,390
but Nian.

18
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,160
What is Nian hiding from me?

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,150
She used her life force

20
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,540
to trade for the power of Bixi to save you.

21
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,150
She may not have much time left.

22
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,550
Not much time left?

23
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,990
How is that possible?

24
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,350
You used Bixi

25
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,750
to save me a few days ago?

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,740
Are you affected?

27
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,400
Nian,

28
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,740
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,160
Is there a solution?

30
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,110
How can I save her?

31
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,710
Can I exchange my life force for hers?

32
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,670
Human life forces

33
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,600
aren't the same.

34
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:41,370
There's no way.

35
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,190
No way?

36
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,550
How can there be no way?

37
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,610
Aren't you the High Priest of Sushui?

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,240
There is one way,

39
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,410
but it's just a legend of our clan.

40
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,160
No one has ever tried it.

41
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,960
I'll try it. I'll try.

42
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,210
The legend says the Xiantang tree

43
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,669
is the sacred tree of Sushui.

44
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,050
Its fruit can bring people back to life.

45
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,590
You used it to save Chief

46
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,520
back then.

47
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,680
Its flower must've fallen.

48
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,620
Yes.

49
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,350
The moment I brought it in front of Grandma,

50
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,280
the flower fell.

51
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,070
But I planted a branch in my backyard, and it's alive.

52
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,470
The flowers are useless.

53
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,750
Only the fruit of the Xiantang tree

54
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,430
can bring people back to life.

55
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,550
But though it blooms every year,

56
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,810
it rarely bears fruit.

57
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,550
Rarely bears fruit?

58
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,110
That means there's still hope.

59
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,640
How can I make it bear fruit?

60
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,450
That sapling

61
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,890
is now bonded to you.

62
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,510
It's said that the tree

63
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,300
can bloom and bear fruit

64
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,040
if watered with blood.

65
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,829
But the tree is sentient.

66
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,630
If the one offering blood harbors ill intent,

67
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,550
it will backfire.

68
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,040
Even if you're righteous,

69
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,070
using your own blood doesn't guarantee

70
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,510
it will bear fruit.

71
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,190
I will make it bloom and bear fruit,

72
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,010
even if I bleed dry.

73
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,370
I have to save her.

74
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,360
Chang Yuan,

75
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,850
keep it a secret for me.

76
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,590
It's open.

77
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,130
Here comes ginseng and black chicken soup.

78
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,220
Take it easy.

79
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,560
Don't burn yourself.

80
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,930
This is ginseng and black chicken soup.

81
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,079
Xiaoman, have more.

82
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,750
It's good for your health.

83
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,760
Thank you, aunt.

84
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,530
This is for General.

85
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,360
General, this is yours.

86
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,950
Come on,

87
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,670
General, try this soup.

88
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,330
It's good.

89
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,240
Aunt Qiu,

90
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,330
aren't you being a bit biased?

91
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,230
From now on, I only have eyes

92
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,970
for Xiaoman.

93
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,550
Aunt.

94
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,690
No General.

95
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,500
Fine.

96
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,600
Okay.

97
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,950
Good stuff.

98
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,450
Dashu, what's this for?

99
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,490
Dashu,

100
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,700
we're not married yet.

101
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,070
It's too early to give us baby gifts.

102
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,600
What are you talking about?

103
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,790
This is for Xiaoman.

104
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,110
Back then,

105
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,270
I had a little sister besides Xiaoshu.

106
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,500
But

107
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:49,800
our family was poor,

108
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,200
and she passed away early.

109
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,290
Now I see

110
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,710
Xiaoman as my own sister.

111
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,690
This

112
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,930
longevity lock

113
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,650
is for Xiaoman.

114
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:00,910
Take it.

115
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,070
Thank you, Dashu,

116
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,420
for accepting me as your sister, despite my identity.

117
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,600
What identity?

118
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,810
You're our family now.

119
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,790
Exactly.

120
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,290
This scene is great.

121
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,600
Why don't we draw it?

122
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,160
And name it

123
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,610
the family portrait.

124
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,620
That's a good idea.

125
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,250
What do you think?

126
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,670
Okay. Let's draw it when Xiaoshu is back.

127
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,900
Family portrait, perfect.

128
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,900
Family portrait.

129
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,620
Are you done?

130
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,350
Almost.

131
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,320
You draw fast.

132
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,490
How is it?

133
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,800
Pretty fast.

134
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,900
You...

135
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,310
You only drew two people.

136
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,080
Art takes time.

137
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,910
Take it easy, General.

138
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,060
Come one by one.

139
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,230
My legs are numb.

140
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,730
No, you...

141
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,980
Call me when it's my part.

142
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,620
Okay.

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,070
Let's go.

144
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,680
Yes.

145
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,950
Draw General first.

146
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,360
Let's go.

147
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,220
I'm exhausted.

148
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,250
Draw us first.

149
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,530
Let's sit and rest.

150
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,040
General.

151
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,590
Are you done?

152
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,440
Yes.

153
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,440
Next.

154
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,090
Done?

155
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,820
It's my turn.

156
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,880
It's my turn.

157
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:54,890
You...

158
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,840
Come.

159
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,060
Look at you.

160
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,430
Want an orange?

161
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,620
-Okay, done.
-Are you sleepy?

162
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,510
Okay, done.

163
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,080
Done? Let me see.

164
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,880
All right.

165
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,780
Let me check.

166
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,200
Look how pretty

167
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:10,900
Xiaoman is.

168
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,430
Is it okay?

169
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,360
Look at her eyes.

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,930
Xiaoman is good-looking herself.

171
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,680
Xiaoman,

172
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,930
let's go see it too.

173
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,140
Xiaoman.

174
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,230
Xiaoman!

175
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,740
Xiaoman.

176
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,640
Xiaoman.

177
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,280
Xiaoman!

178
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,760
Xiaoman!

179
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:41,620
Hurry up.

180
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,490
What's wrong?

181
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,030
She...

182
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,160
She wouldn't...

183
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,310
What are you talking about?

184
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,980
I suddenly fell asleep.

185
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,590
Xiaoman.

186
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,070
What are you doing?

187
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,270
Wealth and longevity.

188
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,760
-It must be good.
-Longevity.

189
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,920
Longevity.

190
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,810
Yes.

191
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,230
I said you two must be blessed.

192
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,450
You both have good fortune.

193
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,490
Is it finished?

194
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,100
Yes.

195
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,320
Chang Yuan,

196
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,020
I can't hold on for much longer, can I?

197
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,470
Have Zisu and the others found out?

198
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,170
Otherwise, why would they act so unusually?

199
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,940
Zisu did come to ask me,

200
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,550
but I...

201
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,560
I didn't tell him the truth.

202
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,210
But he should be able to guess it.

203
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,140
Chang Yuan,

204
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,140
after we resolve the clansmen issues,

205
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,740
take me back to Sushui.

206
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,350
I want to be buried there.

207
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,870
Aren't you going

208
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:54,850
to tell them?

209
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,980
I...

210
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,450
I have a way to make him forget me.

211
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,660
Princess, please.

212
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,840
Your wound...

213
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,000
Please keep it a secret, Princess.

214
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,630
I see her condition worsening.

215
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,900
Yes,

216
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,000
so I hope she can be happy in the time

217
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,840
she has left.

218
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,940
You two want to sacrifice your lives

219
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,290
for each other,

220
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,170
but have you considered

221
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,910
that the living suffer

222
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,310
more than the dead?

223
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,930
Is either of you sure

224
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,430
that whoever survives

225
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,120
will be happier?

226
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,340
I'm learning dream divination technique.

227
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,040
I'll make her forget me.

228
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,950
Love really makes people foolish.

229
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,150
General.

230
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,390
Princess.

231
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,560
Princess.

232
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,540
Nian, are you feeling better?

233
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,650
Much better.

234
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,530
Am I right, Chang Yuan?

235
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,180
Yes.

236
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,130
The moon is so beautiful today.

237
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,080
What should we do?

238
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,200
Anything is fine.

239
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,230
Write a wish on a sky lantern,

240
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,090
and the gods will help

241
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,420
make it come true.

242
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,200
Is this a custom in Lin State?

243
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:43,860
Here.

244
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,420
So, I can write any wish?

245
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:49,800
Yes.

246
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,180
Aunt Qiu, good health.

247
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,490
Dashu, good health.

248
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,940
And…

249
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,600
And...

250
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,640
General, wealth.

251
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,730
Why are all your wishes for others?

252
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,910
My wish is...

253
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,610
to be with you now.

254
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,730
For future wishes,

255
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,840
you'll have to help me.

256
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,380
What are you talking about?

257
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,450
For future wishes, we'll achieve them together.

258
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,660
I'm talking about

259
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,510
arranging things for the clansmen.

260
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,670
What do you think I'm talking about?

261
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,740
No matter what

262
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,250
happens in the future,

263
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,110
we'll achieve every wish

264
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,300
together.

265
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,280
Why did you write so much?

266
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,170
Let's go release them. Hurry.

267
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,020
I still have a wish to write.

268
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,810
Another one?

269
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,280
Wait for me!

270
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,500
Why did you release an empty lantern?

271
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,760
Why didn't you write a wish?

272
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,030
I… I don't know what wish to make.

273
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,500
I want to be with the person I love,

274
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,040
but I don't have a chance now.

275
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,590
Don't you want that?

276
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,850
Do I still have a chance?

277
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,990
Your life

278
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,550
has just begun.

279
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,680
If we were from the same clan,

280
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,820
could we be friends?

281
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,510
We already are.

282
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,500
That's true.

283
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,490
If there really are gods in the sky,

284
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,800
I hope Nian stays safe and sound.
