[Please Remember Me
Episode 21]

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:08,690
Nian.

3
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,310
Trust me.

4
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,590
I will come back.

5
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
It's a deal.

6
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:53,720
Deal.

7
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,680
This is strange.

8
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,340
Why hasn't Nian come here yet?

9
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,440
Maybe Nian is reluctant to see Qi off.

10
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,289
Looks like she won't come.

11
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,500
I'm leaving.

12
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,170
Qi, goodbye.

13
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,000
Take care, Qi.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,860
Take care, Qi.

15
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,830
Take care.

16
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,690
We will miss you.

17
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,990
-Goodbye.
-Qi, take care.

18
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,090
-Goodbye.
-Take care.

19
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,500
Take care.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,530
Goodbye.

21
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,270
Goodbye, Qi.

22
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,890
Take care.

23
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,970
Qi, take care.

24
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,490
Qi!

25
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,729
Qi, wait!

26
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,400
Qi!

27
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,490
Qi!

28
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,330
Nian is finally here.

29
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,200
Qi!

30
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,720
Luckily, she made it in time.

31
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,520
Nian!

32
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,770
Qi!

33
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,100
Qi!

34
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,440
Qi!

35
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,440
Nian!

36
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,730
Nian.

37
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,990
You still came.

38
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:53,780
You're finally here.

39
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:55,720
Zisu.

40
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,380
This is a half piece of Bixi.

41
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,010
Grandma,

42
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,480
you told me

43
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,090
a living water guest will come to Sushui.

44
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,630
When will he come?

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,550
Sushui is not an ordinary river.

46
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:19,079
It's said that the River God let Meng Po down, the keeper of memories.

47
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,960
His tears flowed

48
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,460
and formed Sushui.

49
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,610
So ordinary water guests

50
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,850
can't come in.

51
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,480
Even if they can come in,

52
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,970
they will forget everything here

53
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,730
when they leave.

54
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,329
Only the person with the totem can come in.

55
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,570
The person with the totem?

56
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,690
Who is that?

57
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,130
The great hero who can take us out of Sushui.

58
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,750
Great hero?

59
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,910
When will the great hero come?

60
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,350
High Priest said

61
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,940
he'll come after I die.

62
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,530
After you die?

63
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,200
Then I don't want him to come.

64
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,930
I want Grandma to live forever.

65
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,070
Nian, remember,

66
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,380
when he shows up,

67
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,240
you must tell him

68
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,350
to remember us.

69
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,790
With it,

70
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,080
you can find the way back to Sushui.

71
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,089
Bixi is such an important thing.

72
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,140
How can you give it to me so easily?

73
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,960
Although you're from Lin State,

74
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,940
you're also one of us now.

75
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,470
Since you'll defend Ji people,

76
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,610
you can't forget us.

77
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,890
Sushui's mist is poisonous.

78
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,150
If you don't take this half piece of Bixi,

79
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,750
you won't be able to find the way back to Sushui.

80
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,100
It's said that when Bixi is complete, lovers can be together.

81
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,860
If not, they'll forget each other.

82
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,420
If you give me a half piece of it,

83
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,980
will you forget me?

84
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,110
No.

85
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,600
Seven days.

86
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,530
As long as you can come back within seven days,

87
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,060
we won't forget each other.

88
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,830
It's Grain Buds in seven days.

89
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,080
I will come back by that time.

90
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,630
Remember,

91
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,590
on Grain Buds,

92
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,510
you have to come back.

93
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,500
Grain Buds.

94
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,770
Morning, Brother Qi.

95
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,230
Morning, Nian.

96
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,690
What are you doing?

97
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,020
The smell is so strong.

98
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,410
I'm making maltose.

99
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,120
Qi taught me.

100
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,250
I'll deliver it to you when it's ready.

101
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,140
Okay.

102
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,250
Good morning, Grandma Jiu.

103
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,290
Morning.

104
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,510
Charge!

105
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,130
Charge!

106
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,610
Charge!

107
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,560
Warriors!

108
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,659
It's your duty to protect Sushui.

109
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,210
Ready to fight!

110
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,550
Add some firewood for me.

111
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,790
Sister Nian, he hasn't come back yet.

112
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,600
Why do you come here every day?

113
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,500
You know nothing.

114
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,560
What if he comes back in advance?

115
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,580
I want him to see me first.

116
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,180
I'll accompany you.

117
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,030
I promised Qi

118
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,610
to be the bravest warrior of Sushui.

119
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,280
Did Brother Qi teach you that?

120
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,150
No.

121
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,670
I just learned it from you.

122
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,620
She's getting married!

123
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,600
Sister, you are so beautiful.

124
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,220
I'm beautiful every day.

125
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,660
Nian, do you think Qi will come back?

126
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,680
Today is Grain Buds.

127
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,350
Qi will definitely come back.

128
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,600
I trust him.

129
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,810
Qi is back!

130
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,750
Brother Qi!

131
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,840
Qi is back!

132
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,030
Qi is back?

133
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,900
Qi!

134
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,539
Brother Qi is back!

135
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,990
Slow down.

136
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,340
Qi!

137
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,110
Qi is back.

138
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,100
Qi.

139
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,240
Brother Qi is back.

140
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,930
Qi is back.

141
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,920
Qi!

142
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,190
Qi!

143
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,910
Over here!

144
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,510
Qi, here!

145
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:18,970
Qi!

146
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,690
Here!

147
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,150
Qi!

148
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,130
It's really Qi.

149
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,110
It's Qi.

150
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,370
He's back.

151
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,130
Qi.

152
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,560
Qi!

153
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,850
He's back. Qi is back.

154
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,770
Qi!

155
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,250
Here!

156
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,130
Here!

157
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,590
Qi!

158
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,530
Qi!

159
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,890
-Qi!
-Qi!

160
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,780
Brother Qi!

161
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:49,510
Here!

162
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,050
Qi!

163
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:50,790
Here!

164
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:51,330
Qi!

165
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,010
We're here!

166
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,070
Qi!

167
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,790
Qi, here!

168
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,230
Qi!

169
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:58,870
Qi!

170
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,550
So this is the Qilin Armor.

171
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,800
Brother Qi is so handsome.

172
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,590
Qi!

173
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,270
Qi!

174
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,730
Qi!

175
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,010
Qi!

176
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,160
Qi is back.

177
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,730
Qi!

178
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,560
It's Qi.

179
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,210
High Priest, look!

180
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,000
There are so many of them.

181
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,180
Brother Qi!

182
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,430
Their armor is so cool.

183
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,810
Brother Qi is so handsome,

184
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,760
Sister Nian.

185
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,750
He's coming.

186
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,700
Uncle, have some candies.

187
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,820
What's going on?

188
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,250
High Priest,

189
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,210
what's going on?

190
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,650
Jiuye, come back!

191
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,690
They even killed kids!

192
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,150
-Jiuye!
-Jiuye!

193
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,670
Jiuye.

194
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,370
Jiuye!

195
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,030
Jiuye!

196
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,390
Jiuye!

197
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,290
Jiuye!

198
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,110
They're bad guys!

199
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,540
All men, attack!

200
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,770
High Priest, be careful!

201
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,500
High Priest!

202
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:54,980
Attack!

203
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,140
Sister,

204
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,830
I'm fine.

205
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:14,590
I just tripped.

206
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,970
I'm a warrior.

207
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,140
Jiuye!

208
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,450
Let's go!

209
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,050
Nian!

210
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,130
Let's go now!

211
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:24,780
Let's go!

212
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,530
Let's go now!

213
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,680
Jiuye.

214
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,120
Jiuye.

215
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,330
Nian.

216
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,140
Jiuye!

217
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:32,900
Let's go now!

218
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,220
After them!

219
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,020
-Yes!
-Yes!
