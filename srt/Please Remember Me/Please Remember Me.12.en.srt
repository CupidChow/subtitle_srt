00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,050
[Please Remember Me: Episode 12]

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:15,720
Xiaoman.

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,980
Doctor.

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,950
Why hasn't she woken up yet?

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,810
General,

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,150
she fainted from pain.

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,690
Firethorn Pills can make people suffer from pain that's like bone corrosion.

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,460
Ordinary people

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,100
can't bear this kind of pain.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,450
Who hurt her

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,400
so cruelly?

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,080
Everyone, don't worry.

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,540
I'll make a prescription.

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,910
She will be fine.

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,120
Thank you, sir.

16
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,660
Thank you.

17
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,230
Sir, please follow me.

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,660
Xiaoman.

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,670
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,020
How is she?

21
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,700
Your prescription was delivered in time.

22
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,230
There's no danger of death.

23
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,640
But her body will be in pain for a few days.

24
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,910
I can't let her mess around anymore.

25
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,120
I have to take her away

26
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,250
after the Dongzhi Festival.

27
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:27,700
What is this?

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,229
It's the Dongzhi Festival now.

29
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:34,890
I'll make you guys pay the price with your blood!

30
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,380
Don't kill them, Qi.

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,190
Don't kill them!

32
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:46,880
Xiaoman.

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,500
Xiaoman, you're awake.

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:49,960
Come on.

35
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,340
Xiaoman.

36
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:53,800
It hurts.

37
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,430
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,670
Get up first.

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,670
Come on.

40
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,630
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,960
It won't hurt anymore after you take the medicine.

42
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,530
Come on.

43
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,510
I'm fine.

44
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,630
I can do it myself.

45
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,420
I'm fine.

46
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,060
Come on.

47
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,310
Let me do it.

48
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,420
Your hands might hurt.

49
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,829
It's okay.

50
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,110
I'm not afraid of pain.

51
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,110
Is it still hot?

52
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,400
Are you feeling better now?

53
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,560
Do you still remember who abducted you yesterday?

54
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,680
I don't remember.

55
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,079
But I only remember that before someone made me pass out,

56
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,390
I scratched and hurt

57
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,120
a man's face.

58
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,440
What a bastard.

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,600
Don't go out alone again.

60
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,500
It's very bitter, isn't it?

61
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,090
You're so worried about me.

62
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,600
Are you afraid that I'll go out to meet someone again?

63
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,820
Or are you afraid that after I'm killed,

64
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,360
you won't be able to remember

65
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,940
the person in your memories anymore?

66
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,450
You're talking so harshly.

67
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,210
Have a a piece of candy.

68
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,480
I...

69
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,560
I'm not talking harshly.

70
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,090
I really want to know the answer.

71
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,710
I'm not afraid that you'll meet someone.

72
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,020
Nor am I afriad that

73
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,050
I won't be able to find my memories.

74
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,210
I'm just afraid that I'll never see you again.

75
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,580
I'm afraid that I won't be able to find you.

76
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,430
I'm even afraid that if I can't see you,

77
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,890
I may do something stupid.

78
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,500
Do you understand?

79
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,810
Go!

80
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,790
Go over there!

81
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,870
Go inside!

82
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,550
Tell me!

83
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,040
Who is your boss?

84
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,720
Our boss took this job.

85
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,210
We just did the task after taking the money.

86
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,250
We know nothing.

87
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,690
Don't waste your energy.

88
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,370
You can either kill me

89
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,409
or let me go!

90
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,810
Tell me the truth if you don't want to die.

91
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,610
Where did you get the Firethorn?

92
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,659
That girl is still alive, right?

93
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,600
She's in great pain, but she hasn't died yet.

94
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,550
It means that

95
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,770
she's a member of the Ji Clan, right?

96
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,050
Get out.

97
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,790
Don't let anyone come inside.

98
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,280
Yes.

99
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,300
A deviation of two fingers' width.

100
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,010
It's an inch away from your heart.

101
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,190
General, you don't believe that

102
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,090
you killed Sushui yourself, do you?

103
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:31,880
Now,

104
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,490
you've exposed your bloodthirsty nature, haven't you?

105
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,550
Who asked you to hurt her?

106
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,810
I don't know!

107
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,440
Will you tell me or not?

108
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:48,780
Just kill me!

109
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,290
Otherwise, when I get out,

110
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,390
I'll still complete my mission.

111
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,310
She won't be able to survive.

112
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,030
I've heard that you made

113
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,070
a scene again in the city yesterday.

114
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,250
Poisons are circulated privately in the Lin State.

115
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,290
My Lord, you had better investigate the case carefully.

116
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,470
My younger brother is really

117
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,130
making more and more efforts to shield your lover.

118
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,920
I'm not trying to shield my lover.

119
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,220
As long as someone from the Lin State is tortured by Firethorn Pills,

120
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,250
I'll also try to protect him.

121
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,980
What if he's not from the Lin State but the Ji Clan?

122
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,380
Ji people are under the jurisdiction of the Feilian Troop.

123
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,690
If there are really Ji people,

124
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,850
I'll deal with it according to the actual situation.

125
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,659
You still know that this is the mission of the Feilian Troop?

126
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,990
Remember what you said.

127
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,930
Next time,

128
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,530
I won't turn a blind eye again.

129
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,320
He is my enemy.

130
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,630
How can I fall in love with him?

131
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,620
What Chang Yuan said is right.

132
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,930
I have to leave here.

133
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,100
Members of the Feilian Troop can't get married or have children,

134
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,020
and they have no fiefdoms or titles of nobility.

135
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,680
It's all because of Ji people.

136
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,080
You have to firmly remember your own identity.

137
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,159
If you show mercy to Ji people again,

138
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,430
I won't turn a blind eye again.

139
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,180
Yes.

140
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,490
I've fallen in love with you.

141
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,460
Whether you're a member of the Ji Clan or not,

142
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,260
and whether I'm a general or not,

143
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,830
if I really slaughter all the people of your clan,

144
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,160
I'll definitely give you an explanation.

145
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,300
But I have to find my memories and the truth

146
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,580
and take up responsibilities for you, my past

147
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,870
and all the future that starts from this moment.

148
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,600
You can do these things in the clinic.

149
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,130
Why are you doing them here?

150
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,140
In this way, His Highness can use it sooner.

151
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,120
Do you care about that?

152
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,780
Actually...

153
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,490
I want to spend more time with you.

154
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,890
Your Grace.

155
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,780
Since we've met again after a long separation,

156
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,610
why are you so cold to me?

157
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
If I had known it would be so hurtful,

158
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,710
I would rather that I had not got to know you back then.

159
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,130
I understand it.

160
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,690
Even though we've met again after a long separation,

161
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,020
there's nothing about the past which we can talk about, right?

162
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,800
Your purpose was to get Bixi in exchange.

163
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,510
Everyone knows that I married into this family

164
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,650
for the sake of Bixi.

165
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,730
Your Grace.

166
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,340
You misunderstood it.

167
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,120
I've never thought about

168
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,140
using you.

169
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,010
That's good.

170
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,420
Cai...

171
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,410
It's so lively during the Dongzhi Festival?

172
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,140
Yes.

173
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,060
That means the autumn is over,

174
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,020
and the winter officially begins.

175
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,690
The Five States have always valued this festival very much.

176
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,770
According to the tradition,

177
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,480
His Lordship won't discuss political affairs with officials.

178
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,650
All departments will be on leave.

179
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,900
Then why does the general still need to be on duty?

180
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,630
That's because the general...

181
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,620
I'm on duty in the morning.

182
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,910
There are other colleagues on duty in the afternoon and in the evening.

183
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,440
Are you feeling better now?

184
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,130
It's very lively outside today.

185
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,840
Do you want to go out for a walk around the street?

186
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,640
Sure.

187
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,630
Put it on.

188
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,340
I feel so hot.

189
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,460
Look. Is there anyone who wears more clothes than me on this street?

190
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,700
If you want to go back,

191
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,190
then let's just go back.

192
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,030
I'll wear it.

193
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,020
These kerchiefs look quite nice.

194
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,290
Why don't we buy several kerchiefs so that you can fold them into rats?

195
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,080
Sure.

196
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,760
It'll be the Year of Pig next year.

197
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,220
You need to learn how to fold paper into pigs.

198
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,710
You can't choose which ones you like?

199
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:34,740
Sir.

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,090
Send all these kerchiefs to the General's Mansion.

201
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:37,570
Okay.

202
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,250
I'll wrap them up for you right away.

203
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,540
Others... Others still need to buy them.

204
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,730
This is not appropriate, is it?

205
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,000
Who cares about others?

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,440
As long as you're happy, it'll be fine.

207
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:47,990
Let's go.

208
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,290
Well...

209
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:52,820
Sir.

210
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,780
We're buying them on credit.

211
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,680
The general's salary is deducted again as a punishment?

212
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,210
Don't tell anyone about it.

213
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,940
Brother! Brother!

214
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
Wait for me!

215
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,340
Are you okay?

216
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,650
I'm fine.

217
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,570
Be careful.

218
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,850
There are many people on the street.

219
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,020
Don't let others bump into you.

220
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,020
I've recovered.

221
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,640
As for that boy just now,

222
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,490
I can fight with eight people like him by myself.

223
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,550
I don't believe it.

224
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,410
If you can prise my fingers of this hand apart,

225
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,530
I'll believe you.

226
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,330
Are you looking down on me?

227
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,560
I'm suddenly a bit hungry.

228
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,840
Then let's go to the area ahead.

229
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,000
There's some delicious ahead.

230
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,800
Where is it?

231
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,030
I'm so hungry.

232
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,220
I didn't use much strength.

233
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,330
Thank you, General.

234
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,260
I'm hungry, too.

235
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,470
It's delicious.

236
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,330
Well, General...

237
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,390
General! General!

238
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,410
Taste it now.

239
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,050
The wontons in this restaurant are very delicious.

240
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,080
I think Xiaoshu is hungry, too.

241
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,890
He's full now.

242
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,900
After the Dongzhi Festival,

243
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,900
I'll ask Dashu

244
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,780
to build more heaters at home.

245
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,500
The weather is cold this year.

246
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,960
In this way, you and Aunt Qiu can feel warmer.

247
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,010
Come on.

248
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,290
You said you were hungry just now.

249
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:22,980
Eat more.

250
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:26,900
General.

251
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,140
Stop talking and eat first.

252
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,400
You're hungry, aren't you?

253
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,910
Thank you for taking care of me during this period.

254
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,870
What do you mean?

255
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,070
I've been

256
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,180
disturbing you in the General's Mansion for a long time.

257
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,310
After the festival,

258
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,200
it'll be time for me to leave.

259
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,740
Who said that you disturbed me?

260
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,980
Have you heard any rumors?

261
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,220
I don't think of you as a substitute.

262
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,110
General, you misunderstood it.

263
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,230
Everyone in the General's Mansion treats me very well

264
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,160
just like family.

265
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,590
Then why do you still want to leave?

266
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,390
It's just that

267
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,200
I miss my own home.

268
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,450
I wonder if you still remember

269
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,250
the third agreement between us.

270
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,520
Yes, I remember it.

271
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,600
General, please return Ji people's Bixi to me.
