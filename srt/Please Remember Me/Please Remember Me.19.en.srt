[Please Remember Me
Episode 19]

2
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,370
Brother Trash.

3
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,700
Brother Trash, why are you sleeping here?

4
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,470
Not Trash.

5
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,460
It's Qi.

6
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,680
Why are you still up?

7
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,370
It's late.

8
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,370
Tomorrow is my dressing ceremony.

9
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,430
I can't sleep.

10
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,350
So I came to you...

11
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,480
Dressing ceremony?

12
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,579
What is a dressing ceremony?

13
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,579
The 12th birthday.

14
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,860
After that, I'll be an adult in Sushui.

15
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,600
I'm nervous.

16
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,550
You're nervous?

17
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,520
Brother Qi, tell me a story.

18
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,690
Stop it. Since it's your birthday,

19
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,070
I'll give you a gift tomorrow.

20
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,020
Great! Brother Trash is a good guy.

21
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,579
What gift will you give me tomorrow?

22
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,140
You'll know tomorrow.

23
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,380
Let's go to bed.

24
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,320
I'd like to see what gift you'll give him tomorrow.

25
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,610
[Nian's Home]

26
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,760
What are you doing?

27
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,930
I want to make a suit of armor for Jiuye and the others as a gift.

28
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,630
Armor?

29
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,579
What's the use of armor?

30
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,790
All adult men in my hometown

31
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,370
have their own armor.

32
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,640
This is mine. It's called the Qilin Armor.

33
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,120
Why do you wear armor?

34
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,860
To fight and kill enemies?

35
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,530
We don't wear armor to fight

36
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,130
or kill,

37
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,500
but to defend.

38
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,290
To protect the people we love

39
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,670
and the pure land around us.

40
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,230
Sounds impressive.

41
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,430
Unfortunately, I can't see it.

42
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,200
I will let you see it.

43
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,510
It's a deal.

44
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,090
Deal.

45
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,060
Soldiers, you'll be Sushui's warriors from now on.

46
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,820
It's your duty to protect Sushui.

47
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,700
Can you do it?

48
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,830
Yes!

49
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,220
Ready to fight.

50
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,720
Feng, practice on your own.

51
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,200
Okay.

52
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,300
Come on, the first move.

53
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,100
Nian.

54
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,420
Nian.

55
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,970
Are you still mad at me?

56
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,060
Grandma told me

57
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,560
she knew this day would come long ago.

58
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,560
Even though it's not you, it'll be someone else.

59
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,060
What a pity.

60
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,110
If only I were the one with the totem.

61
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,230
Let me take you somewhere.

62
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,580
Why did you bring me back here?

63
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,380
This is where you hung me, right?

64
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,440
Grandma told me

65
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,180
we should be friendly to water guests.

66
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,980
These are all my treasures here.

67
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,760
They're all from the shore.

68
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,460
Treasures?

69
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,690
Quite a lot.

70
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,880
But why did you pick everything?

71
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,230
These are just offerings at the River God Ceremony

72
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,610
and... trash that ordinary families don't want.

73
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,460
How could they be trash?

74
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,630
These are all my treasures.

75
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,740
What's the River God Ceremony you just mentioned?

76
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,900
It's...

77
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,390
It's a festival to offer sacrifices to the River God.

78
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,920
They pray for good weather.

79
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,100
The customs in different states

80
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,330
are slightly different.

81
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,250
In Lin State, we throw sacrifices into the river.

82
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,100
Offer sacrifices to the River God?

83
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,150
Well, if that's the case,

84
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,930
we would be celebrating the festival every day.

85
00:06:59,010 --> 00:06:59,680
Every day?

86
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,610
We pray for everyone

87
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,110
and everyone in the world every day.

88
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,640
This is the trash I picked

89
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,590
with you from the river that day.

90
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,770
It can be opened?

91
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,440
This bamboo tube is from Liang State.

92
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,310
In Liang State,

93
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,450
they would put their wishes

94
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,480
or secrets into a bamboo tube

95
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,460
and throw it into the river

96
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,590
to beg for the River God's protection.

97
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Then you're peeping at someone else's secret, right?

98
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,470
Take a look.

99
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,230
They don't know anyway.

100
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,780
Although we made a promise,

101
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,250
it's hard to deliver a letter to you.

102
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,550
I can only tell the River God

103
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,880
about my lovesickness.

104
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,710
Written by Chang Yuan.

105
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,640
-An affectionate man.
-Chang Yuan?

106
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,350
Don't tell me you know him.

107
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,660
You really know him?

108
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,410
Yuan is our high priest's son.

109
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,040
His wish is to find another home on the shore

110
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,530
for all the clansmen.

111
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,470
Two months ago,

112
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,040
he secretly left Sushui.

113
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,100
This jerk. He messed with a girl so soon.

114
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,970
Why did he mess with her since he's so sharp-tongued?

115
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,100
Maybe... he really met the right person.

116
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,960
Nian,

117
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,559
when you meet the right person,

118
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,250
you can also try it.

119
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:46,970
Me?

120
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,380
My wish

121
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,470
is that all our clansmen

122
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,800
can live safely.

123
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,250
Do you have any wish?

124
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,730
My wish

125
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,420
is to take you back to the shore

126
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,410
to go shopping with you,

127
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,290
play on the swings with you,

128
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,620
and take you to my mansion to celebrate the Dongzhi Festival and eat dumplings.

129
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,320
Also,

130
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,070
I wish I could become the person with the totem.

131
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,230
What are the Dongzhi Festival

132
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,720
and dumplings you just mentioned?

133
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,050
The Dongzhi Festival is a festival in my hometown.

134
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,980
It'll be winter after the Dongzhi Festival.

135
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,530
Every year in winter,

136
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,400
we would eat dumplings.

137
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,030
Lovers who eat dumplings with special stuffing

138
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,470
will be blessed

139
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,310
and be together forever.

140
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,860
Grandma!

141
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,130
Grandma!

142
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,250
Grandma.

143
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,370
Grandma.

144
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,480
Grandma!

145
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,350
Grandma.

146
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,040
Grandma.

147
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,170
Grandma, you can't die.

148
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,880
Can you hear me, Grandma?

149
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,320
Get up and scold me.

150
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,650
Grandma.

151
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,140
Chief... is on her deathbed.

152
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,480
Grandma.

153
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,680
Didn't you say...

154
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,370
say that there was a good sign?

155
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,710
That was the terminal lucidity.

156
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,820
I want Grandma.

157
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,380
Do something.

158
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,360
Please.

159
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,000
Please.

160
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,050
The Xiantang tree is an ancient divine tree.

161
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,510
Its fruits can extend people's lives.

162
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,270
But there are Water Fireflies and barriers.

163
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,340
We can't get close.

164
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,030
I'll go.

165
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,930
This happened because of me.

166
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,170
No matter what,

167
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,310
I should go.

168
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,140
Grandma.

169
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,810
Take this.

170
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,180
This is...

171
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,320
This is Bixi.

172
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,850
It can relieve the harm of Water Fireflies' fury fire to you.

173
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,660
Remember,

174
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,180
don't enter the illusion again.

175
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,470
Bixi?

176
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,980
This is the Bixi my brother asked me to take back.

177
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,050
They just gave it to me like this?

178
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,550
Brother Qi.

179
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,240
The Heartless Bell.

180
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,340
It's exclusive to Ji people.

181
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,290
We will be family from now on.

182
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,760
We'll give you strength together.

183
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,430
We'll share joy and sorrow.

184
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,830
We'll share weal and woe.

185
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,030
Qi,

186
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,150
you must come back safely.

187
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,610
I will come back safely.

188
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,250
Hmm.

189
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,070
Trust me.

190
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,300
Zisu,

191
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,240
you're back.
