[Please Remember Me: Episode 30]

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,470
[River God Temple]

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,830
Let the bride and groom drink the Wedding Wine together.

4
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,230
You're cheating me?

5
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,410
I asked Xiaoshu to make you stay in the General's Mansion,

6
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,360
and I used the Dream Divination Technique to enter your dream

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,220
so that I could say goodbye to you.

8
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,960
You're still cheating me at this time?

9
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:12,930
Xiaoman!

10
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,180
Xiaoman!

11
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,120
Xiaoman!

12
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,690
Xiaoman!

13
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,860
Xiaoman!

14
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:26,990
Xiaoman!

15
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,910
Xiaoman!

16
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,190
I'll also finish our wedding alone.

17
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,780
You have me in your dream,

18
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,910
and I have you in my heart.

19
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,020
It's kind of a happy ending.

20
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,430
Of course,

21
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,810
I still need to seek justice for something.

22
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,560
So far,

23
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,760
except for being unable to be with you for the rest of my life,

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,190
I've... had no regrets.

25
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,230
I've heard that today is the wedding day of that witch

26
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,290
from the Ji Clan and the hero who slaughtered Ji People.

27
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,810
I've specially brought some people from the Lin State

28
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,180
to attend the wedding.

29
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,400
How come the groom is not here?

30
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,090
Has he escaped from the wedding

31
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,370
or divorced you?

32
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:41,430
You're quite good at joking, Crown Prince Cui.

33
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,060
I just want to take advantage of the wedding

34
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,490
between the General of the Feilian Troop and me

35
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,690
to tell everyone that

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,670
we Ji people are the same as ordinary people.

37
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,870
Yes.

38
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,850
That's right.

39
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,060
We're

40
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,990
not the Ji demons you mentioned.

41
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,090
Shut up!

42
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,720
My purpose of coming here today is not to listen to you telling stories.

43
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,440
Give Bixi to me now!

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,710
[River God Temple]

45
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,730
Stop!

46
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,920
Your Highness, how domineering you are.

47
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,090
What do you mean, State Governor?

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,530
Your Highness, maybe you have forgotten that

49
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,100
this is the Lin State.

50
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,940
Everything here is the domestic affair of our Lin State.

51
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,200
Outsiders are not allowed to interfere.

52
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Did you hear that?

53
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,560
Your State Governor

54
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,290
dares to disobey me for a person from the Ji Tribe?

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,750
When you guys become Ji demons,

56
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,620
you'll also get that incurable disease.

57
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,200
All of this is just a rumor.

58
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,740
What?

59
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,310
For over a hundred years, there have been some troublemakers spreading rumors

60
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,960
in order to get Bixi.

61
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,670
Because of that, Ji people have been wandering around

62
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,000
and have been homeless.

63
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,800
Zisu once led his troops to attack Sushui,

64
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,190
but he was rescued by Ji people.

65
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:46,250
When he came back, he wanted to testify for Ji people. I was the one who confined him,

66
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,490
and I slaughtered the people in Sushui in the name of Zisu.

67
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,409
Ji people are innocent.

68
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,610
I...

69
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,640
am the sinner.

70
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,080
You are a sinner?

71
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,420
You're talking nonsense!

72
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,210
We Ji people are not scary.

73
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,710
That's right. Ji people are not scary.

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,770
My wife is a member of the Ji Clan.

75
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,430
We don't want to hide anymore.

76
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,580
We don't want to hide anymore!

77
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,860
We don't want to hide anymore!

78
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,270
That's right! We don't want to hide anymore!

79
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,750
We don't want to hide anymore!

80
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,590
How dare you!

81
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,450
How dare you!

82
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,580
We don't want to hide anymore!

83
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,380
How dare you!

84
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,620
Kill them! Kill them all!

85
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,960
Kill them!

86
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,060
Wait!

87
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,210
What you want is Bixi.

88
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,510
Why do you have to hurt these ordinary people?

89
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,330
I can just give Bixi to you now.

90
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,360
Okay.

91
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,860
Give it to me now.

92
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,000
Give it to me!

93
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,440
Bixi.

94
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,790
Bixi!

95
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,110
Bixi!

96
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,530
Bixi!

97
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,360
Bixi!

98
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,540
Now that I have Bixi,

99
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,180
I'll see who will still dare to

100
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,310
look down on me in the five continents!

101
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,070
Look!

102
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,230
What's going on?

103
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,960
I don't know.

104
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,950
I've never seen this before.

105
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,299
Xiaoman!

106
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,780
Xiaoman!

107
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
It's the general.

108
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,160
Well...

109
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,730
Xiaoman.

110
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,080
I'm sorry.

111
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,080
I'm sorry that I'm late.

112
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,670
Why are you here, General?

113
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,190
I won't leave you behind.

114
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,330
I'll take you away now.

115
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,070
Okay?

116
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:20,730
Let's go.

117
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,740
Zisu.

118
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,330
Don't forget the agreement between us.

119
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,300
We've finished making the kite, too.

120
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,660
General, you're back.

121
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,390
The general is back!

122
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,110
General, you're back.

123
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,610
Look. This is a small wooden sword I made for Guyu.

124
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,390
General, you're back.

125
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,340
It's time to eat.

126
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,460
Little Guyu.

127
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,790
How about drawing a picture of this?

128
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,480
What are you doing?

129
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,720
Let me hug you.

130
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,950
Your father is back.

131
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:29,830
Father.

132
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,780
I'm back.

133
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,550
Look. Little Guyu drew this picture.

134
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,140
Isn't she much better than that brat?

135
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,290
I don't know where he went after getting scolded.

136
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,240
You drew the picture so well.

137
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,240
It's cold outside. Let's go inside.

138
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,930
Let's have dinner! It's time to eat!

139
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:42,910
Little Guyu, what do you

140
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,910
want to eat today?

141
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,270
Let's ask Aunt Qiu what we'll eat today.

142
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,090
Little Fried Dough Twists.

143
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,620
Little Fried Dough Twists.

144
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,000
Sir, you've been sitting here for more than half a day.

145
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,930
Why haven't you written anything?

146
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,500
There are countless painters in the world.

147
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,160
But they still can't portray the sadness in my heart.

148
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,850
Boatman, I don't know how to start

149
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,990
writing the story of Sushui.

150
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,910
Then just start with regrets.

151
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:53,840
[Xiao Zisu never got married, just because there was a beautiful woman called Xiaoman in his dream.]

152
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:53,840
[Sushui is a river at the border of the Lin State. Rumor has it that Meng Po once cried here and forgot about the River God.]

153
00:11:53,860 --> 00:12:10,130
[Because he knew that he had forgotten a very important person. He never wished for eternity. He only wished to be with Xiaoman.]

154
00:11:53,860 --> 00:12:10,130
[Everyone laughed at him for being obsessive and crazy. He didn't care. On the Grain Buds Day every year, he would come to Sushui to cross the river by ferry.]

155
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:19,070
[Please Remember Me]
