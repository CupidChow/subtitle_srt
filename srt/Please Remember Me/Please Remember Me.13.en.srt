[Please Remember Me
Episode 13]

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,550
Dashu.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,190
There are red beans in this dish.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:12,860
Which dish?

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,790
This one.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,820
When the time comes,

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,140
make sure the General and the young lady eat from this dish.

8
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,320
They'll definitely get the good fortune.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:19,960
Got it.

10
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,310
It means they'll be a perfect match.

11
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:21,840
Exactly.

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,560
Leave it to me.

13
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,860
I won't mess it up.

14
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:25,440
General.

15
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,170
Please don't tell them that I'm leaving today.

16
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,260
Let's not spoil the holiday.

17
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,670
Let's celebrate happily first.

18
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,880
Aunt Qiu, Dashu.

19
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,180
You're back!

20
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,980
We've come to help!

21
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,770
It's fine as long as you don't make things worse.

22
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,200
No need to help.

23
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,870
General, please return the Bixi of the Ji people to me.

24
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,530
I can't return the Bixi to you,

25
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,210
but I can guarantee

26
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,360
that your people will leave safely.

27
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,000
You, fan the fan.

28
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,660
Let me do it.

29
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,900
All you can do is fan.

30
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,880
What's wrong, Xiaoshu?

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,080
Aunt Qiu.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,570
Xiao...

33
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,850
Xiaoman...

34
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,039
He just got scolded by the General on the way here.

35
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,800
This kid...

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,930
Yes.

37
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,440
You got scolded by the General?

38
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:31,910
It's nothing.

39
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,170
I'll avenge you later.

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,759
Avenge? You shouldn't say anything if the General was right.

41
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:38,020
Put that down.

42
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,720
It's cold outside. Let's go inside first.

43
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,160
Yes.

44
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,090
Let's go inside.

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,250
Let's go inside.

46
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,110
Be careful.

47
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,690
Let's go.

48
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,090
Here.

49
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:45,910
Xiaoshu.

50
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,130
Cook this plate of dumplings first.

51
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,039
Time to eat dumplings.

52
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,840
-Come on.
-Have some dumplings.

53
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,009
Fresh out of the pot!

54
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,810
This plate.

55
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,670
Smells so good.

56
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:58,789
Roast chicken.

57
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,970
Eat the dumplings first.

58
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,570
As the saying goes,

59
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,090
"If Dongzhi falls early, the winter will be cold enough to freeze cattle."

60
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,240
This year's Dongzhi Festival falls right at the start of winter.

61
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,590
If you keep washing your face

62
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,220
with well water like Xiaoshu,

63
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,990
your ears will freeze off.

64
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,740
What nonsense are you saying?

65
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,790
Xiaoshu.

66
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,390
You're the General's most considerate aide.

67
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,410
When you're outside in the future,

68
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,270
I'll have to ask you to take good care of the General.

69
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,910
What are you talking about?

70
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,510
Whether you're here or not, I'll always take care of the General.

71
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,500
Xiaoshu.

72
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,550
Xiaoshu.

73
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,020
What do you mean "whether you're here or not'?"

74
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,570
Exactly!

75
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,340
It's the holidays. Can't you say something nice?

76
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,170
Xiaoman.

77
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,120
General.

78
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,670
Eat the dumplings.

79
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,540
The dumplings for Dongzhi Festival has a hidden surprise inside.

80
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,180
Yes.

81
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,210
Whoever finds the surprise first

82
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,900
will be the one to get married!

83
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,680
Eat.

84
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,690
Go ahead and eat!

85
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,440
Eat.

86
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,530
Xiaoman, eat.

87
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,050
Eat.

88
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,770
Why isn't there any?

89
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,880
I don't think there's a mistake.

90
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,240
There is.

91
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,680
What's going on with you?

92
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,950
There are two extra in this bowl. So I put them in that dish.

93
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,170
How could you mess this up?

94
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:48,690
Seriously.

95
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,620
They were cooked up in the same pot.

96
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,410
It smells so good.

97
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,320
Alright.

98
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,790
There're more. Wait a moment.

99
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,950
Let's go.

100
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,360
Look at you.

101
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,670
General.

102
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,640
Have a drumstick.

103
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,730
Xiao... Xiaoman.

104
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,640
I'm sorry for what happened before.

105
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Here, take this roasted persimmon.

106
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,540
Don't forget us

107
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,240
when you see persimmons in the future.

108
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,570
Well done, Xiaoshu.

109
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,420
You've made progress.

110
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,080
You've learned how to apologize.

111
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,280
Not bad.

112
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,240
It's alright if you didn't get the surprise.

113
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,370
I'll give everyone a big surprise instead.

114
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,680
Here.

115
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,070
Xiaoman, this is for you.

116
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,400
General, this is yours.

117
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,650
The surprise is gone.

118
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,860
But let's have a drink.

119
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,100
Come on, cheers.

120
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,280
Cheers.

121
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,610
Come on.

122
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,880
Xiaoman.

123
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,420
General.

124
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,330
Xiaoman.

125
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:10,880
General.

126
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,760
Cheers!

127
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:22,900
General.

128
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:23,610
Xiaoman.

129
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,980
Let's eat.

130
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,530
Let's eat.

131
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,330
It's rare for everyone to gather together for the Dongzhi Festival.

132
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,030
Your Grace, where are you going?

133
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,909
His Lordship will be coming for dinner later.

134
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:37,550
I know.

135
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,610
I'm going out for a walk. You don't need to follow me.

136
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,460
Your Grace.

137
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,490
Chang Yuan is a coward.

138
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Do you want to be fooled by him again?

139
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,380
Last year during Dongzhi Festival,

140
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,580
we waited for him all night by the river.

141
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,890
Have you forgotten?

142
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,060
Once your heart is broken,

143
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,790
there's nothing left to fear.

144
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,210
As expected,

145
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,900
you still won't show up.

146
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,410
I don't even know what I'm waiting for anymore.

147
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,250
But if I didn't come,

148
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,630
I would never know the answer.

149
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,450
Caiyi.

150
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,730
When the Dongzhi Festival comes,

151
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,330
light a lantern by the river.

152
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,330
I will come and take you away

153
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,450
to a place where no one knows us,

154
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,640
and we'll live freely.

155
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,370
I'll wait for you. It's a promise.

156
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,960
On the night of the Dongzhi Festival,

157
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,090
I want to hear you play the tune I composed with the drums.

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,720
Let me see.

159
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,360
It's lively outside today.

160
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,750
I just heard someone beating a drum.

161
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:39,870
Beating a drum?

162
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,419
I'll go check it out.

163
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,809
You child.

164
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,770
New Year's blessings!

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,650
Welcoming prosperity and fortune!

166
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,490
General, you weren't home during last year's Dongzhi Festival, right?

167
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,600
I painted this "Plum Blossom Cold Dissipation" picture.

168
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,650
This year, it's your turn. General.

169
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,110
"Plum Blossom Cold Dissipation" picture?

170
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,900
It's a Dongzhi Festival custom.

171
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,830
Each day, you paint a plum blossom.

172
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,450
After 81 days,

173
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,050
spring will arrive.

174
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,250
It symbolizes stepping into spring

175
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,430
with good fortune.

176
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,160
General, come on.

177
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
Come on, General.

178
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,220
It's Xiaoman's first year at home.

179
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,300
How about

180
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,580
letting her paint this year?

181
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,600
I don't know how to paint.

182
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,920
Try it.

183
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,560
It's okay.

184
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:37,980
Try it.

185
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,920
Keep your wrist steady.

186
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,630
It's nice to have a young woman in the house.

187
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,280
Are you saying I'm too old now?

188
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,960
It's a festival.

189
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,470
Let's just enjoy it.

190
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,080
Protect His Lordship!

191
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,760
Xiaoman.

192
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,060
Can you

193
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,000
not...

194
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,550
General!

195
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,450
General.

196
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,680
The State Lord encountered

197
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,880
an attack by the Ji demons on the street.

198
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,830
Stay at home and don't go anywhere.

199
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,670
Head to the Feilian Troop now!

200
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,090
Yes.

201
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,020
Take His Lordship away. I'll cover the rear.

202
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,800
Zisu.

203
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,690
Be careful.

204
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,350
Xiao Zisu, you've arrived.

205
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,850
Thank you, General.

206
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,380
Let's go.

207
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,150
He's the missing Detective Qin.

208
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,890
They're all puppets, not Ji demons.

209
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,190
Focus on defense.

210
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,200
Don't kill them.

211
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:10,970
Yes.

212
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,510
False compassion.

213
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,520
Let's see how long you can hold out.

214
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,110
They won't tire, but our men will.

215
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,390
I need to find a countermeasure quickly.

216
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,500
What's going on?

217
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,120
I'm sorry, Chang Yuan.

218
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,750
I can't let you kill them.

219
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,880
Xiao Zisu.

220
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,720
I'm leaving.

221
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,620
This will be the last time I help you.

222
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,480
Take care.

223
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,620
General.

224
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,960
Should we capture her?

225
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,070
No need.

226
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,330
She's here to help us.
