00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,950
[Please Remember Me Episode 24]

2
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,550
Xiaoman.

3
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,470
Xiaoman!

4
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,360
Xiaoman!

5
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:32,920
Xiaoman!

6
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,480
Xiaoman!

7
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,150
Aunt Qiu.

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,260
Dashu!

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,440
I can't stay here anymore.

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,920
After I leave, you must keep it a secret for me.

11
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,320
Xiaoman.

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,320
Where are you going

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,760
like this?

14
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,820
Yeah.

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,390
Chang Yuan wants to take me to the Liang State Residence for a few days.

16
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,130
The Crown Prince Cui is still there.

17
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,260
If you go now, you'll be in danger.

18
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,640
If you think so,

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,069
the General will too.

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,440
Then it will be the safest place for me.

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,100
Chang Yuan has a way to keep the Crown Prince Cui from causing trouble.

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,539
Don't worry.

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,010
What are you doing?

24
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,150
Xiaoman.

25
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,050
We're sorry.

26
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,620
Xiaoman.

27
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,470
You must take good care of yourself.

28
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,310
The General's Mansion can't exist without you.

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,120
Xiaoshu, is the medicine ready?

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,090
Yes.

31
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:49,870
Here.

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,479
General.

33
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,450
General, it's time for the medicine.

34
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,550
Here, take the medicine.

35
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,660
Xiaoshu.

36
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,710
Come here.

37
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,170
Come here.

38
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,530
Why? What do you want?

39
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:46,730
Slow down.

40
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,230
Where have you been today?

41
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,600
Nothing special,

42
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,880
just the usual places.

43
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,780
The official residence, barracks, Sushui,

44
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,680
and that...

45
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,870
We also went to His Lordship's.

46
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,860
Today, His Lordship said that

47
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,650
the matter of finding a place for the Ji people

48
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,380
will be handled by the General.

49
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,330
Wait.

50
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,310
What's wrong?

51
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,440
General hasn’t recovered yet.

52
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,430
How does he already have tasks to do?

53
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,050
Let him do something.

54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,330
Look.

55
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,250
Since Xiaoman left,

56
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,100
the General has been like an empty shell.

57
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,650
Yes.

58
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:15,750
Well,

59
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,910
I wonder if it is right for us

60
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,360
to hide this from the General for Xiaoman.

61
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,800
Then, I'll go to the Residence

62
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,910
and bring Xiaoman back.

63
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,500
What?

64
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,230
That will alarm the Crown Prince.

65
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,110
Oh, right.

66
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,440
Don’t make trouble for the General.

67
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,670
Then what should we do?

68
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,600
I got it.

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,200
What?

70
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,990
I'm going to sneak up on the General

71
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,120
and give him a slash.

72
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,480
So we can tell her that the General is injured again,

73
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,010
and lure Xiaoman back here.

74
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,930
Are you crazy?

75
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,810
Don't...

76
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,840
General is in such condition.

77
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,080
How can he stand it?

78
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,780
You're right.

79
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,610
You are crazy.

80
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,930
You are saying no to this and that,

81
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,190
then what should we do?

82
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,260
I have an idea.

83
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:01,830
What is it?

84
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,850
I'll burn down the General's Mansion.

85
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,910
I don't believe that Xiaoman will disregard our lives.

86
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,150
-Don’t come up with random ideas.
-Don’t come up with random ideas.

87
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:09,660
I...

88
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,700
What should we do?

89
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:43,900
Hey.

90
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,909
General.

91
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,000
General. General.

92
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,240
Where are you going?

93
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,540
General, wait for me.

94
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,650
This is the medicine from Chang Yuan.

95
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,470
Thank you.

96
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,870
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

97
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,750
It's okay. He treated Cui Ya's eyes,

98
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,090
so just think of this as an exchange.

99
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,230
Also, Cui Ya lives far away.

100
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,590
He doesn't know you're here. Don't worry.

101
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,030
Slow down.

102
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,360
You paid a high price to save Zisu,

103
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,540
is it worth it?

104
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:46,970
Yes.

105
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,240
Whether it's worth it or not,

106
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,040
it is something only considered when meeting someone unworthy.

107
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,830
If you meet someone worth it,

108
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,660
you can't weigh it in advance.

109
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,070
It seems your bond goes beyond just Lin State.

110
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,200
and there are also other stories.

111
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,550
I really envy you for having such a passionate love.

112
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,630
I've always been curious about

113
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,510
how you met Chang Yuan.

114
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,720
Liang State is the leading state among the five continents.

115
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,450
As the princess of Liang State,

116
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,360
forming an alliance through marriage with other states

117
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,620
has become my destiny.

118
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,910
Hey.

119
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,750
Do you want to die?

120
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,030
You...

121
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,750
You should think carefully before you jump.

122
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,250
You...

123
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,620
I just jumped into the water from here,

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,200
but I regretted it after I jumped.

125
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,020
There are man-eating fish

126
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,630
at the bottom of the water.

127
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,720
You're lying.

128
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,870
We, Ji people, never lie.

129
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,840
Ji...

130
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,470
What's wrong with Ji people?

131
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,270
Hey.

132
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,580
I did come up from the water here.

133
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,730
I know better than you

134
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,860
what's in the water.

135
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,890
There are not only man-eating fish in the water,

136
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,650
but also blood-sucking insects.

137
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,350
Think about it. With your beauty,

138
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,910
you could end up being torn to shreds.

139
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,680
You're lying.

140
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,430
Even so,

141
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,380
it's better than marrying an old man I don't know.

142
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,390
If you don't want to marry him, then don't.

143
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,100
In my hometown, women choose their husbands.

144
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,290
Women choose their husbands?

145
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,890
Yes.

146
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,270
Think about it. It's the women who bear the pain of reproducing.

147
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,930
So, she should be the one

148
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,090
to choose a man

149
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,310
who is willing to experience the pain of giving birth for her.

150
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,570
That makes more sense.

151
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,890
Why is that so different from what the books say?

152
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,680
The books?

153
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,300
Yes.

154
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,130
What else do the books say?

155
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,410
It doesn't matter.

156
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,370
Anyway,

157
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,030
I don't want to be a bargaining chip for my father to exchange land.

158
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,340
I'd rather just kill myself.

159
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:36,760
Wait.

160
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,690
What land

161
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,750
is so valuable?

162
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,530
It hurts.

163
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,550
Let me see.

164
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:47,320
Here.

165
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,580
What are you doing?

166
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:49,780
I'm a doctor.

167
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,740
Let go.

168
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,370
Trust me.

169
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,530
Hey, let go.

170
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,270
Here?

171
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,120
Yes.

172
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,730
How dare you touch the princess?

173
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,190
Prin...

174
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,570
Princess?

175
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,190
I-I'm saving her.

176
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,280
I'm saving your princess.

177
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,770
Do you save people by taking off their shoes?

178
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,090
I...

179
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,590
Princess.

180
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,310
Princess.

181
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,350
You finally remembered me.

182
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,840
Stay by my side as a guard.

183
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,060
Then I'll let you go.

184
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,170
Okay.

185
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,580
I have no other choice anyway.

186
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:02,970
It's a deal.

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,800
Okay.

188
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,140
The Lord of Bo State suddenly died.

189
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,140
The marriage was also cancelled.

190
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,390
Do you think the princess brings misfortune to her husband?

191
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,390
Definitely.

192
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,600
Since the princess began negotiating marriages,

193
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,130
things has never gone well.

194
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,150
Remember,

195
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,200
the princess's marriage proposals haven't gone well

196
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,360
because they are not capable of handling the princess's good fortune.

197
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,870
If I ever hear you

198
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,450
talking about the princess behind my back,

199
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,800
I'll cut off your tongue.

200
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,750
-You hear me?
-Yes. Yes. Yes.

201
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,330
We were all wrong.

202
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:31,680
Get lost!

203
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,480
We were wrong.

204
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,740
I don't even care,

205
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,810
so why do you care?

206
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,270
The princess is the finest woman in the world.

207
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,000
I won't allow them to say that.

208
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,890
Am I stupid?

209
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,580
Just because he said I was the finest,

210
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,050
I was moved.

211
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,550
Chang Yuan was telling the truth.

212
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,650
He's always been mean,

213
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,970
and nothing good ever comes out of his mouth.

214
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,630
What was he like before?

215
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,100
He has been very curious about the outside world since he was young.

216
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,990
He always hides in Grandma's study to read.

217
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,470
He said

218
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,400
the water guest he falls in love

219
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,930
must be the woman he loves the most.

220
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,640
He will dedicate all his effort

221
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,150
and his life to protecting

222
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,310
and loving her.

223
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,300
Princess, the General is here.

224
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,780
I'll check it out.

225
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,130
Princess, is Xiaoman with you?

226
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,170
General, you're asking a strange question.

227
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,250
You know her grudge with the Crown Prince.

228
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,580
How could she be with me?

229
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,330
Can I...

230
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,890
Do you still want to do this?

231
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,700
I'm going to be your sister-in-law soon.

232
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,240
Do you have to go this far?

233
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,620
You disregarded my reputation.

234
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,130
Do you want your brother and me

235
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,790
to become the laughingstock of the whole world?

236
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,570
I was thoughtless.

237
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,400
Sorry to bother you.

238
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,660
General, what are you...

239
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,180
Go back first.

240
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,190
I'll wait for her.

241
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,560
General.

242
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,970
If Xiaoman is not here,

243
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,280
you would have waited for nothing.

244
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,400
She must be here.

245
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,380
I can feel it.

246
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,720
