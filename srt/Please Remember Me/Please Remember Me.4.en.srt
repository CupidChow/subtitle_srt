[Please Remember Me
Episode 4]

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,410
General.

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,050
There is a bud again.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,630
The previous one has fallen.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,970
It's all thanks to her this time.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,970
She said the plant should get more sunlight.

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,480
She also used egg shells as fertilizer.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,880
I didn't believe her at first.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,560
Look, there really is a bud.

10
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,510
This...

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,400
What's wrong with her?

12
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,180
When General eats,

13
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,490
he likes to alternate bites between meat and vegetables.

14
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,140
He doesn't like too much meat on his plate,

15
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,360
especially fat.

16
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,240
General practices martial arts at 5 a.m. every day.

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,740
He's used to drinking a pot of hot tea first.

18
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,430
There's a problem with Dashu's legs.

19
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,320
I must go there as fast as I can when he calls me.

20
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,720
Aunt Qiu coughs a lot.

21
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,289
I should make pear water for her every day.

22
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,130
The small branches need sunlight and company.

23
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,460
You should get more sunlight usually.

24
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,789
And you should drink more water.

25
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:54,190
Only in this way can you have a bud.

26
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,370
It's a little sad,

27
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,310
just like General.

28
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,120
General...

29
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,950
Stop reading.

30
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,720
She actually can...

31
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:18,740
[The plan has changed. Get ready to leave the mansion.]

32
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,010
Poisonous wine. Poisonous wine.

33
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,020
What the people outside said is right.

34
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,710
Anyone who makes a mistake in General's Mansion

35
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,460
can only be carried out of the mansion.

36
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,990
What are you talking about?

37
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,580
Carried out of the mansion?

38
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,440
Nothing.

39
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,460
I just want to remember your face

40
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,370
so that I can repay you for saving me in the next life.

41
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,560
What?

42
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,870
Do you regret it?

43
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,430
No.

44
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,240
I want to ask you for another favor.

45
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,829
Go ahead.

46
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,320
I don't remember my past.

47
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,300
I don't know my name.

48
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,120
I hope you can give me a name,

49
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,290
so that it can...

50
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,630
be carved on the tablet in the future.

51
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,070
You also want a tablet?

52
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,380
What tablet?

53
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,160
What tablet?

54
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,550
What tablet?

55
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,019
Looks like I won't have a tablet.

56
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,670
Get up.

57
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,130
After drinking this cup of wine,

58
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,160
you'll be a member of General's Mansion.

59
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,920
From now on,

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,460
your name will be Xiaoman.

61
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,860
Xiaoman is a good name.

62
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,620
Xiaoman is a good name.

63
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,130
Come on, cheers.

64
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,030
Come on.

65
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,200
Nice.

66
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,700
Delicious.

67
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,760
Tasty.

68
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,420
Delicious.

69
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,650
Dashu.

70
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,320
This...

71
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,480
is for you.

72
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,190
I'll eat some too.

73
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:05,950
This...

74
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,380
Aunt likes this.

75
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,350
-Thank you, Xiaoman.
-The cup tipped over.

76
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,410
Xiaoman is so nice.

77
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,720
General, you should eat more.

78
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,050
Eat more vegetables so that you can be strong.

79
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,360
Here.

80
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,360
Well...

81
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,520
you eat first.

82
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,180
There are some other dishes in the kitchen.

83
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,040
I'm going to get them.

84
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,320
Thank you, Xiaoman.

85
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,670
Thank you, Xiaoman.

86
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,920
No big deal.

87
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,400
I want this.

88
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,740
What are you doing?

89
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,920
What are you doing, Aunt Qiu?

90
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,200
Xiaoman loves eating meat.

91
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,520
The meat is for her.

92
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,830
You guys just eat some vegetables.

93
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,840
They're nutritious.

94
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,040
Eat more vegetables.

95
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,100
Little Trash,

96
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,640
I'm counting on you this time.

97
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,500
Tell Chang Yuan

98
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,840
I managed to stay here

99
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,700
and I'll find a chance to meet him.

100
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,320
Xiao Zisu seems to have accepted me,

101
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
but in fact, he's wary of me in every aspect.

102
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,650
He's very scheming.

103
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,780
I should be careful when I use the dream divination technique on him.

104
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,250
You rest early too.

105
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,120
Done.

106
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,800
Take off your clothes and go to bed.

107
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,580
Take off your clothes and go to bed.

108
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,600
My elder brother doesn't allow me to interact with the Ji people.

109
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,200
He must be hiding something.

110
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,710
If Xiaoman really is one of the Ji people,

111
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,840
she would be my final hope of regaining my lost memories.

112
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,640
Take off your shoes and sleep.

113
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,510
Take off your shoes and sleep.

114
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,310
So that she can use the dream divination technique to help me.

115
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,500
But is she really one of the Ji people?

116
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,790
If she's not,

117
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
what should I do?

118
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,620
Why hasn't he taken off the other shoe?

119
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,470
Forget it.

120
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,240
I'll think about that tomorrow.

121
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,600
Looks like it worked.

122
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,400
He should be asleep now.

123
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,120
What are you doing?

124
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,920
Aren't you... going to rest with your eyes closed?

125
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,650
Why haven't you... slept at this hour?

126
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,260
I'm worried you'll catch a cold since it's too cold.

127
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,940
The weather is so cold, but you forgot to cover yourself with the quilt properly.

128
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,060
Rest early.

129
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,200
Stop!

130
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,070
Since you care so much about my daily life,

131
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,060
from tomorrow onwards,

132
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,780
you should live in the heated room.

133
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,000
Live in the heated room?

134
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,370
General's Mansion doesn't keep idle people.

135
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,570
Do you have a problem?

136
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,220
No.

137
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,780
General, rest early.

138
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,500
Looks like

139
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,980
my guess is right.

140
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,000
She is one of the Ji people.

141
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,130
[Fanglin Garden]

142
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,430
General, you're back.

143
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,300
Did anything strange happen in the mansion last night?

144
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:24,860
No.

145
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,170
She slept soundly last night.

146
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,820
Now... she's chopping firewood in the backyard.

147
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,950
Chopping firewood?

148
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,750
Brother,

149
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,740
why are you on her side now?

150
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,850
I'm telling the truth.

151
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,290
Xiaoshu,

152
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,500
don't always be paranoid like General.

153
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,820
Now you don't even care if I'm in front of you

154
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,610
when you speak ill of me, do you?

155
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,020
Oh no!

156
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,070
Is there a fire in the backyard?

157
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,300
It doesn't seem like a fire.

158
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,180
Could it be...

159
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,990
she's sending a signal?

160
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,020
Let's go!

161
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,540
Yes!

162
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,650
Are you done?

163
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,350
What are you doing?

164
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,380
General, I'm roasting persimmons.

165
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,020
What are you... doing?

166
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,620
General has stomach problems.

167
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,020
He can't eat persimmons.

168
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,450
Who asked you to make a fuss? Leave.

169
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,270
Let's go.

170
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,760
You just can't stay idle in the mansion.

171
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,460
This is...

172
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,640
It's boring to stay in the mansion all the time.

173
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,730
There are not many things to do.

174
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,640
I heard there is a temple fair here.

175
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,710
Why don't you take me there to have a look?

176
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,710
She's going to show her true colors.

177
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,550
Okay.

178
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,920
Really?

179
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,560
General, you're so nice.

180
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,280
Knead the dough.

181
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,890
Come on. Hurry.

182
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,760
Aunt Qiu.

183
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,660
Are there any of the steamed buns left from this morning?

184
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,390
I want to take some for General.

185
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,390
Otherwise, if he gets hungry on the way,

186
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,640
he won't have anything to eat.

187
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,750
Yes, I'll get you some.

188
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,680
Thank you, Aunt.

189
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,870
Since we have such a considerate girl like Xiaoman,

190
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,510
General's past hardships were not in vain.

191
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,400
He suffered hardships in the past?

192
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,330
General suffered a lot in the past.

193
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,230
Back then, Liang State's lord required each of the other four states

194
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,290
to send a hostage there to maintain balance among them.

195
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,720
Poor General.

196
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,680
He was sent there as a hostage

197
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,400
after his mother passed away.

198
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,040
But Crown Prince Cui

199
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,160
has been an evildoer since he was little.

200
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,510
He wanted to bully General,

201
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,760
but he was no match for General.

202
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,720
He often found excuses to starve General.

203
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,400
That's why General has stomach problems.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,370
Stomach problems?

205
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,320
Xiaoman!

206
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,560
What are you doing?

207
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,460
-Everyone is waiting for you. Hurry up.
-Coming.

208
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,080
Go.

209
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:05,810
Hurry.

210
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,690
Aunt Qiu, Dashu, I'm leaving.

211
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,500
Okay.

212
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,650
Why did you make General's past seem so miserable?

213
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,380
He was only a hostage for a year.

214
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,970
The atmosphere made me do that.

215
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,350
You don't understand.

216
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,550
Sounds like you understand.

217
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,650
General, what is that thing they're wearing on their heads?

218
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,090
This is called Willow Wearing.

219
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:35,850
It's for warding off evil spirits.

220
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,920
It means they're immune to ghosts.

221
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,850
Willow Wearing?

222
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,380
Guards.

223
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,420
If anyone suspicious talks to her later,

224
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,210
arrest that person.

225
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:50,870
-Yes.
-Yes.

226
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,200
General. Xiaoshu.

227
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,220
So fast?

228
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,680
Xiaoshu.

229
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,760
General, you make sure everyone here is safe and worry-free.

230
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,840
I hope you can be safe and worry-free.
