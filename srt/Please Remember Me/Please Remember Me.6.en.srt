[Please Remember Me Episode 6]

2
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:20,890
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,540
It seems that my self-centeredness and paranoia

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,290
made me forget my initial purpose of protecting the people,

5
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,820
which caused you to suffer.

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,180
From now on,

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,750
you can come and go freely in the General's Mansion.

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,880
I won't ask anymore.

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,220
Sorry.

10
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,390
You are busy with military affairs,

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,450
but I've caused you more trouble.

12
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,460
It's my fault.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,470
General, it's time.

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,220
I'll be right there.

15
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,060
Take a rest.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,000
General.

17
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,130
Be careful.

[Liang State Residence]

19
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,320
You losers!

20
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:17,920
Get lost!

21
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,300
All of you, get lost!

22
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,210
If my eyes can't be cured,

23
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,750
none of you will live.

24
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,470
Your Highness.

25
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,530
What are you doing? Do you want to die?

26
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,520
The State Lord is here.

27
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,390
State Lord.

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,530
Your Highness.

29
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,860
I've heard that recently there have been noises coming from the residence.

30
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,190
This is inappropriate.

31
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,690
Inappropriate?

32
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,190
Our Liang State is the leading province,

33
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,190
yet you can't even find the perpetrator who harmed me.

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,720
Doesn't that make our state's reputation

35
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,270
like a doormat,

36
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:57,220
where anyone can trample on it whenever they please?

37
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,330
Your Highness, please calm down.

38
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,790
For now, your recovery is the priority.

39
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,830
I'll give you an answer tomorrow.

40
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,010
Calm down.

41
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,470
Fine.

42
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:09,990
Fine.

43
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,400
You said it.

44
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,380
Choujia.

45
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,220
Yes.

Drink with me.

47
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:18,800
Yes.

48
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,630
This way.

49
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,520
If you don't give me an explanation,

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,380
I'll take my sister back anytime.

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,990
My Lord.

52
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,230
The Crown Prince has become a joke in Lin State,

53
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,520
and it's not a solution for you to cover for the General.

54
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,930
Is Zisu here?

55
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,130
No.

56
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,530
Okay.

57
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,190
General, nothing.

58
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:04,800
Search!

59
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,230
It's weird.

60
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,590
All the Ji people in the village are gone.

62
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,680
We've wasted our time.

63
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,900
Expand the search area

64
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,450
and continue searching.

65
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,090
Yes.

66
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,850
Expand the search area

67

Yes.

69
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,829
Under His Lordship's order,

70
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,500
I'm here to question the suspect.

71
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,870
[General's Mansion]

72
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,200
Wuchui.

73
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,010
Why does our General's Mansion

74
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,630
have so many problems?

75
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:50,660
Hasn't the matter with the Ji people already been resolved?

76
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:53,790
The case with the Ji people has been settled.

77
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,410
But the maid from the General's Mansion

78
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,210
is not on the list of maids at the River God Temple.

79
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,420
So we are taking her away for questioning.

80
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,020
It’s just about finding a scapegoat, isn’t it?

81
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,970
According to the laws in this state,

82
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,690
all areas under the jurisdiction of the Feilian Troop

83
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,000
have special privileges.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,660
Without General's permission,

85
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,120
no one is allowed to enter.

86
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,710
His Lordship has given an order

87
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,970
that the privileges of the Feilian Troop

88
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,970
are exclusive to the General alone.

89
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,589
If anyone else is guilty,

90
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,610
he shall be executed on the spot.

91
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,140
How dare you!

92
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,410
With me here,

93
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,590

96
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,050
Xiaoman, you can't go.

97
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,870
The State Lord's Huqi Troop is outside.

98
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,670

99

100
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,350
Let me go.

Xiaoman!

102
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,020
Wuchui.

103
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,280
How dare you bully a cripple?

104
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,190
If you dare,

105
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,820
break one of your legs before you fight me.

106
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,210
You haven't changed a bit over the years.

107
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,420
You're still so shameless.

108
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,540
Dashu.

109
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,060
Open the door!

110
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,600
Let me out!

111
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,790
Don't come out.

112
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,090
I'm here.

113
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,960
This brat doesn't dare to break into the General's Mansion.

114
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,940
Dashu, open the door.

115
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,950
I'm now a member of the General's Mansion.

116
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,260
I don't want to make things difficult for the General.

117
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,500
Let me out.

118
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,230

119
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,160
Come on.

120
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,510
I'm not afraid.

121
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,350
Dashu.

122
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,760
In this General's Mansion,

we don't need you to stand out.

124

Wuchui.

125
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,730
I’ll go with you to see His Lordship.

126
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,120
[The Lord's Mansion]

127

The nation's major affairs

128
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,170
are in rituals and military matters.

129
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,650
The rise and fall of the five continents are depend on nurturing the spirit.

130
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,520
The deities of the five continents are protected by the River God, Hebo.

131
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,240
This is a grand ceremony passed down through thousands of years.

132
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,230
It is not a place for you to mess around.

133
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,710
-What happened today...
-My Lord.

134
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,880
It was the Crown Prince of Liang State who

135
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,740
disrespected the gods and violated the laws first.

136
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,480
The Crown Prince, born into nobility,

137
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,570
remains unafraid and proud.

138
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,130
How can you compete with him?

139
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,450
Whether he is respectful or not

140
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,550
is up to God.

141
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,110
How can you judge?

142
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:37,650
That bitch...

143
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,110
Now you don't even regard my Huqi Troop with respect.

144
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,550
You are getting more and more outrageous.

145
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,180
My eyes...

146
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,820
People in the General's Mansion has been my loyal servants for years.

147
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,010
My Lord, the punishment

148
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,610
should be borne solely by me.

149
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,810
You?

150
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,330
You are taking the responsibility alone?

151
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,409
How?

152
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,250
Every year, the River God Ceremony

153
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,080
is managed by your Feilian Troop.

154
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,310
But so many troubles happened this year.

155
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,640
Go and ask what the people in the city said.

156
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,530
You should come up with

157
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,710
-a way to stop...
-Enough.

158
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,970
About my eyes

159
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,510
and that bitch...

160
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,200
You are not going to mention it?

161
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,700
What?

162
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,690
Are you toying with me?

163
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:22,910
Forget it.

164
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,610
Where are you?

165
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,810
And you, Xiao Xianchen.

166
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,900
Listen,

167
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,350
my sister hasn't married you yet.

168
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,640
As long as I'm unhappy,

169
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,950
I can bring her back anytime.

170
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,530
I'll ask my father to convict you.

171
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,470
It seems that both of you, the State Lord

172
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,250
and you, the young General,

173
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,409
have reached the end of your roles.

174
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,670
How dare the Crown Prince of Liang State act recklessly

175
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,400
and kill the innocent at the River God Ceremony?

176
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,260
If you really alarm King of Liang,

177
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,990
let's see how your father will punish you.

178
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,480
Zisu.

179
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,470
Don't be disrespectful to the Crown Prince.

180
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,680
Since you said you will bear all the punishment alone,

181
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,810
then you should accept whatever punishment is imposed.

182
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,880
Yes.

183
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,730
Fine.

184
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,360
Then you should proceed from the Wende Temple,

185
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,800
bowing and kneeling all the way to the River God Temple.

186
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,730
Yes.

187
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,560
That's it?

188
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,250
My Lord.

189
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:23,920
This...

190
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,340
This...

191
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,590
This...

192
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,890
That's it?

193
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,640
Are you spacing out?

194
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,790
The Huqi Troop has retreated.

195
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,650
Why hasn’t the General come back?

196
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,880
There shouldn't be

197
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,290
any danger, right?

198
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,830
Dashu!

199
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,170
Bad news!

200
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,700
What are you panicking about?

201
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,630
His Lordship...

202
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,340
His Lordship ordered the General to bow

203
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,200
from the Wende Temple all the way to the River God Temple.

204
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,400
Bowing and kneeling?

205
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,160
From the Wende Temple to the River God Temple outside the city

206
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,420
is a distance of over 20 miles.

207
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,000
That far?

208
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:26,770
Yeah.

209
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,640
For such a proud person as the General,

210
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,660
making him kneel down the street

211
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,460
would be worse than killing him.

212
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,900
Xiaoman

213
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,080
What?

214
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,920
Go after her.

215
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,510
I don't need you if I can go after her.

216
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,880
Isn't that General Xiao?

217
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,180
Why is he kneeling and bowing on the street?

218
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,080
I heard that he offended the Crown Prince of Liang State.

219
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,010
No, I heard that

220
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,840
General Xiao is covering for the Ji people.

221
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,070
How is that possible?

222
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,820
General Xiao is our Ji-slaying hero.

223
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,530
General.

224
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,530
How can he covering for the Ji people?

225
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,030
That's right.

226
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,460
General. General.

227
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,810
-Excuse me.
-General.

228
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,520
Excuse me.

229
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,680
General.

230
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,010
Stop!

231
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,570
General.

232
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,830
General.

233
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,720
General.

234
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,680
Why are you here?

235
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,100
Xiaoshu, bring her back.

236
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,890
Let's go, Xiaoman.

237
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,280
It's all my fault, General.

238
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,140
How could I possibly hide at home?

239
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,160
Tell everyone in the Feilian Troop to stay still.

240
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,670
No one is allowed to leave the barracks.

241
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,140
Yes.

242
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,830
And her.

243
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,680
If you can't bring her back,

244
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,100
be prepared to face punishment.

245
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,890
No, General.

246
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,300
Xiaoman, I'm sorry. Let's go.

247
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,800
General.

248
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:39,970
Let's go.

249
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,650
General!

250
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,770
General!

251
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,410
General!

252
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,820
He was punished so lightly.

253
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,630
He got lucky.

254
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,730
A man's knees are as valuable as gold,

255
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,390
let alone kneeling in public.

256
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,730
That's enough to humiliate him.

257
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,590
You think you're a member of the Xiao family so soon?

258
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,290
I'm just reminding you to stop.

259
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,460
The Xiao brothers are not easy to mess with.

260
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,820
Leave me alone.

261
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,600
Without me,

262
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,120
would Xiao Xianchen marry you as the future lady of Lin State?

263
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Without me marrying Xiao Xianchen,

264
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,670
would you be able to secure your future position?

265
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,290
Send some skilled ones to follow him.

266
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,820
Then kill him.

267
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,150
Yes.

268
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,050
Chang Yuan.

269
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,310
Why is he here?

270
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:46,860
Maybe

271
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,010
I was wrong again.

272
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,310
Caiyi, I'm sorry.

273
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,770
I can't see you now.

274
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,810
Why?

275
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,460
He could have handed me over.

276
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,310
Why did he kneel on the street for me?

277
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,850
Cui Ya wants to kill him.

278
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:44,930
No.

279
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,160
Xiao Zisu can't die yet.

280
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,470
While Xiao Zisu is exhausted,

281
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,120
this River God Temple will be his grave.

282
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,450
After all, he is the General of the Feilian Troop.

283
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,390
If we kill him,

284
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,950
will they find us?

285
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,150
Don't worry.

286
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,310
When we killed people, we always blame them on Ji demon.

287
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,070
So the authorities won't be able to trace us.

288
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,210
Pin the blame on the Ji demon?

289
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,550
Who are you?

290
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,590
Come out!

291
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,050
Come out!

292
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,190
Stop playing tricks.

293
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,300
Who is playing tricks?

294
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,780
Is it you

295
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,360
or the Ji people?

296
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,770
Why must the Ji people bear

297
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,110
the evil you've done and the mistakes you've made?

298
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,640
Have you seen the Ji people?

299
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,950
Why should

300
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,270
the Ji people bear the blame?

301
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,300
Let me ask you.

302
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,630
Why?

303
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,070
Cut the crap. Kill her.
