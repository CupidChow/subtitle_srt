No.

163

If you live on this island and can't ride a motorcycle, transportation will cost you a fortune.

If you want to go somewhere, tell Palm to give you a ride.

165
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:27,349
He looks like he can survive anywhere he goes.

166
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:30,293
I'll take you to your room on the second floor.

167
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:31,893
Let's go.

168
00:13:35,188 --> 00:13:36,988
Follow me.

169
00:13:45,472 --> 00:13:49,109
You can stay in this room.

170
00:13:49,109 --> 00:13:52,350
I'll save other rooms for guests.

171
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,750
Yes.

172
00:13:54,498 --> 00:13:57,827
Get some rest. You can go down and help me with work later.

173
00:13:57,827 --> 00:13:59,327
Sure.

174
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:05,435
Mark my word, smoking pot is forbidden.

175
00:14:05,435 --> 00:14:07,646
If you want to try it, come to me.

176
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,318
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

177
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:12,118
Do you get it?

178
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,569
You are nothing like your mom.

179
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:34,615
So? Did Uncle Non call you yet?

180
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:37,082
No, not yet.

181
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:44,924
Do you think my mom will be okay?

182
00:14:44,924 --> 00:14:48,344
She is probably just injured.

183
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:52,338
Yes. I'm sure Khun Thanya will be fine.

184
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:56,116
She is probably receiving treatment in a hospital.

185
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:04,782
I think the attack is Uncle Kit's doing.

186
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:09,709
He is the only person who would benefit from my parents' death.

187
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:14,473
I think you should let my dad take care of it.

188
00:15:14,473 --> 00:15:17,821
He will find those who attacked your family.

189
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:20,852
Right now.

190
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:23,955
You need to be strong.

191
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:27,482
We will probably need to stay here for a while.

192
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:31,849
If you have any problems, you can always come to me.

193
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:47,838
Will you tell your mom about our relationship?

194
00:15:47,838 --> 00:15:49,949
What is our relationship?

195
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:56,049
Will you tell your mom that you are working for my family?

196
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:01,019
I don't think it's necessary.

197
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:04,131
We can act like we are friends while we are with her.

198
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,347
It's up to you. You are the one who always has plans.

199
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:19,116
Then can I call you Nueng instead of Khun Nueng?

200
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:23,749
I told you that you can call me whatever you want.

201
00:16:24,494 --> 00:16:26,094
All right.

202
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:30,382
Nueng, you should go take a shower first.

203
00:16:30,382 --> 00:16:32,270
I'll use the bathroom after you.

204
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,609
You surely don't let the chance go, do you? Your mom is not even here.

205
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:39,749
I'm just practicing. So it will look natural.

206
00:16:55,301 --> 00:16:59,145
Palm, go get the beer and put it in the refrigerator.

207
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:01,978
You, go help me carry stuff from the front of the bar.

208
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:05,190
It's okay, Mom. I'll do everything myself.

209
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:09,249
No! If you are going to live with me, you both need to work.

210
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,254
Sure, I'll help you.

211
00:17:13,254 --> 00:17:16,054
Hurry up, let's go.

212
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,741
Take these chairs and put them on the beach.

213
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:26,049
Yes.

214
00:17:31,098 --> 00:17:34,870
Who is the owner of this electric piano?

215
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,627
It's from my bar.

216
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:38,741
But all the musicians resigned.

217
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:40,367
So I put it here.

218
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:44,305
Instead, I play reggae music to entertain my customers.

219
00:17:44,305 --> 00:17:48,606
We should open this area as a live music corner.

220
00:17:48,606 --> 00:17:50,089
Don't you think it's a good idea?

221
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:53,440
I think the customers would prefer live music to music played from a device.

222
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:59,005
You just got here but want to teach me how to run my business.

223
00:17:59,005 --> 00:18:02,826
Will you open a resort management class for me?

224
00:18:02,826 --> 00:18:07,318
You look like a rich boy. Have you ever had real work experience?

225
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:09,319
Take the chairs.

226
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,782
Yes.

227
00:18:22,963 --> 00:18:24,719
Hello.

228
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:25,896
Hello.

229
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,318
Do you have a room available?

230
00:18:29,137 --> 00:18:30,631
Yes?

231
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:34,516
We're looking for a room for two people. You know?

232
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:39,049
So sorry.

233
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:41,082
Again, please.

234
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:48,428
Hi. Hi. How can I help?

235
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:52,149
We're looking for a room for two people for three nights.

236
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:56,483
- Yes, sure, I'll check with the owner and let you know.
- Okay.

237
00:18:56,483 --> 00:19:00,062
- So where are you guys from?
- I'm from France.

238
00:19:00,062 --> 00:19:01,709
I'm from China.

239
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:04,218
Oh, I see.

240
00:19:04,218 --> 00:19:07,044
Hello. I'm Nuengdiao.
(in Chinese)

241
00:19:07,044 --> 00:19:08,307
You speak Mandarin?

242
00:19:08,307 --> 00:19:12,982
I'm Wu. This is my boyfriend, David.

243
00:19:12,982 --> 00:19:15,692
This is Palm. He is my friend.

244
00:19:15,692 --> 00:19:17,915
I'm sorry. My Mandarin is not very good.

245
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:19,672
I learned Mandarin in school.

246
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:25,307
Your Mandarin is pretty good. I wouldn't have known who to talk to. He doesn't speak any Mandarin.

247
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:28,206
When I scold him in Mandarin, he doesn't get it.

248
00:19:31,757 --> 00:19:34,215
Why are you laughing?

249
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:38,055
If you want to know what we are talking about, you should pay more attention in class.

250
00:19:40,153 --> 00:19:43,824
Hi! Hi!

251
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:47,356
What's going on here?

252
00:19:47,356 --> 00:19:50,649
They are looking for a room.

253
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:53,409
Sure. Did you ask them?

254
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:57,127
Yes. They want a room for two people for three nights.

255
00:19:57,127 --> 00:19:59,359
Sure. I'll take them to the room.

256
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,882
Did you ask them yourself?

257
00:20:01,882 --> 00:20:03,364
Yes.

258
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:06,549
You are perfect for this job.

259
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:10,249
I'll have Palm do the physical work.

260
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:14,647
Hi.

261
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:15,981
I'll show you the room.

262
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:19,015
- Okay. Great. I'll follow you.
- Let's go.

263
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:20,902
How long are you going to stay?

264
00:20:20,902 --> 00:20:24,876
- Three nights.
- That's wonderful.

265
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,650
Khun Nueng.

266
00:20:29,737 --> 00:20:32,250
Are those two a couple?

267
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:35,687
Yes.

268
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:40,615
He said he wanted to speak Mandarin with his boyfriend. But he doesn't know the language.

269
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,135
He uses Mandarin to scold his boyfriend.

270
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:47,149
Do you know how to scold in Mandarin?

271
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,600
"Bèndàn."

272
00:20:54,437 --> 00:20:56,350
What does it mean?

273
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:03,115
It means "fool."

274
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:18,018
Ai Palm.

275
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,090
Yes.

276
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,607
Can I ask you something?

277
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:27,049
What do you do when you can't sleep?

278
00:21:28,824 --> 00:21:32,339
I go swimming until I feel exhausted, and then I go back to bed.

279
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:34,216
What about you?

280
00:21:34,216 --> 00:21:36,219
I listen to classical music.

281
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:38,378
I usually fall asleep after listening to it.

282
00:21:38,378 --> 00:21:42,216
But right now, I can't turn on my phone.

283
00:21:42,216 --> 00:21:44,216
So I don't know what to do.

284
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:47,025
I'll find a phone so you can to listen to music.

285
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:50,616
It's okay. I'll find another way.

286
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,800
You.

287
00:21:58,556 --> 00:21:59,956
Yes.

288
00:22:00,637 --> 00:22:02,618
Can I ask you something?

289
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:08,262
Talk to me. Turn around and talk to me.

290
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,000
Why did you kiss me?

291
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:23,549
I saw you were feeling sad.

292
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:27,449
I wanted to make you feel better.

293
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:32,149
You kissed me because you wanted me to forget Ben.

294
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:35,516
Was that all?

295
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:36,919
Yes.

296
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:45,616
Okay.

297
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,216
I got it.

298
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,736
You kissed me because it was part of your job.

299
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:52,016
You didn't have any feelings.

300
00:22:55,561 --> 00:22:57,682
What do you mean?

301
00:22:57,682 --> 00:23:00,258
Next time, if you want to make me feel better,

302
00:23:00,258 --> 00:23:02,908
you don't have to go that far.

303
00:23:02,908 --> 00:23:05,849
You can just act funny or play a joke.

304
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:07,822
You don't need to kiss me.

305
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:11,049
A kiss is a very special thing.

306
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:13,215
It means something.

307
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:40,203
If you don't pay the money you owe him, he won't let you get away.

308
00:23:40,203 --> 00:23:41,778
All right, I got it.

309
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:45,719
Can you let my arm go first? I'll find the money to pay him.

310
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:49,247
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

311
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:54,515
Khun Nueng, what are you doing here?

312
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:10,607
Who are they? What are they doing here at this hour?

313
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:14,349
They are guests looking for a room.

314
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:18,852
There are rooms available. Why don't they take one?

315
00:24:18,852 --> 00:24:21,623
They said it is too expensive. They will look for a room somewhere else.

316
00:24:21,623 --> 00:24:24,050
Don't ask me so many questions.

317
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:27,569
Go buy the things on this list for me.

318
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,749
It's a long list.

319
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:33,749
You can take Nuengdiao to help you carry them.

320
00:24:34,322 --> 00:24:36,715
Here is the money.

321
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:38,549
Go eat something at the market.

322
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:41,015
I won't cook breakfast for you.

323
00:24:49,996 --> 00:24:51,918
Khun Nueng, get on.

324
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:56,508
Are you sure that you won't get into an accident?

325
00:25:01,894 --> 00:25:03,744
It's dangerous to sit like that.

326
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,358
If I hit the brakes, you can fall on your back.

327
00:25:06,358 --> 00:25:08,260
Then you need to do it softly.

328
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:12,826
I think you should sit closer to me, so the weight will be balanced.

329
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,500
Are you ready?

330
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,344
Yes. Just don't drive too fast.

331
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:23,824
If you are afraid of falling off the bike, you can hold on to me tightly.

332
00:25:23,824 --> 00:25:25,482
No.

333
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,550
♫ Oh my love ♫

334
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:51,820
♫ You're such a fragile thing I know ♫

335
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,110
♫ And with the winter comes the ice, the snow ♫

336
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:00,590
♫ But I'm here to hold ♫

337
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:08,860
♫ And oh my love ♫

338
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:15,890
♫ Don't worry about the cold just yet ♫

339
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,100
♫ The trees haven't started to shed ♫

340
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,700
♫ Just feel the summer sun ♫

341
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:28,970
♫ As it warms our bed ♫

342
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:38,690
♫ I'm lying ♫

343
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:44,720
♫ And I'm lying ♫

344
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,392
♫ When I say I'm not... ♫

345
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:52,837
This is Khua Kling (spicy, dry-fried curry) made from own my recipe.

346
00:26:52,837 --> 00:26:55,450
Thank you.

347
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,013
Nueng, are you sure you can eat this?

348
00:26:58,013 --> 00:27:00,018
If you can't, I can take you somewhere else.

349
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,367
I can eat it. It's just a normal Thai dish.

350
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:04,296
It's not a normal dish.

351
00:27:04,296 --> 00:27:07,915
The recipe of Khua Kling has been passed down from my ancestors.

352
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:10,349
It's spicy and flavorful.

353
00:27:10,349 --> 00:27:12,576
Can't you eat spicy food?

354
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:14,476
I can.

355
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:19,666
If you come to the southern region and don't get to taste my Khua Kling,

356
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:22,882
you will feel like something is missing.

357
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:27,164
Southern dishes are very spicy.

358
00:27:27,164 --> 00:27:29,851
If you can eat it, so can I.

359
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,470
Look.

360
00:27:35,908 --> 00:27:37,693
Tam.

361
00:27:37,693 --> 00:27:39,804
- It's delicious.
- See? I told you.

362
00:27:39,804 --> 00:27:42,816
Please enjoy it. It's delicious.

363
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,241
Do you want to eat vegetables with it?

364
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:50,587
So it will be less spicy.

365
00:27:51,472 --> 00:27:54,569
Stop talking and eat it.

366
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:57,432
It's a recommended dish here. Tam made it for us.

367
00:27:57,432 --> 00:27:59,715
Since we are here, we should eat like the locals.

368
00:27:59,715 --> 00:28:01,682
Eat it.

369
00:28:04,775 --> 00:28:07,191
- Does it taste good?
- Yes.

370
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:09,227
So tell Tam.

371
00:28:09,227 --> 00:28:12,921
- It's delicious.
- Is that so?

372
00:28:14,304 --> 00:28:16,316
But it looks like it's too spicy for you.

373
00:28:16,316 --> 00:28:18,152
- What?
- Your face is turning red.

374
00:28:18,152 --> 00:28:19,635
It's not too spicy.

375
00:28:19,635 --> 00:28:20,997
Here.

376
00:28:20,997 --> 00:28:23,765
- Tam, do I look like I can't eat spicy food?
- No.

377
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:26,021
His face is turning red. Look.

378
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:28,651
No, it's not. It's not that spicy.

379
00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:31,397
- I just had a bite of it.
- Your lips are turning red too.

380
00:28:31,397 --> 00:28:33,449
It's not spicy.

381
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:43,829
Why are you laughing?

382
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:45,449
Nothing.

383
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,418
What?

384
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:07,574
Your lips are burning and swollen.

385
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:18,496
The food was spicy, especially the Khua Kling.

386
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:21,292
I told you that it was very spicy.

387
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:24,932
I know, but I don't want to hurt Tam's feelings.

388
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:29,221
I never thought the dish would be so spicy that it could cause me a stomach ache.

389
00:29:29,221 --> 00:29:33,158
But it was also delicious. I couldn't stop eating it.

390
00:29:33,158 --> 00:29:34,972
I have to go now. Take this.

391
00:29:34,972 --> 00:29:36,885
I'll be right back.

392
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:53,008
So? Did you get everything?

393
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:54,126
Yes, Mom.

394
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,710
Do you want anything else? I'm thinking of taking Nueng to look around the island.

395
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:01,549
Why did you call him "Khun" Nueng?

396
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,907
But when you are with me, you call him Nueng.

397
00:30:03,907 --> 00:30:09,382
When you two are together, you look unusually close.

398
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:12,952
Are you hiding something from me?

399
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,944
No, Mom. We are just friends. There's nothing between us.

400
00:30:16,944 --> 00:30:19,583
You two don't look like normal friends.

401
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,918
You act impolite towards him when you are with me.

402
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:25,818
But when you two are alone, you are soft and gentle with him.

403
00:30:25,818 --> 00:30:28,324
Are you two dating?

404
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:30,256
No, we are not.

405
00:30:30,256 --> 00:30:32,616
I'm not dating anyone.

406
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:36,321
Just tell me the truth.

407
00:30:36,321 --> 00:30:39,221
There's one thing that similar between you and your father.

408
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:41,916
You both can't lie.

409
00:30:43,986 --> 00:30:45,586
So?

410
00:30:51,564 --> 00:30:56,420
Your dad told you to work as a bodyguard for his boss's son?

411
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,815
Yes.

412
00:30:58,945 --> 00:31:00,731
How could he do that?

413
00:31:00,731 --> 00:31:05,507
To repay the gratitude, how could he put the life of his only son in danger?

414
00:31:05,507 --> 00:31:09,952
Why didn't his rich family hire a professional bodyguard for him?

415
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:12,978
Why did they choose a boy from a fishing village to do the job?

416
00:31:12,978 --> 00:31:16,151
The situation is so serious that they want to take his life.

417
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:18,610
What will you do if you are caught in the crossfire?

418
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,090
It won't get that bad.

419
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:24,785
- No one knows we are here. That's why Dad believes that we will be safe here.
- Crap.

420
00:31:24,785 --> 00:31:26,948
But I'm still upset with his decision.

421
00:31:26,948 --> 00:31:29,744
You are supposed to live a normal teenage life.

422
00:31:29,744 --> 00:31:33,923
Instead, you have to sacrifice your life and act like you are some kind of hero.

423
00:31:33,923 --> 00:31:36,278
I'll tell you this. It isn't worth it.

424
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:39,227
It's all right, Mom. It's not that bad.

425
00:31:39,227 --> 00:31:41,391
Nueng is also a nice person.

426
00:31:41,391 --> 00:31:43,807
You are exactly like your father.

427
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:46,250
You should put yourself first sometimes.

428
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,443
That family doesn't really care about you.

429
00:31:49,443 --> 00:31:51,798
They only think of you as one of their servants.

430
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:55,026
When you die, they will find someone else to replace you.

431
00:31:55,026 --> 00:31:57,726
Stop thinking that you are that important to them.

Are you going to murder me?

437
00:32:28,775 --> 00:32:32,381
You don't need to feel afraid. I have a surprise for you.

438
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:35,372
What surprise? I don't want it. I don't like surprises.

439
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:37,902
If you have something to say, just tell me.

Is this the surprise that you were talking about?

447
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,749
This is just the first spot.

448
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:36,324
It's nothing special.

449
00:33:36,324 --> 00:33:39,047
It's just a viewpoint.

450

This is all I can give you.

451
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:46,783
I don't have money. But at least I brought you to a beautiful place.

452
00:33:46,783 --> 00:33:49,949
Can you praise me for my effort?

453
00:33:49,949 --> 00:33:52,800
No. I have high standards.

454
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,996
If you want to wow me, it has to be something more special than this.

455
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:01,475
I think just having me here with you is special enough.

Khun Nuengdiao Kiattrakulmethee the Great, you are so hard to please.

00:34:08,392 --> 00:34:10,149
Are you done?

00:34:11,155 --> 00:34:14,667
How dare you tease me? I'll push you off the cliff.

459
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:17,772
Okay, Young Master.

460
00:34:18,593 --> 00:34:21,949
Khun Nueng, don't do this. I may fall off the cliff for real.

464
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,878
Do you remember the story of the cowherd and the weaver girl?

465
00:35:11,878 --> 00:35:13,518
Of course.

466
00:35:13,518 --> 00:35:18,735
They can meet each other only once a year in the same place.

467
00:35:18,735 --> 00:35:20,775
It's a very sad story.

468
00:35:23,824 --> 00:35:29,647
When I think about the story, I think there is hope for them.

469
00:35:31,912 --> 00:35:36,009
At least, they can meet each other once a year.

470
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,369
They have something to look forward to.

471
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:42,752
For some, their lives are even sadder than that.

472
00:35:43,537 --> 00:35:45,652
They don't have anything to look forward to.

473
00:35:45,652 --> 00:35:47,885
They have no hope.

474
00:35:47,885 --> 00:35:50,382
They don't have someone to wait for.

475
00:35:54,978 --> 00:35:56,518
Gosh!

476
00:35:56,518 --> 00:35:59,950
My life is even sadder than the lives of the cowherd and the weaver girl.

477
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:03,927
It's not that bad.

478
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:07,128
You are important to many people.

479
00:36:07,128 --> 00:36:11,449
To Khun Thanya and...

480
00:36:18,204 --> 00:36:20,652
and many people.

481
00:36:20,652 --> 00:36:24,716
You can bring changes to their lives.

482
00:36:27,509 --> 00:36:30,552
How do you know that? Are you a fortune-teller?

483
00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:33,440
I don't need to be a fortune-teller to see that.

484
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,715
I'm sure that you will become an important person one day.

485
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,667
Let's go.

486
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:52,382
I have another place, I want to take you to.

487
00:37:18,547 --> 00:37:20,182
Khun Nueng.

488
00:37:32,212 --> 00:37:34,489
It's beautiful.

489
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:35,573
It's also peaceful.

490
00:37:35,573 --> 00:37:38,175
You told me that you aren't a local here.

491
00:37:39,098 --> 00:37:41,650
I asked Tam.

492
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:46,558
She said that this place is beautiful and has a good atmosphere.

493
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:49,482
Especially when the sun is setting.

494
00:37:49,482 --> 00:37:51,875
Her boyfriend took her here.

495
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,388
Why did you bring me here? I'm not your boyfriend.

496
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:04,982
We don't need to be a couple to come here.

497
00:38:05,687 --> 00:38:08,382
I just want to make you feel relaxed.

498
00:39:05,915 --> 00:39:08,582
Do you carry a gun everywhere?

499
00:39:08,582 --> 00:39:10,774
It's become my habit.

500
00:39:10,774 --> 00:39:14,816
In case I need it, I can use it to protect us.

501
00:39:16,212 --> 00:39:22,385
I can't believe that you have to live in fear like this because of me.

502
00:39:22,385 --> 00:39:24,204
It's okay.

503
00:39:26,454 --> 00:39:28,715
You said it's okay.

504
00:39:28,715 --> 00:39:32,012
You always think everything is your duty, your duty, and your duty.

505
00:39:32,012 --> 00:39:35,216
Your every breath is about your duty.

506
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:42,970
Khun Nueng.

507
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,916
You shouldn't play with guns.

508
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:46,916
It's dangerous.

509
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:49,616
Let it be my job.

510
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,615
We are safe here.

511
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:02,659
You don't have to worry.

512
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,020
Do you want go into the water?

513
00:40:17,569 --> 00:40:20,144
You know that I'm not a good swimmer.

514
00:40:20,144 --> 00:40:21,793
It's okay.

515
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:23,881
The water is not that deep.

516
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:28,082
If something happens, I can help you.

517
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:34,649
I won't let you out of my sight.

518
00:40:59,753 --> 00:41:01,215
Let's go.

519
00:41:12,432 --> 00:41:14,215
Palm.

520
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:24,690
♫ It's so hard to be near you ♫

521
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:28,200
♫ You make it hard for me to breathe ♫

522
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,300
♫ And I can't stand to see you smile ♫

523
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,400
♫ Because it kills me ♫

524
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,600
♫ From within ♫

525
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:42,980
♫ Your voice is like an arrow that pierced me through the heart ♫

526
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:49,660
♫ And your touch is like fire that will burn my skin ♫

527
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:56,490
♫ I wish that I could say ♫

528
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,290
♫ What I really feel ♫

529
00:42:00,295 --> 00:42:05,082
One day, I'll come back and buy this beach. So it will be mine.

530
00:42:05,082 --> 00:42:09,687
If people find out about this beach, it will be full of tourists.

531
00:42:09,687 --> 00:42:11,713
It will be ruined.

532
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:16,648
If I buy it, I will protect and take good care of it.

533
00:42:16,648 --> 00:42:19,082
Then who will be allowed to come here?

534
00:42:22,565 --> 00:42:27,382
Someone I want to spend time with in this beautiful place.

535
00:42:31,235 --> 00:42:34,439
I want this place to be like the bridge of magpies

536
00:42:34,439 --> 00:42:38,682
that brought the cowherd and the weaver girl back together.

537
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:42,160
Although they could only meet once a year,

538
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:48,249
their love made this place a very special place.

539
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:53,349
You are quite a romantic person.

540
00:42:55,858 --> 00:42:59,050
There is much more of me that you've never seen.

541
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,749
I only show you what I want you to see.

542
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:08,549
What you chose to show me is your good side, isn't it?

543
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:12,649
Because that is the only side of you that I see.

544
00:43:21,489 --> 00:43:25,598
I think you shouldn't set high expectations for me.

545
00:43:25,598 --> 00:43:27,549
You may be disappointed.

546
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,918
Thank you.

547
00:43:47,655 --> 00:43:50,016
I feel much better now.

548
00:43:54,017 --> 00:43:56,349
You're welcome.

549
00:43:56,349 --> 00:44:01,849
When I see you feeling better, I feel that I did my job well.

550
00:44:21,127 --> 00:44:24,685
[Next Week]
No matter what, I will do everything to find Nuengdiao.

551
00:44:24,685 --> 00:44:26,569
I will bring him back.

552
00:44:26,569 --> 00:44:27,975
Do you think they will find Nuengdiao?

553
00:44:27,975 --> 00:44:30,217
I think he's probably dead.

554
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:32,594
- What the hell did you say?
- Why?

555
00:44:36,248 --> 00:44:38,479
I'm sure Phum was behind this.

556
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:42,115
Even though you are sure, you need to have evidence too.

557
00:44:42,115 --> 00:44:43,066
What are you doing?

558
00:44:43,066 --> 00:44:45,107
I'm hugging you. Can't you tell?

559
00:44:45,107 --> 00:44:48,544
Since I'm a new person on this island, I want to try new things.

560
00:44:48,544 --> 00:44:50,561
For example, dating.

561
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,180
♫ Don't be afraid even if we are apart ♫

562
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:03,180
♫ Just stay where you are, and I'll find you ♫

563
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:08,760
♫ No matter what tomorrow brings, just remember this ♫

564
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,920
♫ I will only live ♫

565
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:19,510
♫ For you ♫

566
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:38,140
♫ Don't be afraid even if we are apart ♫

567
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:42,910
♫ Just stay where you are, and I'll find you ♫

568
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:48,780
♫ No matter what tomorrow brings, just remember this ♫

569
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:53,300
♫ I will only live ♫

570
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:58,280
♫ For you ♫
