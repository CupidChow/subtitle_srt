00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,460
Take it.

168
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,610
Alright then

169
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,587
Do it. Kill me.

170
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:51,284
Kill me.

171
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,040
Do it, Palm. Kill me. Shoot me.

172
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,671
If you kill me, everything will be over.

173
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:58,209
Your dad will be released from prison. My mom will be alive.

174
00:15:58,209 --> 00:15:59,378
Shoot me!

175
00:15:59,378 --> 00:16:02,569
Your mom is dead. Do you want your dad to die too?

176
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:04,669
- Mr. Nueng!
- Shoot me.

177
00:16:42,844 --> 00:16:45,625
I will never hurt you.

178
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,558
I just lost my mind for a moment.

179
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:54,311
I knew if I killed Mrs. Tanya, he would kill you anyway.

180
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:58,339
In the end, he will put the blame on me and my dad.

181
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:07,337
He is trying to manipulate us.

182
00:17:07,337 --> 00:17:08,700
We can't let him, Palm.

183
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,302
We need to fight back. We have to confront him.

184
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:15,879
What do we need to do?

185
00:17:15,879 --> 00:17:18,006
Don't worry about your dad.

186
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:19,954
I'll help him out.

187
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:23,977
If he can buy people with money, I have more money than him.

188
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,905
Are you ready to stand by my side in front of everyone?

189
00:17:48,122 --> 00:17:51,787
From now on, you are going to openly be my bodyguard.

190
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:53,887
You will stay close to me.

191
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:56,843
We are going to confront our enemy.

192
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:59,953
We need to show him that we are not afraid of him.

193
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:03,119
He can't do anything to us if we stay together.

194
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,760
[The market belongs to everyone.]
[Give the land back to us.]

195
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
[Stop cheating us.]

196
00:18:11,126 --> 00:18:13,268
The cheater is here.

197
00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:14,817
Cheater.

198
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:15,960
- Cheater.
- Cheater.

199
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,868
Everyone. Everyone, please calm down.

200
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:20,123
Cheater.

201
00:18:20,123 --> 00:18:21,882
Please calm down.

202
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,088
I'm the representative of Kiattrakulmaytee Company.

203
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:27,665
I'm here to talk to you about taking over the market.

204
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:30,563
What talk? I'm not going to talk to a kid.

205
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:32,360
What right do you have to talk about it?

206
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,451
I have the right.

207
00:18:35,403 --> 00:18:38,799
I'm the only heir of the land's owner.

208
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,737
So what? How would you help us?

209
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:44,940
You suddenly canceled the contract. Where are we going to do our business?

210
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,080
That's right.

211
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,827
A capitalist like you never cares about poor people like us.

212
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,618
You never care about poor people.

213
00:18:50,618 --> 00:18:52,165
You have never been poor.

214
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:55,002
Please hear me out.

215
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:56,424
I talked to my lawyer.

216
00:18:56,424 --> 00:19:00,878
The reason that the contract was canceled was that the lessee breached the contract.

217
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:03,606
The ownership of the land is now returned to me.

218
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:06,939
Don't worry. The market will continue to be open.

219
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:19,075
Why don't you take off your jacket? It's all dirty.

220
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:24,283
It's okay, Mr. Nueng. It's not that dirty.

221
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:29,720
Were you hit by anything that was thrown at us?

222
00:19:30,576 --> 00:19:32,354
It's alright. I'm okay.

223
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:36,055
Your shoulder is wide. So you could fully shield me.

224
00:19:40,984 --> 00:19:44,999
You did great back then.

225
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:46,926
You looked mature.

226
00:19:46,926 --> 00:19:48,777
You had a leader vibe.

227
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:51,679
Everyone was listening to you.

228
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,879
I'm so proud of you.

229
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:57,582
It's not easy.

230
00:19:57,582 --> 00:20:00,148
I have a long way to prove myself.

231
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:01,271
One more thing,

232
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:06,811
I don't know when someone is going to hurt me or throw things at me.

233
00:20:09,494 --> 00:20:11,741
You don't have to worry about that.

234
00:20:11,741 --> 00:20:14,068
If someone is going to hurt you,

235
00:20:14,068 --> 00:20:18,256
I'll use my wide shoulder to protect you.

236
00:20:18,256 --> 00:20:21,070
I guarantee that no one can hurt you.

237
00:20:27,508 --> 00:20:29,980
Oh, I just remembered this.

238
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,159
We haven't talked about your pay for working as my bodyguard.

239
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:38,799
It's okay, Mr. Nueng. I don't need the money.

240
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:39,978
No. You can't do that.

241
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:43,110
You are working. So you should get paid for it.

242
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,483
I'll set a salary for you.

243
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:47,303
How about this?

244
00:20:47,954 --> 00:20:50,839
I want this in return for my work.

245
00:20:55,717 --> 00:20:57,190
Sure.

246
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,919
I'll pay you every day.

247
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:09,059
You did really great.

248
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,652
I can't believe that you have changed this much.

249
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:14,719
Why? What did I use to be like?

250
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:17,206
Just like I said before.

251
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:19,380
You are not stubborn.

252
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,642
You are just a bit self-centered.

253
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:26,238
Shut up.

254
00:21:39,827 --> 00:21:42,895
How much do you love Nuengdiao?

255
00:21:42,895 --> 00:21:46,239
You are willing to give your dad's life up for him.

256
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:49,295
If I were your dad, I would be devastated.

257
00:21:49,295 --> 00:21:51,531
My son didn't love me and let me die in the prison.

258
00:21:51,531 --> 00:21:54,099
Even though he had the chance to save me.

259
00:21:56,763 --> 00:21:58,796
My dad will be alright.

260
00:21:58,796 --> 00:22:01,146
You can't do anything to him.

261
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:06,399
The person who is behind everything like you should be put in jail.

262
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,005
When I am put in jail, your dad would already be put in a body bag.

263
00:22:15,128 --> 00:22:17,779
Do you want me to call my men right now?

264
00:22:19,602 --> 00:22:22,462
Do you think you are the only one who has connections?

265
00:22:22,462 --> 00:22:23,820
Huh?

266
00:22:24,571 --> 00:22:27,938
Mr. Nueng hired a lawyer to bail my dad out.

267
00:22:27,938 --> 00:22:32,499
Soon, my dad will be released on bail to defend himself in a court trial.

268
00:22:33,747 --> 00:22:35,163
Is that so?

269
00:22:36,934 --> 00:22:39,939
Do you think you still can threaten me?

270
00:22:39,939 --> 00:22:41,999
Soon.

271
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:45,099
You will be spending time in jail instead of my dad.

272
00:23:05,085 --> 00:23:07,239
Thank you so much, Mr. Nueng.

273
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:09,248
For bailing me as the trial is pending.

274
00:23:09,248 --> 00:23:10,497
It's okay.

275
00:23:10,497 --> 00:23:13,702
I need to find the real culprit.

276
00:23:13,702 --> 00:23:15,099
Yes.

277
00:23:17,985 --> 00:23:23,248
Palm, where have you been? Why weren't you taking care of Mr. Nueng?

278
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:26,497
Palm was with me.

279
00:23:26,497 --> 00:23:28,236
He didn't go anywhere.

280
00:23:28,873 --> 00:23:31,719
He is the best person at taking care of me.

281
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,548
That's good.

282
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:37,308
It's his job anyway.

283
00:23:38,744 --> 00:23:40,729
Uncle Non, please don't say that.

284
00:23:40,729 --> 00:23:43,959
Don't make Palm repay my family.

285
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:47,239
Please let him live his life.

286
00:23:50,251 --> 00:23:53,559
What happened to Mama Mam was terrible enough.

287
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,404
What?

288
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:57,359
What happened to Mam?

289
00:23:59,122 --> 00:24:01,942
She was shot to death while she tried to save me and Mr. Nueng.

290
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:12,205
Did she die because of me?

291
00:24:12,205 --> 00:24:14,099
Don't think that way.

292
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:16,076
She made her choice.

293
00:24:16,076 --> 00:24:18,709
She chose to protect me and Mr. Nueng.

294
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:23,960
I not only ruined my wife's life,

295
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,839
but I'm also ruining my son's life.

296
00:24:30,225 --> 00:24:31,757
Palm.

297
00:24:32,642 --> 00:24:34,317
I'm sorry.

298
00:24:35,372 --> 00:24:38,117
From now on, I won't force you to do anything again.

299
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:41,519
You can do whatever you want.

300
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,384
From now on, I will take care of everything by myself.

301
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:46,565
It's okay, Dad.

302
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:48,137
You didn't force me.

303
00:24:48,137 --> 00:24:50,719
I want to take care of Mr. Nueng.

304
00:24:54,073 --> 00:24:57,143
Right now, you should go hiding.

305
00:24:57,143 --> 00:24:59,443
Mr. Nueng and I will take care of everything.

306
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:07,339
I'll do that, Mr. Nueng.

307
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:10,739
Please take care of Palm.

308
00:25:11,702 --> 00:25:13,704
I truly believe...

309
00:25:13,704 --> 00:25:17,018
that Palm will be your most loyal friend.

310
00:25:18,077 --> 00:25:19,577
Yes.

311
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:25,930
Palm.

312
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,822
You know it, right?

313
00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:32,042
That I love you.

314
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:36,579
My dad told me to take my mom's ashes...

315
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:40,946
to the place where I think she would be happy to be laid to rest.

316
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:43,580
So I chose the sea.

317
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,506
I think it was her favorite place.

318
00:26:49,614 --> 00:26:53,699
I think she would be happy that you laid her to rest here.

319
00:26:54,805 --> 00:26:57,302
You also took her here by yourself.

320
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:04,450
Do you know that your mom asked me to take care of you?

321
00:27:05,632 --> 00:27:10,099
She told me how much you love me.

322
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:13,697
I promised her that I wouldn't leave you.

323
00:27:14,897 --> 00:27:17,608
Let your mom rest in peace.

324
00:27:26,425 --> 00:27:28,831
I'm trying not to be sad.

325
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:31,153
I think my mom would want to see me happy.

326
00:27:31,153 --> 00:27:33,002
One more thing.

327
00:27:33,002 --> 00:27:36,407
My mom also sacrificed her life for us.

328
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:39,339
I think she would want to see us together.

329
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:44,239
Right now, we are together.

330
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,186
To be honest, I'm not afraid anymore.

331
00:27:55,186 --> 00:28:00,799
I've been through many things that I feel like I can overcome anything.

332
00:28:01,738 --> 00:28:04,132
My dad was put in jail.

333
00:28:04,132 --> 00:28:05,899
My mom was killed.

334
00:28:07,077 --> 00:28:09,619
How can my life be worse than this?

335
00:28:11,587 --> 00:28:16,059
Why are there so many obstacles in our love?

336
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,520
♫ Don't you ever paint it black ♫

337
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,585
They said the more obstacles we face,

338
00:28:27,585 --> 00:28:31,914
the longer our love will last and the more meaningful it will be.

339
00:28:31,914 --> 00:28:36,670
Then I think our love will be a legend.

340
00:28:55,297 --> 00:28:56,439
Dad, where are you going?

341
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:57,557
It's not your business.

342
00:28:57,557 --> 00:28:59,720
Are you going to stop Nueng?

343
00:29:04,191 --> 00:29:06,122
I'm begging you.

344
00:29:06,122 --> 00:29:08,239
Could you stop it?

345
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:12,080
Nuengdiao canceled the contract that I made with my important client.

346
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,162
I need to show that I'm serious.

347
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:32,399
Are you going to shoot me?

348
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,659
You are worried about Nuengdiao more than me?

349
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,061
I'm not worried about Nuengdiao.

350
00:29:42,061 --> 00:29:43,788
I'm worried about you.

351
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:46,328
I don't want you to be an even worse asshole than you already are.

352
00:29:53,314 --> 00:29:55,014
Shoot me.

353
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,339
Do it.

354
00:30:00,978 --> 00:30:03,932
If you want to stop me, then shoot me.

355
00:30:03,932 --> 00:30:06,003
You are the only one who can stop me.

356
00:30:06,003 --> 00:30:07,494
Do it!

357
00:30:07,494 --> 00:30:09,526
I will die because my son wants to be a good person.

358
00:30:09,526 --> 00:30:12,797
So I can go to heaven like everyone else. Shoot me!

359
00:30:12,797 --> 00:30:15,060
Don't dare me, Dad.

360
00:30:29,768 --> 00:30:31,996
You are a coward.

361
00:30:33,371 --> 00:30:36,060
You don't deserve to be my son.

I'll wipe your body.

365
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,313
The doctor told me that I should talk to you often.

366
00:31:13,313 --> 00:31:17,297
But I'm not sure if you can hear me.

367
00:31:17,297 --> 00:31:21,291
Right now, I took your position to manage the hotel.

368
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:23,571
I may not be as good as you were. But...

369
00:31:23,571 --> 00:31:25,709
But I'm learning.

370
00:31:28,294 --> 00:31:31,839
Right now, I have a boyfriend.

371
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,779
You may wonder how I can find a boyfriend.

372
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:39,939
I found him because of you.

373
00:31:41,964 --> 00:31:44,362
You introduced him to me.

374
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:45,913
It's Palm.

375
00:31:45,913 --> 00:31:49,508
The person you sent to take care of me.

376
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:52,759
He's still taking care of me.

377
00:31:53,424 --> 00:31:55,649
He's doing a great job.

378
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:58,571
Sometimes, he did too well.

379
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:03,419
I want him to think about himself more.

380
00:32:04,926 --> 00:32:08,919
He takes good care of me, but sometimes it becomes annoying.

381
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:14,180
But I'm happy to be with him.

382

You did well. You are a fighter.

Finally, you came back to me.

I'm okay.

I've been through many things. I'm much stronger.

Why are you taking me out for dinner?

I just want to do something romantic for you.

410

You don't need to do that.

00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:22,480
Spending time with you already makes me happy.

I'm happy that we no longer need to be on a run.

No.

Yes.

Of course.

424
00:35:15,245 --> 00:35:20,259
But I can't be with you twenty-four seven.

You know how different we are.

To be honest, I'm okay if we won't be together.

430

Don't say that.

431

Before we got to know each other, you know how different we were.

But we still came this far.

You woke up quite fast.

Why did you bring me here?

479
00:40:43,048 --> 00:40:45,257
Are you going to kill me too?

480
00:40:46,374 --> 00:40:49,062
Nueng, don't think too far.

481
00:40:49,062 --> 00:40:51,459
I just want to talk to you.

482
00:40:51,459 --> 00:40:53,159
Talk to me?

483
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,831
If you wanted to talk to me, you could meet me at the hotel.

484
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:58,079
You don't need to order your men to bring me here.

485
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,935
You did this to me.

486
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:02,671
It means that we can't talk.

487
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:04,931
So you used your dirty plan.

488
00:41:04,931 --> 00:41:07,271
Just like you did to my parents.

489
00:41:09,831 --> 00:41:12,479
How did you know that I did it?

490
00:41:13,983 --> 00:41:15,759
Do you have a witness?

491
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:18,608
Do you have evidence?

492
00:41:23,544 --> 00:41:26,839
It's just the words of a self-important kid.

493
00:41:28,562 --> 00:41:30,999
Do you think you can beat me?

494
00:41:33,031 --> 00:41:36,305
Since you came back, you have been annoying me.

495
00:41:36,305 --> 00:41:40,282
I was making money but you got in my way even though you've never wanted it.

496
00:41:40,282 --> 00:41:44,920
Even though I don't want it, it's still mine.

497
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,804
I won't give it to an asshole.

498
00:42:06,856 --> 00:42:09,254
Sign it.

499
00:42:09,254 --> 00:42:12,752
Give all your executive power to me.

500
00:42:13,578 --> 00:42:17,939
And also all the shares that you have.

501
00:42:24,821 --> 00:42:26,677
I won't sign it.

502
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:29,151
You can't force me to do it too.

503
00:42:29,151 --> 00:42:31,679
I won't force you.

504
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,059
But you will want to sign it.

505
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:37,300
Wait and see.

506
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,920
Smile, Nuengdiao.

507
00:42:51,421 --> 00:42:52,513
[Next Week]
What are you doing to Khun Nuengdiao?

508
00:42:52,513 --> 00:42:55,565
Are you working with your dad? Tell me!

509
00:42:56,418 --> 00:42:57,963
Asshole, stop it. Stop it!

510
00:42:57,963 --> 00:43:00,120
You are easily lured into the trap.

511
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,944
- Khun Nueng.
- If you are going to shoot me, then do it.

512
00:43:01,944 --> 00:43:03,952
If we're going to die, we will die together.

513
00:43:03,952 --> 00:43:07,839
I'll make you see what kind of ending is waiting for good people.

514
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,974
No matter what happens, we will overcome it together.

515
00:43:12,974 --> 00:43:15,800
We will do everything to be together.

516
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:22,610
