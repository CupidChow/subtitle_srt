Nueng,

2
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:39,637
what are you doing here? It's almost time.

3
00:00:39,637 --> 00:00:43,234
Didn't Dad say he would be here soon?

4
00:00:43,234 --> 00:00:46,077
Your dad is meeting with some landowners from Macau.

5
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:48,820
He said he would come as soon as possible after the meeting ended.

6
00:00:50,737 --> 00:00:53,254
Why don't you go and play the piano for me?

7
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:55,484
It's been a long time since I heard you play the piano.

8
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:59,564
I also want Dad to listen to the song that I've practiced.

9
00:00:59,564 --> 00:01:02,444
Do you not want me to listen to it then?

10
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:04,674
I'm feeling hurt.

11
00:01:04,674 --> 00:01:06,384
Mom, please don't feel hurt.

12
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:09,344
If Dad doesn't arrive in time, I'll play it for you.

13
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:10,824
I'm already used to it.

14
00:01:10,824 --> 00:01:15,204
I understand that his work is more important than me.

15
00:01:15,204 --> 00:01:18,524
I'm glad that you understand him,

16
00:01:18,524 --> 00:01:21,084
so your dad doesn't have to worry about it.

17
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:28,234
You know that he is working hard for you, don't you?

18
00:01:30,984 --> 00:01:35,614
How about this? When he gets here, I'll playfully tease him.

19
00:01:35,614 --> 00:01:37,794
How should I punish him? Help me think.

20
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:39,734
What punishment?

21
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:46,244
Why don't we ask him to tell you a bedtime story, just like he did when you were little?

22
00:01:46,244 --> 00:01:49,754
Mom, I'm not a child anymore. I'm turning eighteen today.

23
00:01:49,754 --> 00:01:50,884
Eighteen?

24
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:53,754
Wow, my son is all grown up now.

25
00:01:53,754 --> 00:01:56,324
Can I still give you a kiss?

26
00:01:57,474 --> 00:01:59,504
Hum.

27
00:01:59,504 --> 00:02:01,468
What do you mean "hum"?

28
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:04,214
Yes.

29
00:02:04,214 --> 00:02:06,254
How many kisses?

30
00:02:06,254 --> 00:02:08,340
Will you do it or not?

31
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:12,024
Give me your other cheek.

32
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:18,224

Are you interested in helping me manage the business?

49
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:57,934
You could assist with running small errands in our hotel.

50
00:03:57,934 --> 00:04:00,234
Consider it an internship.

51
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:05,034
Your ability to speak foreign languages, including English and Mandarin,

52
00:04:05,034 --> 00:04:07,774
means you won't have any problems communicating with the guests.

It's not too soon at all.

55
00:04:14,224 --> 00:04:16,724
These days, you need to start working when you are young.

Everything that I am building,

57

59

60

Don't you have something to give to him?

61
00:04:39,774 --> 00:04:42,774

It means only one.

66

I wanted to give you this necklace.

67
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:14,942
To tell you, Nuengdiao, that you are the only one

68

who will protect our Kiattrakulmethee family after me.

You are the only one that I trust.

70
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:27,654
I hope you will grow up to be talented, decisive, and strong,

71
00:05:27,654 --> 00:05:31,944
and eventually, you will be the one to take over the businesses from me.

72

Do you think you can do that for me?

I'll do my best.

327
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,245
I was feeling uneasy. I thought everyone was asleep,

328
00:28:14,245 --> 00:28:16,348
so I secretly came to use the pool.

329
00:28:16,348 --> 00:28:20,825
Even if everyone is asleep, it doesn't mean that you can use the pool!

330
00:28:29,936 --> 00:28:35,813
But can you please not tell my dad about me using the pool?

331
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:38,182
I'm so sorry about this.

332
00:28:38,182 --> 00:28:40,079
I will never use the pool again.

333
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,682
If I don't tell your dad, what do I get in return?

334
00:28:50,682 --> 00:28:53,413
I have nothing to give you.

If there's anything that you want me to do,

337
00:28:57,348 --> 00:28:59,713
I'll do it for you.

338
00:28:59,713 --> 00:29:01,943
I only want one thing from you.

339
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:05,114
Please, don't tell my dad about this.

340
00:29:13,206 --> 00:29:16,426
Begging me to cover it up doesn't mean you are not guilty.

341

About the thing that I want you to do, I'll tell you later.

Yes, Khun Nu.

343

First of all, stop calling me Khun Nu.

I'm not surprised that you are Uncle Non's son.

May I?

348
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:52,273
I removed the magazine from the gun.

349
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:56,835
If you're going to use the gun, you can put the magazine back in.

350

It's for your own safety.

Hello. I'm Pannakorn Jannaloy.

358
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,125
I just transferred to this school.

Okay. Pannakorn, please take a seat.

In the previous class, we…

362

He must have good connections. He moved to our school after the semester started.

363
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,902
He even enrolled in this special class.

What family does he belong to? His family name doesn't sound familiar.

Do you recognize his last name?

- No.
- I'll Google it.

Not really. I just happened to do well today.

- About the land, I guess.

you should give me one of the hotels to manage.

Either a hotel in Krabi, Hua Hin, or Phuket.

You are just an in-law to this family.

The businesses will later be passed on to Nuengdiao.

I'm not good at managing a casino. You should find someone else to do it.

Then I guess there's nothing else for you to do.

Or should I tell your dad that you secretly used the swimming pool?

485
00:40:30,725 --> 00:40:34,833
I wonder how angry he will be.

486
00:40:49,276 --> 00:40:51,363
Then let me go with you.

487
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:53,508
I promise I won't tell anyone.

488
00:40:53,508 --> 00:40:56,116
I can't let you go alone.

489
00:40:57,068 --> 00:40:59,558
All right. You can come.

490
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:01,758
But keep your mouth closed.

491
00:41:10,953 --> 00:41:13,113
Khun Nu, let me climb over first.

492
00:41:13,113 --> 00:41:15,613
I'll catch you on the other side.

493
00:41:18,547 --> 00:41:20,211
Excuse me.

494
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:29,433
You can climb over. I'll catch you.

495
00:42:57,034 --> 00:42:59,327
Khun Nu, what are we doing here?

496
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:40,922
My father bought this building during the economic crisis.

497
00:43:40,922 --> 00:43:43,558
He planned to renovate it into high-end condos.

498
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:46,374
He told me to pick a space on any floor.

499
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,648
He would build a special condo for me,

500
00:43:48,648 --> 00:43:51,136
one unlike any other.

501
00:43:56,003 --> 00:43:58,273
This is the space that I picked.

502
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,337
He promised me here.

503
00:44:02,337 --> 00:44:06,176
He would build the condo for me when I turned eighteen.

504
00:44:07,656 --> 00:44:10,553
He was shot on my birthday.

505
00:44:17,368 --> 00:44:19,928
How do you think I am supposed to feel?

506
00:44:19,928 --> 00:44:22,513
My father died on my birthday

507
00:44:26,584 --> 00:44:29,576
- I'm sorry.
- Is that all you have to say?

508
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,142
Palm,

509
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:15,453
don't you think it's a bit too coincidental?

510
00:45:17,905 --> 00:45:22,824
Not long after my father was shot, Uncle Non took you into our house.

511
00:45:22,824 --> 00:45:25,653
He said you came to Bangkok to study,

512
00:45:25,653 --> 00:45:28,341
but the semester has already started.

513
00:45:36,618 --> 00:45:39,254
Did my mother bring you here to protect me?

514
00:45:45,738 --> 00:45:47,753
Yes.

515
00:45:47,753 --> 00:45:50,861
My father told me to protect you.

516
00:45:52,656 --> 00:45:55,291
You and I are quite similar.

517
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:57,308
We are our father's puppets.

518
00:45:57,308 --> 00:45:59,966
We have to do whatever our fathers tell us to do,

519
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,484
be whoever they tell us to be.

520
00:46:03,671 --> 00:46:07,253
We will never get to live the life that we want.

521
00:46:08,621 --> 00:46:12,421
My mom told me that she trusted me and wanted to see me become a leader.

522
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:16,753
She wanted me to be in charge of everything, but then you are sent to look over me.

523
00:46:17,799 --> 00:46:19,190
Is this what she called trust?

524
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:23,353
Khun Tanya loves you very much.

525
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,653
She is worried that someone may attack you.

526
00:46:33,553 --> 00:46:35,833
Are you sure you can protect me?

527
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:38,348
Can you protect me?

528
00:46:38,348 --> 00:46:42,390
A boy from a fisherman's village who only knows about fishing.

529
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:46,090
Suddenly, you are assigned to protect a wealthy boy.

530
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:48,241
Are you sure you can do it?

531
00:46:57,588 --> 00:46:59,753
It's my job.

532
00:46:59,753 --> 00:47:02,753
- I'll find a way to do it well.
- I don't need a bodyguard.

533
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:05,199
I need a friend.

534
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:07,501
I need someone I can talk to.

535
00:47:07,501 --> 00:47:09,808
I need someone to hang out with me.

536
00:47:09,808 --> 00:47:11,969
You said you will follow my order.

537
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:14,033
Can you be my friend?

538
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:24,531
After Piphop died, I always feel uneasy.

539
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:27,858
I'm worried about Nuengdiao.

540
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:30,693
I want to find someone to protect him.

541
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:36,877
Someone who can be with him all the time, when he is at home and school.

542
00:47:36,877 --> 00:47:39,373
Anything can happen to him.

543
00:47:40,176 --> 00:47:42,959
Can you help me, Chanon?

544
00:47:42,959 --> 00:47:45,989
You are the person I trust the most.

545
00:47:50,865 --> 00:47:53,231
Fresh longtail tuna from the sea.

546
00:47:53,231 --> 00:47:55,634
Only 230 baht per kilogram.

547
00:48:01,776 --> 00:48:04,774
Is there something wrong, Dad? Why did you come here?

548
00:48:04,774 --> 00:48:08,136
I'm here to take you to Bangkok. I have a job for you.

549
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:09,502
What job?

550
00:48:09,502 --> 00:48:11,809
You will be taking care of my boss's son.

551
00:48:11,809 --> 00:48:14,978
Your job will be to protect Khun Nuengdiao.

552
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:17,520
Don't let anything happen to him.

553
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,119
What about my life here? What about my job and school?

554
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,766
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of everything.

555
00:48:24,766 --> 00:48:26,653
You need to come with me no matter what.

556
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:30,633
Because I owe that family a lot, and so do you.

557
00:48:30,633 --> 00:48:35,099
Without them, you wouldn't be here today.

558
00:48:38,545 --> 00:48:41,042
Brace yourself for it.

559
00:48:41,042 --> 00:48:45,893
This could be a lifelong job for you.

560
00:48:48,448 --> 00:48:50,048
So?

561
00:48:50,685 --> 00:48:52,739
Can you be my friend?

562
00:48:58,391 --> 00:49:00,293
Of course.

563
00:49:00,293 --> 00:49:02,758
If that's what you want.

564
00:49:04,391 --> 00:49:06,773
I'll be your friend.

565
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:32,557
I am volunteering to be a piano player here.
[Next Week]

566
00:49:32,557 --> 00:49:34,748
You can leave.

567
00:49:38,259 --> 00:49:40,939
Why don't we dance to his song to cheer him on?

568
00:49:41,794 --> 00:49:44,848
If you want to learn Mandarin, you need to start by memorizing the vocabulary.

569
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:46,692
- I'm Chopper.
- I'm Palm.

570
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,802
- Can I talk to you casually?
- Sure.

571
00:49:48,802 --> 00:49:52,422
What are you listening to? Can I listen, too?

572
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:55,394
Did you notice that about me? I thought you only paid attention to Mackie.

573
00:49:55,394 --> 00:49:57,282
- Give it to me.
- Help me.

574
00:49:57,282 --> 00:50:00,254
- What the hell are you doing?
- Palm.

575
00:50:00,254 --> 00:50:04,890
♫ Don't be afraid even if we are apart ♫

576
