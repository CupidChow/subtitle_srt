Hello.

You should put yourself first sometimes.

00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:15,516
Your image is...

167
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,460
a good guy,

168
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,348
a leader.

169
00:10:20,348 --> 00:10:25,949
But I heard that you blamed Nueng for initiating the kiss.

170
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:27,747
He was mad at you for that.

171
00:10:27,747 --> 00:10:30,549
How could you consider yourself a good guy?

172
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,702
- What the hell did you just say?
- Why?

173
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:36,861
What are you going to do?

174
00:10:36,861 --> 00:10:40,049
You are a jackass just like me.

175
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:46,169
What the hell are you doing?

176
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:48,982
Asshole.

177
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:54,358
Let me go.

178
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:57,578
What? How dare you?

179
00:10:57,578 --> 00:10:59,212
Let's go.

180
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,582
Are you all right?

181
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,921
I'm all right.

182
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:14,716
Thanks a lot.

183
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:17,164
Can you get up?

184
00:11:17,164 --> 00:11:18,515
Of course I can.

185
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:22,087
I'm the class president. I'm not that weak.

186
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:26,115
You are the class president, not Wolverine.

187
00:11:52,652 --> 00:11:56,749
I'm sure that Phum was behind everything.

188
00:11:56,749 --> 00:12:00,649
Even though you are sure, you still need evidence.

189
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,297
I guess everyone knows... that I blamed Nuengdiao for the kiss.

190
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:16,456
That's what people are saying.

191
00:12:16,456 --> 00:12:18,515
Is that true?

192
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:23,715
No.

193
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:28,782
I was the one who asked to kiss him.

194
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,322
Why did you do that?

195
00:12:34,611 --> 00:12:36,549
Nueng must feel hurt.

196
00:12:38,118 --> 00:12:40,321
Because I am a coward.

197
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:43,983
I was selfish. I was afraid that my dad would scold me.

198
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:48,495
I was not as brave as Nueng.

199
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:51,135
He was not afraid to talk back to my dad.

200
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:52,937
To be honest,

201
00:12:55,298 --> 00:12:58,915
I was impressed by his bravery.

202
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:02,915
After I heard that he went missing...

203
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,615
and about his family's unfortunate event,

204
00:13:06,615 --> 00:13:09,415
I feel so guilty.

205
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:11,715
I want to apologize to him.

206
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:16,815
But I'm not sure if he will forgive me.

207
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:38,715
Do you think he will come back?

208
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:47,982
Of course.

209
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:51,349
You will have your chance to apologize to him.

210
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,374
To tell the truth,

211
00:13:59,374 --> 00:14:01,558
I confessed my feelings to him.

212
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:03,578
It was because you encouraged me.

213
00:14:04,473 --> 00:14:06,315
I didn't encourage you.

214
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:10,217
I just understand how it feels to have a crush on someone.

215
00:14:12,957 --> 00:14:19,349
How tormenting it feels to be unable to show your feelings.

216
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:23,649
It's a terrible feeling.

217
00:14:24,983 --> 00:14:27,243
So I wanted you to have a happy ending.

218
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:29,985
Why?

219
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:35,176
Would you be happy if I got my happy ending?

220
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:37,249
What would you get from that?

221
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:45,358
I wouldn't get anything from it.

222
00:14:45,358 --> 00:14:51,150
I just wanted to see my cousin and my old friend end up together.

223
00:14:52,155 --> 00:14:54,649
Do I need any other reasons?

224
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:06,368
I need to go back to my class.

225
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:08,382
Don't get into trouble again.

226
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,943
I wanted to bring them here.

227
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:31,616
He wanted to go to a beautiful place and propose to his boyfriend.

228
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,184
Then this is the perfect place.

229
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,249
I think it's very romantic.

230
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:44,685
So when you brought me here, did you want to have a romantic gesture?

231
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:50,182
Do you think it's romantic?

232
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:54,282
If you think so, it means I achieved my goal.

233
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,894
When will he propose?

234
00:16:02,894 --> 00:16:04,171
How would I know that?

235
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:09,305
I think he is waiting for the right timing and moment.

236
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:12,982
When he gets down on his knee, I will take a video of it.

237
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:17,782
I'm also waiting for my moment.

238
00:16:26,498 --> 00:16:27,505
Hurry up.

239
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:29,369
He's getting down on his knee.

240
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,084
David.

241
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:46,082
Some people say we do not belong together.

242
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:49,449
We are so different.

243
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:52,549
But I see our difference is good.

244
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:55,949
Because I can learn about you.

245
00:16:58,109 --> 00:17:01,749
I want to share my life with you.

246
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,341
You are my friend,

247
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:05,947
my family,

248
00:17:05,947 --> 00:17:07,749
my soulmate.

249
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:10,549
So...

250

Yes.

252

Yes, I do.

253
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,650
Sure.

254
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,320
Yes, I do. Yes.

♫ Here is where I belong ♫

261
00:18:21,238 --> 00:18:24,882
Khun Nueng, are you all right? Do your feet hurt?

262
00:18:25,577 --> 00:18:29,082
Yes. I guess I walked too much today.

263
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:35,662
Do you want a foot massage?

264
00:18:35,662 --> 00:18:37,718
I know a little about it.

265
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:41,197
Why do you know so many things?

266
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:43,658
It's okay. I will go to bed soon.

267
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:48,487
You won't be able to fall asleep if your feet hurt.

268
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:51,377
I think you should soak your feet in warm water.

269
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:53,435
I'll prepare it for you.

270
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:15,972
Let me help you.

271
00:19:24,948 --> 00:19:26,699
Khun Nueng, did you know that

272
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:30,916
soaking your feet in warm water can help you sleep better?

273
00:19:31,782 --> 00:19:34,442
You seem to have a lot of random knowledge.

274
00:19:35,536 --> 00:19:39,358
After coming home after working on a fishing boat, my feet would hurt so much.

275
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:43,382
I learned that soaking my feet in warm water can help.

276
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:59,582
How deeply in love a person must be to decide to propose...

277
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:02,969
and spend the rest of their lives together?

278
00:20:06,714 --> 00:20:09,382
Have you ever loved someone that much?

279
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:17,284
No.

280
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:21,151
Me, niether.

281
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:27,549
I think I will never find that kind of love.

282
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:33,391
I'm a bad-luck guy.

283
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:37,356
On the outside itt looks like I have everything, but there's one thing I don't have.

284
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:39,059
Happiness.

285
00:20:44,975 --> 00:20:47,982
I think you will find it one day.

286
00:20:48,827 --> 00:20:50,339
Really?

287
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:54,982
Who will be able to put up with my bad temper?

288
00:20:58,895 --> 00:21:01,582
You are not bad-tempered.

289
00:21:01,582 --> 00:21:03,582
You are just a bit stubborn.

290
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:07,241
You have a way to view it in a positive light.

291

It's 500 baht per hour?

Kiddo.

302

Do you see that path?

304
00:23:09,124 --> 00:23:11,301
You follow it and keep walking straight until you reach the end of the path.

305
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:13,047
Then you go home.

Are you crazy? Who will pay you 500 baht per hour?

Have you ever worked before?

308

I'm fine with 400 baht per hour.

Work on a boat?

328

You will work on a fishing boat? Do you know how to fish?

No.

00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:36,849
But I can learn. I'm a quick learner.

331
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:40,161
I admit that there are things that you can learn fast.

332
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:43,915
But it's not easy to work in the middle of the sea,

333
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,028
Why?

334
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:47,227
You can do it. So can I.

335
00:24:47,227 --> 00:24:49,117
How hard could it be?

336
00:24:50,126 --> 00:24:51,437
Khun Nueng.

337
00:24:51,437 --> 00:24:55,416
You need to admit that there are things that I can do better than you.

338
00:24:58,027 --> 00:24:59,342
Let's go back to the hostel.

339
00:24:59,342 --> 00:25:02,262
We can take our time to figure out how to get the money.

340
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:12,012
I'm sorry.

341
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:14,692
I'm quitting.

342
00:25:14,692 --> 00:25:16,432
How can you do that?

343
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:20,416
Kids these days have no patience and perseverance.

344
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:22,724
How can you quit the job after working for only half of a day?

345
00:25:22,724 --> 00:25:24,915
I'm not paying you.

346
00:25:24,915 --> 00:25:26,423
How will I find a new worker?

347
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:28,849
Go away. Get out of here.

348
00:26:27,304 --> 00:26:28,652
What did you pray for?

349
00:26:28,652 --> 00:26:30,142
Why did you pray so quietly?

350
00:26:30,142 --> 00:26:33,251
How would God hear your wish?

351
00:26:35,381 --> 00:26:39,849
I prayed for the safety of the people that I love.

352
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:44,215
Who are the people that you love?

353
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,517
My dad.

354
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:50,417
My mom.

355
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,315
And...

356
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:57,215
What about me?

357
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:06,449
Yes, you are included.

358
00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:17,015
If you want them to stay safe, you need to shout it out like this.

359
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:19,715
God, please keep my mom safe!

360
00:27:20,468 --> 00:27:22,011
Khun Nueng.

361
00:27:22,011 --> 00:27:24,262
People are staring at you.

362
00:27:24,262 --> 00:27:26,249
Why did you shout so loudly?

363
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:28,349
Try it.

364
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:30,784
It really works. God will speed up our wish.

365
00:27:30,784 --> 00:27:32,529
Khun Nueng, don't try to fool me.

366
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:33,670
I'm not.

367
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:37,852
If you say it out loud, your voice will reach heaven.

368

371
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,316
Please keep Khun Nueng safe!

372
00:27:56,316 --> 00:27:59,224

00:28:52,484 --> 00:28:54,536
My prediction is not good.

377
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:56,517
What about yours?

378
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,227
"You will have tough days ahead."

379
00:29:07,227 --> 00:29:13,293
"Your love won't go as you wish."

380
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:17,048
"You need to do more good deeds to lessen the bad luck."

381
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:21,624
"This is an honest message to you."

382
00:29:25,112 --> 00:29:26,179
It's not good.

383
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:28,752
It said I will lose things that I love.

384
00:29:29,955 --> 00:29:34,416
We got bad predictions. What should we do?

385
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,416
We put it back.

386
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,316
So bad luck won't follow us.

387
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,473
Hey.

388
00:30:02,616 --> 00:30:07,249
You said that your family owed a lot to my family.

389
00:30:07,966 --> 00:30:10,701
Can I ask you what happened?

390
00:30:10,701 --> 00:30:14,115
Why is Uncle Non so loyal to my family?

391
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:24,121
I found out from my dad on the day that you were sent to the hospital.

392
00:30:33,847 --> 00:30:37,917
I know that I'm acting like I'm their running dog.

393
00:30:41,384 --> 00:30:44,251
It's because I knew that I owed them.

394
00:30:44,251 --> 00:30:46,321
Both you and I.

395
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:50,515
They gave us new lives.

396
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:55,217
Did you know this?

397
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:59,175
When your mom left me,

398
00:31:00,386 --> 00:31:02,850
my life was falling apart.

399
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:06,589
I lost my job. I was addicted to alcohol.

400
00:31:07,356 --> 00:31:10,550
I was a complete loser.

401
00:31:12,184 --> 00:31:14,339
When you were sick,

402
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,286
I didn't have money to take you to a hospital.

403
00:31:17,286 --> 00:31:19,597
Miss, please help my son.

404
00:31:19,597 --> 00:31:21,198
My son is very sick.

405
00:31:21,198 --> 00:31:23,419
- What are his symptoms?
- He has a heart valve disease.

406
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:26,984
Let's take him to the emergency room. Please follow me.

407
00:31:26,984 --> 00:31:29,552
If you don't pay for the medical bill, we can't treat to son.

408
00:31:29,552 --> 00:31:32,155
Can you treat him first? I'll go find the money .

409
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:35,684
No matter the cost, I'll find a way to pay for it.

410
00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:37,351
I'm begging you.

411
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,990
- I'm begging you, I'm begging you. Please!
- We can't do that.

412
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,127
Please take a seat.

413
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:45,182
No, Nurse. Will my son get the surgery?

414
00:31:45,182 --> 00:31:46,745
You need to calm down. Please sit down.

415
00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:48,585
I know. I'm not going anywhere.

416
00:31:48,585 --> 00:31:51,449
- My son will get the treatment, right?
- Yes.

417
00:31:55,005 --> 00:31:57,669
Is there anything I can help you with?

418
00:31:57,669 --> 00:31:59,782
I don't have the money to pay for my son's surgery.

419
00:31:59,782 --> 00:32:02,349
Can I borrow the money from you?

420
00:32:02,349 --> 00:32:04,750
Please. I'll pay every penny back.

421
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,473
If I don't get the money, my son will die.

422
00:32:06,473 --> 00:32:08,316
Please calm down.

423
00:32:08,316 --> 00:32:11,116
I'll go talk to the hospital.

424
00:32:11,116 --> 00:32:15,549
About his medical bill, I'll take care of it.

425
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:17,916
Are you really going to help my son?

426
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:20,778
You have a son, right?

427
00:32:20,778 --> 00:32:23,217
Yes, I have only one son.

428
00:32:26,423 --> 00:32:28,371
I also have only one son.

429
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:30,209

430

Thank you, thank you.

432

Thank you. I can't thank you enough.

434
00:32:45,015 --> 00:32:47,494
our lives became much better.

435
00:32:47,494 --> 00:32:51,515
I got a new life. My dad also had a new life.

436
00:32:53,365 --> 00:32:59,275
My dad told me that we owed our lives to the Kiattrakulmethee family.

437

Hey.

438
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,316
No one is the owner of your life.

439
00:33:07,316 --> 00:33:09,251
We are all living our own lives.

440
00:33:09,251 --> 00:33:11,119
You, too.

441

What is the current condition of Khun Thanya?

442
00:33:23,197 --> 00:33:25,932
Her condition is still critical.

443
00:33:25,932 --> 00:33:27,919
The bullet damaged important organs.

444
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,852
She is still unconscious. We don't know when she will wake up.

445
00:33:30,852 --> 00:33:32,964
The doctor can't tell us too.

446
00:33:32,964 --> 00:33:36,712
What about Khun Thanya's son, Nuengdiao? Where is he now?

447
00:33:36,712 --> 00:33:38,654
I still don't have any clues of his whereabouts.

448
00:33:38,654 --> 00:33:42,004
The Police are working to find him.

449
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:48,587
As his uncle, there's something I want to say.

450
00:33:48,587 --> 00:33:51,649
Nuengdiao is my nephew whom I love very much.

451
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:54,952
He is talented and kind-hearted.

452

I'm praying that nothing bad happens to him.

What about the rumor that you are suspected of this crime,

455
00:34:02,705 --> 00:34:07,429
because you want to be the main shareholder of the company?

456

How could you say something that?

457
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:16,701
No matter how severe the conflicts in our family are, I would never attempt kill them.

458
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:20,408
If you still have doubts about me, I'm ready and willing to prove my innocence.

I give my word here.

No matter what,

461
00:34:24,914 --> 00:34:30,078
I will do everything to find Nuengdiao and bring him back.

462

Can I ask you for real?

Were you behind the attack on Nuengdiao's family?

I don't know.

I saw you fighting with Aunt Thanya about the hotel business.

468

You are the only one who has the motives to order the attack.

469
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:49,515
If I tell you that I did it, what would you do?

470
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:55,049
Did you really do it?

471
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:56,471
How could you do that?

472
00:35:56,471 --> 00:35:58,504
They are your family. How could you order a hit them?

473
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:01,516
They never thought of me as their family.

474
00:36:02,574 --> 00:36:03,671
Huh?

475
00:36:03,671 --> 00:36:08,516
You saw how his parents treated me.

476
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:11,216
They treated me like a loser.

477
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,628
I just wanted to prove that I could do everything that they believed I couldn't.

478
00:36:17,628 --> 00:36:19,704
It's unfortunate.

479
00:36:19,704 --> 00:36:22,131
No one from that family will live to see it.

What are you planning to do with Palm and Nuengdiao?

481
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:31,979
I didn't do anything to them.

482
00:36:31,979 --> 00:36:36,275
They went missing. I ordered my men to look for them.

I will play the song that I wrote.

You wrote a song?

Yes. I've never shown it to anyone before.

There's no piano here.

I can play an electric piano.

Tam, can I borrow the electric piano from the bar?

00:38:12,283 --> 00:38:14,831
Sure. It's in the storage room, you can take it.

00:43:09,372 --> 00:43:12,549
You looked like a married couple.

So?

00:43:26,282 --> 00:43:27,475
Did you kiss him?

559
00:43:27,475 --> 00:43:28,875
Huh?

560
00:43:30,821 --> 00:43:35,147
Are you blushing because you are drunk or shy?

561
00:43:37,793 --> 00:43:40,672
You surely kissed him.

562
00:43:43,027 --> 00:43:46,144
How was it? How did you feel?

563
00:43:49,173 --> 00:43:51,515
It felt good.

564
00:43:54,155 --> 00:43:55,291
Did you sleep with him?

565
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:57,546
Huh? Why did you ask me that?

566
00:43:57,546 --> 00:43:59,586
You should go to bed. You are drunk.

I kissed him to comfort him.

You are a gentleman protecting him from the bad guys.

You know what?

573
00:44:18,607 --> 00:44:21,964
Your dad loved me very much.

574
00:44:21,964 --> 00:44:26,949
He loved me so much that I didn't have any freedom.

575
00:44:26,949 --> 00:44:32,518
It felt like... I couldn't breathe.

576
00:44:32,518 --> 00:44:36,949
One day, I couldn't take it anymore.

577
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:40,206
So I left you and your dad,

578
00:44:40,206 --> 00:44:44,316
even though I loved you and your dad very much.

579
00:44:50,481 --> 00:44:55,149
If you really loved each other, how could you leave him?

580
00:44:55,149 --> 00:45:00,052
Palm, our lives are not only about love.

581
00:45:00,052 --> 00:45:06,621
It's not like we are dating, sleeping together, getting married, and that's it.

00:45:08,795 --> 00:45:12,318

585
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,667
I'm hugging you. Don't you know what it is?

586
00:45:42,525 --> 00:45:45,016
Did you secretly have a drink?

587
00:45:45,016 --> 00:45:47,482
I told you that you shouldn't drink.

588
00:45:47,482 --> 00:45:49,495
If you had shortness of breath, what would you do?

589
00:45:49,495 --> 00:45:54,326
How could I get a chance to drink when you had kept an eye on me all night?

590
00:45:54,326 --> 00:45:58,001
If I looked drunk, it's because I got drunk on their love.

591
00:45:58,001 --> 00:45:59,967
Love is in the air.

592
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:07,171

The song that you wrote is beautiful.

595
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:27,375
When you played the piano, you looked very happy.

596

You know what?

597
00:46:31,713 --> 00:46:36,373
I can't remember the last time that I felt this happy.

598
00:46:37,781 --> 00:46:42,682
While staying on this island, I don't need to be a Young Master.

599
00:46:42,682 --> 00:46:45,475
I can forget about my family's expectations of me.

600
00:46:45,475 --> 00:46:47,324
I'm just an ordinary guy.

601
00:46:47,324 --> 00:46:48,949
I became a new person.

602
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:52,594
I can see that.

603
00:46:52,594 --> 00:46:55,149
You smile more often.

604
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,443
When you smile,

605
00:46:58,443 --> 00:47:01,469
it makes people around you feel happy too.

606
00:47:06,228 --> 00:47:12,456
Do the "people around me" mean the person who is next to me right now?

607
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,351
Yes.

608
00:47:18,495 --> 00:47:22,148
Since we got here, you seem less shy and have become bold.

609
00:47:23,848 --> 00:47:26,349
It may be because this is my home.

610
00:47:26,987 --> 00:47:29,449
Just like Bangkok is your home.

611

No. Asidefrom my mom who is in a coma, I have no one else.

612

When I saw the love between Wu and David today,

613
00:48:02,715 --> 00:48:06,043
I thought they were cute.

614

00:48:13,235 --> 00:48:15,235
No.

618

I just want to have a boyfriend.

619
00:48:17,449 --> 00:48:19,366

and to love.

622
00:48:27,136 --> 00:48:32,149
I told you that you would find that person one day.

623
00:48:38,793 --> 00:48:41,049
What if I don't want to wait anymore?

624
00:48:42,175 --> 00:48:44,426
I want to have him right now.

What do you want?

626
00:48:53,717 --> 00:48:56,815
Since I became a new person after coming to this island,

627
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,915
I want to try new things.

00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,572
Freeze.

656
00:51:45,572 --> 00:51:47,449
Put the gun down.

657
00:51:48,777 --> 00:51:50,949
Put it down slowly.

658
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:55,938
Put your hands behind your head.

659
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,349
Arrest them.

660
00:52:01,672 --> 00:52:06,212
You are arrested as accomplices in Khun Thanya Kitttrakulmethee's attack.

661
00:52:06,212 --> 00:52:08,126
I didn't do it.

662
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:09,181
Take them.

663
00:52:09,181 --> 00:52:10,580
- Wait, Officer.
- Take them.

664
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:13,330
Wait, let me explain, Officer. You got the wrong man.

665
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,629
- I didn't do it.
- Take them to the police station.

666
00:52:15,629 --> 00:52:18,148
Officer, listen to me. You got the wrong man.

667
00:52:18,148 --> 00:52:19,987
I didn't do it.

668
00:52:23,696 --> 00:52:26,715
[Next Week]
Why are people willing to do everything for love?

669
00:52:26,715 --> 00:52:28,517
You'd better focus on your problem first.

670
00:52:28,517 --> 00:52:30,117
What are you going to do with Nuengdiao?

671
00:52:30,117 --> 00:52:35,149
What I'm worried about the most right now is Nuengdiao's safety.

672
00:52:35,149 --> 00:52:36,982
You should think about yourself, too.

673
00:52:36,982 --> 00:52:39,637
You need to have your own life.

674
00:52:39,637 --> 00:52:42,385
Let me go!

675
00:52:42,385 --> 00:52:43,412
Nueng!

676
00:52:43,412 --> 00:52:45,650
We need to rescue your mom.

677
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:48,710
If we're going to do that, we need a plan.

678
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:55,500
