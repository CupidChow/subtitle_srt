Maybe because you think of me this way, we no longer are close friends.

Palm, if you are going to ride to school with him, you should arrive before him.

How could you let your boss wait for you? Do you understand?

- I'm sorry.
- Get in the front seat.

I don't want to sit alone.

One more thing: if someone sees him getting out of the car, he won't be teased about it.

It's okay. He can handle it.

00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,390
You should give him some space to live his own life.

167
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,399
He doesn't need a bodyguard.

168
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,937
I don't think anyone is planning to kill him;

169
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,100
it's just bullying at school.

170
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,500
I'm the class president,

171
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,460
and I can handle it.

172
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,500
So you will have time to do whatever you want.

173
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,340
Don't you like basketball? Why don't you apply for the Basketball Club? Do you want me to do that for you?

174
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,513
It's okay. I can manage my own schedule.

175
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,500
Okay. That's up to you.

176
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,950
I do have something to tell you.

177
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,150
Lately, you will see me around often.

178
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,850
So...

179
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,500
I hope you have a little more trust in me.

180
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,427
I won't hurt Nuengdiao.

181
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,410
- Ben.
- Maggie.

182
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,153
Are you here to play music?

183
00:13:28,153 --> 00:13:31,583
No, I'm here to support Nuengdiao.

184
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,740
Why do so many people come here to cheer on Nuengdiao?

185
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,440
Both you and Palm.

186
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,730
I was the one who told him about the position.

187
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,590
I need to see him with my own eyes.

188
00:13:44,797 --> 00:13:46,900
The elderly like him.

189
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,820
Seeing young people here helps them feel younger.

190
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,100
The club will hold a party.

191
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,650
You must come because it's a really cute party.

192
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,720
People will wear costumes.

193
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,450
It will be the day that I look the prettiest.

194
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,310
Palm, you can come, too.

195
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,960
Don't forget to dress up. You can come dance with me.

196
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,230
You don't need to invite him. He doesn't like dancing

197
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,820
as he prefers physical activities.

198
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,250
If you dance with him, he might step on your foot.

199
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,370
If you come often and practice dancing with me, you will get good at it before the party.

200
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,070
Believe me.

201
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,620
Nuengdiao, good job. You're amazing!

202
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,780
Thank you, Maggie.

203
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,200
- Are you done?
- Yes.

204

They will turn on music for them to dance .

205
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,760
Anyway, what are you doing here?

206
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,950
I came to see the person who said he doesn't know how to play the piano,

207
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,160
can't play the piano, or is bad at the piano.

208
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,300
You're being too modest.

209
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,070
You play like a professional.

210
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,110
- You're overstating.
- I mean it.

211
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,840
I love this song.

212
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,540
My dad used to play it when I was little to teach me to dance.

213
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,230
The song makes me feel good and want to dance along to it.

214
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,930
Do you want to dance with me? I'll teach you.

215
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,200
It's okay.

216
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,900
I'm not good at counting dance steps.

217
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,723
It's okay. You will get better after practicing,

218
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:32,850
especially with a good trainer like me.

219
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,050
Come on, let's go, Palm.

220
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,360
Give it a try.

221

Put your hand on my back.

222

Hold my other hand.

223
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,400
Do you want to dance with me?

224
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,390
No. It's not my thing.

225
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,660
It's just dancing along to the music.

226
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,779
I'll lead you in a dance.

227
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,680
You don't need to be serious if you get it wrong.

228
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,741
No one is watching you.

241

Khun Thanya, how will you handle the tenants who are currently filing complaints against you?

242
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,880
Is there anything unusual in the lease contracts?

243
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,000
The land lease agreement has reached the end of its 30-year term.

244
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,680
Our company is looking for a new form of investment that is more suitable to today's world.

245
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,720
Many tenants said they didn't know about it.

246
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,480
That's impossible.

247
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,330
We have informed them one year in advance.

248
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:45,310
We also told them that we are willing to give compensation to those who are affected.

249
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,320
Like everyone here, I'm also affected by it.

250
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,190
My agreement with the company,

251
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,860
it was signed when Phiphop was managing the business.

252
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,280
We had this agreement a long time ago.

253
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,560
After Phiphop's wife took over his position, she made changes to the agreement.

254
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,380
This is not right. She can't do that.

255
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,760
Everything that I've been building is…

256
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,727
What's wrong? Why do you look so stressed?

257
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,130
I saw the news about the land eviction.

258
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,952
So I'm worried about you.

259
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,320
You don't need to worry about me.

260
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,610
It's not a big deal. I can handle it.

261
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,590
This land is ours.

262
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,650
We need to take it back.

263
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,800
We have let them do business on our land for too long.

264
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,520
They also use our land for a business that is our competitor.

265
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,725
We didn't do anything wrong, Nueng.

266
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,627
Can I ask you something?

267
00:21:59,627 --> 00:22:02,880
Do you really want to take over Dad's position in the company?

268
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:08,473
I don't want people to hate you. I don't want to see you being attacked.

269
00:22:08,473 --> 00:22:12,430
But this is what I have to do.

270
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,780
I don't trust others enough to let them take over.

271
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,069
I'm working hard.

272
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:22,360
I'm doing all this for you.

273
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,750
You know this, don't you?

274
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:30,410
Soon you will take over after me.

275
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,040
You need to take better care of yourself. You need to be careful.

276
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,760
After Dad passed, the world seems more dangerous.

Yes. I enrolled Palm in your shooting class.

281
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,470
So you will have a friend.

282
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,860
I want you to open up to him.

283

He may be different from you.

284

he will be someone that you can trust.

Don't worry about me.

- Okay?
- Yes.

I can take care of myself.

289
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,290
There are the four rules of firearm safety.

290
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:53,310
The first rule is to treat all guns as though they are loaded.

291
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,800
The second rule is to only point your gun in the direction of your target.

292
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,720
The third rule is keeping your index finger off the trigger.

293
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,050
The fourth rule is being sure of your target,

294
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:17,770
and making sure that your bullet won't harm anyone else besides your target.

295
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,750
Why are you so good at shooting?

296
00:24:42,727 --> 00:24:44,650
How long have you been shooting?

297
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,430
For several years.

298
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:49,490
When I went to work on a fishing boat, I always carried a gun.

299
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,130
In case there were any thieves.

300
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,500
When you pull the trigger, what are you thinking?

301
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,950
Are you thinking about the person you hate? The one that you want to kill.

302
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,700
No. I don't use hatred to drive me.

303
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,810
When I pull the trigger,

304
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,720
I'm thinking that I am protecting someone.

305
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,930
Someone important in my life.

306
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,760
Someone that I love.

307
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,020
Someone that I really care about.

308
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,990
Someone who I can't live without.

309
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,219
When I think of that person,

310
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:26,230
I feel more determined.

311
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:31,840
Love is much more powerful than hate.

312
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,340
Khun Nueng, why don't you give it a try?

313
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:42,067
Think about the person you love the most. The person that you will die for.

314
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:43,890
Do you have that person?

315
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,560
My mom.

316
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,660
My mom is the one I care about the most.

317
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,230
Then think about her when you pull the trigger.

318
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,760
Try to aim at the target.

319
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,025
Imagine that you are protecting your mom.

320
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,280
What about you?

321
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,540
When you pull the trigger, who are you thinking of?

322
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,378
Do you have a person that you love the most?

♫ I will live only for you ♫

327
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,260
Hey. What are you doing here?

328
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,960
My dad came to talk to your mom.

329
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,680
I guess it's something important.

330
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,960
On the way here, he took his frustration out on me.

331
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,890
What about you? How is your plan going?

332
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,290
Did you become rich from stock trading?

333
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,130
Did you become a young billionaire?

334
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:03,480
I think the one who should be called a young billionaire is you.

335
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,120
My goal is still far away.

336
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,970
But you will definitely become the owner of a hotel business soon.

337
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,640
Do I need to call you "CEO Nueng"?

338
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,440
Nonsense.

339
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,933
Can I ask you something?

340
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:18,312
You're close to Ben, the class president, aren't you?

341
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,550
We used to be close when we were in 10th grade.

342
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,430
Why?

343
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,217
Nothing. He asked me to join the music club.

344
00:28:29,217 --> 00:28:31,977
So I want to know what kind of person he is.

345
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,600
He's nice.

346
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,200
He's very talented.

347
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,240
So everyone loves him. That's why he was elected class president.

348
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,380
Why aren't you still close with him?

349
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,331
How should I explain it?

350
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,010
As we grew up, we had different interests.

351
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,120
That was why we drifted apart.

352
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,600
Don't get too close to him.

353
00:29:00,717 --> 00:29:03,117
He can't stay close to someone for long.

354
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,540
What do you mean?

355
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,130
Nothing. I'm just talking gibberish.

356
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,040
You will know him after spending time together.

357
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,740
Let me ask you for real.

358
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,180
Are you sure you can take care of all the businesses?

359
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:29,010
Our company owns many hotels. The management cost is escalating.

360
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,600
Why do you need to keep them all to yourself?

361
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,750
Your husband is dead. You have only one son.

362
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,800
Nuengdiao shows no interest in the business.

363
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,560
Look at my son, Chopper.

364
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,700
He has better potential. He earns hundreds of thousands of baht from stock trading every day.

365
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,193
That's good. You and your son can open your own business.

366
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,290
You don't need to worry about Nuengdiao.

367
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,780
I'll teach him.

368
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,960
He has a lot of time to learn from me.

369
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,510
He's talented enough to excel in anything he does.

370
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,280
I hope he does well.

371
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,883
His dad is dead.

372
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:08,683
His mom makes enemies everywhere.

373
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:11,700
You are lucky that the conflicts aren't serious.

374
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,136
But if you continue on this path, it's not that I'm cursing you...

375
00:30:15,136 --> 00:30:17,455
It will be dangerous.

376
00:30:17,455 --> 00:30:22,510
Do you need to get hurt more than you already did before you give in?

377
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,073
Are you worried about me or threatening me?

378
00:30:32,073 --> 00:30:33,773
I'm worried.

379
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,540
I'm worried about both you and Nuengdiao.

380
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,630
If something happens to you, what will Nueng do?

381
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,210
Do you want him to become an orphan?

382
00:30:47,937 --> 00:30:52,050
Thank you for worrying about my family,

383
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,030
but you don't need to worry about Nuengdiao.

384
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,020
If something happens to me,

385
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:01,740
the only one who has the right to take over the business of the Kiattrakulmethee is Nuengdiao.

386
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,950
Are you sure he can handle it?

387
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,000
There are dozens of enemies out there.

388
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,980
Give him some time.

389
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,128
I will be strong enough.

390
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,500
One more thing.

391
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,750
External enemies are not as scary as internal enemies.

392
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,700
Internal enemies can cause deeper wounds.

393
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,373
It's hard to get rid of them.

394
00:31:31,373 --> 00:31:33,733
They never feel full no matter how much you feed them.

395
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:42,550
I hope that Nuengdiao won't end up like his dad.

Yes. My dad works here.

Why are you so polite to me?

400
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,100
Just talk to me like when we are at school.

401

It's okay.

She sends you to the same school as Nuengdiao.

404

Do you need to act as his servant when you are at school?

405

I'm sorry if my words offended you.

I didn't mean it.

407

I promise. I won't tell anyone at school.

408

I don't want them to tease you.

How can Chanon afford an expensive school for you?

Khun Thanya helps us with that.

Khun Thanya is generous.

She does charity work for education.

425
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:54,000
She gives a less fortunate kid a good opportunity in life. That's good.

426
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,760

00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,450
That's right.

489
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,340
The contract that my family signed with your father is also not fair.

490
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,390
After he died, your mom canceled the contract.

491
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:59,180
Do you know how much money my family lost as a result of it?

492
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,240
My family is breaking apart.

493
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,470
My dad tried to kill himself.

494
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,120
It's all because of your capitalist parents.

495
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,530
Is that why you bully me?

496
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,620
You are behind all those pranks, cutting my bag and the flyers.

497
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,720
Yes.

498
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,390
I want everyone to know that your father was a jackass.

499
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:30,900
As his son, you don't deserve anything good that he left behind.

500
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,030
Your dad was a jackass.

501
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,820
So you should be treated like a jackass.

502
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,030
Okay.

503
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,619
I understand why you are angry.

504
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:50,853
I won't ask for anything from you, except for the necklace that my dad gave me.

505
00:40:50,853 --> 00:40:52,710
He gave it to me before he died.

506
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,263
That's all I want.

507
00:40:54,263 --> 00:40:56,211
And let's call it off here.

508
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,890
This necklace,

509
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,880
is it a gift from him?

510
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,180
It reminds you of your trashy cheating father.

511
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,570
Your mom is now carrying on his trashy legacy.

512
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,280
Your family are all cheaters.

513
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,350
Your whole family are cheaters.

514
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:16,500
Your dad deserves to rot in hell.

515
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,680
Stop talking bad about my dad.

516
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,260
Why?

517
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,470
I won't stop.

518
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,170
Your dad deserved to be dead.

519
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,460
Your dad is dead.

520
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,810
Your trashy dad won't wake up and come back to you.

521
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,190
Your dad is dead.

522
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,050
Asshole, stop talking about my dad!

523
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,690
Do you want to try me?

524
00:41:36,487 --> 00:41:38,307
What the hell are you doing?

525
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,577
Khun Nueng, are you all right?

526
00:41:43,577 --> 00:41:45,170
Khun Nueng.

527
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,359
Khun Nueng, why do you need to butt in?

528
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,618
This is between me and Nuengdiao.

529
00:41:49,618 --> 00:41:50,910
Get lost!

530
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,680
Why can't I butt in?

531
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,600
Why are you protecting him?

532
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,600
Are you his underling?

533
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,942
Or his boyfriend?

534
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:11,900
Now, Khun Nuengdiao, the mafia's son, has a handsome boyfriend protecting him.

535
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,820
All right.

536
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,890
If you want to butt in, then bring it on.

537
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,380
He's too scared.

538
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,980
Khun Nueng, are you all right?

539
00:42:31,187 --> 00:42:32,440
Are you okay?

540
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,140
Palm!

541
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,090
Palm, watch out!

542
00:42:43,147 --> 00:42:45,047
Palm.

543
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,428
Palm, behind you!

544
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,380
Phum.

545
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,340
Khun Nueng!

546
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:36,337
Palm, that's enough!

547
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,620
What are you thinking?

548
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:47,651
Are you thinking about the person that you hate? The one that you want dead.

549
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,630
Palm, that's enough!

550
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,900
What are you doing? Stop it!

551
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,980
Break it up! Stop it!

552
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:02,490
No.

553
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:05,429
I'm thinking that I am protecting someone.

554
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,420
Someone who I can't live without.

555
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,860
How are you?

556
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:33,900
Phum was sent to a hospital.

557
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,290
His condition is quite serious.

558
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:37,660
Palm was a bit too violent.

559
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,360
What about Palm?

560
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,930
How is he?

561
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,923
His condition is pretty bad.

562
00:44:44,923 --> 00:44:47,343
He was sent home.

563
00:44:47,343 --> 00:44:49,070
He will probably get disciplinary probation.

564
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:51,330
I don't know how severe his punishment will be.

565
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,530
The teacher will announce it later.

566
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,310
Are you all right?

567
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,350
I'm sorry that I didn't help you.

568
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:03,803
It's okay.

569
00:45:03,803 --> 00:45:06,163
Thank you for all you have done for me.

570
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,370
Do you need my help?

571
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,430
It's okay, Khun Nueng. I can do it myself.

572
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:29,660
Don't be stubborn.

573
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,060
Give it to me.

574
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,480
Give it to me.

575
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,840
Don't move.

576
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,440
Stay still.

577
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:50,930
Do you know that you will get into trouble for helping me?

578
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:53,900
Photos of Phum are spreading.

579
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,590
He was beaten up badly.

580
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:59,080
I think the whole school is probably afraid of you.

581
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,237
Are you afraid of me?

582
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,980
No. I'm a bit surprised.

583
00:46:08,987 --> 00:46:11,767
What made you that furious?

584
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,720
I think it was instinct.

585
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,640
Instinct?

586
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,850
Then you have a crazy instinct.

587
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,840
You did it without worrying about yourself.

588
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:29,180
The person that I need to worry about is you.

589
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,450
Whatever reasons you have,

590
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:39,050
next time, you need to think about your future before you do anything.

591
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:40,970
You can let me get hurt sometimes.

592
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:43,680
So I can learn my lesson from it.

593
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,610
We can learn from our wounds.

594
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:51,507
Next time, you don't need to be that protective of me.

595
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,970
When did you get it back?

596
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,240
When I was fighting with him.

597
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,890
When I saw a chance, I pulled it off him.

598
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,060
Thanks.

599
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,450
I'm really very thankful.

600
00:47:56,298 --> 00:47:58,632
I'd better go back to my room.

601
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,570
Can you stay with me? I want to talk to someone.

602
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:42,723
[Next Week]
My room is big.

603
00:48:42,723 --> 00:48:45,003
I get lonely sometimes.

604
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:49,720
Even if you come sleep with me, there's still plenty of space in my room.

605
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,280
If you really like him,

606
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,490
you should tell him.

607
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:57,170
I…

608
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,260
I like you.

609
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,580
You can dance with her, but why don't you want to dance with me?

610
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:04,380
What the hell is wrong with you?
