00:12:54,027 --> 00:12:55,991
What about the Vegetarian Festival?

164
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:59,249
It is held every year. The celebration of the festival is also very big.

165
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:01,000
I also like vegetarian food.

166
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,910
It's not a holiday. It's a festival.

167
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,739
What are you going to show to the class? Eating show?

168
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:11,099
Whatever. I'm out of ideas.

169
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:35,110
You are pretty good shot.

170
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,810
Didn't you say you've never received any training before?

171
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,779
I'm just lucky.

172
00:13:39,766 --> 00:13:41,439
Why are you so humble?

173
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:43,660
Look at your target. You also did well.

174
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,784
I'm not that good.

175
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,537
How is Uncle Kit?

176
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:55,739
I know that our parents are not on good terms.

177
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:57,218
He's okay.

178
00:13:57,218 --> 00:13:59,979
You know that my dad feels offended easily.

179
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:03,465
I guess he feels offended that your mom doesn't trust him.

180
00:14:06,276 --> 00:14:08,849
What about me? Are you okay with me?

181
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,286
Of course.

182
00:14:10,286 --> 00:14:14,498
Although our parents are not on good terms, I have no reason to be mad at you.

183
00:14:14,498 --> 00:14:16,529
I'm just checking.

184
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:20,311
About your dad, I think my mom trusts him.

185
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:22,830
Right now, she is restructuring the management system.

186
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,396
If he gives her some time, he will definitely be on the management committee.

187
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:29,841
My mom is extremely busy with work.

188
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:31,793
She is also worried about her safety.

189
00:14:31,793 --> 00:14:34,597
What is the point of being rich if you can't find happiness?

190
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:37,151
I think you should prepare yourself for it.

191
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:39,188
One day, you will have to take over the business.

192
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:41,160
I never want to do that.

193
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,993
Do you want to do it?

194
00:14:42,993 --> 00:14:45,916
Don't kid me about that. I may take it seriously.

195
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:49,219
You can take it. I'm too tired. I don't want to do it.

196
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,289
How is it going with Ben? You asked me about him the other day.

197
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:00,923
It's okay. We are friends now.

198
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:02,760
We get along well.

199
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,903
Besides you, he is another person I can trust.

200
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,960
Wait a second.

201
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,252
I have to take this call.

202
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:35,386
Catch it.

203
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:37,705
Wait. It's slippery.

204
00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:45,220
Palm, score!

205
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,700
Great game.

206
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,476
How long have you been using those shoes?

207
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:02,979
You must love them very much.

208
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:06,058
It's not that I love them.

209
00:16:06,058 --> 00:16:08,200
I just can't afford new shoes.

210
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,599
I'm planning to get a job to save money to buy new ones.

211
00:16:12,448 --> 00:16:13,974
Good.

212
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,537
You work to buy new shoes with your own money.

213
00:16:16,537 --> 00:16:18,504
You should be proud.

214
00:16:18,504 --> 00:16:20,368
But sometimes it's too tiring.

215
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:25,744
To buy something I wanted, I worked as a tour guide assistant.

216
00:16:25,744 --> 00:16:29,162
I had to stand in hot weather to introduce tourist attractions.

217
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:33,639
It was so tiring to earn money.

218
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,239
But It was kind of fun.

219
00:16:38,308 --> 00:16:39,897
Do you want to be a tour guide?

220
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:42,931
I thought you wanted to help your father with work at the dance club.

221
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:47,894
No, no, no. My father has many businesses and buildings.

222
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:52,919
He has a dormitory business. He wants me to take over the business after him.

223
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:55,218
But I don't want to do that.

224
00:16:55,218 --> 00:16:57,554
I want to live my own life.

225
00:16:57,554 --> 00:17:00,279
Palm, what about you? What do you want to do?

226
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:02,379
Do you have any field of study you want to pursue?

227
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,319
To tell you the truth, I don't have any plans yet.

228
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,587
I'm just going to live my life like this.

229
00:17:13,803 --> 00:17:16,099
You don't need to be in hurry.

230
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:18,609
If I could choose,

231
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:22,849
I would be born rich like Nuengdiao.

232
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:27,636
He can always buy whatever he wants. I'm so jealous of him.

233
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,823
You said you will look for a job. What skills do you have?

234
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:36,880
There's no sea around here for you to work on a fishing boat.

235
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,419
It doesn't have to be a job on a fishing boat. I can do all kinds of labor jobs.

236
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,790
Why don't you come to work with me at the dance club?

237
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:52,079
When you came with Nuengdiao, you didn't do anything.

238
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:54,508
Next week, there will be a big party.

239
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:57,248
My dad has to hire someone to help him anyway.

240
00:17:57,248 --> 00:17:59,659
I can talk to him about it.

241
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:01,465
Thanks a lot.

242
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,000

Do you see Palm?

244
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:32,086
He went out to play basketball. He will be back soon.

245
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:33,524
Thank you.

246
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:37,379
What do you need him for? I can call him if you want.

247
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:39,572
It's okay. You can go back to your work.

248
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:41,290
Yes.

Where did you go?

251
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,719
I went to play basketball.

252
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:46,769
Did you play it all day?

253
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:50,059
Have you ever thought about doing the assignment?

254
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:53,779
I'm doing research on it.

255
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:59,340
I was worried that you might fall behind in the class.

256
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,022
It's okay. I get it.

257
00:20:02,022 --> 00:20:05,079
I should just let you fail the class.

258
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,079
I'm sorry.

259
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:09,280
I'll hurry and finish my research.

260
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,954
Hurry up.

261
00:20:10,954 --> 00:20:15,120
If I do the assignment by myself, I'll take all the credit for it.

262
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,049
Yes.

263
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,400
Who did you play basketball with?

264
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,306
I played with Aun.

265
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,489
Can you play basketball only with two people?

266
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,180
My friends from the basketball club were there, too.

267
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:33,344
Hurry and do your research.

268
00:20:33,344 --> 00:20:36,519
You are on probation, not a school break.

269
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:39,819
Since I'm suspended from school,

270
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:43,833
shouldn't I take the time to rest from school?

271
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,917
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

272
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:47,737
Should I teach you a lesson?

[Two Weeks Later]

274
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,940
Khun Nueng.

275
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,240
I found the holiday that I want to write a paper on.

276
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,380
What is it?

277
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,145
If you choose Chinese New Year, I'll scold you.

278
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,322
No. Hear me out.

279
00:21:56,322 --> 00:22:00,215
I found out about Qi Xi Jie.

280
00:22:00,215 --> 00:22:02,443
It falls on the 7th day of the 7th Chinese lunar month.

281
00:22:02,443 --> 00:22:06,002
It's the day celebrating the tragic love between the weaver girl and the cowherd.

282
00:22:06,002 --> 00:22:07,720
This is their story.

283
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,209
The weaver girl who lived in heaven fell in love with the cowherd.

284
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:14,313
They were living together for years.

285
00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:18,581
When the wife of the Jade Emperor found out about their relationship, she interfered.

286
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:22,959
She drew a river in the sky to separate them.

287
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:25,839
The queen was later moved by their love.

288
00:22:26,357 --> 00:22:29,740
They were allowed to meet each other

289
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,150
on a bridge formed by magpies.

290
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:36,159
But they can only meet once a year.

291
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,128
That's interesting.

292
00:22:38,128 --> 00:22:41,248
There are a lot of details we can talk about in our paper.

293
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,939
It's a story of impossible love. It's a classic story.

294
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,339
I feel sorry for them.

295
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:52,279
They loved each other but couldn't be together.

296
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,785
But I think it's very romantic.

297
00:22:53,785 --> 00:22:57,578
They overcame major obstacles for their love.

298
00:22:57,578 --> 00:23:02,080
Even though they could meet only once a year, they would patiently wait for that day.

299
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,839
That must have been tormenting.

300
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,679
If you were them, would you wait for that day?

301

If I was them, I would wait for that day.

302
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:20,546
When I love someone, I can endure anything for that person.

303
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:25,740
Maybe it's because of the long waiting and their different backgrounds,

304
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,406
That made their love become legendary.

305
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:32,279
The queen might have wanted to test their love.

306

00:25:08,345 --> 00:25:09,807
I...

325
00:25:11,222 --> 00:25:13,819
I want to apologize about the other day.

326
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:15,319
About what?

327
00:25:15,957 --> 00:25:21,082
When I said that you approached Nuengdiao because you want something from him.

328
00:25:22,428 --> 00:25:25,982
Forget it. I already forgot about it.

329
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:29,779
Actually, what you said was right.

330
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,945
- What I said was right?
- Um.

331
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:33,020
How?

332
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:38,697
You said I want something from Nuengdiao.

333
00:25:38,697 --> 00:25:41,320
Yes, I do want something from him.

334
00:25:42,168 --> 00:25:43,960
What is it?

335
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,619
I want him to like me, the same way that I like him.

336
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:56,399
Are you serious?

337
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:58,080
Yes.

338
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,059
As I said, I like those who are similar to me.

339
00:26:03,086 --> 00:26:06,819
Does Nueng know how you feel?

340
00:26:08,664 --> 00:26:10,119
No.

341
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:14,220
But I will tell him soon.

342
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,881
Please don't tell anyone about this.

343
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:19,130
I'm not ready yet.

344
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,702
I won't tell anyone. My lips are sealed.

345
00:26:22,702 --> 00:26:24,279
I promise.

346
00:26:31,696 --> 00:26:33,596
Ben.

347
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:37,559
If you like him, you should tell him.

348
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:43,019
I'm not sure about that.

349
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:48,219
What if I confess to him and he rejects me?

350
00:26:50,077 --> 00:26:52,179
What do you have to lose?

351
00:26:53,776 --> 00:26:56,196
At least, you get to tell him how you feel.

352
00:26:58,342 --> 00:27:01,519
You never know if you will get that chance again.

353
00:27:02,853 --> 00:27:06,219
Being rejected can only hurt you once.

354
00:27:07,068 --> 00:27:09,668
One more thing,

355
00:27:09,668 --> 00:27:11,893
who wouldn't like you?

356
00:27:21,697 --> 00:27:24,440
Thanks a lot, Chopper.

357
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,839
I'm glad that you came to talk to me.

358
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,086
I thought that we would stop being friends after what happened that day.

359
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,979
I forgot all about it.

360
00:27:37,096 --> 00:27:39,639
I'm glad that I came to talk to you.

361
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:58,770
"Ài."

362
00:27:58,770 --> 00:27:59,920
Love.

363
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,520
To like.

364
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,302
I'm sorry.

365
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,877
"Jiējí."

366
00:28:28,877 --> 00:28:30,740
Social classes.

367
00:28:37,608 --> 00:28:39,814
"Fēnlí."

368
00:28:39,814 --> 00:28:41,719
Separation.

369
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:29,839
I guess there is a ghost living here.

370
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:34,623
I was looking for you. I knew you would be here.

371
00:29:35,714 --> 00:29:38,706
There are only a few students in our school who can play piano.

372
00:29:38,706 --> 00:29:40,739
I'm here to practice.

373
00:29:41,776 --> 00:29:44,696
You don't need to practice that hard. You are already good.

374
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:46,318
You are exaggerating.

375
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,137
You shouldn't think that way.

376
00:29:48,137 --> 00:29:50,191
Don't act like a glass full of water.

377
00:29:50,191 --> 00:29:52,971
We should always practice and improve ourselves.

378
00:29:52,971 --> 00:29:55,678
We need to find our shortcomings and fix them.

379
00:29:55,678 --> 00:29:57,378
Do you get it?

380
00:29:58,099 --> 00:29:59,580
Yes.

381
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,999
Why did you come see me?

382
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:07,691
I have something to give you.

383
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:09,271
What?

384
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,973
I'm taking a paper cutting class.

385
00:30:12,973 --> 00:30:14,839
So I made you something.

386
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,365
It's your name.

387
00:30:21,365 --> 00:30:23,699
It was so hard to make.

388
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:30,299
Thanks.

389
00:30:34,071 --> 00:30:37,256
What song were you playing?

390
00:30:37,256 --> 00:30:39,119
Can you play it for me?

391
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,973
Well... It's a song that I'm composing.

392
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:45,591
Really? That's cool.

393
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:47,350
Can you play it for me?

394
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,746
Come on play.

395
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,840
No, I'm still not good at it.

396
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,099
It's also not completed yet.

397
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:56,362
I can be the first one to listen to it.

398
00:30:56,362 --> 00:31:03,099
I can give you feedback on whether it's good or bad, or how to improve it.

399
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,466
Sure.

400
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,536
But you can't laugh.

401
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,236
I won't.

402
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:53,999
What is the song about?

403
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:57,299
Why does it sound so sad?

404
00:31:58,622 --> 00:32:00,759
The song...

405
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,719
It's about a lonely man's love.

406
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:08,719
He thinks he doesn't deserve to love someone,

407
00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:14,573
nor receive love from anyone.

408
00:32:14,573 --> 00:32:18,519
Are you talking about yourself?

409
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,179
If I tell you that I like you,

410
00:32:50,157 --> 00:32:52,159
would you believe me?

411
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,925
Before you tell me that,

412
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:02,459
are you sure you know me well enough?

413
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,145
As much as I've gotten to know you,

414
00:33:06,491 --> 00:33:08,451
from what I see,

415
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,543
that's enough for me to like you.

416
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,392
What about you? How do you feel about me?

417
00:33:24,428 --> 00:33:26,499
I have good feelings for you.

418
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,679
No one has said those words to me before.

419
00:33:33,592 --> 00:33:37,066
When a popular guy like you,

420
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:39,879
who has dozens of admirers,

421
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:43,168
says that to me,

422
00:33:45,384 --> 00:33:47,357
I feel good about it.

423
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:52,559
I'm not popular nor more special than anyone else.

424
00:33:53,185 --> 00:33:57,479
But you are the one who always devalues yourself.

425
00:33:59,908 --> 00:34:01,680
Can...

426
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:05,279
Can I kiss you?

427
00:34:58,528 --> 00:35:00,648
Why didn't you tell me that you came home early?

428
00:35:02,607 --> 00:35:06,077
Aunt Nid told me to come back and help her.

429
00:35:06,077 --> 00:35:08,379
So I came home early.

430
00:35:10,952 --> 00:35:15,159
You make me feel nervous about the grade of our paper.

431
00:35:16,903 --> 00:35:18,417
Yes.

432
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:21,558
What's wrong with you? Why are your answers so curtly?

433
00:35:21,558 --> 00:35:23,519
You're also not looking at me.

434
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,419
It's nothing.

435
00:35:27,088 --> 00:35:31,439
May I be excused? I need to go help Aunt Nid.

436
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:39,130
Wait. You need to talk to me first.

437
00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:42,059
What's wrong with you?

438
00:35:43,748 --> 00:35:46,180
There's nothing wrong.

439
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,979
I don't have the right to be mad at you.

440
00:35:49,791 --> 00:35:52,875
Just tell me what's going on here.

441
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,797
Aren't we friends?

442
00:35:54,797 --> 00:35:57,380
If we are friends, we should be able to talk to each other about everything.

443
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:03,988
Why don't you answer me?

444
00:36:03,988 --> 00:36:07,099
If you have something you want to say, just say it.

445
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:10,722
You are easy to read. You cannot hide your feelings from me.

446
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:14,819
When I was looking for you at school,

447
00:36:15,668 --> 00:36:18,249
I went to the music club's room.

448
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,799
I saw you with Ben.

449
00:36:23,571 --> 00:36:25,259
What did you see?

450
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:31,062
I saw you kissing Ben.

451
00:36:53,798 --> 00:36:56,466
I don't feel anything about it.

452
00:36:56,466 --> 00:36:59,359
I just want you to be more careful.

453
00:37:00,247 --> 00:37:04,240
You never know who has bad intentions for you.

454
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,988
I accidentally saw it.

455
00:37:05,988 --> 00:37:08,674
It means that anyone could have seen it, too.

456
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:12,640
You can't tell anyone about it.

457
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,293
You can't tell your dad.

458
00:37:14,293 --> 00:37:15,920
Especially not my mom.

459
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,163
Why not?

460
00:37:18,163 --> 00:37:21,019
Khun Thanya loves you very much.

461
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:24,656
Because she loves me, that's why I'm scared.

462
00:37:24,656 --> 00:37:27,719
I'm afraid that I can't fulfill her expectations.

463
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,042
About Ben, can he really be trusted?

464
00:37:54,493 --> 00:37:56,559
I'm not sure.

465
00:37:58,703 --> 00:38:02,859
Knowing that someone wants to be close to you...

466
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,842
be with you,

467
00:38:05,842 --> 00:38:08,122
wants to touch you...

468
00:38:08,122 --> 00:38:11,124
It's an amazing feeling.

469
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:13,439
Have you ever felt that before?

470
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:18,619
That you are wanted by someone.

471
00:38:22,127 --> 00:38:23,819
No.

472
00:38:26,832 --> 00:38:30,479
One day, when you find that person, you will know how it feels.

473
00:38:33,531 --> 00:38:37,998
Thank you for warning me to be careful.

474
00:38:37,998 --> 00:38:43,039
When I have you watching my back, it kind of feels good.

475
00:38:44,213 --> 00:38:45,619
Yes.

476
00:38:46,465 --> 00:38:50,508
Are you going to the party held by the dance club?

477
00:38:50,508 --> 00:38:55,168
Yes. Maggie asked me to go help her.

478
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:58,730
Are you two so close that she helped you find a job?

479
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,559
Do you like her?

480
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,176
Not yet.

481
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,819
"Not yet"?

482
00:39:07,696 --> 00:39:09,183
Does it mean that it can happen?

483
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:12,053
I'm not sure about that.

484
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:15,696
She is being nice to me. So I am being nice to her.

485
00:39:15,696 --> 00:39:18,099
We'll need to wait and see.

486
00:39:23,373 --> 00:39:28,200
If you have nothing else to say, may I be excused to help Aunt Nid?

487
00:40:38,346 --> 00:40:42,039
You look quite handsome when you dress up.

488
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,759
What about me? Do I look pretty?

489
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:46,697
Yes.

490
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:48,632
How is it? Do you like the party?

491
00:40:48,632 --> 00:40:50,739
My dad holds this party every year.

492
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,312
He likes vintage things.

493
00:40:53,312 --> 00:40:56,143
That's why he is stuck here and can't move on.

494
00:40:56,143 --> 00:41:00,915
He also likes to hold parties to hang out with his friends.

495
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:04,242
What are you thinking?

496
00:41:04,983 --> 00:41:07,237
Tell me, what are you thinking?

497
00:41:08,807 --> 00:41:10,277
Nueng!

498
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,079
Are you done?

499
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,665
Where are you going?

500
00:41:14,665 --> 00:41:16,602
Yes, I'm done.

501
00:41:16,602 --> 00:41:18,245
I'm going to find something to drink.

502
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:21,219
You are drinking? I never knew that.

503
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:25,200
Why? This is a party. Are you expecting me to drink only water?

504
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,780
No. You can drink if you want.

505
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,284
But don't drink too much. You will get drunk.

506
00:41:30,284 --> 00:41:33,582
Or should I carry you home?

507
00:41:36,939 --> 00:41:40,659
I thought that you wouldn't talk to me after what happened that day.

508
00:41:40,659 --> 00:41:42,059
You are overthinking.

509
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:45,460
If I wasn't okay with it, I would have punched you.

510
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,159
Are you becoming Khun Tough Nuengdiao?

511
00:41:51,817 --> 00:41:57,559
So about us, what are we going to do next?

512
00:42:00,047 --> 00:42:01,799
Are you in a hurry?

513
00:42:03,368 --> 00:42:05,299
No.

514
00:42:06,965 --> 00:42:10,919
Then let's get to know each other first.

515
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:12,419
Why?

516
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,688
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

517
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,160
If I could, it would be good.

518
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,930
You need to wait a bit longer.

519
00:42:27,362 --> 00:42:30,999
I want to stay and have a drink with you.

520
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:33,120
But my dad told me to come home early.

521
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,548
You know how strict my dad is.

522
00:42:35,548 --> 00:42:38,481
It's okay. We can take a rain check on that.

523
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:40,406
I'm not going anywhere.

524
00:42:44,632 --> 00:42:47,591
I have to go now. See you.

525
00:42:47,591 --> 00:42:49,096
See you.

526
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,768
I want to get on a fishing boat with Palm.
[Ballroom Dance Club]

527
00:43:04,768 --> 00:43:06,050
Will you give me permission to do it?

528
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,850
Come on, Maggie.

529
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,991
It's not as fun as you think.

530
00:43:09,991 --> 00:43:14,335
Do you know how terrible you will feel if you have seasickness?

531
00:43:14,335 --> 00:43:17,019
There are motion sickness medications.

532
00:43:17,019 --> 00:43:18,712
Palm used to be a captain.

533
00:43:18,712 --> 00:43:20,331
No.

534
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:23,760
Do you know how much money we need to buy a boat?

535
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,580
It's very expensive.

536
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,074
If you keep working hard like this, you will be able to buy a boat one day.

537
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:31,435
Dad, please give me permission.

538
00:43:31,435 --> 00:43:33,960
If you want to eat fish, I'll take you to a market.

539
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,070
Dad, come on.

540
00:44:06,681 --> 00:44:08,939
I won't get sea sickness.

541
00:44:10,268 --> 00:44:11,840
A boat trip.

542
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,478
Nueng, do you want to dance with us?

543
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,623
Are you having fun?

544
00:44:20,623 --> 00:44:22,268
Nueng.

545
00:44:22,268 --> 00:44:24,315
Are you drunk?

546
00:44:24,315 --> 00:44:26,422
We should go home.

547
00:44:26,422 --> 00:44:28,848
Yes, I'm drunk. Why?

548
00:44:28,848 --> 00:44:30,085
But I'm not leaving.

549
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:32,460
Aren't you supposed to take care of me? That's your job.

550
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,505
Instead, you are flirting with her.

551
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:38,120
It's not like that. We are just friends, seriously.

552
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,240
Maggie, Nueng is drunk. I'd better take him home.

553
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,880
I'm not leaving.

554
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,682
What right do you have to touch me?

555
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:47,744
Know your place!

556
00:44:47,744 --> 00:44:49,853
You are a servant in my house, do you get it?

557
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,557
I'm your boss!

558
00:44:51,557 --> 00:44:55,622
You have no right to tell me what to do! You are my dog, my lackey!

559
00:44:55,622 --> 00:44:57,439
What?

560
00:44:57,439 --> 00:44:59,139
Dance!

561
00:44:59,139 --> 00:45:02,320
Dance! I told you to dance. Why don't you dance?

562
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,300
Why don't you dance? Dance with me.

563
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,712
Stop it.

564
00:45:06,712 --> 00:45:08,682
Khun Nueng, let's go home.

565
00:45:08,682 --> 00:45:09,936
Why?

566
00:45:09,936 --> 00:45:11,700
Let's go home. You are drunk.

567
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,797
You can dance with her, but you don't want to dance with me.

568
00:45:13,797 --> 00:45:15,559
You were dancing with her for hours.

569
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:17,259
You are drunk. Let's go home.

570
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:19,573
No! I'm not leaving.

571
00:45:19,573 --> 00:45:21,579
Know your place!

572
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:22,763
Let's go home.

573
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:25,058
Leave me alone!

574
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,159
What the hell are you doing? I'm all wet.

575
00:45:30,621 --> 00:45:32,760
What the hell is wrong with you?

576
00:45:34,906 --> 00:45:36,694
Did you kick my friend?

577
00:45:36,694 --> 00:45:39,514
If you don't want to be caught in the fight, then get out!

578
00:45:43,248 --> 00:45:44,848
Palm!

579
00:45:45,653 --> 00:45:47,094
Stop it!

580
00:45:47,094 --> 00:45:49,337
That's enough!

581
00:46:11,432 --> 00:46:13,657
Nuengdiao, get up slowly.

582
00:46:13,657 --> 00:46:15,702
Are you all right?

583
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,080
Nuengdiao, are you okay?

584
00:46:23,469 --> 00:46:24,987
Palm.

585
00:46:24,987 --> 00:46:27,388
I can't breathe.

586

I can't breathe.

What kind of debt do we owe them?
