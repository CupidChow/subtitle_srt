I told you that bad things happened because of me!

If you didn't try to protect me, your mom would still be alive!

00:00:12,363 --> 00:00:14,563
Khun Nueng, please don't leave me.

7
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:16,147
Have you ever thought about this?

8
00:00:16,147 --> 00:00:20,421
What would your life be like if you hadn't meet me?

9
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:23,751
This is the problem that I will face for the rest of my life.

10
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:27,497
This is a problem that my mom and I need to fix ourselves.

11
00:00:27,497 --> 00:00:30,685
I hope you will respect my decision.

How are you feeling? Do you feel better?

13
00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:54,860
I ordered more beer for you.

Thank you.

15
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:03,548
I think Mama Mam loved you very much.

16
00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:09,649
I just thought I would have more time with her.

17
00:01:11,587 --> 00:01:15,582
But at least she got the chance to know you.

18
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:21,082
She must be very proud of you.

19
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:25,482
There's nothing about me to be proud of.

20
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:28,282
I can't protect anyone.

21
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:30,382
Don't say that.

22
00:01:31,154 --> 00:01:35,182
Without you, I would have been killed at home that day.

23
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:41,105
I'm the problem.

24
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,782
Let's be honest.

25
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:49,815
You need to admit that you can no longer protect me.

26
00:01:52,314 --> 00:01:54,011
It's not that you are incompetent.

27
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:55,824
You are competent.

28
00:01:55,824 --> 00:02:01,784
In my life, I don't think I will find someone else who can take care of me as well as you do.

29
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,864
But you need to think about your life too.

30

31

Your mom just died.

32

Do you still think that I'm that important to you?

Don't do this, Palm. I'm not worth it.

You should go live your life.

Don't choose me to be the goal of your life.

Hello. I'm Nuengdiao.

72

Excuse me, who are you?

75

I was hiding somewhere safe.

But I realized there's no place safe for me to hide.

80
00:08:13,962 --> 00:08:18,015
Because the person who wants to kill me will never let me live.

You don't need to worry.

112
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:40,630
I'll wait until she wakes up before taking her to get a brain scan.

113
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,730
This means that she will wake up, right?

114
00:10:43,334 --> 00:10:46,180
We need to keep monitoring her condition.

115

Your mother is a fighter.

116

00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:39,024
But you don't need to rush.

132
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:42,134
I can wait.

133
00:12:42,134 --> 00:12:45,115
You can rest until you are better.

134
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:47,910
You can wake up then.

135
00:12:58,114 --> 00:13:00,317
You don't have to worry about me.

136
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:06,619
When I went into hiding, I learned many things.

137
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,015
I learned about myself.

138

Yes.

143
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:41,449
But it's broken. So we need to handwash our clothes.

144

Your shirt looks familiar.

145

148
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:06,067
The smell is quite nice. I can't explain it.

149
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:07,160
I read a research paper.

150
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,685
It says the scent of people that we love can help us feel relaxed.

151
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:15,985
It makes us feel like we are close to the people that we love.

152
00:16:15,985 --> 00:16:20,262
It makes us feel safe. So the body will produce some kind of chemicals.

153
00:16:26,671 --> 00:16:28,882
You also smell good.

154
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:33,247
Wash your clothes.

155
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:36,261
I'll help you.

156
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,977
I'll do it.

157
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:39,823
You should go read a book.

158
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:42,886
I want to try it.

159
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:45,648

160

It wouldn't be that hard.

161
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,115
It's not hard, but it's tiring.

162
00:16:52,868 --> 00:16:55,808
If I feel tired, I'll ask you to give me a message.

163
00:16:57,126 --> 00:16:58,748

Your scent helps me relax.

168

All right.

169
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,874
Then you should smell the detergent.

170
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:33,549
Khun Nueng, it's dirty.

171
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,382
Don't do it.

172
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:40,538
- Stop it, Khun Nueng.
- Okay, I will stop.

173
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:42,784
Take this.

174
00:17:42,784 --> 00:17:44,484
I'm not afraid.

175
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,600
Khun Nueng, it's dirty.

176
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,220
You said you're not afraid. Then take this.

177
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,630
Khun Nueng, it's dirty.

178
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,707
Wash the clothes.

179
00:17:59,351 --> 00:18:01,957
Wipe it. It's your shirt.

Ai Nueng? How are you?

00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:49,788
I'm fine.

189

I'm still alive.

Are you happy to see me?

191
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:57,215
Of course.

192
00:19:57,215 --> 00:20:00,215
When you went missing, I was worried about you.

193
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:03,378
I'm your cousin.

194
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:05,065
Is that so?

195
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:07,648
I thought you would be disappointed.

196
00:20:11,882 --> 00:20:13,948
How could you say that?

197
00:20:14,702 --> 00:20:18,022
My dad may want to take a share in your family's business.

198
00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:21,874
But I told you that the conflict is between our parents.

199
00:20:21,874 --> 00:20:24,091
It has nothing to do with me.

Whatever my dad did,

I tried to stop him.

203
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:42,032
You should have stopped him when he thought of killing my mom.

204
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,651
Your best wishes to me aren't enough.

205
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:49,228
You knew everything that he did.

206
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:52,115
This means you are his accomplice.

Are you here to pick on me?

I'm really sorry.

211

For everything that I did to you.

212
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:42,725
I didn't know what you were going through.

213

But now, I got it.

214
00:21:45,231 --> 00:21:47,882
When I was bullied and wrongly accused,

215
00:21:47,882 --> 00:21:51,948
my dad is accused of hiring the gunmen to kill your parents.

216
00:21:51,948 --> 00:21:53,587
My family is in big trouble.

217
00:21:53,587 --> 00:21:56,274
You know that my dad didn't do it, didn't you?

218
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:59,008
He will never do something like that.

219
00:21:59,008 --> 00:22:01,922
If you weren't a victim yourself,

220
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:04,225
you would have never understood how I felt, wouldn't you?

221

If you were bullied, you would have never apologized to me, wouldn't you?

I know I was wrong.

Believe me. Help me.

Please tell the police that my dad has nothing to do with it.

I have no one to turn to for help.

Please help me. I'm begging you.

Please help me, Nueng.

I'm begging you.

I can bow my head to you.

Get up.

231
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:48,544
I know that your dad didn't do it.

232
00:22:48,544 --> 00:22:50,818
Don't worry. He won't go to jail.

233
00:22:50,818 --> 00:22:54,682
I do everything to punish the one who hurt my family.

234
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,224
But I didn't do this for you.

235
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:01,444
I do this for people that I love.

236
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:07,418
I will forgive you.

237
00:23:07,418 --> 00:23:10,275
Next time, don't wait until you become a victim yourself

238
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:13,407
to realize that you shouldn't bully anyone.

239

Is my mom's business plan in this file?

240

Yes, Khun Nuengdiao.

241
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:48,328
Khun Tanya planned to renovate the rooftop.

242
00:23:48,328 --> 00:23:53,342
She also wanted to build a small poolside café for social media check-in.

243
00:23:53,342 --> 00:23:57,723
She wanted to attract more younger customers.

244
00:23:57,723 --> 00:24:01,748
She didn't want our hotel to look old.

245
00:24:02,362 --> 00:24:04,550
I'll go back and study her plan.

246
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:08,477
If I have new ideas, I'll discuss them with you.

247
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:11,870
I'm taking her position until she is fully recovered.

248
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,577
I'm not an expert on this.

249
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:17,990
If you have any ideas, you can tell me.

250
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,482
- Yes.
- Yes.

251
00:24:19,482 --> 00:24:21,723
- Thank you.
- Yes.

252
00:24:40,951 --> 00:24:42,137
I love you, Khun Nueng.

253
00:24:42,137 --> 00:24:46,084
How do you feel about me?

254
00:24:46,745 --> 00:24:49,007
I've never been in love before.

255
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:52,248
When I wake up,

256
00:24:54,048 --> 00:24:56,415
I want you to be with me.

257
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,585
When I fall asleep, I want you to be next to me.

258
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:09,311
I want you to be with me every moment.

259
00:25:10,822 --> 00:25:13,706
Please keep Khun Nueng safe!

260
00:25:14,449 --> 00:25:18,771
- Please keep Palm safe!
- Please keep us safe!

261
00:25:34,391 --> 00:25:36,219
By the way,

262
00:25:36,219 --> 00:25:39,231
Woo paid me for playing the piano at his wedding.

263
00:25:39,231 --> 00:25:40,686
I'll use it to buy a new phone.

264
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:43,159
My boyfriend is the best.

265
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:01,182
- Hello.
- Hello.

266
00:26:25,548 --> 00:26:27,107
Palm.

267
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,882
I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else.

268
00:27:10,661 --> 00:27:13,793
Are you sure that you want to learn how to ride a motorcycle?

269
00:27:13,793 --> 00:27:14,950
Yes, I am.

270
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,501
So it will be more convenient to go around the island.

271
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:22,855
Khun Nueng, you can tell me if you want to go somewhere. I'm your boyfriend.

272
00:27:22,855 --> 00:27:25,965
I want to give my boyfriend a ride, too.

273
00:27:25,965 --> 00:27:30,060
When I go to the market in the morning, I don't have to wake you up.

274
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:34,965
If I want to go to the beach, I can go alone.

275
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:37,744
So you are planning to have fun by yourself.

276
00:27:37,744 --> 00:27:40,098
Then I won't teach you.

277
00:27:40,098 --> 00:27:43,042
Come on.

278
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:44,391
Where are you going?

279
00:27:44,391 --> 00:27:46,137
Come back.

280
00:27:46,137 --> 00:27:48,350
Are you that mad?

281
00:27:49,525 --> 00:27:52,011
Don't be selfish. Please teach me.

282
00:27:52,011 --> 00:27:53,080
Please smile.

283
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,357
Smile, smile, smile.

284
00:27:57,357 --> 00:27:58,464
See?

285
00:27:58,464 --> 00:27:59,870
Okay, okay.

286
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,239
I'll teach you.

287
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:03,062
I have to teach you anyway.

288
00:28:03,062 --> 00:28:04,603
Okay.

289

290
00:28:07,371 --> 00:28:09,382
Start the bike.

291
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:15,498
Push the side-stand up. Start the engine.

292

Again.

293
00:28:19,688 --> 00:28:22,349
Khun Nueng, you can do it right away.

294
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:24,260
I told you that I'm a fast learner.

295
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,995
- Get on the bike.
- Should I?

296
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,448
Get on and hold me tight.

297
00:28:29,754 --> 00:28:32,036
All right, I'm ready.

298
00:28:32,036 --> 00:28:35,030
Roll the throttle slowly. Don't go too fast.

299
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,215
Hold me tight.

300
00:28:41,418 --> 00:28:43,748
That's too tight.

301
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:47,788
It's good that you learn how to ride a motorcycle.

302
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:51,060
So I will have an excuse to hold you all the time.

303
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,582
Don't say such a cheesy thing right now.

304
00:28:52,582 --> 00:28:54,990
Otherwise, we both will end up in an accident.

305
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,282
Okay.

306
00:28:56,282 --> 00:28:58,730
You just focus on the road.

307
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,448

This is the music club's room.

Then wait until Khun Nuengdiao is done using the room.

319
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,368
Are you going to use the room?

320
00:30:30,368 --> 00:30:32,150
I'll leave. So you can use it.

I want to talk to you.

Where have you been? I was worried about you.

Just say what you want to say.

324

You don't need to act like you are worried about me.

Well...

326
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:49,915
I want to apologize to you.

327

Is that all?

329
00:31:01,553 --> 00:31:03,341
Then I have a question for you.

330
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:06,145
Are you apologizing to me because you want to apologize to me?

331
00:31:06,145 --> 00:31:07,865
Or are you doing it for yourself?

332
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,548
I did it for you.

333
00:31:12,907 --> 00:31:15,445
No matter what,

334
00:31:15,445 --> 00:31:20,515
the feelings I had for you at the time were real.

335
00:31:22,406 --> 00:31:25,179
I was a coward.

336
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:31,789
So I did terrible things to you on that day.

337
00:31:34,065 --> 00:31:37,015
Do you think I should forgive you?

338
00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:45,582
For me, you are an asshole.

339
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:51,015
Because of you, I don't trust anyone who tries to be nice to me.

340
00:31:57,643 --> 00:32:02,515
I get it if you don't want to talk to me.

341
00:32:03,362 --> 00:32:05,317
But I want you to know...

342
00:32:06,685 --> 00:32:08,917
that I feel really bad about it.

343
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:19,500
If there's anything I can do to pay for the terrible thing that I did to you,

344
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,253
please let me know any time.

345
00:32:21,253 --> 00:32:23,049
I'm ready to do it.

346
00:32:30,562 --> 00:32:34,783
You've changed a lot.

347
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:42,082
But I'm glad that you are back.

348
00:33:02,351 --> 00:33:04,834
Since Nuengdiao is back,

349
00:33:04,834 --> 00:33:07,894
he's getting on my nerves more and more.

350
00:33:07,894 --> 00:33:11,060
He takes back what belongs to him. There's nothing wrong with that.

351
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,981
You don't even have the right to be mad at him.

352
00:33:13,981 --> 00:33:18,280
I'm begging you. Please leave him alone.

353
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,940
He's been through a lot already.

354
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,308
His dad is dead. His mom is in a coma.

355
00:33:22,308 --> 00:33:24,458
What else do you want from him?

356
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:26,405
Are you feeling bad for him?

357
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:29,005
You are taking his side instead of mine.

358
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,985
Do you want me to stop?

359
00:33:31,985 --> 00:33:35,085
Then tell him to give everything to me.

360
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:37,784
Dad, you know that is impossible.

361
00:33:37,784 --> 00:33:41,297
From the way he talked to me, he is not backing down.

362
00:33:41,297 --> 00:33:44,130
- He will fight back against you.
- Good.

363
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,489
I like that. Fight back.

364
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:50,982
Let's see if I will lose to an incapable kid like him.

365
00:33:59,445 --> 00:34:01,683
Your friend.

366
00:34:01,683 --> 00:34:04,540
The one that came to our house the other day.

367
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,682
Is his name Ben?

368
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,021
Who is he?

369
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:12,283
He's just a friend.

370
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:14,590
Are you two close?

371
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:19,383
No. Why are you asking about him?

372
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,066
The day that he came here,

373
00:34:24,066 --> 00:34:27,978
I think he overheard my conversation about Nuengdiao.

374
00:34:34,957 --> 00:34:36,581
Chopper.

375
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,981
You've never told him anything about me, haven't you?

376
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:48,882
What would I tell him?

377
00:34:51,282 --> 00:34:55,073
Tell him that you tried to kill your own family?

378
00:34:55,073 --> 00:34:56,980
Do you think I'm proud

379
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,668
to have a father who is greedy for things that are not his?

380
00:34:59,668 --> 00:35:02,468
You can do anything, including killing your own nephew.

381
00:35:02,468 --> 00:35:06,035
Do you think that I would tell him that my father is a murderer?

382
00:35:20,402 --> 00:35:25,549
I don't know what your friend, Ben, means to you.

383
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,177
It's good that you didn't tell him anything.

384
00:35:29,177 --> 00:35:33,582
You know that I will never let anyone get in my way.

385
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,190
Chanon.

386
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,397
Khun Nueng, why did you come here?

387
00:35:54,397 --> 00:35:56,728
I'm here to help you.

388
00:35:56,728 --> 00:35:59,365
I know that you were framed.

389
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:03,408
I don't believe that you would hurt my family.

390
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:06,315
Thank you for believing in me.

391
00:36:06,315 --> 00:36:09,052
But it's not safe for you to go out.

392
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:12,985
What about Palm? Where is he? Why isn't he taking care of you?

393
00:36:15,261 --> 00:36:17,455
I told him to go hiding.

394
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:20,907
The police are looking for him.

395
00:36:20,907 --> 00:36:24,982
If they can put you in jail, they won't let Palm get away.

396
00:36:30,714 --> 00:36:33,584
I'm so sorry.

397
00:36:33,584 --> 00:36:37,931
I'm not only unable to help you, but I also became your burden.

398
00:36:37,931 --> 00:36:40,064
Don't say that, Uncle Non.

399
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,415
You are my family.

400
00:36:43,415 --> 00:36:45,417
Don't worry. Wait for a while.

401
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:47,950
I hired a good lawyer to represent you.

402
00:36:48,644 --> 00:36:52,448
Thank you. Thank you so much, Khun Nueng.

403
00:36:52,448 --> 00:36:57,480
Can you please tell Palm that he doesn't have to worry about me?

404
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,880
I can handle life in jail.

405
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,817
I want him to stay close to you.

406
00:37:05,785 --> 00:37:07,223
Sure.

407
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:01,114
Can you protect me?

408
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:05,141
A boy from a fisherman village who only knows about fishing.

409
00:38:05,141 --> 00:38:08,357
Suddenly, you are assigned to protect a wealthy boy like me.

410
00:38:08,357 --> 00:38:10,251
Are you sure you can do it?

411
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:18,115
You two will be through many things in the future.

412
00:38:18,115 --> 00:38:20,658
Hold your hands and go through them together.

413
00:38:20,658 --> 00:38:22,782
Please don't leave Palm.

414
00:39:34,381 --> 00:39:36,648
Khun Nueng, how could you leave me?

415
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:40,117
What are you doing here?

416
00:39:42,587 --> 00:39:45,417
I explained everything in the note.

417
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:47,317
Didn't you read it?

418
00:39:49,142 --> 00:39:50,911
I read it.

419
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,683
But I want to hear it from you.

420
00:40:01,434 --> 00:40:03,148
I'm sorry.

421
00:40:04,427 --> 00:40:07,549
I don't want to cause any trouble to anyone anymore.

422
00:40:08,494 --> 00:40:11,948
Look at your dad and mom.

423
00:40:11,948 --> 00:40:14,792
Why are you going to risk your life for me?

424
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:18,382
Palm, you should go live your life.

425
00:40:20,132 --> 00:40:22,680
But you are my life.

426
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,132
That's enough. Stop it.

427
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:28,716
I have bodyguards now.

428
00:40:28,716 --> 00:40:31,153
I'll help Uncle Non get out of jail.

429
00:40:31,153 --> 00:40:33,034
I'll give you some money.

430
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:36,154
Use it to start a new life and don't ever come back again.

431
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:44,347
Are you getting rid of me from your life by paying me?

432
00:40:45,064 --> 00:40:47,173
Is this how you treat people?

433
00:40:47,173 --> 00:40:48,365
The time that we shared together...

434
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:50,070
The things that we did together...

435
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,856
- Do they mean nothing to you?
- They mean a lot to me.

436
00:40:54,437 --> 00:40:56,883
Believe me.

437
00:40:56,883 --> 00:40:59,882
It was the best time of my life.

438
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:02,464
So I want to treasure it.

439
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:05,609
I want you to stay alive and be happy.

440
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:09,849
But my happiness is being with you.

441
00:41:12,205 --> 00:41:13,365
Why?

442
00:41:13,365 --> 00:41:15,905
Why? What will you do?

443
00:41:15,905 --> 00:41:19,057
Will you live a life that you always have to hide and be on the run?

444
00:41:19,057 --> 00:41:22,017
How many times do we have to watch people that we love die?

445
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,708
Don't you get it, Palm?

446
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:29,282
As long as you stay with me, you will get killed one day.

447
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,919
I can't let you handle it by yourself.

448
00:41:40,919 --> 00:41:43,951
The person who did this to us.

449
00:41:43,951 --> 00:41:45,915
He needs to pay for it.

450
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,415
I won't let you run away from me again.

451
00:41:50,415 --> 00:41:52,714
From now on, if we are going to fight,

452
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:55,651
We will fight together.

453
00:41:57,036 --> 00:41:58,849
If we are going to die,

454
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,049
we will die together.

455
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:53,320
[Do not litter.]

456
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:00,300
[Turn off the car engine. | Violators face 1 month imprisonment and a fine of 2,000 baht.]

457
00:43:01,443 --> 00:43:03,897
How long have you been back?

458
00:43:03,897 --> 00:43:05,714
Around two weeks.

459
00:43:05,714 --> 00:43:08,492
Since I came back to Bangkok, I've been hiding here.

460
00:43:08,492 --> 00:43:10,449
I rented the motorbike from a shop nearby.

461
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:13,049
How did you know that I went to the building?

462
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,149
I've been watching you.

463
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,622
You are so stubborn.

464
00:44:05,622 --> 00:44:07,842
You never did what I asked you to do.

465
00:44:07,842 --> 00:44:11,448
Do you know it's dangerous for you to go around alone?

466
00:44:15,193 --> 00:44:18,082
Don't worry. I hire bodyguards.

467
00:44:19,768 --> 00:44:24,382
I think no one can take care of you as well as I do.

468
00:44:24,382 --> 00:44:25,951
Palm.

469
00:44:25,951 --> 00:44:27,465
I'm serious.

470
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:30,203
I don't know what Uncle Kit is planning.

471
00:44:30,203 --> 00:44:32,119
I'm getting on his nerves lately.

472
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:35,101
If you are around me, you will be his target too.

473
00:44:37,396 --> 00:44:39,340
Don't worry about your dad.

474
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,282
I'm finding a way to help him.

475
00:44:43,268 --> 00:44:44,968
Thank you, Khun Nueng.

476
00:44:44,968 --> 00:44:46,597
You don't need to thank me.

477
00:44:46,597 --> 00:44:48,900
Your dad is arrested because of a problem in my family.

478
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,916
I have to help him out anyway.

479
00:44:50,916 --> 00:44:54,554
You need to lay low. Don't go anywhere.

480
00:44:54,554 --> 00:44:57,349
Wait until I take care of everything.

481
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:59,382
Promise me.

482
00:45:01,209 --> 00:45:02,948
I promise.

483
00:45:05,004 --> 00:45:07,022
Don't forget to keep your promise.

484
00:45:07,022 --> 00:45:08,559
I'm leaving.

485
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:10,130
Khun Nueng.

486
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:12,134
Where are you going?

487
00:45:12,134 --> 00:45:13,947
I'm going home.

488
00:45:15,444 --> 00:45:19,948
If you go home, you will be alone.

489
00:45:19,948 --> 00:45:22,082
Can you stay with me here?

490
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,715
I miss you.

491
00:45:25,894 --> 00:45:30,318
I want to hold you just like when we were living on the island.

492
00:45:33,615 --> 00:45:37,548
If I stay, will you keep your promise?

493
00:45:38,548 --> 00:45:40,215
Yes.

494
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:45,126
But I don't have any clothes to change into.

495
00:45:46,843 --> 00:45:49,144
It's okay.

496
00:45:49,144 --> 00:45:51,564
You can wear your boyfriend's clothes.

497
00:46:21,682 --> 00:46:24,149
Are you okay about your mom?

498
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,149
No, I'm not.

499
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:34,149
I still miss her.

500
00:46:41,021 --> 00:46:42,722
I get it.

501
00:46:42,722 --> 00:46:46,849
We both lost the people who understood us the most.

502
00:46:47,562 --> 00:46:49,821
My mom is unconscious.

503
00:46:49,821 --> 00:46:51,816
I don't know when she will wake up.

504
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,815
Your mom is gone forever.

505
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:06,915
For me, your mom was the only witness who knew that our love was real.

506
00:47:08,645 --> 00:47:13,649
It was my mom who gave me the courage to tell you how I feel.

507
00:47:16,442 --> 00:47:18,649
Me, too.

508
00:47:18,649 --> 00:47:23,595
My mom gave me the courage to love, and was not afraid of anything.

509
00:47:27,851 --> 00:47:29,551
Khun Nueng.

510
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:35,951
We are no longer on the island.

511
00:47:37,817 --> 00:47:40,149
Am I still your boyfriend?

512
00:47:43,329 --> 00:47:45,267
That depends on your heart.

513
00:47:45,267 --> 00:47:49,349
Do you think we are on the island or here?

514
00:47:59,641 --> 00:48:01,531
My heart,

515
00:48:01,531 --> 00:48:03,551
it's here.

516
00:48:09,282 --> 00:48:12,080
Then no matter where we are,

517
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,082
you are my boyfriend.

518
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:29,769
After I gave it to you,

519
00:48:29,769 --> 00:48:31,924
don't throw it away again.

520
00:48:38,002 --> 00:48:41,015
I will never take it off again.

521
00:49:11,622 --> 00:49:15,748
Do you think what is waiting for us in the future?

522
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:27,799
♫ I used to wonder who I am living for ♫

523
00:49:30,389 --> 00:49:37,076
♫ When I met you, I finally understand ♫

00:49:37,076 --> 00:49:41,799

529
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,920
[Next Week]
To tell you the truth, I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

530
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:42,211
We have been through so many things that I feel that I can overcome anything.

531
00:50:42,211 --> 00:50:46,294
Right now, you are with me.

532
00:50:49,205 --> 00:50:50,544
What do you want me to do?

533
00:50:50,544 --> 00:50:51,925
You have to let my dad go.

534
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:54,340
1. Kill Tanya.

535
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:58,105
2. Kill Nuengdiao.

536
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:09,260
♫ My one life, how valuable is it? ♫
