00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,740
I, Tanya Kitttrakulmaythee,

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,310
will take over the CEO position for every company...

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,810
in the conglomerate after Khun Piphop.

5
00:00:16,507 --> 00:00:18,970
You came into this family empty-handed. You can't think everything is yours.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,070
Why not?

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,480
Your job is to protect Nuengdiao.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,580
Don't let anything happen to him.

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,530
I don't need a bodyguard.

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,380
I need a friend. Will you be my friend?

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,470
If that's what you want.

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,690
I'll be your friend.

13
00:00:46,617 --> 00:00:49,430
What are you making, Aunt Nid? It looks delicious.

14
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,532
They are called Eggs Benedict. Have you heard of them?

15
00:00:52,532 --> 00:00:54,840
No, I haven't.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,400
I only know omelet, fried egg, and steamed egg.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,350
I have never heard of Eggs Benedict before.

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,840
It's breakfast for rich people.

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,860
I cook many dishes to serve him.

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,400
For breakfast, just one dish should be enough. Why do you need to cook so many dishes?

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,640
I cook them so he can choose what he wants to eat.

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,060
Rice people can have many dishes to choose from for their breakfast.

23
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,630
Just a plate of omelet rice can fill up my stomach.

24
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,650
No, don't mess with my kitchen.

25
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,500
My kitchen utensils will break because of you.

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,400
Take this dish and serve Khun Nu.

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,031
Then come back and have breakfast with me before going to school.

28
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,040
Why aren't you going? Hurry, hurry, go.

29
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,200
Why are you serving my breakfast?

30
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:21,890
You seem to have many duties.

31
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,290
Aunt Nid is still busy cooking.

32
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,490
So she asked me to bring it to you. She was worried you might be hungry.

33
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,690
Why does she need to cook so many dishes?

34
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,330
Look at the table. It's full of food.

35
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,570
I'm having breakfast alone. My mom is not even home today.

36
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,840
It will be a waste of food if I don't eat it all.

37
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,770
Have you had breakfast?

38
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,260
Aunt Nid will make omelet rice for me.

39
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,070
Why does she need to cook another dish?

40
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,620
Sit down and have breakfast with me.

41
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,620
It's okay. I'll have my breakfast in the kitchen.

42
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,840
Why? Don't you want to eat with me?

43
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,513
You said you would do whatever I told you to do.

44
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,500
Sit down. Have breakfast with me.

45
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,310
Eat. Otherwise, we will be late for school.

46
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,288
Just take whatever you want to eat.

47
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,800
If you don't eat it, I'll feed you.

48
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,460
It's okay. I'll feed myself.

49
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,160
There's nothing hard about eating. Why are you making it so difficult?

50
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,330
Palm.

51
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,950
Why are you having your breakfast here? Why don't you eat it in the kitchen?

52
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,050
I… Well…

53
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,190
It's okay, Uncle Non.

54
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,820
Don't scold him for this. I told him to eat with me.

55
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,260
I don't think it looks right.

56
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,860
Palm should have breakfast with me and Aunt Nid in the kitchen.

57
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,120
Shouldn't you have left for school by now?

58
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,560
You need to wait for the bus, and the traffic is bad.

59
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,160
Yes.

60
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,281
I'll wait for you in the car.

61
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,770
You know that you shouldn't have done that, don't you?

62
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,560
Yes, but he told me to eat with him.

63
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,160
Even though he told you to, you should find a way to say no to him.

64
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,230
Don't do it again.

65
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,340
You should leave for school.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,600
Why don't you let Palm ride to school with us?

67
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,350
He will be late for school.

68
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,290
There are plenty of seats available in the car. There's no need for him to take the bus.

69
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,090
I don't think it's a good idea.

70
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,660
Khun Tanya helped Palm get into the same class as you.

71
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,940
I feel very grateful for that.

72
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,630
I don't want to ask anything more of you.

73
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,780
Palm wants to do things his own way.

74
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,680
He wants to ride the bus to school.

75
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,183
So you don't need to worry about him. He will be fine.

76
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,710
Please get in the car if you don't want to be late.

Yes.

Of course.

Can I ask you something? Before moving to this school, where did you live?

121
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,670
I lived in Chonburi.

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,430
You should find a way to vent.

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,760
Do you have any close friends?

165
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,693
I don't need one. I'm good on my own. I'm more comfortable this way.

166
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:19,840
Would you be interested in having me as your close friend?

167
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,530
I can do that.

168
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,494
We have the whole year.

169
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,971
It's long enough to get to know each other.

170
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,530
What do you want from me?

171
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,530
Just tell me what you want.

172
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,470
Do you want me to ask a favor from the principal, or do you want a bigger budget?

173
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,740
What kind of person do you think I am?

174
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,043
If you don't want to be friends with me, just tell me.

175
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:49,583
You don't need to accuse me of trying to take advantage of you.

176
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,110
That's a terrible thing to say.

177
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,880
Hey.

178
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,220
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,850
I'm not used to people being nice to me.

180
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,580
It's okay. I get it.

181
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,170
Many people approach you for favors, right?

182
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,240
I wanted to ask if you want to play the piano at a dance club.

183
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,880
They are looking for a pianist.

184
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,040
I often go there to play music

185
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,170
so I was thinking of asking you to join. Are you interested?

186
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,220
Is it a good idea? I'm not that good at the piano.

187
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,280
I'm afraid that I will embarrass myself.

188
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,930
You are good.

189
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,230
I remember watching you play very well at the Christmas event.

190
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,870
Did you see that? I thought no one paid attention to me.

191
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,147
Of course. Please think about it. I'll send the details to you later.

192
00:13:59,147 --> 00:14:01,937
I have to go now. See you.

193
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,120
"Péngyǒu."

194
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,010
"Péngyǒu"?

195
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:26,958
"Péngyǒu"…

196
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,140
"Péngyǒu."

197
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,996
"Péngyǒu."

198
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,901
It is pronounced that way.

199
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:36,590
Khun Nu.

200
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,840
Say it again.

201
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,420
"Péngyǒu."

202
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,040
"Péngyǒu."

203
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,260
It's "yǒu," not "you."

204
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,850
"Péngyǒu."

205
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,860
The third tone in Mandarin is equivalent to the low tone in Thai.

206
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,143
"Péngyǒu."

207
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,663
"Péngyǒu."

208
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,617
Remember this feeling.

209
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,800
"Péngyǒu."

210
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,730
"Péngyǒu."

211
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,495
Do you remember it?

212
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,900
Do you remember the feeling?

213
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,600
Yes.

214
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,090
Try to say it.

215
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,560
"Péngyǒu."

216
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,450
Touch your throat when you say it.

217
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,750
"Péngyǒu."

218
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,930
"Péngyǒu."

219
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,400
"Péngyǒu."

220
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,240
- Nuengdiao.
- Nueng…

221
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,729
Call me Nuengdiao.

222
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,180
I can't, Khun Nu.

223
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,890
You are my boss.

224
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,950
My family owes a lot to your father.

225
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,700
I need to show you respect.

226
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,590
That was between your father and mine. It has nothing to do with us.

227
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,720
You said you would be my friend but refused to call me by my name.

228
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,240
When we are at school, I can be your friend.

229
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,960
But here in the house, I'm your servant.

230
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,080
Do you know what the word "péngyǒu" means?

231
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,967
Yes.

232
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,360
"Péngyǒu" means "friends."

233
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,690
Do you know what "friends" means?

234
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:29,130
Friends are not about a place, time, or status.

235
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,550
You can be my friend no matter where you are.

236
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,440
Do you like that I order you around?

237
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,540
Fine. From now on, don't call me Khun Nu again.

238
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,763
You can call me Nueng or Nuengdiao. Either is fine with me.

239
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:46,940
But don't call me Khun Nu again. Do you hear me?

240
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,670
I don't think I can call you that.

241
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,090
If my father hears it, he will kill me.

242
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,993
You don't need to call me that. Just don't talk formally to me.

243
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:01,660
That is my order. Do you hear me?

244
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:07,520
Did you order me as a friend or as my boss?

245
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,680
You are getting on my nerves.

246
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,900
No. I won't call you Khun Nu.

247
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,940
Instead, I'll call you Khun Nueng.

248
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,257
I think it's better this way.

249
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,140
Whatever. I don't want to argue with you anymore.

250
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,280
You said I was stubborn. You are more stubborn than me.

251
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,600
Let me see what other words you need to learn.

252
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,673
Do you understand this page?

253
00:17:34,673 --> 00:17:36,360
Kind of.

254
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,900
So you won't embarrass yourself in class tomorrow.

255
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,820
Khun Suphakit.

256
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,950
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cheat the casino.

257
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,903
Please don't hurt me.

258
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,183
You said you didn't mean to cheat,

259
00:17:53,183 --> 00:17:55,880
but you stole hundreds of thousands of baht from me.

260
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,420
If you planned to cheat me, wouldn't I go bankrupt?

261
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,800
I'll try to pay you back as soon as possible. I already gave the money to my family.

262
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,340
My kid is sick. I needed money for his medical bill.

263
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,120
Drop your act of good father.

264
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,530
You don't love your kid.

265
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,300
If you did love your kid,

266
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,540
you wouldn't hide the cards and cheat in my casino. Am I right?

267
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,531
I'm sorry. Please don't hurt me.

268
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:20,400
You know that I will teach a lesson to those who dare cheat me.

269
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,680
I'm sorry. Please don't hurt me.

270
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,243
Hey.

271
00:18:24,243 --> 00:18:26,490
Please don't hurt me.

272
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,450
Hey!

273
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,300
If you can't pay me back, I'll keep cutting off your fingers.

274
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,460
When all your fingers are cut off, I'll cut your toes.

275
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,060
Do it.

276
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,165
Isn't this too cruel?

277
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,020
If you want to run this kind of business, you need a way to make cheaters afraid of you.

278
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,820
Otherwise, they will come back and take revenge on you.

279
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,920
Look.

280
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,270
I should have been managing a luxurious beachfront hotel.

281
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,160
Instead, I am running a casino and I need to deal with these scumbags.

282
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,490
It's all because of Tanya.

283
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,750
She wants to protect the fortune for her son.

284
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:42,080
I don't know what makes her think that Nuengdiao can be the leader of Kitttrakulmethee.

285
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,480
I don't see any good qualities in him. He only cares about playing the piano.

286
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,920
If someone needs to step up to be the leader of this family,

287
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,660
It should be you or me, Chopper.

288
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,990
But I don't want it.

289
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,330
I will be prouder if I can be successful on my own.

290
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,800
I get it.

291
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,910
I get that you want to prove yourself.

292
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,940
I've done that before.

293
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,900
But it's not that easy.

294
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,780
Do you know how hard I tried?

295
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
Because I'm the youngest son,

296
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,520
whatever I did, I was always compared to Nuengdiao's father.

297
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,723
Everyone thought he was better than me. He was the pride of the family.

298
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:23,260
What about me?

299
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,760
They saw me as a failure.

300
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,280
Life is a competition, Chopper.

301
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,740
Then I am lucky.

302
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,620
I don't have any siblings so I don't need to compete with anyone.

303
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,150
You need to compete with Nuengdiao.

304
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,800
Why do I need to compete with him, Dad?

305
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,930
I don't want to be his enemy.

306
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,410
There's no way that we can take his fortune from him.

307
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,523
Even if Aunt Tanya were gone, Nueng is getting ready to take over the business.

308
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,908
What if both were gone?

309
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,770
What do you mean?

310
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,480
I didn't mean anything.

311
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,370
I just want you to know that everything I am doing is also for your future.

312
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,030
Do you get it?

313
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,870
You and I, we are on the same team.

314
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,930
If I need your help, you need to help me.

315
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,313
I have business to talk with him. You should leave.

316
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,670
Is everything okay?

317
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,550
Yes, Khun Tanya.

318
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,860
Palm, how is school?

319
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,421
Good.

320
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:07,009
There's no problem, right?

321
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:09,730
Mom, when did you get back? Why didn't you tell me?

322
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,560
I took a late-night flight back from Phuket.

323
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,020
I thought you were sleeping.

324
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,430
After Dad died, you barely have time for me.

325
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,880
You are an adult now. Do you still need time from me?

326
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,980
Why don't you go spend time with your friends?

327
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,480
You little brat.

328
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,400
- Do you miss me?
- Yes, I do.

329
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:39,030
Mom, do we normally change the water in the pool every week?

330
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,340
Yes. Why?

331
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,870
My current gym class is swimming

332
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,180
so I will be using the pool often.

333
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,410
I want to find someone to teach me how to swim.

334
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,960
Sure. You can hire a trainer to teach you at home.

335
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,480
If Nueng will be taking a swimming lesson,

336
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,800
Palm also needs to take it, right?

337
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,030
Yes.

338
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:05,030
That's good. I'll hire a swimming trainer to teach you at home.

339
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,910
For both Nuengdiao and Palm.

340
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:11,430
Palm doesn't need swimming lessons. He grew up with the sea.

341
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,650
He should be the one teaching me how to swim.

342
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,020
That's right.

343
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,280
So we don't need to hire a trainer.

344
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,950
Let's have Palm teach you how to swim.

345
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,650
Can you do that, Palm?

346
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,860
Yes, Khun Tanya.

347
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,530
You can use the pool anytime.

348
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,600
No one uses it anyway.

349
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,910
As for the shooting, boxing, and horse riding classes that Nueng is taking,

350
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:38,260
Palm should also join him.

351
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,380
Chanon.

352
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,780
Enroll Palm in those classes.

353
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,070
Nuengdiao will have a friend to take the classes with.

354
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,970
Yes, Khun Tanya.

355
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,330
Thank you.

356
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,300
Do you miss me?

357
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,400
Of course.

358
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,360
Do it well.

359
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,060
Hurry up.

360
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,340
Those who are late for class…

361
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,610
get in a line.

362
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,680
Do twenty push-ups.

363
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,580
Get ready.

364
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,470
Hurry up.

365
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,730
Start doing it if you are ready.

366
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,720
Count.

367
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,200
One.

368
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,660
Two.

369
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,980
Three.

370
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,500
Four.

371
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,520
Five.

372
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,540
- Are you okay?
- What?

373
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,280
You only did it five times. Stop acting.

374
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,480
I'll do it in his instead.

375
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,950
Are you trying to be a hero?

376
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,190
Fine.

377
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,510
But the push-ups you need to do will be doubled.

378
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,740
Yes.

379
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,870
Then do it.

380
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,620
Count out loud.

381
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,550
One. Two. Three.

382
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:00,820
Four. Five. Six.

383
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,790
Seven. Eight. Nine.

384
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:07,230
Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen.

385
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,800
- Fourteen.
- You don't need to do it.

386
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,609
You can go in.

387
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:13,480
But I am also late, just like them.

388
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,530
It's okay. You can go in.

389
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,716
I'll take care of everything.

390
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,510
Go in.

391
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,300
Go.

392
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:30,410
Continue.

393
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,210
Why did you stop?

394
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,810
- Count louder.
- Sixteen.

395
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:36,800
Seventeen.

396
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,910
I'll follow you after I put my bag in my locker.

397
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,290
Hurry. Don't be late.

398
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,190
I won't.

399
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,020
- Ben.
- Chopper.

400
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,210
Do you have something to say?

401
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,110
No. I just want to say hi to you, my old friend.

402
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,200
After you became the class's president, we barely talked to each other.

403
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,820
I guess you forgot your old friend after getting the big title.

404
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,230
You are talking nonsense.

405
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,500
I didn't forget you. You are the one who avoided talking to me.

406
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,320
Then you disappeared.

407
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,990
Is there something wrong?

408
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,190
No.

409
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,140
I saw that you are into music,

410
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,330
but I'm not,

411
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,510
so I didn't know what to talk to you about.

412
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:31,240
I forgot. You are only interested in stocks and bitcoin trading, stuff like that.

413
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,690
I know nothing about that. It's too hard for me to understand.

414
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,030
I don't think it's too hard for you.

415
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,330
Why don't you try playing a musical instrument?

416
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,463
No. It's too hard.

417
00:26:39,463 --> 00:26:41,063
See?

418
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,480
Since when did you become close to Nueng?

419
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,106
I saw you talking to him.

420
00:26:51,106 --> 00:26:53,930
How did you see that?

421
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,106
Have you been watching me?

422
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,450
No.

423
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,870
I saw you guys in the hallway.

424
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,450
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

425
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,930
That's right.

426
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,760
I just started to get to know him.

427
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,830
I think he is very interesting.

428
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,320
Look around the school.

429
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,850
You will see his father's name everywhere as a donor.

430
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,600
But he's never shown it off or boasted about it to anyone.

431
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,450
If it were someone else, they would take the class presidency away from me.

432
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:35,290
Besides, we both like music.

433
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,500
So we get along well.

434
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,080
Why are you asking?

435
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,010
Nothing.

436
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,368
I'm just curious.

437
00:27:45,368 --> 00:27:49,337
Are you approaching him because you want something from him?

438
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,930
How could you say that to me?

439
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,950
I sincerely want to be his friend without expecting anything in return.

440
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:11,740
Maybe we are no longer close friends because you think of me this way.

441
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,980
You are using the pool without considering the owner.

442
00:28:56,327 --> 00:28:58,980
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

443
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,290
I was the one who asked for my mom's permission

444
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,600
so you don't need to sneak around to use the pool.

445
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,820
I don't want to shoot you to death from a misunderstanding.

446
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,790
Thank you.

447
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:15,250
Do you still want me to teach you how to swim?

448
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,341
No. I used it as an excuse to ask for permission.

449
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,600
Am I smart for coming up with the excuse?

450
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,690
Yes, you are.

451
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,120
Don't you feel cold when swimming at night?

452
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,720
No.

453
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,930
When I lived in Chonburi, I often went swimming in the sea at night.

454
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,270
Swimming in the sea at night, isn't it scary?

455
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,450
It's dark. You don't know what will attack you.

456
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:47,130
The darkness is not scary.

457
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:52,400
If we are alert and ready to fight, there's nothing to be afraid of.

458
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,698
You are quite a boaster.

459
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:00,040
May I be excused to go back to my room?

460
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,690
Wait.

461
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,850
Why don't you swim a bit longer?

462
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,296
I want to watch you.

463
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,680
Khun Nu.

464
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,640
Khun Nueng, aren't you going to join me?

465
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,630
No. I just want to watch you.

466
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,110
Maybe I can learn something from you.

467
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,030
I'm applying to play the piano here as a volunteer. My friend told me about the position.

468
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,068
You can go home first.

469
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:13,140
Who is that friend? Do I know him?

470
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,880
Why? Do I need to tell you everything?

471
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,970
I have friends, too.

472
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,830
Then I'll go with you.

473
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,290
There might be something I can help with.

474
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,803
How can you help?

475
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:29,126
Music is art.

476
00:31:29,126 --> 00:31:31,266
You are only good at physical activities.

477
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:44,350
Okay. Here, please take a look at it.

478
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,070
- Thank you.
- Sure.

479
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,950
Hello.

480
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,600
Hello.

481
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,090
Are you here to apply for a dance class?

482
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,390
Most of the students here are elderly.

483
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:02,320
Are you applying for yourself or an elder in your family?

484
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,570
No. My friend from the music club told me about the pianist position.

485
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,960
He said you were looking for a pianist.

486
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,960
Are you Ben's friend?

487
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,060
- Yes.
- That's great. Ben told me that you are a good pianist.

488
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:22,630
I was worried that no one would apply for the job because it was a volunteer position.

489
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,460
People aren't very interested.

490
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,410
The class is also full of elderly people.

491
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,830
It's okay.

492
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,050
I just want to find a place where I can practice.

493
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,900
Do you want to try now? Just think of it as an audition.

494
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,900
Sure.

495
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:39,393
I'm Mackie. What's your name?

496
00:32:39,393 --> 00:32:41,410
I'm Nuengdiao.

497
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,980
Nuengdiao. Okay.

498
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:48,630
Is your friend also applying for the pianist position?

499
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,880
No.

500
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,480
He just tagged along with me.

501
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,180
He doesn't know how to play any musical instruments.

502
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,880
It's okay if you don't know how to play.

503
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,020
You can take a dance lesson with me. Are you interested?

504
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,270
Do you want to take a dance class?

505
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,780
Your friend is so good at the piano.

506
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,620
My father will definitely give him the job.

507
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,480
This is my first time seeing him playing the piano.

508
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,460
Are you sure you're his friend? How have you never seen his talent?

509
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,480
I mean this is the first time I hear him play this song.

510
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,612
I see.

511
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,200
What is your name again?

512
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,800
I'm Palm.

513
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,220
You're Mackie, right? I heard it earlier.

514
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,500
Your ears are working well.

515
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,650
Or is it because you are interested in me?

516
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,110
Huh?

517
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,460
Good job, Nuengdiao.

518
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,160
Excellent.

519
00:34:31,997 --> 00:34:34,740
Why don't you support your friend by dancing to his song?

520
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,920
I don't know how to dance.

521
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,750
Just give it a try to support your friend.

522
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,060
You just need to move along to the beat of the music.

523
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,360
- I really don't know how.
- I'll teach you. Trust me.

524
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,540
Stand here.

525
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,990
- Turn your hand now hold my hands.
- Okay

526
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:50,160
Take a step back. Okay, take a step back

527
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,780
Take a step to the left.

528
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,047
I'll take a step forward while you take a step back.

529
00:34:54,047 --> 00:34:56,090
Okay, take a step to the right. Walk in a square shape. Okay?

530
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,940
- Okay.
- Now match your steps to the music.

531
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,370
I'm afraid that I will step on your foot.

532
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,663
Be careful. You may hurt me.

533
00:35:03,663 --> 00:35:07,100
- Do you get it?
- Yes.

534
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,255
You are pretty good. Didn't you say you didn't know how to dance?

535
00:35:13,255 --> 00:35:15,355
Let's do it one more time.

536
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:25,210
I'll teach you other dance steps.

537
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:36,100
After dancing with her, you look more refreshed.

538
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,450
Are you really going to take the pianist job?

539
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:46,890
If they offer me the job, I will do it in my free time.

540
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,460
I want to do something useful.

541
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,840
I'm happy when I see other people happy.

542
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,670
You look happy when you play the piano.

543
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,095
Did you notice that about me?

544
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,060
I thought you only had eyes for Mackie.

545
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,390
I always keep my eyes on you.

546
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,200
- Help me. Don't take my bag.
- Give it to me.

547
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,739
- What the hell are you doing?
- Palm!

548
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,522
Palm!

549
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,320
Do you want to try me?

550
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,330
Palm, watch out.

551
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,933
Don't. Be careful.

552
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,010
Khun Nueng, call the police.

553
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,223
I'll get you back.

554
00:37:08,223 --> 00:37:11,533
Palm, are you okay?

555
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:14,193
I'm fine. It hurts a little.

556
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:18,600
You almost got killed because you tried to be a hero.

557
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,640
I can't stand it when I see people being bullied, especially those who are weak.

558
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,000
Young Man, are you all right?

559
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,100
I'm fine.

560
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,700
Thank you so much.

561
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,260
If you hadn't helped me, I would have been robed.

562
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,180
What are you selling?

563
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,710
Roti Sai Mai. Have you ever eaten it?
(T/N: Cotton candy wrapped in roti)

564
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,690
No, but I want to try it.

565
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,100
I'll buy it all from you.

566
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,920
It's okay. It's okay.

567
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,700
I'll give it to you for free to repay your kindness.

568
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,280
It's okay. I want to help you.

569
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,980
All right. Thank you.

570
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:05,400
I'm sorry. I can't make it look pretty.

571
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,840
Are your hands clean?

572
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,808
You just fought with them.

573
00:38:22,397 --> 00:38:24,007
It's delicious.

574
00:38:24,007 --> 00:38:26,100
Why have I never eaten it before?

575
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,213
Do you want another piece?

576
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,550
If I tell you I want another 100 pieces, will you make them for me?

577
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,170
Sure.

578
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,590
Do you want me to make it for you?

579
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,520
It's okay. I have someone to do that for me.

580
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,890
Do you want a big or small stuffing?

581
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,460
Just make it the way you usually do.

582
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,530
Do you want to eat it?

583
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,150
It's okay.

584
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,553
Why? Don't you want to eat it with me?

585
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,880
Is it good?

586
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,193
Yes.

587
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:32,453
You don't need to tell me. Go tell him.

588
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,476
Uncle, it's delicious.

589

[Phoomphiphat Wittayalai High School]

590
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,010
What are you listening to?

591
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,050
What?

592
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,840
What are you listening to? Can I listen to it, too?

593
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,830
You are listening to classical music.

594
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,780
You have good taste in music.

595
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,250
I listen to it in case I can play it at the dance club.

596
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,230
I got the job that you told me about.

597
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,777
I know.

598
00:40:48,777 --> 00:40:53,937
Mackie called me to tell me the news. She said you were amazing at playing the piano.

599
00:40:53,937 --> 00:40:56,880
The elders in the class loved it.

600
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,750
If I have free time, can I join you?

601
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,260
I need to thank you for telling me about the job.

602
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,420
It's good that I have new things to do.

603
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:10,483
If you hang out with me, your life will never be boring.

604
00:41:10,483 --> 00:41:13,664
Your life will be full of exciting beats, just like music.

605
00:41:13,664 --> 00:41:14,930
You don't believe me, do you?

606
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,430
I'll show you.

607
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:28,190
Play the piano.

608
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,850
- How is it?
- Why are you being so extra?

609
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,780
- It's not ending yet.
- No?

610
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,650
Palm, what's up?

611
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,653
Nothing. I have a question about the Chinese vocabulary.

612
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,250
This is Ben. He's the class president.

613
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,610
This is Palm.

614
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,160
He is the new student in my class.

615
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,650
I saw him before.

616
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,493
You are the new student.

617
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,890
Nice to meet you.

618
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,770
It may be hard to adjust to the new life at this school.

619
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:51,300
If you have any problems, just let me know.

620
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:58,450
I have to go now.

621
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,889
See you at the dance club.

622
00:43:00,889 --> 00:43:02,620
See you.

623
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,840
Who is he?

624
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:18,090
I told you, he's the class president.

625
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,990
He is the only one who talks to me nicely.

626
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,320
He was the one who told me about the job at the dance club.

627
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:31,720
Can he be trusted?

628
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,680
Of course. I think I am right about him.

629
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,970
You don't need to suspect him for me.

630
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,870
What is the Chinese vocabulary that you wanted to ask about?

631
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,670
I'll help you.

632
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,190
Nothing.

633
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,160
I didn't have a question to ask you.

634
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,330
I just wanted to check if you had any problems.

635
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:53,900
I was worried that he might have been bullying you.

636
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:58,010
He's my friend. He wasn't bullying me.

637
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,093
You should be helping me look at others in a positive light.

638
00:44:00,093 --> 00:44:02,353
Instead, you are making me scared of people.

639
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:24,060
Please get in the car. We should go home right away.

640
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,590
Why? What's wrong?

641
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,590
Let's talk about it at home.

642
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:29,300
Let's take Palm with us.

643
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,440
It's okay.

644
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,270
He can take the bus home.

645
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:38,840
Let Palm come with us. That's my order.

646
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,010
Palm.

647
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,410
Get in the car.

648
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,400
- But…
- No "but."

649
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,920
You two are so stubborn.

650
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,700
From now on, you will come to school and go home with me.

651
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,600
Get in the car.

652
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:32,460
Put your heads down!

653
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,020
What's going on, Uncle Non?

654
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,039
It's probably nothing.

655
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,520
Mom.

656
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,350
What's going on?

657
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,860
You can go now.

658
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:25,903
It's nothing, Nuengdiao. It was just a small accident.

659
00:46:25,903 --> 00:46:28,290
You are not lying to me, are you?

660
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,990
If there's something wrong, please tell me. I'm worried about you.

661
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:33,290
I told you that I was fine.

662
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,380
You must be tired from school.

663
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,630
Why don't you go take a shower and come down for dinner?

664
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:42,720
I'll order Aunt Nid to cook something delicious for you.

665
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,250
Mom.

666
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:51,300
You said you want me to grow up and take over Dad's businesses,

667
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,040
but you are treating me like a child.

668
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,351
You won't tell me anything when there are problems. You are always protecting me.

669
00:46:55,351 --> 00:46:57,850
How could I ever be ready?

670
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,330
On the one hand,

671
00:47:12,983 --> 00:47:18,513
I want Nuengdiao to grow up and be strong enough to do everything by himself.

672
00:47:18,513 --> 00:47:23,770
But I'm also worried that it may be too much for him to do everything by himself.

673
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:25,220
Chanon.

674
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,130
You saw it.

675
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,560
In the short time that I've stepped up to take Phiphop's position,

676
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,220
people started expressing dissatisfaction with me.

677
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,090
If I were alone, I wouldn't be afraid of anything,

678
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:40,890
but I can't let anything happen to my son.

679
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:46,270
Palm.

680
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:52,120
Please take very good care of Nuengdiao.

681
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,210
Nuengdiao is soft-hearted.

682
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:55,940
He is too sensitive.

683
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,800
People always want to take advantage of him.

684
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,120
I don't know what people want from him when they approach him.

685
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:10,180
You need to protect him, both physically and emotionally.

686
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,840
Can I trust you to do that?

687
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,980
Yes, Khun Tanya.

688
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,830
I'll do my best to take care of him.

689
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:43,610
[Next Week]
Palm. I have to tell you something.

690
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:45,680
You will be seeing me often.

691
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,740
I hope you will have a little more trust in me.

692
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,901
I won't hurt Nuengdiao.

693
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,668
When you shot at the target, what were you thinking?

694
00:48:52,668 --> 00:48:55,857
I was thinking that I was protecting someone.

695
