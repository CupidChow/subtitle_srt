170
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,905
Trust me. Come and sit here.

171
00:10:46,465 --> 00:10:47,640
Nueng.

172
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,750
I'm so sorry.

173
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,060
My dad put Palm in this condition.

174
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,890
It's not your fault.

175
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,280
I know you tried to stop your dad.

176
00:11:05,382 --> 00:11:07,692
But because of my dad,

177
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,710
your loved one is in that condition.

178
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,360
Because I was a coward.

179
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,785
I was too scared to stop him.

180
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:15,560
I should have stopped him a long time ago.

181
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,715
I'm so sorry.

182
00:11:16,715 --> 00:11:18,545
I should have stopped him a long time ago.

183
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:21,494
You can do anything to me. You can punch or shoot me.

184
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:23,451
- I'm really sorry.
- Hey.

185
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:25,760
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm not mad at you.

186
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,975
It's not your fault.

187
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:34,047
It's not easy to put your own dad in jail.

188
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:36,740
You should be proud of yourself.

189
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:44,525
Even though you are Uncle Kit's son,

190
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:46,765
you are nothing like him.

191
00:11:50,155 --> 00:11:53,760
I know you've never had bad intentions toward me.

192
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,270
For me,

193
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:02,375
you are still my talented cousin.

194
00:12:34,102 --> 00:12:37,075
Thank you so much for calling the police to help us.

195
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:38,200
It's nothing.

196
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,980
Seeing you and Palm safe, that's good enough for me.

197
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,470
I hope that he will be alright.

198
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,380
I don't want to lose people that I love again.

199
00:13:00,852 --> 00:13:03,052
Palm will be okay.

200
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:26,395
How are you feeling?

201
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:28,155
Do you feel any better?

202
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,380
If Palm dies,

203
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,855
I don't think I will ever be able to forgive myself.

204
00:13:44,295 --> 00:13:47,370
Don't think that way.

205
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,060
Nueng said that it's not your fault.

206
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,640
Right.

207
00:13:55,375 --> 00:14:00,175
I used to be mad at you for not stopping your dad.

208
00:14:02,115 --> 00:14:04,480
But now I understand.

209
00:14:05,155 --> 00:14:07,300
How hard it is...

210
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:16,120
to choose between the right thing
and people that we love and care about.

211
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,455
It is very hard.

212
00:14:21,165 --> 00:14:23,524
To tell you the truth,

213
00:14:23,524 --> 00:14:28,643
if I were you, I wasn't sure if I would
be brave enough to do what you did.

214
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,215
I'm proud of you.

215
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:40,655
Thank you so much for coming to help us.

216
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,088
When I heard what happened from Palm,
the first thing I did was send the message to you.

217
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,640
[I'm going to see Nueng and tell him everything.]

218
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,480
[Thank you for talking some sense into me.]

219
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,741
[Don't give up on me yet.]

220
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:05,135
At first, I thought you wouldn't come.

221
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,060
Why wouldn't I come?

222
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,510
I...

223
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:18,775
I also did bad things to Nueng.

224
00:15:20,142 --> 00:15:23,997
This is a good chance to redeem my mistake.

225
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,790
One more thing,

226
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:34,930
I went there for you.

227
00:15:36,565 --> 00:15:39,117
I want to stay by your side.

228
00:15:39,117 --> 00:15:42,900
I want you to know that you did the right thing.

229
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,700
You did good.

230
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,109
No matter what happens,

231
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,233
I'll always be by your side.

232
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,975
Don't you feel disappointed in me?

233
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,630
The feelings I have for you.

234
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,320
Are you okay with it?

235
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,500
I'm okay.

236
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,545
Remember this.

237
00:16:20,545 --> 00:16:22,721
The feelings that you have,

238
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,995
I feel the same way.

239
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:38,450
♫ Baby, you can turn the rain into gold. ♫

240
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,240
♫ So this is what ♫

241
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,740
Do you feel any better?

242
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,990
♫ I like it ♫

243
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,875
Palm.

244
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,532
Mr. Nueng.

245
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:24,132
How do you feel?

246
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:27,585
I'm thirsty.

247
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,640
Take it easy.

248
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,694
How long have I been out?

249
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,510
It's been two days since you came out of the surgery.

250
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:14,170
Is my condition that serious?

251
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,890
It's not serious.

252
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,915
The doctor said you need some rest.

253
00:18:19,915 --> 00:18:22,310
You should stay in the hospital for a while.

254
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,070
Have you been staying with me all this time?

255
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,210
Yes.

256
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,790
I was sleeping here.

257
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,250
I wanted to be the first one
that you saw when you woke up.

258
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,095
While I was unconscious, did anything happen?

259
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,365
I can't remember anything.

260
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:49,935
All I remember...

261
00:18:50,685 --> 00:18:52,966
was I blacked out.

262
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,400
You took the bullet for me.

263
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:07,395
What happened to Mr. Supakit?

264
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:09,240
He was arrested.

265
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,805
Chopper agreed to be a witness
to testify against his dad.

266
00:19:11,805 --> 00:19:16,145
So the police interrogated the gunmen again.

267
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:19,905
They finally confessed that
your dad had nothing to do with the crime.

268
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:28,535
From now on, you are no longer a target of an attack.

269
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,020
Um.

270
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,673
Mr. Nueng.

271
00:19:44,673 --> 00:19:46,602
What's wrong with my leg?

272
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,090
Why can't I move my right leg?

273
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:09,775
The doctor said that your right leg
may be temporarily paralyzed.

274
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,685
You need to regularly receive physical therapy.

275
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,670
It's okay.

276
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,330
It will get back to normal soon.

277
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:35,000
For all those times, you have been taking care of me.

278
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,200
Now, it's time for me to take care of you.

279
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,000
I will never leave you.

280
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,670
[Physical Therapy Department]

281
00:20:58,787 --> 00:21:00,873
Walk slowly. Don't put your weight on it.

282
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:02,833
The doctor said you should move slowly.

283
00:21:07,355 --> 00:21:09,485
Mr. Nueng, don't help me. I can get up by myself.

284
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:11,375
It's okay.

285
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,135
I said you don't need to help me.

286
00:21:13,135 --> 00:21:14,825
I can get up by myself.

287
00:21:14,825 --> 00:21:17,160
Don't be stubborn.

288
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,535
Accepting help is not going to kill you.

289
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,665
What if my leg won't get back to normal?

290
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,195
Don't give up yet. You need to be positive.

291
00:21:31,195 --> 00:21:33,630
Even if you can't walk normally,

292
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,165
you still have me to help you.

293
00:21:53,505 --> 00:21:55,105
Palm.

294
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:03,060
Palm.

295
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,160
How are you?

296
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,810
I'm getting better.

297
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,275
Nueng told me that you are working hard.

298
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:14,082
Your condition is getting better, isn't it?

299
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,233
If you continue to do physical therapy,
you will be able to play basketball again.

300
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,780
I'm here to apologize to you.

301
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,900
I'm sorry that my dad put you in this condition.

302
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,510
You weren't the one who shot me.

303
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,670
You don't need to apologize to me.

304
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,885
I'll take the responsibility for it.

305
00:22:37,885 --> 00:22:40,105
I'll pay all the medical bills
until you are fully recovered.

306
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:43,640
It's okay. I'll pay for it myself.

307
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,730
I don't want to be a charity project for anyone. You don't need to pity me.

308
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:58,195
Don't view it that way.

309
00:22:58,195 --> 00:23:01,820
I'm not doing this because I pity you.

310
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,350
I need to take responsibility for the things
that my dad did to you and Nueng.

311
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,710
Although he is already serving his punishment in jail.

312
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,850
This is the only thing I can do for you.

313
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,850
I'm begging you.

314
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:20,930
My dad did many bad things.

315
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,685
Can you give me a chance to do good things?

316
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,230
It's up to you.

317
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,850
Nueng, don't forget to take care of yourself.

318
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,630
You need to eat a lot.

319
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,140
I think you need a lot of energy for Palm.

320
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,330
Why?

321
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,535
I mean Palm is stubborn.

322
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:04,170
So Nueng will need a lot of energy to support him.

323
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,940
Oh I see.

324
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,840
What were you thinking?

325
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,180
Nothing.

326
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,350
Why didn't you explain it sooner?

327
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,730
I was going to.

328
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,700
Don't worry. I can handle it.

329
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,570
Thanks a lot.

330
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,340
What are you two going to do next?

331
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,500
I'm planning to go study in England.

332
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,200
I want to study music there.

333
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,685
I'm planning to go with him.

334
00:24:31,685 --> 00:24:34,655
I'm looking for a university.
I'm planning to study finance.

335
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:36,555
Are you going together?

336
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,800
You need to ask him if he's going to go with me.

337
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,605
Didn't you ask me to go with you?

338
00:24:47,975 --> 00:24:50,505
Yes. But I wasn't serious about it.

339
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:53,265
- I didn't think that you would go with me.
- Of course, I will.

340
00:24:53,265 --> 00:24:55,480
If you're going with me, that's fine.

341
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,085
We are leaving now.

342
00:24:58,085 --> 00:25:00,860
- Don't forget to take care of yourself.
- Um.

343
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,805
- See you.
- See you. Bye.

344
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,405
Bye.

345
00:25:19,845 --> 00:25:21,465
Palm.

346
00:25:21,465 --> 00:25:22,690
What happened?

347
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,330
I'm going to the bathroom.

348
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,340
Why didn't you tell me or the nurse?

349
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,540
- Get up.
- It's okay, Mr. Nueng.

350
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,735
I can go to the bathroom by myself.

351
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:33,295
Your walking is not back to normal yet.

352
00:25:33,295 --> 00:25:35,240
- Take it easy.
- Mr. Nueng,

353
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,810
I said I can go by myself.

354
00:25:37,815 --> 00:25:40,695
- Get up.
- Mr. Nueng, don't you have work to do?

355
00:25:40,695 --> 00:25:43,065
Why are you wasting your time on me?

356
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,190
How could you say that?

357
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,240
Do you know that your words hurt me?

358
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,925
You may think that you are protecting me
and sacrificing yourself for me.

359
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,210
But what you are doing right now makes me
feel like my love means nothing to you.

360
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:07,685
When you took care of me, it made you happy.

361
00:26:07,685 --> 00:26:11,800
Have you ever thought that I will be happy too
when I take care of you?

362
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,240
- But I don't want to be your burden.
- You are not a burden.

363
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:18,410
You are my lover.

364
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:25,665
It's normal for lovers to be there for each other.
Both in good and bad times.

365
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,850
Don't try to be the only hero.

366
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,510
We need to be heroes for each other.

367
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,220
Come on. Get up.

368
00:26:43,055 --> 00:26:45,115
One, two.

369
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,530
Take it easy.

370
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,880
Can I sleep on the bed with you?

371
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,215
I slept alone for several nights. I can't sleep.

372
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,010
I want to hold you.

373
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,540
If you don't want to stay here,

374
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,190
I can take you home.

375
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,530
When my mom is discharged from the hospital,

376
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,510
I will take care of both of you.

377
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,820
You don't need to worry that it will be uncomfortable.

378
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,570
You will stay in my room.

379
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,585
I'll explain everything to my mom.

380
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,800
Are you sure about that?

381
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,545
I think it's too early for Mrs. Tanya.

382
00:28:07,355 --> 00:28:09,040
Don't worry.

383
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,580
My mom likes you.

384
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,781
There won't be any problem.

385
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,030
Now, we will finally be together.

386
00:28:21,055 --> 00:28:23,395
I don't want to sleep alone anymore.

387
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,305
Hello, Mrs. Tanya.

388
00:28:57,305 --> 00:28:59,605
Hello, Palm.

389
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,480
How are you feeling?

390
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,305
I'm much better now.

391
00:29:03,305 --> 00:29:07,145
I will be discharged from the hospital soon
and be able to walk again.

392
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,980
Palm is doing well.

393
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,680
He will be able to walk normally soon.

394
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,080
He should be discharged at the same time as you.

395
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,640
It's because he has great support from you.

396
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,055
Palm and I will be discharged from the hospital soon.

397
00:29:22,055 --> 00:29:25,600
While you were unconscious, I told you about Palm.

398
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,595
When we were living on the island,
many things happened to us.

399
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:31,290
I'm not sure if you could hear me.

400
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:36,130
You can tell me again.

401
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:40,290
This time, you need to tell me every detail.

402
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,025
If I tell you in detail,
it will take more than one day.

403
00:29:43,025 --> 00:29:46,429
One more thing,
I need Palm to help me tell them.

404
00:29:52,505 --> 00:29:54,930
I'm sorry, Mom. I need to take this call.

405
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,245
It's a customer's call from England.

406
00:29:56,245 --> 00:30:01,290
Right now, we are expanding
our customer base in Europe.

407
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:04,540
I'll have Palm tell me about your lives on the island.

408
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,540
I'll go take the call.

409
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,490
Hi.

410
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,178
I'm very sorry.

411
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:12,778
How are you?

412
00:30:18,805 --> 00:30:23,115
Thank you so much for taking good care
of Nuengdiao, Palm.

413
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,567
You don't need to thank me.

414
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:30,560
I took him to have a hard time and be in danger.

415
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,700
Instead, I should apologize to you.

416
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,510
For failing to keep my promise.

417
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,269
Nuengdiao has changed.

418
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,820
He's changed for the better.

419
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,545
He is more mature and self-sufficient.

420
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:53,220
I don't know what he had been through
when he was with you.

421
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,075
But those things made him stronger.

422
00:30:58,011 --> 00:31:02,225
Your family risked your lives for my family.

423
00:31:02,225 --> 00:31:05,215
Nuengdiao told me about your mom.

424
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,655
I'm sorry for your loss.

425
00:31:10,145 --> 00:31:11,193
Yes.

426
00:31:11,193 --> 00:31:13,500
You don't need to worry, Palm.

427
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,105
I will take good care of you and Chanon.

428
00:31:21,175 --> 00:31:26,170
Palm, you don't need to take care of Nuengdiao anymore.

429
00:31:27,425 --> 00:31:30,080
You can go back to live your life.

430
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,645
I'll find someone else to take care of him.

431
00:31:37,365 --> 00:31:39,750
Yes, Mrs. Tanya.

432
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,290
Now, I have nothing to worry about.

433
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,700
If Pipop saw this,

434
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,400
he would be happy to see that Nuengdiao

435
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:54,050
can take care of himself and Kiattrakulmaytee's business.

436
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,600
I will retire soon.

437
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,880
I hope that there will be
no other obstacles in his life.

438
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:24,425
I hope that there will be
no other obstacles in his life.

439
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:48,165
Palm.

440
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:51,875
Palm.

441
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,260
Excuse me.

442
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,705
Where is the patient?

443
00:33:04,705 --> 00:33:07,280
He was discharged.

444
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,795
But he can't walk.

445
00:33:08,795 --> 00:33:11,860
He's not fully back to normal.
So he asked our staff to call a taxi for him.

446
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:16,140
- Do you know where he went?
- No, I don't. Excuse me.

447
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,610
Mr. Nueng,

448
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:59,295
I'm sorry that I can't keep the promise I gave you.

449
00:33:59,295 --> 00:34:02,220
Please don't waste your time on me anymore.

450
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,660
I know that you love me.

451
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,434
Thank you so much.

452
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,220
But I want you to love yourself more.

453
00:34:14,615 --> 00:34:18,510
You should live your life without worrying about me.

454
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:23,485
For all these times, being loved by you.

455
00:34:24,255 --> 00:34:27,120
I'm so lucky to have that.

456
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,515
It's more than I could ever dream of.

457
00:34:30,515 --> 00:34:33,010
If you really love me,

458
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,340
please don't look for me.

459
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,765
Because this is what I want.

460
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,635
I love you, Mr. Nueng.

461
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:43,772
From Palm.

[3 Months Later]

472
00:35:31,765 --> 00:35:34,110
Don't overdo yourself.

473
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,995
Are you fully recovered from your injury?

474
00:35:36,995 --> 00:35:39,190
I'm still limping a bit.

475
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,695
If I get some more rest, I'll be fine.

476
00:35:41,695 --> 00:35:44,047
You should take better care of yourself.

477
00:35:44,047 --> 00:35:46,380
Since you came back,

478
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,340
you've been doing everything by yourself
to open the bar.

479
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,770
You didn't ask anyone to help.

480
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:52,530
If they are the things that I can do,
I want to do them myself.

481
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,670
So I can save money.

482
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:04,445
Your mom would be proud to see
her son carrying out her dream.

483
00:36:04,445 --> 00:36:09,175
I thought this bar would become abandoned.

484
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,195
I won't let that happen, Tam.

485
00:36:12,195 --> 00:36:14,955
I've planned to reopen her business.

486
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:20,070
This is the only thing that I can do for my mom.

487
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,690
To repay her for everything she did for me.

488
00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:26,285
If there's anything I can help, just let me know.

489
00:36:26,285 --> 00:36:28,135
I can help you with anything.

490
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:30,830
Look, the glasses that I washed are crystal clear.

491
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,530
It's all done.

492
00:36:34,085 --> 00:36:37,530
By the way, where is Nuengdiao?

493
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,743
Why isn't he here to help you?
Is he busy managing his business?

494
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,040
I guess he is living his life right now.

495
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,535
Is that so?

496
00:37:01,535 --> 00:37:03,480
That's too bad.

497
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,640
At least, he should come to help you
take care of the guests and do accounting.

498
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,880
You are doing everything by yourself.

499
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,570
But it's okay. You have me.

500
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,670
I'm here. I can do everything. Don't worry.

501
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,680
But you should find someone to help you.

502
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,675
So I will have time to go out on a date.

503
00:37:20,675 --> 00:37:22,890
I can't help you all the time.

504
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,815
- I got it, Tam.
- You can't do everything on your own.

505
00:37:24,815 --> 00:37:26,645
I'll find someone to help me.

506
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,645
Alright.

507
00:37:54,222 --> 00:37:56,658
What are you doing? Don't you feel shy about it anymore?

508
00:37:56,658 --> 00:37:59,740
No. I want to hold you to recharge my energy.

509
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,815
Today, we have so many guests.

510
00:38:01,815 --> 00:38:04,320
My mom also ordered me to do many things.

511
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,765
I'm tired and my body is aching.
So I want my boyfriend to help boost my energy.

512
00:38:07,765 --> 00:38:10,555
Do you think I'm a battery charger?

513
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:13,270
Yes. You are my battery.

514
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,820
When I hold you, my exhaustion melts away.

515
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,940
Palm, let me go.

516
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,985
How could you devalue me like that?

517
00:38:21,985 --> 00:38:23,770
Now, I'm just a battery?

518
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:27,165
If you don't need energy,
you won't come to me, will you?

519
00:38:27,165 --> 00:38:29,165
It's not like that.

520
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:37,313
Even though I don't feel tired,
I will come to you anyway.

521
00:38:39,507 --> 00:38:41,100
What if I feel tired, what should I do?

522
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,868
If you feel tired, you can kiss or hold me too.

523
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:48,338
You are taking all the advantages.

524
00:38:52,795 --> 00:38:54,841
Mr. Nueng, are you tired?

525
00:39:11,955 --> 00:39:13,745
I guess that can help get rid of your tiredness.

526
00:39:13,745 --> 00:39:16,050
Go back to work.

527
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:19,260
But I still feel tired.

528
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,690
I need to hold you a bit longer.

529
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,658
Palm. Your mom will scold you.

530
00:39:23,658 --> 00:39:26,650
She can scold me. I'm not afraid of her.

531
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,145
Go back to work.

532
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,140
Nueng.

533
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,080
Mom.

534
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,220
How are you doing?

535
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,795
Why didn't you tell me
that you are coming to the hotel?

536
00:40:41,795 --> 00:40:46,160
Actually, I don't think I need to come
because I trust you.

537
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,040
My son is a talented man.

538
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,990
Don't overestimate me.

539
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,590
Leave some room for me to make mistakes.

540
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,590
Are you tired?

541
00:40:57,645 --> 00:41:00,945
Are you deciding to buy this hotel?

542
00:41:00,945 --> 00:41:04,942
Based on its fundamental structure, it's quite okay.

543
00:41:04,942 --> 00:41:09,720
Although it looks a bit old,
I think it will look great after renovation.

544
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,180
Nueng.

545
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,055
Can I ask you something?

546
00:41:16,055 --> 00:41:18,770
You are dedicating yourself to work.

547
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,450
Is it because you feel lonely?

548
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,625
I'm worried about you.

549
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:26,450
Don't worry. I'm doing this because I enjoy it.

550
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,030
There are many projects that I want to do.

551
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,375
Nueng, I'll tell you something.

552
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,735
You cannot use work
to fill an empty hole in your heart.

553
00:41:40,735 --> 00:41:43,325
It won't work.

554
00:41:43,325 --> 00:41:47,190
Even though you try to exhaust yourself physically,

555
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:51,625
and keep your brain busy,

556
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:55,715
Your heart is still longing for the same thing.

557
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,006
What do you mean?

558
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,335
Are you longing for someone?

559
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:10,580
If you miss him, why don't you go to see him?

560
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,273
But he doesn't want to see me.

561
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,875
I want him to live the life that he wants.

562
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:23,390
I don't want him to live a life
where he will be following me around.

563
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,960
So I need to forget him.

564
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,625
But time already proves that you are not over him.

565
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:35,695
Normally, you are very persistent.

566
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,690
Why aren't you being persistent about this?

567
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:09,266
Hello. Please have a seat.

568
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:11,110
The bar reopened today.

569
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,700
We don't have any food. Only drinks are available.

570
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,390
You can chill out and enjoy yourself.

571
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:18,760
The atmosphere is great.

572
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,940
Is the bar's name Nuengdiao?

573
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,260
It's a beautiful name. I haven't heard of it before.

574
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,150
The name belongs to my acquaintance.

575
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,873
I think it sounds pretty. So I decided to use the name.

576
00:43:27,873 --> 00:43:30,078
I see.

577
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,500
Here's the menu. Please take a look.

578
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,628
I'll have coconut juice.

579
00:43:36,628 --> 00:43:38,440
Sure. Please wait a sec.

580
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,640
Go take your seat.

581
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,320
Here.

582
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,080
If you need anything, please call me.
I'll be at the counter.

583
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,390
Hello.

584
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,818
I'm here to apply for a job.

585
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,380
Mr. Nueng.

586
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,135
So? Are you still looking for an employee?

587
00:44:27,175 --> 00:44:29,275
How did you come here?

588
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:33,920
I knew that you would come here.

589
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,800
You came here to fulfill your mom's dream.

590
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,705
How are you doing?

591
00:44:46,705 --> 00:44:47,803
Are you living well?

592
00:44:47,803 --> 00:44:50,105
Do you think I'm living well?

593
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:54,040
Have you ever thought that I will miss you?

594
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,765
To be honest, I have wanted to look for you
since the first day that you went missing.

595
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:03,640
But I wanted to respect your decision.

596
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,438
Do you know?

597
00:45:05,438 --> 00:45:08,120
In the past three months,

598
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:12,305
I let you do what you want and take care of yourself.

599
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,775
Do you know how terrible it felt
to be worried about you all the time?

600
00:45:18,775 --> 00:45:21,145
I didn't know if you can walk,

601
00:45:21,145 --> 00:45:25,100
if you eat properly,
or if you can do things on your own.

602
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,439
Do you think I will be happy?

603
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:33,830
You said you wouldn't leave me.

604
00:45:35,565 --> 00:45:38,895
In the end, you broke your promise.

605
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,615
I'm sorry.

606
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:46,535
I didn't want you to waste your time on me.

607
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,675
You said you love me.

608
00:45:48,675 --> 00:45:51,850
But you hurt me and left me waiting.

609
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:54,840
Can I ask you seriously? Do you still love me?

610
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,440
Yes.

611
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,300
I always love you.

612
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,815
If you love me, why can't we be together?

613
00:46:01,815 --> 00:46:04,115
Why aren't you by my side?

614
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,570
What about your work?

615
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:12,035
I talked to my mom about it.

616
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:13,980
I can travel between here and Bangkok.

617
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,055
My mom is in Bangkok to manage the business anyway.

618
00:46:17,055 --> 00:46:18,922
But you,

619
00:46:18,922 --> 00:46:21,022
you need my help.

620
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,005
We have been through so many things together, Palm.

621
00:46:30,115 --> 00:46:34,815
Your mom sacrificed her life for our happiness.

622
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,850
Can I ask you this?

623
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,780
Living like this...

624
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,200
Living alone...

625
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,300
Are you happy?

626
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:51,415
If you are happy, you can tell me to leave.

627
00:46:51,415 --> 00:46:54,115
I will never come back to see you again.

628
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:31,060
♫ Don't be afraid even if we are separated ♫

629
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:36,085
♫ Just stay there and wait for me, I'll find you ♫

630
00:47:36,085 --> 00:47:41,730
♫ No matter what tomorrow brings,
please remember this ♫

631
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:45,550
♫ I will live only for you ♫

632
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:48,520
I still need my charger.

633
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,435
You said you would forget and leave me.

634
00:48:07,435 --> 00:48:11,420
But you named the bar after me.

635
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:13,625
I can only distance myself from you.

636
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:15,460
But I know that I will never be able to forget you.

637
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:19,970
So I need something to always remind me of you.

638
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:27,730
So? Are you ready to start your work?

639
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,960
Let's go.

640
00:48:39,815 --> 00:48:41,345
Mr. Nueng, are you okay?

641
00:48:41,345 --> 00:48:43,975
I'm sorry that the room is a bit too small.

642
00:48:43,975 --> 00:48:47,500
My mom's hostel was seized by the bank.

643
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,540
So I rented this room to live in for the moment.

644
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,050
I'm okay.

645
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:52,950
Don't worry.

646
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,815
Why didn't you tell me about the hostel?

647
00:48:56,815 --> 00:48:59,360
I can buy it back for you.

648
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,838
Don't do that.

649
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:03,725
I don't want to cause any burden to you.

650
00:49:03,725 --> 00:49:06,805
I want to build everything on my own.

651
00:49:06,805 --> 00:49:12,240
I want to make my dad, my mom, and you proud.

652
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,235
You don't need to do anything.
I'm already proud of you.

653
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:24,600
How is your leg?

654
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,340
To tell you the truth,

655
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:30,330
after I ran away from you,
I went to do physical therapy regularly.

656
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:34,495
I was worried that
I wouldn't be able to walk normally again.

657
00:49:34,495 --> 00:49:39,780
I was worried that I wouldn't be able
to take you to places or swimming.

658
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:45,515
So I worked hard to get better
and waited until I would be ready.

659
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,965
I've never wanted to leave you.

660
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,495
I just thought if I wasn't physically ready,

661
00:49:52,495 --> 00:49:54,860
how could I take care of you?

662
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,910
If I didn't come to see you,

663
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:01,930
how much longer would I have
to wait for you to be ready?

664
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:03,530
That hurts.

665
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:11,395
Anyway, it doesn't matter if you are ready or not.

666
00:50:11,395 --> 00:50:13,030
I'm ready now.

667
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:16,400
You want to carry out your mom's dream.

668
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,290
I want to be with you.

669
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:24,270
Are you ready to have me in your future?

670
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:27,225
Yes.

671
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:30,100
Okay.

672
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,360
No matter what happens,

673
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,612
we will never leave each other.

674
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:37,450
We will overcome it together.

675
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:41,175
We will do everything to be together.

676
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,975
Okay, Palm?

677
00:50:45,975 --> 00:50:47,375
Yes.

678
00:51:04,585 --> 00:51:06,265
Go a bit to the left?

679
00:51:06,265 --> 00:51:08,275
To the left? Like this?

680
00:51:08,275 --> 00:51:11,605
Nuengdiao Bar and Café.

681
00:51:11,605 --> 00:51:13,365
It looks okay.

682
00:51:16,325 --> 00:51:19,221
Mr. Nueng, do you know how to do it?

683
00:51:19,221 --> 00:51:22,179
- Serve them to the customers.
- Here's your drink.

684

♫ Gets the attention that we wish that we had ♫

685
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,780
♫ Yeah, it's almost cruel 'cause I want her too ♫

686
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,690
♫ Running in circles just to make her react ♫

687
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:39,010
Are you doing okay?

688
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:43,640
♫ I wanna kiss her, but I know for a fact ♫

689
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:49,130
♫ That she's way too cool, but I want her too ♫

695
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:26,685
I've never thought I would come back here with you.

696
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,965
Why? Didn't you have any hope for us?

697
00:52:29,965 --> 00:52:31,685
How could I dare to hope for it?

698
00:52:31,685 --> 00:52:34,775
There was barely any possibility.

699
00:52:34,775 --> 00:52:36,360
How could you say that?

700
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,460
I was sending you all kinds of signals since we were living at my house.

701
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,910
But you were always acting cool.

702
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:44,350
So you had been flirting with me all those times?

703
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:46,260
You are quite daring.

704
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,970
That's right.

705
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:50,270
Because you were acting cool.

706
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:55,255
We almost died before we got together.

707
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:58,520
Even though we almost died, I think it's worth it.

708
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,090
Sitting here on the beach.

709
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:03,960
Holding your hand like this.

710
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,000
No matter how much blood I lost, I don't regret it.

711
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:17,385
Anyway, I still want you to follow your dream.

712
00:53:17,385 --> 00:53:22,230
You told me that you want to go and study music abroad.

713
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:24,880
I want you to pursue it.

714
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,570
No matter how much I want to be with you,

715
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,315
I don't want you to give up on your dream.

716
00:53:30,315 --> 00:53:32,515
What about us?

717
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,683
You don't need to worry about us.

718
00:53:35,683 --> 00:53:38,000
I'll be right here waiting for you.

719
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,755
Even though we will get
to see each other only once a year,

720
00:53:40,755 --> 00:53:44,015
I'll wait for you here, on our beach.

721
00:53:44,995 --> 00:53:48,975
Next year, I'll come back to see the hostel's owner.

722
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,535
Sure.

723
00:53:50,535 --> 00:53:52,670
I'll prove to you...

724
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:58,630
that a boy from a fisherman village
who only knows about fishing can take care of you.

725
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:02,470
Do you still hold a grudge against me?

726
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,600
You don't need to prove anything anymore.

727
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:15,045
I know that you are the one
who loves and cherishes me the most.

728
00:54:16,885 --> 00:54:20,390
I want you to live the life that you want.

729
00:54:26,675 --> 00:54:31,610
The life that I want is the life
that I can be with you.

730
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:50,740
Can I ask something from you?

731
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,885
What is it?

732
00:54:51,885 --> 00:54:53,980
Stop calling me Mr. Nueng.

733
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:55,425
Just call me Nueng.

734
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:56,365
Alright, Nueng.

735
00:54:56,365 --> 00:54:58,995
Also stop talking politely to me. No couples do that.

736
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:00,675
Sure, Nueng.

737
00:55:00,675 --> 00:55:05,065
From now on, you are no longer my boss.

738
00:55:05,065 --> 00:55:09,390
But you are the one and only love of my life.
