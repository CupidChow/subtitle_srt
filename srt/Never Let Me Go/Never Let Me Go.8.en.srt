38
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,820
Khun Nueng, what are you reading?

39
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,470
The Symposium by Plato.

40
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,140
One of the guests left it at the hostel.

41
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,280
It's about the philosophy of love.

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,450
I don't think I would understand the book.

43
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,600
It's not that complicated.

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,380
There are many theories written in the book.

45
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,530
For example, why do humans do everything for love?

46
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,645
Humans have been madly in love since ancient times.

47
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,539
Tell me more.

48
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,414
What did you learn from the book.

49
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,439
There's a story.

50
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,821
It explains the origin of love.

51
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,790
When gods created the world,

52
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,000
Human beings were created to have two bodies connected.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,660
They had four arms and four legs.

54
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,300
The male and female kind,

55
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,250
they were the offspring of the moon.

56
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,650
The female and female kind,

57
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,030
they were the offspring of the earth.

58
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,980
The male and male kind,

59
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,980
they were the offspring of the sun.

60
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,760
One day, human beings made the gods angry.

61
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,270
So a god punished them. He struck lightning on them.

62
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,340
- Bang!
- That hurts.

63
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,160
So the humans were split into two halves.

64
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,560
He also created a storm.

65
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,650
To separate their other halves so that they could not find each other.

66
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,570
This is the myth explaining why people

67
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,560
are trying to find their other halves.

68
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,980
Khun Nueng,

69
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,730
do you believe that your other half is searching for you?

70
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,140
Not...

really.

72
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:36,616
It's just a myth but it's kind of romantic.

73

Why? Do you believe it?

Are you searching for your other half?

75
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,500
Are you going to do everything to find that person?

76
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,780
Should I make an announcement for you?

77

00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,420
Maggie.

332
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,020
Can you promise that you won't tell anyone that Khun Nueng and I are staying here?

333
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,550
I'm serious.

334
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,010
Khun Nueng can be in danger.

335
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,370
You're only worried about him.

336
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:13,180
All you think about is Nuengdiao.

337
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,367
This is not a favor that you can ask for free.

338
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:19,540
You need to bribe me.

339
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,140
Where is the money?

340
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,220
Let's take more photos.

341
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,800
1, 2, 3.

342
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,960
What are you doing here?

343
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,960
I'm just taking pictures. I thought the place looks nice.

344
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,580
You can't take pictures here.

345
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,740
Delete the pictures right now.

346
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,740
This is a film camera, not a digital one. The pictures can't be deleted.

347
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,290
- Then give me the film.
- But this is my camera.

348
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,080
- Give it to me.
- Let my camera go.

349
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,171
Let it go.

350
00:24:17,171 --> 00:24:18,810
Palm, help me.

351
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,881
What are you doing? Let her go.

352
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:22,600
Stay out of it.

353
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,500
Don't butt in.

354
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,960
Are you all right, Maggie?

355
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,870
Get up slowly.

356
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,090
Are you all right? Get up slowly.

357
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,930
Palm.

358
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,443
- Palm, run!
- Let's run.

359
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,710
Hey!

360
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,630
What is going on?

361
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,560
The noise is so loud and gets into the gambling house.

362
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,130
Teenagers took pictures here.

363
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,040
Who are they?

364
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,810
We know everyone on the island.

365
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,610
I don't know them.

366
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,880
I think they are tourists.

367
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,760
But the kid who kicked you looks familiar.

368
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,690
I saw him at the hostel owned by Mam, our debtor.

369
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,680
That's why he looks familiar.

370
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,017
He must be Mam's son.

371
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:16,520
Mam's son?

372
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,430
She is my debtor and hasn't paid the money back, right?

373
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,360
I'll teach you a lesson.

374
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,100
How dare you cause trouble on my turf?

375
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,120
You shouldn't have fought with them.

376
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,020
They would never listen to us.

377
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,120
They would use force on us anyway.

378
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,880
It's just a camera. Your life is more important.

379
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,050
Let me take a look.

380
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,110
Does it hurt?

381
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,520
Nuengdiao.

382
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,250
Are you all right?

383
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,510
Thank you for helping me.

384
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,303
It's okay. I'm glad that you got your camera back.

385
00:26:02,303 --> 00:26:04,660
How did you come to help us in time?

386
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,390
When did you get there?

387
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,360
I told you that I would come see you later.

388
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,030
When I got there, I saw you were in trouble.

389
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,540
So I stepped in to help you.

390
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,440
I got used to it.

391
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,940
After spending a lot of time with Palm, I realized I need to learn these things.

392
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,281
It's good that he had a chance to protect someone else other than me.

393
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,770
I have to go now.

394
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,644
Khun Nueng, do you want me to give you a ride?

395
00:26:33,672 --> 00:26:36,672
It's okay. You should stay with Maggie.

396
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,492
Can I ask you something?

397
00:27:00,492 --> 00:27:04,908
Don't you feel frustrated that you need to hide your feelings?

398
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,560
What feelings?

399
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,800
The feelings that you have for Nuengdiao.

400
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,630
Don't you feel frustrated?

401
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:17,110
Why do you look so surprised?

402
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:21,628
The way you look at him and treat him says it all.

403
00:27:21,628 --> 00:27:23,770
It says you love Nuengdiao.

404
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:26,515
How do you know that I love Nuengdiao?

405
00:27:26,515 --> 00:27:29,183
I've never said that.

406
00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:31,916
It's so obvious.

407
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,676
You can lie to yourself, but you cannot lie to me.

408
00:27:35,676 --> 00:27:39,504
I can tell how you feel. I noticed since we were at the dance club.

409
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,480
Every time you looked at Nuengdiao when he played the piano,

410
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,929
it was the way a man looked at his lover.

411
00:27:54,130 --> 00:28:00,163
When you were dancing with me, your eyes kept looking at Nuengdiao.

412
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,268
It was like your whole world was him.

413
00:28:10,576 --> 00:28:15,156
I understand it. You are crazy in love.

414
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:17,484
I've been through it before.

415
00:28:17,484 --> 00:28:19,744
I had a crush on you at first.

416
00:28:19,744 --> 00:28:22,648
But after I saw the way you looked at him on the first day you came to the dance club,

417
00:28:22,648 --> 00:28:25,176
I knew I didn't have a chance.

418
00:28:25,176 --> 00:28:27,741
It's better to befriend you.

419
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,940
Because I have a bright personality.

420
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,788
So people misunderstood thinking I was flirting with you.

421
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,860
Thank you, Maggie.

422
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,296
No problem.

423
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:50,080
[Phoomphiphat Wittayalai High Schoo]l

424
00:29:01,704 --> 00:29:04,632
Hey! What are you doing here?

425
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:06,864
Do you have a swimming class?

426
00:29:06,864 --> 00:29:09,580
No. I'm here to see you.

427
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:13,170
Why? Did you start get into fights?

428
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,304
Are you here to take me to get into another fight?

429
00:29:15,304 --> 00:29:16,684
Are you crazy?

430
00:29:16,684 --> 00:29:18,124
I'm a peaceful man.

431
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:22,412
If they don't look for trouble with me, I won't start a fight with them.

432
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,172
What do you want from watching me swimming?

433
00:29:29,616 --> 00:29:32,080
I...

434
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,148
I have something I want to talk to you about.

435
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,748
Is it something serious?

436
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,972
Serious? Yes, it's very serious.

437
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,228
It's about us.

438
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:02,740
What are you looking at?

439
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,752
To be honest,

440
00:30:04,752 --> 00:30:08,840
when we were in 10th grade, I never thought that you were good-looking.

441
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,720
I've never been your type.

442
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,200
Should we go talk outside?

443
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,472
I'm done.

444
00:30:18,472 --> 00:30:19,990
Sure.

445
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,390
Let's go.

446
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,080
What is the serious thing you want to talk to me about?

447
00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:31,620
I want to thank you.

448
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,330
For helping me find the person who exposed Nuengdiao and me.

449
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,688
This is the serious thing that you want to talk about?

450
00:30:37,688 --> 00:30:40,864
Nueng is my cousin. You are my friend.

451
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:43,020
I had every reason to help you.

452
00:30:44,488 --> 00:30:48,280
Do you have any updates on Nuengdiao?

453
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,532
Is your dad looking for him?

454
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,730
Yes..

455
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,500
My dad sent his men to look for him.

456
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,589
He will be back soon.

457
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:06,996
He will come back and date you again.

458
00:31:11,472 --> 00:31:13,024
I...

459
00:31:13,024 --> 00:31:15,584
I have another thing I want to ask you.

460
00:31:16,848 --> 00:31:18,548
What is it?

461
00:31:21,304 --> 00:31:26,044
Do you still like me?

462
00:31:28,156 --> 00:31:30,056
Why do you ask me that?

463
00:31:31,104 --> 00:31:33,244
I'm just curious.

464
00:31:33,244 --> 00:31:37,028
I want to apologize to you.

465
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:40,288
That I rejected you when you confessed your feelings to me.

466
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,296
After that, you kept a distance from me.

467
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,630
What did you want me to do?

468
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:53,270
Staying close to the guy that I liked, but he didn't feel the same way.

469
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,270
It was awkward.

470
00:31:56,876 --> 00:31:58,976
I get it.

471
00:32:00,224 --> 00:32:05,780
You are helping me and Nuengdiao.

472
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,632
Don't you feel hurt?

473
00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:12,132
Or don't you have feelings for me anymore?

474
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,240
Why do you want to know that?

475
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,290
Just know that I'm okay now.

476
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:24,084
Forget about what happened in the past.

477
00:32:27,592 --> 00:32:32,016
If I told you I rejected you back then,

478
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:35,250
because I couldn't admit to myself who I am.

479
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:40,564
But now I know how I really feel.

480
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:46,400
♫ I couldn't stopp ♫

481
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,980
Do you still have feelings for me?

482
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,140
♫ But that has changed now ♫

483
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,880
Move. Come with us.

484
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,610
I'm not going.

485
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,510
Where are you taking her?

486
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,350
- It's none of your business.
- Khun Nueng.

487
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,068
Palm. Your mom.

488
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,831
Mom. Hey!
- Palm!
- Mom!

489
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:18,663
- Palm. Palm!
- Mom.

490
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,168
Hey!

491
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,928
Hey.

492
00:33:24,928 --> 00:33:26,510
Where are you going?

493
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,753
I'm here looking for my mom. Where did you take her?

494
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:31,536
My boss put your mom to work so she can pay back her debt.

495
00:33:31,536 --> 00:33:33,996
How the hell can you do that to my mom?

496
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,630
Palm.

497
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:40,768
Do you think you are some hotshot? Huh?

498
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,946
Do you want to die?

499
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:47,250
Calm down.

500
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,016
Don't shoot him in the gambling house.

501
00:33:49,016 --> 00:33:53,096
If there's a body here, I will need to smooth things out with the police.

502
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,790
He's here to look for his mom, Boss.

503
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,000
Hey, come here.

504
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,360
Let me go.

505
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,240
- Mom.
- Palm, don't.

506
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,296
Your son is quite daring.

507
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,144
He's such a devoted son.

508
00:34:10,144 --> 00:34:11,700
He came here to rescue you.

509
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,302
Palm, you don't have to rescue me.

510
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,657
Go home. I can take care of it.

511
00:34:17,657 --> 00:34:20,440
Stay away from these men.

512
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,924
I'll find the money to pay them back.

513
00:34:22,924 --> 00:34:25,460
How will you find the money?

514
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:30,430
I gave you a lot of time to pay it back, but you can't do it.

515
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:33,775
I want my money back today.

516
00:34:38,864 --> 00:34:44,391
If you can't pay me back, you need to work for me to pay your debt.

517
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:52,056
In my opinion, though you are a bit old,

518
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,857
you still look pretty.

519
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,690
Your body is still in shape.

520
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,680
Asshole, you cannot do that to my mom!

521
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,220
Why?

522
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,184
Why can't I do that?

523
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,395
I opened an illegal gambling house,

524
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:07,815
But the police cannot do anything about it.

525
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:11,266
Do you think I am afraid of anyone? Huh?

526
00:35:13,048 --> 00:35:16,902
Your son is brave, but he is a bit dull-witted.

527
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:23,310
- Palm
- If you don't want your mom to become a prostitute,

528
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,960
you need to pay me back.

529
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,622
If you can't find the money by the end of the day,

530
00:35:28,622 --> 00:35:31,642
brace yourself for a new father.

531
00:35:33,168 --> 00:35:35,490
- Palm.
- Let's go.

532
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,751
Palm.

533
00:35:37,751 --> 00:35:39,751
I'm sorry.

534
00:35:41,493 --> 00:35:43,628
What are you going to do?

535
00:35:43,628 --> 00:35:46,328
Where are you going to get the money?

536
00:35:46,328 --> 00:35:48,280
Why don't we call Uncle Non?

537
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,400
I tried to call my dad,

538
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,320
but I couldn't reach him. I don't know if something happened to him.

539
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,132
I have money in my account. But I need to get it from an ATM.

540
00:35:57,132 --> 00:35:59,591
It's too risky to do that.

541
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,795
What will you do if Khun Suphakit finds out?

542
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:03,706
It's not time to worry about me.

543
00:36:03,706 --> 00:36:05,640
You should be worried about your family.

544
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,830
One more thing, he may already have stopped looking for me.

545
00:36:10,551 --> 00:36:13,244
Do you want to see your mom hooking to pay for the debt?

546
00:36:13,244 --> 00:36:15,457
This is our only way.

547
00:36:21,908 --> 00:36:25,120
Okay. I'll get the money and give it to them.

548
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,437
You don't need to come with me.

549
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:29,480
You can't do that. It's very dangerous.

550
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,970
If they try to con or hurt you, what will you do?

551
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:35,970
Because you are hot-headed, that's why I don't want you to go with me.

552
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,540
Don't you trust me?

553
00:36:44,924 --> 00:36:46,640
I trust you.

554
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,660
But I'm worried about you.

555
00:36:50,637 --> 00:36:52,040
Palm.

556
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,019
If I can't pull this off, I don't deserve to inherit Kiattrakulmaythee's businesses.

557
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:01,631
Don't worry.

558
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,888
What the hell are you doing?

559
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:26,633
Here is the money that Mam owes you.

560
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,457
Is it all here? Both the principal and the interest.

561
00:37:41,457 --> 00:37:44,960
Yes, every single penny.

562
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,060
So let her go.

563
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,106
Who are you?

564
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:59,080
Why do you need to pay her debt?

565
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,784
Are you also her son?

566
00:38:03,422 --> 00:38:05,850
It doesn't matter who I am.

567
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:09,132
I just don't like seeing people being taken advantage of.

568
00:38:09,132 --> 00:38:10,284
One more thing.

569
00:38:10,284 --> 00:38:14,678
Even though she borrowed money from you, you have no right to do this to her.

570
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,950
You are quite daring.

571
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:24,620
You came here alone and dared to lecture me.

572
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,815
How dare you!?

573
00:38:28,331 --> 00:38:30,720
Listen to me.

574
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,451
If I take your money but refuse to let Mam go,

575
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,500
and then I shoot you dead,

576
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,520
what do you think about the plan?

577
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:02,184
You won't kill me.

578
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,208
You just want the money.

579
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:10,633
I know people like you well.

580
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:12,040
One more thing.

581
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,470
If I disappear, you will get into bigger trouble.

582
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,217
It isn't worth the money that you got from me.

583
00:39:42,988 --> 00:39:45,065
Mom. Khun Nueng.

584
00:39:49,102 --> 00:39:51,160
Mom, how are you?

585
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,683
I'm all right. They didn't do anything to me.

586
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:58,616
Luckily, Nueng paid the debt before they did anything.

587
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,888
Thank you so much, Nueng.

588
00:40:02,888 --> 00:40:07,850
I can't pay you back anytime soon.

589
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:12,690
But I promise that I will pay you back as soon as possible.

590
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:16,155
It's okay. You don't need to pay it back.

591
00:40:16,155 --> 00:40:17,200
No, I can't do that.

592
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,351
I don't like to owe anyone anything.

593
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:22,560
You paid the debt for me, I need to pay you back.

594
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,520
Don't try to be a saint rescuing others.

595
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,777
I don't like it.

596
00:40:27,777 --> 00:40:31,097
Mama Mam, you can pay it back whenever you have the money.

597
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:39,086
Now I get why you want to protect him so much.

598
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,202
He's nice and cute.

599
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,777
I want to thank you too, Palm.

600
00:40:49,777 --> 00:40:53,642
I know you did your best to help me.

601
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,910
Wait.

602
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,422
Earlier, you called me Mama Mam.

603
00:41:01,422 --> 00:41:03,430
Why didn't you call me Aunt Mam?

604
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:06,840
When did I become your mama?

605
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,704
Please let me call you that. It sounds cute.

606
00:41:10,704 --> 00:41:14,117
I also miss my mom.

607
00:41:14,117 --> 00:41:17,538
If you are not okay with it, I can go back and call you aunt.

608
00:41:17,538 --> 00:41:19,000
You can call me whatever you want.

609
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,110
I didn't have any hidden agenda when I mentioned it.

610
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,154
That's good.

611
00:41:22,154 --> 00:41:24,836
Now I have another son.

612
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,271
Give me a hug.

613
00:41:29,271 --> 00:41:31,880
I need some comfort.

614
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,830
I'll peel the prawn for you.

615
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,600
It's okay. I can do it.

616
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,900
I think you should let me do it. You don't need to do anything.

617
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,157
I can do it myself.

618
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,197
Peeling a prawn is a thing that lovers do for each other.

619
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,108
You said it yourself.

620
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:08,980
While we are living on this island, I'm your boyfriend.

621
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,366
So let me do it.

622
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,931
All right. Take it.

623
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,920
Do you need to feed me?

624
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,588
Of course. Couples always feed food to each other.

625
00:42:36,463 --> 00:42:38,500
Does it taste good?

626
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,170
Yes.

627
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,816
I'm just your mom.

628
00:42:43,816 --> 00:42:47,690
So my son has never thought of peeling a prawn for me.

629
00:42:48,688 --> 00:42:51,195
I feel hurt.

630
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:53,990
Mom, I'll peel a prawn for you.

631
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,302
It's okay. Do it for your boyfriend.

632
00:42:56,302 --> 00:42:59,173
I've done it for many years.

633
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:03,266
Khun Nueng, I'll peel it for you.

634
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,940
[My Michelle]

635
00:43:26,508 --> 00:43:28,108
Khun Nueng.

636
00:43:28,944 --> 00:43:31,561
I need to apologize to you.

637
00:43:33,185 --> 00:43:34,388
Apologize for what?

638
00:43:34,388 --> 00:43:37,651
You did many wrong things to me. Let me hear it.

639
00:43:38,641 --> 00:43:41,806
I want to apologize for not trusting you.

640
00:43:42,404 --> 00:43:45,491
You can take care of yourself.

641
00:43:45,491 --> 00:43:48,390
Today, you also took care of me and my mom.

642
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:51,090
Nothing else?

643
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:57,367
I have no idea.

644
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:59,100
What else did I do wrong to you?

645
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,100
You can tell me.

646
00:44:04,459 --> 00:44:07,239
I'll give you more time to think about it.

647
00:44:16,317 --> 00:44:19,222
Did Maggie leave for Bangkok?

648
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,920
Oh I see.

649
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:27,386
You are jealous because of Maggie.

650
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,927
Should I apologize to you for that?

651
00:44:32,927 --> 00:44:35,809
Why? Can't I feel jealous?

652
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:39,470
I'm your boyfriend. I have a right to feel that way.

653
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,185
It's okay.

654
00:44:41,185 --> 00:44:46,213
I get it. For you, our dating is just a casual relationship while we are on the island.

655
00:44:46,213 --> 00:44:48,080
I can't stop you from viewing it that way.

656
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,280
I can't force you to feel things that you don't.

657
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,624
You do not belong to me.

658
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:06,244
What do I need to do to show that I belong to you?

659
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:13,940
Is this a way to show that you belong to me?

660
00:45:20,949 --> 00:45:22,749
What about this?

661
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:32,734
No. I want to hear the words from a tight-lipped person like you.

662
00:45:45,904 --> 00:45:48,003
I love you, Khun Nueng.

663
00:45:49,686 --> 00:45:51,897
That's all I want.

664
00:45:54,298 --> 00:45:56,177
What about you?

665
00:45:56,177 --> 00:45:57,713
How do you feel about me?

666
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,270
I want to know your true feelings.

667
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:02,940
It's not about our casual relationship on the island.

668
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,420
I want to know how you feel.

669
00:46:07,048 --> 00:46:09,320
I've never been in love before.

670
00:46:10,364 --> 00:46:12,550
When I wake up,

671
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,923
I want you to be with me.

672
00:46:14,923 --> 00:46:16,707
When I fall asleep,

673
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:19,460
I want you to be next to me.

674
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,395
I want you to be with me every moment.

675
00:46:23,164 --> 00:46:25,784
If this is what people call love,

676
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:28,762
I think I love you.

677
00:46:29,837 --> 00:46:32,171
If that's so,

678
00:46:32,171 --> 00:46:35,271
can I express my ownership of you?

679
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:48,740
♫ When I feel worn out, tired and alone ♫

680
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:53,540
♫ And everything passes to the unknown ♫

681
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:59,940
♫ So I hold out hope ♫

682
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:06,220
♫ To be stronger than forever when its me and you together ♫

683
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:12,030
♫ because I never lost my faith in you ♫

684
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:18,340
♫ Every time when I failed you pulled me thru ♫

685
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:25,120
♫ because I never lost my faith in you ♫

686
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:52,415
Go find them.

687
00:47:52,415 --> 00:47:54,622
Don't let anyone interrupt my plan again.

688
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:56,077
Are you looking for a room?

689
00:47:56,077 --> 00:47:58,305
Do you know this kid?

690
00:47:58,305 --> 00:48:00,920
Boys. They found you.

691
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,993
You need to run.

692
00:48:02,993 --> 00:48:05,980
Do we really need to leave this island?

693
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:10,390
Why is my happiness so short?

694
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:17,220
♫ My one life, how valuable is it? ♫

695
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:24,420
♫  My one heart that I give you is the answer♫

696
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,740
♫ You are the only one  ♫

697
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:34,530
♫ Whom I will give my whole heart to ♫

698
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:39,510
♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫

699
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:44,300
♫ How valuable is it? ♫

700
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:51,430
♫ You are the only one  ♫

701
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,800
♫ You are the only one ♫

702
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:01,610
♫ Whom I will give my whole heart to ♫

703
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:08,290
♫ You are the meaning of my life ♫

704
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:18,200
♫ Because my life is for you, my one and only ♫
