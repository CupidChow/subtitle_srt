What kind of tattoo do you want?

21
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,333
I can't do yantra tattoos for magical protection from physical harm.

If you are thinking of getting a tattoo with Nuengdiao's name,

26
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:19,326
you should give up the idea.

I saw many teenagers who were crazy in love.

One day, they were madly in love.

30
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:29,780
Then they broke up a few weeks later.

31
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,624
Soon they found a new love and held each other tightly while riding a motorcycle.

32
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:37,448
No way. I won't give you that tattoo.

00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,703
Thank you for loving me that much.

167
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:13,661
I have something thing I want to give you.

168
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:14,876
What is it?

169
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:18,187
You prepared so many surprises for me that I can't keep up with you.

170
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:19,887
Wait a sec.

171
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,120
Here. This is a sun bracelet.

172
00:11:30,468 --> 00:11:33,506
I bought it from the shop that we went to together.

173
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:36,548
I remember the story you told me.

174
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:40,315
The myth about love.

175
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:42,605
Between two men.

176
00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:45,800
They were the offspring of the sun.

177
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:51,082
One day, they were punished by the gods.

178
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:54,148
They were struck by lightning.

179
00:11:56,437 --> 00:12:00,282
Their bodies were separated.

180
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:02,571
So they needed to look for their missing halves.

181
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:12,202
This bracelet is a symbol of our love.

182
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:17,615
When we found each other, we became the complete sun.

183
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,199
You have a good memory.

184
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,522
I hope the gods won't punish us.

185
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:53,890
I don't want to live without you anymore.

186
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:59,380
♫ Now I cannot picture my life being without you ♫

187
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,120
♫ You're the center of my life ♫

188
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,410
♫ I know we can't predict the future ♫

189
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,440
♫ Baby, I won't lose you, you know ♫

190
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,430
♫ That I will stick around ♫

191
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,950
♫ The sun will shine ♫

192
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,928
Your house is huge.

193
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:29,013
Only you and your dad live here?

194
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:30,614
Yes.

195
00:13:30,614 --> 00:13:32,554
I don't get why we need such a big house.

196
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:35,508
I have saved some money.

197
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:38,597
After I graduate from high school, I plan to move out.

198
00:13:38,597 --> 00:13:40,237
Me, too.

199
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:43,365
But I'm not as rich as you. So I still need help from my dad.

200
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,906
Right now, I'm working hard to save money.

201
00:13:45,906 --> 00:13:49,694
I guess, in the end,

202
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:51,080
I need to learn how to make money from you.

203
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,305
If I buy a condo, you can come and live with me.

204
00:14:02,577 --> 00:14:04,334
Wait.

205
00:14:05,058 --> 00:14:07,075
- Are you asking me to live with you?
- Yes.

206
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:09,582
Aren't you skipping the steps?

207
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,565
Normally, before people move in together,

208
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:16,848
aren't they supposed to start dating?

209
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,982
I'm asking you to live with me as a friend.

210
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:24,182
But if you want me to ask you to live with me as my boyfriend,

211
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:26,143
I can do that too.

212
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,199
Huh?

213
00:14:33,095 --> 00:14:35,513
Thanks for asking.

214
00:14:35,513 --> 00:14:38,982
At least, I feel good.

215
00:14:38,982 --> 00:14:42,882
When I feel worried or stressed,

216
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,182
I can go see you.

217
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:48,028
One day, if my dad kicks me out,

218
00:14:48,028 --> 00:14:50,382
you will be the first person I think of.

219
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,928
To be honest,

220
00:15:00,154 --> 00:15:04,318
Whenever you look back, I will always be here.

221
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,815
Don't be so cheesy.

222
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,382
I don't know how to act now.

223
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:22,086
Can I use the bathroom?

224
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:25,282
Go into the house and turn right.

225
00:15:25,282 --> 00:15:26,908
Okay.

226
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:47,855
Does it still hurt?

227
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:49,455
No.

228
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:52,780
Why do you need to apply lotion on it?

229
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,682
So it will heal faster.

230
00:15:57,284 --> 00:15:59,300
Your mom did a great job on the tattoo.

231
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,206
- Really?
- Um.

232
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:03,290
Boys.

233
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,980
Take a look at this. There's a big problem.

234
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,454
This is the news about your dad, Palm.

235
00:16:08,454 --> 00:16:10,350
For an update on Khun Thanya Kitttrakulmethee's case,

236
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,240
Khun Chanon Jannaloy, a driver who worked closely with her family, was the main suspect in the case.

237
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,366
He was hired by a business partner who leased land from the businesswoman.

238
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:20,675
The partner was angry that his land lease contract was canceled.

239
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:23,404
The suspect worked with his friends to plan the attack.

240
00:16:23,404 --> 00:16:26,780
The police are investigating to find evidence.

241
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,328
Khun Nueng, my dad would never do that.

242
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:31,640
You don't believe the news, do you?

243
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,267
Don't worry. I don't believe it.

244
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:35,355
He protected both my mom and dad.

245
00:16:35,355 --> 00:16:38,615
Uncle Non would never do anything to hurt my family.

246
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,820
My goodness,

247
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,515
Who framed your dad, Palm?

248
00:16:44,941 --> 00:16:46,479
It must be Uncle Kit.

249
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,786
He has close connections with the police.

250
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:51,108
They must have helped him set this up.

251
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:53,016
Wait.

252
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:56,349
Isn't your dad going to be put in jail for years?

253
00:16:57,657 --> 00:16:59,385
I'll go back to help him.

254
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:03,758
I'll go with you. I'll be his witness.

255
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:07,331
Don't worry. Your dad won't go to jail.

256
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:30,951
Uncle Non will be fine.

257
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:34,809
Yes, Khun Nueng.

258
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:45,749
Do we really have to leave the island?

259
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:52,649
Why is my happiness cut so short?

260
00:17:55,398 --> 00:17:59,605
I want to go back to my mom.

261
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:02,147
I want to go help Uncle Non.

262
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:07,715
But I'm afraid that I'll lose everything I have while living here.

263
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:12,782
It's okay, Khun Nueng.

264
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:18,260
No matter where you are, I will always be by your side.

265
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,515
Ben, where have you been?

266
00:18:42,515 --> 00:18:44,700
I went to submit my assignment.

267
00:18:52,894 --> 00:18:54,449
What's the matter?

268
00:18:58,117 --> 00:18:59,950
I need to talk to you.

269
00:19:00,693 --> 00:19:03,137
About what? Why don't we go outside and talk?

270
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:05,161
Let's talk here.

271
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:08,549
If someone hears, you may get in trouble.

272
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:13,868
What do you mean? Why will I get in trouble if someone hears?

273
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:22,847
Your dad sent gunmen to kill Nuengdiao's family.

274
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:33,177
Are you sure that the gunmen won't change their statement to the police?

275
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:34,411
I'm sure.

276
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:40,048
They told the police that Chanon, Khun Tanya's driver, was hired to work with them.

277
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:43,721
What about Nuengdiao and Chanon's son? Do you have any updates?

278
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:47,785
I have some new updates. I'll send my men to investigate.

279
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:50,582
You need to find them.

280
00:19:50,582 --> 00:19:53,582
Don't let anyone interrupt my plan.

281
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:55,615
What are you doing?

282
00:19:58,481 --> 00:19:59,512
I'm looking for a bathroom.

283
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:00,757
This is not a bathroom.

284
00:20:00,757 --> 00:20:03,151
It's Khun Suphakit's office..

285
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:04,388
What's going on?

286
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:07,015
I saw this kid eavesdropping.

287
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:08,971
Who are you?

288
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:11,732
I'm Chopper's friend. My name is Ben.

289
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:13,870
Chopper asked me to come here to hang out.

290
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,483
Chopper's friend?

291
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:16,498
Yes.

292
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:18,320
I haven't seen you before.

293
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,774
We used to be close before we grew apart.

294
00:20:19,774 --> 00:20:23,448
Now, we are reconnecting.

295
00:20:23,448 --> 00:20:26,448
Excuse me.

296
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,200
I heard everything.

297
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,882
I just want to know.

298
00:20:35,882 --> 00:20:37,893
All this time...

299
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:40,487
You knew, didn't you?

300
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:50,109
Tell me that you didn't know that your dad did it.

301
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:52,715
Tell me that you were pretending to be worried about Nuengdiao.

302
00:20:52,715 --> 00:20:54,890
You comforted me.

303
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,149
Even though you were well aware that your dad was behind the attack.

304
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:00,617
- Say it.
- Yes.

305
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:02,449
I knew it.

306
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,900
What do you want me to do?

307
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,382
Do you want me to report it to the police and put my dad in jail?

308
00:21:09,382 --> 00:21:11,257
I tried.

309
00:21:11,257 --> 00:21:13,644
But they never listened to me.

310
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:15,051
So what do you want me to do?

311
00:21:15,051 --> 00:21:17,760
So you just let your dad do it.

312
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,641
Are you going to let him keep hurting Nuengdiao's family?

313
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:22,940
Someone has to stop him.

314
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,954
If you won't do it,

315
00:21:25,954 --> 00:21:27,782
I will.

316
00:21:28,702 --> 00:21:31,215
I'll report this to the police.

317
00:21:31,215 --> 00:21:32,351
Ben.

318
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:35,115
I'm begging you.

319
00:21:35,115 --> 00:21:38,615
If my dad finds out, he will kill you.

320
00:21:40,562 --> 00:21:42,650
Are you worried about my safety?

321
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,615
Or are you threatening me?

322
00:21:45,398 --> 00:21:47,561
I'm not threatening you.

323
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:49,849
I'm worried about you.

324
00:21:52,451 --> 00:21:55,751
Don't pretend like you don't know how I feel about you.

325
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,484
I'm begging you. Please let me take care of this.

326
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,200
I promise that I won't let my dad kill anyone else.

327
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,700
If he hurts you,

328
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,853
I don't think I could bear it.

329
00:22:16,522 --> 00:22:18,597
Will you promise me?

330
00:22:21,522 --> 00:22:23,154
Can you do that, Ben?

331
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
I'll wait and see what you are going to do.

332
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:32,482
If you don't do anything,

333
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,426
Then I'll do it.

334
00:22:35,426 --> 00:22:39,451
When that day comes, I won't care...

335
00:22:39,451 --> 00:22:41,948
about your feelings for me.

336
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,350
[My Michelle | Bar & Café]

337
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,782
Are you looking for a room?

338
00:23:16,782 --> 00:23:18,330
No.

339
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,348
I'm looking for someone.

340
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:22,149
Who?

341
00:23:23,927 --> 00:23:25,982
Do you know this kid?

342
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:31,503
He doesn't look familiar. I don't think he's a local.

343
00:23:31,503 --> 00:23:33,682
He may not be a local.

344
00:23:33,682 --> 00:23:36,252
He might be a staying at your guesthouse.

345
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,600
My guests are all foreigners, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and from around the world.

346
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,638
I don't have many Thai guests.

347
00:23:45,638 --> 00:23:47,763
Are you sure?

348
00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:49,051
Yes, I'm sure.

349
00:23:49,051 --> 00:23:54,693
Why don't you go to other beaches where there are pool villas for rent?

350
00:23:54,693 --> 00:23:57,757
Kids like to rent them to have parties.

351
00:23:57,757 --> 00:23:59,137
He may be staying there.

352
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,948
Thank you.

353
00:24:06,102 --> 00:24:09,589
Boys. They found you. You need to run.

354
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:13,075
- Mom, who are you talking about?
- Those men who are looking for Nueng.

355
00:24:13,075 --> 00:24:14,650
They came to look for you here.

356
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,805
I lied and got rid of them.

357
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:19,265
But I think they will come back.

358
00:24:19,265 --> 00:24:21,859
You need to run now.

359
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:24,188
Take my motorcycle.

360
00:24:24,188 --> 00:24:26,934
You can leave it wherever you want. Call me later to tell me where you left it.

361
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:29,125
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

362
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,964
I can take care of myself. You need to think about yourself first.

363
00:24:31,964 --> 00:24:33,882
Take Nueng somewhere and stay there for a night.

364
00:24:33,882 --> 00:24:37,115
Then you need to hurry back to help your dad.

365
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:39,448
Yes, Mom.

366
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:49,082
I'm glad that you came to live with me.

367
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:55,714
I'm glad that I had the chance to be your mom even for only a couple of weeks.

368
00:24:56,457 --> 00:24:59,941
Your dad raised you well.

369
00:24:59,941 --> 00:25:05,269
I'm sorry that I have never taken care of you.

370
00:25:06,195 --> 00:25:08,145
It's all right, Mom. I get it.

371
00:25:08,145 --> 00:25:10,515
I'll come back to see you again.

372
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,151
Why are you just standing there? Come and hug me.

373
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,651
Come here.

374
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,441
You two,

375
00:25:44,441 --> 00:25:46,915
Take care of each other.

376
00:25:46,915 --> 00:25:49,149
If you have no place to go,

377
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:50,764
you can come back here.

378
00:25:50,764 --> 00:25:52,138
Do you hear me?

379
00:25:52,138 --> 00:25:56,782
You are always welcome at my hostel.

380
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,800
Go pack. I'll go down and keep a look out.

381
00:26:25,462 --> 00:26:30,118
Why are you back? I told you that I don't know him.

382
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:32,481
Sis, calm down.

383
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:34,717
There's no need to use a gun.

384
00:26:34,717 --> 00:26:38,382
What sis? I'm not your sis.

385
00:26:38,382 --> 00:26:41,240
If I shoot you now, I won't face any charges.

386
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,374
Because you are trespassing on my property.

387
00:26:43,374 --> 00:26:45,705
Go get those two kids.

388
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:48,007
I know they are here.

389
00:26:49,485 --> 00:26:52,917
When I take care of my business, I won't come back to your hostel again.

390
00:26:52,917 --> 00:26:55,284
Who the hell do you think you are to order me around?

391
00:26:55,284 --> 00:26:57,588
I don't even listen to my husband.

392
00:26:57,588 --> 00:26:59,982
I think you'd better leave now.

393
00:26:59,982 --> 00:27:02,449
Get out of here.

394
00:27:04,176 --> 00:27:06,276
Get out.

395
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:08,604
Get out.

396
00:27:08,604 --> 00:27:10,441
Get out.

397
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,305
Mom.

398
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,188
Mom. Mom.

399
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:18,815
Palm, run!

400
00:27:23,805 --> 00:27:25,605
Mom.

401
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:34,006
Khun Nueng, wait here.

402
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:37,440
Mom. mom, mom

403
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,930
Stop!

404
00:27:41,063 --> 00:27:44,349
Mom, mom, mom

405
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:46,814
Mom.

406
00:27:46,814 --> 00:27:48,222
Mom.

407
00:27:48,222 --> 00:27:50,349
Mom.

408
00:27:56,437 --> 00:27:58,958
Mama Mam.

409
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,649
Mama Mam.

410
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,392
Khun Nueng.

411
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,462
We have to go.

412
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:18,382
What about your mom?

413
00:28:20,453 --> 00:28:22,482
My mom is dead.

414
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:27,482
We need to go before they come back.

415
00:28:28,848 --> 00:28:30,548
Let's go.

416
00:30:05,794 --> 00:30:08,304
Are you all right?

417
00:30:08,304 --> 00:30:11,451
- I'm here.
- Leave me alone!

418
00:30:25,483 --> 00:30:27,705
Khun Nueng, are you okay?

419
00:30:27,705 --> 00:30:29,405
I'm sorry.

420
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,600
I told you that bad things happened because of me.

421
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,597
If you didn't bring me here...

422
00:30:37,597 --> 00:30:39,100
If you didn't try to protect me...

423
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,481
your mom would still be alive!

424
00:30:41,481 --> 00:30:42,993
Don't you see?

425
00:30:42,993 --> 00:30:46,082
When we are together, something bad always happens!

426
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,431
That's enough, Palm.

427
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:50,104
We shouldn't be together.

428
00:30:50,104 --> 00:30:52,091
I'm going back to Bangkok.

429
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:54,952
I won't let you go anywhere. You didn't do anything wrong.

430
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:57,217
Why are you trying to stop me?

431
00:30:57,217 --> 00:30:59,440
Don't you see it's impossible between us?

432
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,035
How could you say that?

433
00:31:01,035 --> 00:31:05,351
You told me that you love me. Was that a lie?

434
00:31:05,351 --> 00:31:07,735
Yes, I lied.

435
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:09,233
I don't love you.

436
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:11,849
I just fooled you to love me.

437
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:14,949
Did you really think that we can be together?

438
00:31:14,949 --> 00:31:16,944
We are from different clases,

439
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:19,858
from different worlds, from different societies.

440
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:23,316
A guy like you will never make me happy.

441
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:28,152
Even if no one was trying to kill me, it would still be impossible between us.

442
00:31:30,997 --> 00:31:33,480
Don't ever go looking for me again.

443
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,448
Otherwise, you may end up dead.

444
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:48,048
Khun Nueng, please don't leave me.

445
00:32:18,132 --> 00:32:21,497
An air-conditioned suite room is 700 baht a night.

446
00:32:21,497 --> 00:32:25,077
Most of the guests here are night workers,

447
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:27,897
or foreigners who opened a room for casual sex.

448
00:32:27,897 --> 00:32:30,009
Where are you two from?

449
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:31,731
Why did you choose to stay at my hotel?

450
00:32:31,731 --> 00:32:34,420
It doesn't look like your style.

451
00:32:37,338 --> 00:32:39,935
We are on vacation.

452
00:32:39,935 --> 00:32:43,985
The hotel room that we booked was canceled. So we looked for a hotel nearby.

453
00:32:45,493 --> 00:32:48,465
I'm asking you for real. Are you renting a room to do something?

454
00:32:48,465 --> 00:32:50,805
Or are you on the run?

455
00:32:53,088 --> 00:32:54,985
I don't mind it.

456
00:32:54,985 --> 00:32:57,292
If you want anything, just let me know.

457
00:32:57,292 --> 00:32:59,022
I have many special items.

458
00:32:59,022 --> 00:33:02,715
If we want anything, we will call the lobby.

459
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:04,994
Sure. Okay.

460
00:33:54,602 --> 00:33:56,282
Are you okay?

461
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:02,648
Yes.

462
00:34:05,707 --> 00:34:07,225
You should go take a shower.

463
00:34:07,225 --> 00:34:10,010
It may help you feel better.

464
00:34:11,348 --> 00:34:15,509
It's okay. You can take a shower first.

465
00:34:15,509 --> 00:34:18,682
I'll order a beer.

466
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,582
Do you want anything?

467
00:34:22,677 --> 00:34:27,448
To be honest, I don't want you to drink.

468
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:31,415
But if it can help you forget and sleep,

469
00:34:31,415 --> 00:34:33,982
Then do it. I'll be here for you.

470
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,108
I'm sorry that I can't drink with you. If I drink, I will be a burden to you.

471
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:49,492
You should go take a shower or a bath.

472
00:34:49,492 --> 00:34:51,982
It can help. Trust me.

473
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,811
I'll order a beer for you.

474
00:34:56,288 --> 00:34:57,710
All right.

475
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:37,753
Which one of you is Palm?

476
00:35:37,753 --> 00:35:39,731
I haven't seen him in such a long to recognize him.

477
00:35:39,731 --> 00:35:41,409
It's me.

478
00:35:42,062 --> 00:35:43,559
Are you glad that I came to live with you?

479
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:47,549
Do you think that I don't love or miss you?

480
00:35:47,549 --> 00:35:54,915
I left you, but it didn't mean that I don't love you.

481
00:35:54,915 --> 00:35:57,215
I'm sorry.

482
00:36:04,094 --> 00:36:06,282
Earlier, you called me Mama Mam.

483
00:36:06,282 --> 00:36:07,502
Why didn't you call me Aunt Mam?

484
00:36:07,502 --> 00:36:10,073
Please let me call you that. It sounds cute.

485
00:36:10,073 --> 00:36:11,131
That's good.

486
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:13,192
Now I have another son.

487
00:36:13,192 --> 00:36:17,249
Give me a hug. I need some comfort.

488
00:36:19,134 --> 00:36:21,952
Our lives are not only about love.

489
00:36:21,952 --> 00:36:27,749
It's not like we are dating, sleeping together, getting married, and that's it.

490
00:36:27,749 --> 00:36:29,982
Do you love Nueng?

491
00:36:32,063 --> 00:36:35,067
Take care of each other.

492
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:38,335
If you have no place to go, you can come here.

493
00:36:38,335 --> 00:36:43,082
You are always welcome at my hostel.

494
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:04,482
Here is the beer that you ordered.

495
00:37:04,482 --> 00:37:05,565
How much?

496
00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:07,459
It's 450 baht.

497
00:37:16,226 --> 00:37:18,206
Wait a second. I'll give you the change.

498
00:37:18,866 --> 00:37:20,820
No need for that.

499
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:23,617
That's great.

500
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,744
So you are having a party?

501
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,181
A little.

502
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:28,680
No need to hide it from me.

503
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,494
You can party as hard as you want.

504
00:37:30,494 --> 00:37:32,156
If you want anything, just let me know.

505
00:37:32,156 --> 00:37:33,440
I can find it for you.

506
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,551
For you, I'll offer a cheaper price.

507
00:37:40,379 --> 00:37:41,979
Do you want it?

508
00:37:48,777 --> 00:37:51,082
Can you find something for me?

509
00:37:57,089 --> 00:37:59,160
That's a piece of cake.

510
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,948
I'll arrange it for you.

511
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,760
♫ An ocean, a cave ♫

512
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,530
♫ A dream that no one could save ♫

513
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,910
♫ A shelter ♫

514
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,320
♫ Our whole lives ♫

515
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:34,140
♫ A lie that dies with the night ♫

516
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:41,680
♫ You and I, we got our differences ♫

517
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:53,420
♫ I thought that we were more alike than unlike ♫

518
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,710
♫ Monsoon rain and chest pain ♫

519
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,800
♫ What's the plan? ♫

520
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:08,270
♫ Hard to breath and staying sane ♫

521
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:13,150
♫ Grab my hand ♫

522
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:19,720
♫ Everything is great inside this narrow maze ♫

523
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:38,750
♫ Monsoon rain and chest pain ♫

524
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,450
♫ Hard to breathe and staying sane ♫

525
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:52,450
♫ Now grab my hand ♫

526
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,580
♫ Monsoon rain and chest pain ♫

527
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:00,270
♫ Tell me, what's the plan? ♫

528
00:40:05,373 --> 00:40:06,982
Palm.

529
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,280
Have you ever thought about this?

530
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,482
What would your life be like if you hadn't met me?

531
00:40:16,354 --> 00:40:19,307
I guess I would be working on a boat somewhere.

532
00:40:19,307 --> 00:40:21,649
I would spend my days catching fish.

533
00:40:22,752 --> 00:40:25,382
My life would be very boring.

534
00:40:27,262 --> 00:40:29,802
I think it's a good thing that I met you.

535
00:40:32,413 --> 00:40:34,449
But I imagine your life differently.

536
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:41,048
I think your life would be a lot happier.

537
00:40:41,048 --> 00:40:45,248
You might be taking an exam to get into a university.

538
00:40:45,248 --> 00:40:47,449
You might be an athlete.

539
00:40:48,649 --> 00:40:53,342
You might meet a woman and fall in love with her.

540
00:40:53,342 --> 00:40:55,448
You might be dating her.

541
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:59,115
You might take her to a beach.

542
00:41:00,165 --> 00:41:02,507
You might confess your love to her.

543
00:41:02,507 --> 00:41:04,582
As the years go by,

544
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:08,184
you might start a family.

545
00:41:08,184 --> 00:41:09,882
You might have a kid.

546
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,882
Who knows?

547
00:41:13,882 --> 00:41:16,748
You might open a resort like your mom.

548
00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:20,448
But one thing I know for sure.

549
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,248
No matter what happens,

550
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,657
you will do your best to take care of your family.

551
00:41:28,336 --> 00:41:30,650
They will love you very much.

552
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:36,707
But everything just you said,

553
00:41:37,336 --> 00:41:39,739
I can do that with you.

554
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:05,052
Palm.

555
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:11,849
In my life,

556
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:15,419
I have only a few people that are important to me.

557
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:18,983
My dad.

558
00:42:19,634 --> 00:42:21,134
My mom.

559
00:42:21,921 --> 00:42:23,682
And you.

560
00:42:26,663 --> 00:42:28,750
If I could choose,

561
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,147
I wouldn't want to lose any of you.

562
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:40,482
I love you, Palm.

563
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,885
I love you.

564
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,748
Can you get me sleeping pills?

565
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:20,880
To Palm.

566
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,878
This letter is an order for you.

567
00:44:22,878 --> 00:44:26,382
I'll order you as your boss, and you need to follow my order.

568
00:44:27,088 --> 00:44:32,244
Thank you for everything that you've done for me and my family.

569
00:44:32,244 --> 00:44:37,348
Whatever help my family ever gave to your family,

570
00:44:37,348 --> 00:44:44,651
I think what your family has done for my family is enough to pay back everything.

571
00:44:44,651 --> 00:44:48,461
This is the problem that I will face for the rest of my life.

572
00:44:48,461 --> 00:44:51,677
You and your dad can't fix it.

573
00:44:51,677 --> 00:44:55,184
This is the problem that my mom and I need to fix ourselves.

574
00:44:55,184 --> 00:44:58,282
I hope you will respect my decision.

575
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:12,150
I hope that you will start a new life with someone who can truly love you.

576
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:17,008
One day when everything is over,

577
00:45:17,008 --> 00:45:19,296
and if I am still alive,

578
00:45:19,296 --> 00:45:21,795
I'll be waiting to meet the person that you love.

579
00:45:21,795 --> 00:45:25,965
I wish for you to have a happy life and a good family.

580
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:29,764
Don't worry about our story.

581
00:45:29,764 --> 00:45:31,880
I'll keep it a secret.

582
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,748
You won't have any problem because of it.

583
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:39,921
From me, a rich boy who doesn't have many friends.

584
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,490
[Next Week]

585
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:21,091
Nueng, how are you?

586
00:46:21,091 --> 00:46:23,415
I'm still alive. Are you glad to see me?

587
00:46:23,415 --> 00:46:25,575
I thought you would feel disappointed.

588
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:28,548
From now on, you don't need to come to work at the hotel.

589
00:46:28,548 --> 00:46:30,809
I'll take care of everything until my mom wakes up.

590
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:32,780
I know that you were framed.

591
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,802
What about Palm? Where is he? Why isn't he taking care of you?

592
00:46:35,802 --> 00:46:40,705
I told him to go into hiding. The police are searching for him.

593
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:45,020
Palm.

594
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:52,690
♫ My one life, how valuable is it? ♫
