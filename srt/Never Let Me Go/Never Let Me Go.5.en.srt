00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,800
He knows that he's allergic to alcohol.

167
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,590
But he still drank so much.

168
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,380
What about you? How are you?

169
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,540
I only got my arm broken. It will be healed soon.

170
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,410
I'm not talking about your arm.

171
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,530
I'm talking about your heart. How is it?

172
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,570
He completely embarrassed you.

173
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,270
It's okay.

174
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,214
I feel sorry for Nuengdiao.

175
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,580
He must be too embarrassed to come back here again.

176
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,860
Why are you protecting Nuengdiao?

177
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,073
He was the one who started the fight.

178
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:28,400
But it was also my fault.

179
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,540
I should have stopped him from drinking alcohol.

180
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,550
How can you take care of him all the time?

181
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,890
He was the one who made the choice.

182
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,603
Even if he is your boss,

183
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:45,662
he doesn't own your life, Palm.

184
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,400
Can I write on it?

185
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,627
Who wrote this?

186
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,400
Khun Nueng.

187
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,460
[You should love yourself more, Bigfoot.]

188
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,094
I'll put it back on.

189
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,280
In the next few weeks, I have to travel to the south.

190
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,770
I will go help my friend and work as a tour guide.

191
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,696
So we won't get to meet for a while.

192
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:48,420
Really?

193
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,280
It sounds fun.

194
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,940
You get to travel while working.

195
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,680
It will be fun.

196
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,260
But it will be exhausting too.

197
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,170
But at least, I get to do what I love.

198
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,540
That's true.

199
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:11,312
You should find something that you love, focus on it.

200
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,261
You should live for yourself.

201
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:18,141
Don't only live for others.

202
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,850
Do you get it?

203
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,510
Palm, do you want to have a meal with me?

204
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,920
I cooked a lot of food.

205
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,260
It's okay, Aunt Nid. I already ate when I was out.

206
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,510
How is your arm? When will the cast be removed?

207
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,950
It's getting better. The doctor just put the cast on it for the meantime.

208
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,870
It only feels itchy sometimes.

209
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,110
Do you want to borrow my back scratcher?

210
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,880
It works very well.

211
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,380
It's okay. The cast will be removed soon.

212
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,170
Palm, wait.

213
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,906
Khun Nueng was looking for you. He told me to give this to you.

214
00:15:58,906 --> 00:16:00,500
What is it?

215
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,750
I'm not sure. I'll go get it for you.

216
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,760
Here.

217
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,550
Thank you.

218
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,610
Are you buying new shoes?

219
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:27,680
Yes, but they are too expensive. So I'm going to buy second-hand ones.

220
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,610
I'm giving you back the shoes.

221
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,710
I can't take them.

222
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,020
Why?

223
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,830
I bought them for you.

224
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,880
Don't you want them?

225
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,190
Just think of them as a reward for saving me from those thugs.

226
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,951
I want them.

227
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,790
But I'll save money and buy them myself.

228
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:08,393
Protecting you is my job anyway.

229
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:10,760
I need to keep the promise that I made to Khun Thanya.

230
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,600
You don't need to give me any reward, Young Master.

231
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,530
Why are you calling me "Young Master"?

232
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,620
Because I'm your servant.

233
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,000
You said that I should know my place.

234
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,603
I was drunk at the time. So you shouldn't take it to heart.

235
00:17:30,603 --> 00:17:32,850
I didn't take it to heart.

236
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,070
But I think what you said was right.

237
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,890
I should know what my job is.

238
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,750
If I wasn't busy with my own stuff,

239
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,470
I would have been able to take care of you when you were drunk.

240
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,800
Are you being sarcastic?

241
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,850
No, I'm not. I'm just saying the truth.

242
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,920
I know who I am to you.

243
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,933
I'm just a servant.

244
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:56,000
So I need to know my place.

245

Do you have anything else you want me to do?

248
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,700
No.

249
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,913

How long do I have to wait?

255
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,370
The longer we wait, the more damaged my family's reputation will be.

256
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:34,460
Moreover, I'm worried that my son's record will be affected.

257
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,020
Then how will he get into a good university?

Hello.

Are you Nuengdiao, a son of Phiphop who was the school's sponsor?

Yes.

After your father died, you become like this?

263
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,260
I guess you spend too much time with your mother.

264

That's why you become like this.

265
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,050
Will your mother be here, too? So we can talk things over at the same time.

What does my mother have to do with this?

How did you let it happen?

272
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,180
I saw it.

273

Did you find the person who is spreading the photo?

I'll take care of that. You worry about this.

How could this happen in school?

277

It's real.

How could you boldly admit it? Don't you feel ashamed?

282
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,923
Why do I need to feel ashamed? I didn't do anything wrong.

283
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:58,200
It's normal for two people to kiss.

284

Instead of criticizing me, you should find the person who did this.

Principal, I think my son would have never done this unless someone else started it.

Ben is a straight man. You know that.

Moreover, he is the class president.

288

My son would never do such an embarrassing thing.

Say it.

292
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,760
I know that you don't have this kind of preference.

293
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,020
- Yes, Dad.
- See!

294
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,500
I know my son doesn't have that kind of inclination.

295
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:02,079
From now on, you must stop hanging out or talking to him.

296
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,624
I need to talk to your mother about this.

297
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:09,799
She needs to know what you did.

298
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:14,090
Ben's father, we will find a way to solve this problem.

299
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:19,080
We will say that it was a prank or that the photo was edited or something like that.

300

Don't worry. Ben's record will not be affected.

Nuengdiao kissed Ben.

302
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:35,780
They kissed in school.

303
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,130
- I think it's...
- What is going on?

304

Nuengdiao kissed Ben, the class president.

I'm sorry.

Aun, did you see Nueng?

313
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,870
I saw him walking out of the principal's office.

314
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,160
I think he walked to the sports court or the back of the school.

315
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,860
Thanks a lot.

316
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,820
Palm, why do you have to worry about him?

317
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,960
You shouldn't get involved in the rich kids' business.

318
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,020
You know that he is on a different level from you.

319
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,890
Are you being nice to him because you want something from him?

320
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,620
I just found out what happened.

321
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,367
How are you feeling?

322
00:24:13,656 --> 00:24:15,576
I was a jerk.

323
00:24:18,717 --> 00:24:20,687
Don't blame yourself for it.

324
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,100
After this incident, what will happen between you two?

325
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,430
I don't know.

326
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,999
He probably never wants to talk to me again.

327
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,924
Just give him some time. You can explain it to him later.

328
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,543
I think he feels hurt, too.

329
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,290
I need to find the person who spread the photo.

330
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,574
If I find out who did it,

331
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,373
I'll make him pay for it.

332
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,170
If there's anything I can help with, just let me know.

333
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,370
Thanks.

334
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,240
What are you doing here? Are you here to look down on me?

335
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,740
No. I'm just worried about you.

336
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,860
That's bullshit. You didn't want to be my friend from the beginning.

337
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,420
I can be your friend.

338
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,370
I'll be anything that you want me to be.

339
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:10,570
Don't try to be nice to me if you think it's a part of your job, asshole.

340
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,400
If you didn't receive an order, you wouldn't have wanted to befriend me!

341
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,090
You've never worried or cared about me.

342
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,730
Why is everyone doing this to me?

343
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,200
What did I do wrong?

344
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,940
Huh? Tell me!

345
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,310
No one wants me!

346
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,240
Huh?

347
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,450
Go away! Go home, Palm!

348
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,080
Palm, go away!

349
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,930
Palm, let me go and go away!

350
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,280
Palm!

351
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,380
Tell me! Why did this happen to me?

352
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,980
I opened up to him. Why did I get this in return?

353
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,240
This is what I get from opening up to someone?

354
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,060
Asshole!

355
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,130
Let me go. Leave me alone!

356
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,779
Is your arm fully healed?

357
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,550
Yes.

358
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,180
Are you still mad at me?

359
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,120
Why would I be mad at you?

360
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:04,450
I told everyone that you are my servant.

361
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,628
I'm not mad at you.

362
00:28:07,628 --> 00:28:10,390
You have the right to say that.

363
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,940
I'm sorry.

364
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,590
Your apology means a lot more than the expensive shoes you bought me.

365
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,350
Did you know what happened?

366
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,710
Yes.

367
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,910
Do you know what Ben told his father?

368
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:59,795
He said I was the one who initiated the kiss.

369
00:28:59,795 --> 00:29:02,577
But in fact, he was the one who made a move on me.

370
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,520
I didn't know that.

371
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,870
I shouldn't have opened up my heart to him so easily.

372
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,630
Look.

373
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,560
This is the result I get from opening up to him.

374
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:24,670
That's why people are looking for chances to take advantage of me, and hurt me.

375
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,303
I was stupid. I don't know how to read people.

376
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,510
That's not true.

377
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,760
It's because you are kind.

378
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,030
So you always think positive of others.

379
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,490
You knew that Phum doesn't like you.

380
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,060
But you chose to give him a chance.

381
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,140
Then he betrayed you.

382
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,980
About Ben.

383
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,660
It's because you love him.

384
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,640
How do you know that I love him?

385
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,431
Have I ever said that?

386
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:10,727
Stop thinking that you know how I feel.

387
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,790
I don't love him.

388
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,100
I completely opened up my heart to him.

389
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,350
That's why

390
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,610
it hurts so much.

391
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,770
I want to forget that I kissed an asshole like him.

392
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,680
But I still remember the touch of his kiss.

393
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,580
Khun Nueng, stop it.

394
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,099
Do you know

395
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,300
that when my first kiss turned into an awful memory,

396
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,340
how terrible I'm feeling?

397
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,170
So...

398
00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:23,529
start all over again.

399
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:30,630
Erase his kiss completely.

400
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,050
Let me...

401
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,580
be the first kiss in your new memory.

402
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,440
Okay.

403
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,905
What did your father say?

404
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:20,490
He said... Khun Thanya is waiting for you at home.

405
00:33:35,885 --> 00:33:38,216
Do you think my mom will be okay?

406
00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:40,950
When she finds out that I kissed a guy.

407
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,470
She will be okay.

408
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,240
Like I said,

409
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,290
Khun Thanya loves you for who you are.

410
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,283
Love cannot solve everything.

411
00:33:52,283 --> 00:33:54,870
If my mom is not okay with it,

412
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,635
I don't know what I will do.

413
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,079
Have you ever heard this?

414
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,946
There are only monks who are better than me.

415
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,031
What the hell is that? Is that a joke?

416
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:18,230
I have another one.

417
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:23,650
A hug from a man who is covered with dust is not as warm as a hug from a rich man.

418
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,709
What's wrong with you?

419
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:27,092
So cheesy.

420
00:34:27,092 --> 00:34:29,212
Come on. Let's go home.

421
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,993
Palm, go to our room.

422
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:17,070
- Mom, I...
- Have you had dinner?

423
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,090
I prepared dinner for you.

424
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,010
Let's go and have dinner together.

425
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,112
- I...
- Have dinner with me.

426
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,710
Why are you only eating vegetables?

427
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,705
I like them.

428
00:35:44,705 --> 00:35:46,820
Aunt Nid cooked it deliciously.

429
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,950
I remember.

430
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,920
When you were young, your dad and I always told you to eat vegetables.

431
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,090
So you would be healthy.

432
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:01,950
So you chose to eat only vegetables to please us.

433
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:05,650
But I knew that you didn't like vegetables at all.

434
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,580
You knew that?

435
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,780
Yes, I knew.

436
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,030
I'm your mom.

437
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,390
I've always been watching you.

438
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:21,400
When you are with me, you will choose to eat only vegetables.

439
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,139
Because you want to please me.

440
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:31,810
Aren't you mad that I lied to you that I like vegetables?

441
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,030
No.

442
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,910
I understand.

443
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:41,920
But I don't want you to force yourself just because you want to please me.

444
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,630
You are an adult now. You can eat whatever you want.

445
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,110
You don't need to care about what I think.

446
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,320
Do you know what happened at school?

447
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,860
Yes.

448
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,540
If you are not ready to talk about it, we don't need to talk about it now.

449
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,390
I can wait.

450
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,740
I am afraid that I'm disappointing you.

451
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,210
I am disappointed.

452
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,120
I'm disappointed in myself.

453
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:25,820
I'm disappointed that I can't be a mom that you can trust and come to talk about it.

454
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,420
I was so busy with work that I forgot to take care of you.

455
00:37:40,316 --> 00:37:41,930
Mom.

456
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,420
Are you okay?

457
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,225
With the fact that I like men.

458
00:37:50,557 --> 00:37:56,940
Nueng, you can like whatever or whoever you want.

459
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,430
This is your life.

460
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:06,600
What I expect is to see you have a happy life,

461
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,540
and live the life that you choose.

462
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:15,860
What if the life that I choose is not what you expect?

463
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,660
It's okay.

464
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,900
Don't force yourself.

465
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,817
What is more important than our family's reputation,

466
00:38:29,817 --> 00:38:33,560
honor, and business,

467
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,360
is your happiness.

468
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,310
Whatever you want to do,

469
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,240
whoever you want to be,

470
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,490
you can choose as you want.

471
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,200
I will support you.

472
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,780
I will take care of you.

473
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,085
Nueng, remember this.

474
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:56,830
You are the pride of the Kitttrakulmethee.

475
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,110
Why are you smiling?

476
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,930
Are you dating someone?

477
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,990
No, Dad. It's nothing.

478
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,470
Good.

479
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:29,070
You shouldn't date anyone now.

480
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:32,310
Because you won't have time for that.

481
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,713
You need to take care of Khun Nueng. Do you hear me?

482
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,590
Yes, Dad.

483
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,270
Where did you find him yesterday?

484
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,760
Near the school.

485
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,710
There is a shop that he likes to visit. So I went to look for him there.

486
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:51,070
Good. You should learn about what he likes.

487
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,926
So he will like you.

488
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,910
Nueng, if you feel uncomfortable,

489
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:02,600
you don't need to go to school today.

490
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,060
I will take care of everything.

491
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,060
I won't let those who hurt you get away with it.

492
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,120
You don't have to do that. I can handle it.

493
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,843
I didn't do anything wrong. I won't run away from the problem.

494
00:40:16,628 --> 00:40:20,300
If I run away, those who hurt me will feel encouraged.

495
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,500
I'll make them see that this can't hurt me.

496
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:31,760
My son, you are all grown up now.

497
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,210
I have nothing to worry about.

498
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,420
Nueng.

499
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,890
Remember this.

500
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,720
You don't need to be afraid of anyone.

501
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,540
Other people should be afraid of you.

502
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,843
I'm leaving for school now, Mom.

503
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,770
Mom!

504
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,690
Nueng!

505
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,330
- Mom!
- Get down!

506
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,320
- Mom!
- Khun Thanya!

507
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,300
Mom! Mom!

508
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,010
- Stay down.
- Palm! Open the glove box. Now!
- Mom!

509
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,010
Nueng, stay down!

510
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:40,830
- Dad!
- Palm, what about my mom?

511
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,510
Take Nueng and run away! Do what I tell you!

512
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,810
Don't worry about me. I'll take care of everything here.

513
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,803
- Go!
- I'm not going! I'll stay with my mom!

514
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:55,058
I won't leave my mom!

515
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:00,480
Mom! Mom!

516
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,479
Khun Thanya.

517
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:04,108
Mom!

518
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:05,779
Palm!

519
00:42:05,779 --> 00:42:07,299
Mom!

520
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:16,230
Palm. Palm.

521
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,340
Take me back.

522
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:21,090
I can't. It's not safe for you to go back.

523
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:25,093
My mom was shot. Aren't you worried about your dad?

524
00:42:25,093 --> 00:42:28,240
Yes, I am. But I believe that he can find a way out.

525
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,305
Where are you taking me?

526
00:42:29,305 --> 00:42:31,550
I'm taking you somewhere safe.

527
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,873
Don't worry. My dad prepared everything.

528
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,480
Palm.

529
00:43:37,304 --> 00:43:39,060
Please take me home.

530
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,760
I'm begging you.

531
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,480
Khun Nueng, you need to calm down.

532
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,280
I told you that we can't go back right now.

533
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,580
My dad told me to take you and run away.

534
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,890
Because he knew that something like this would happen one day.

535
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:02,245
Khun Thanya told me if something happened to her,

536
00:44:02,245 --> 00:44:05,325
I needed to do my best to take care of you.

537
00:44:05,325 --> 00:44:08,488
Why is everyone making decisions for me?

538
00:44:08,488 --> 00:44:11,550
I'm supposed to be there for my mom.

539
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:14,090
I shouldn't have run away alone.

540
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,500
I'm begging you. Please take me home.

541
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,980
Khun Nueng.

542
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,300
If we go back now, they will find a chance to attack you again.

543
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,781
We need to run away and come up with a plan.

544
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:38,110
Right now, I am the one you should believe in and trust the most.

545
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:40,369
You need to listen to me.

546
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,620
I promise that I will never leave you.

547
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,190
[Next Week]
We are going to see your mom.

548
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,860
Are you sure that he will help us?

549
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,880
You told me that she left you when you were young?

550
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,002
- Hello.
- Which one of you is Palm?

551
00:45:22,002 --> 00:45:23,603
I haven't seen you for a long time, so I don't remember.

552
00:45:23,603 --> 00:45:24,820
That's me.

553
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:28,140
Did your dad assign you to be a bodyguard for his boss's son?

554
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,150
How the hell could he do that?

555
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:32,290
It's safe here.

556
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:34,044
You don't need to worry.

557
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,950
Why did you kiss me?

558
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:42,440
Seeing you relaxed, it means that I did my job well.

559
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:47,650
