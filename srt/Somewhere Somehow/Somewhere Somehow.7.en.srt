Why did you do it?

00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,480
I’m sorry, Kie.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,680
I’m so sorry.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,040
Hasn’t anyone told you…

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,160
that ‘sorry’ is not an answer?

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,760
And you just believe it without asking her anything?

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,600
But she’s already engaged.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,600
So, it’s over, isn’t it?

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,480
I want to make a wedding presentation for my older sister.

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,080
Can you teach me how to do it?

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,000
Let’s call it a day.

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,720
It’s for you.

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,760
Think of it as a thank-you gift for teaching me today.

15
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,400
Pheem, come, let’s go home.

16
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,640
- Happy birthday to you…
- Thank you for the gift.

17
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,400
A friend: So shocked!

18
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,080
I’m more shocked.

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,200
That’s Explosive Pheem. It’s game over, Pai.

20
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,160
You have to help me.

21
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,000
- Okay.
- Go, go!

22
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,080

23
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,560
Please calm down first.

Let’s talk nicely, Pheem.

25
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,960
We need to talk right now.

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,480
I’ll wait for you at the car park.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,480

31

I don’t know.

32
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,160
But I swear it wasn’t me, Kie.

33
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,960
I didn’t tell her we’re here.

34
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,880
Pock: I’m serious!

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,080

00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
I don’t know!

37
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,560
I did.

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,240
Ga!

39
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,680
Well, she asked me where I was.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,640
I also wanted you and Pheem to make up.

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,440
So, I just told her.

42
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,720
But I didn’t think she’d come in at that specific moment.

43
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,200
What a fucking surprise.

44
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,120

You’ve gone home for quite long this time, Kie.

194
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,583
I thought you’d never come back to our dorm.

195
00:16:02,983 --> 00:16:05,783
I’m only here to get my books. I’ll go sleep at home.

196
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:09,063
Oh, okay then. But before you leave,

197
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:10,863
don’t forget to check your letterbox.

198
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:14,063
You’ve got lots of mails there.

199
00:16:14,503 --> 00:16:16,703
Okay, thank you.

200
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:17,863
Sure.

00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:17,463
[Pheem: But my life has never been easy at all.]

204
00:17:18,423 --> 00:17:20,983
[Pheem: I’m not raised up like other kids.]

205
00:17:22,063 --> 00:17:27,103
[Pheem: Everything I own, I had to earn it by sacrificing something in return.]

206
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:31,503
[Pheem: Without any exception.]

207
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:36,743
[Pheem: I know what I did was wrong.]

208
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:39,303
[Pheem: But that was because I wanted to be close you.]

209
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:44,223
[Pheem: It’s not because I’m afraid that distance and time might change someone’s heart.]

210
00:17:45,503 --> 00:17:48,103
[Pheem: But rather because you’re my only happiness in life.]

211
00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:01,263
[Pheem: Could you please forgive me?]

212
00:18:02,183 --> 00:18:03,623
[Pheem: I love you, Kie.]

213
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:09,423
[Pheem: I love you so much. Can you please stop acting like we’re strangers?]

214
00:18:10,863 --> 00:18:16,103
[Pheem: I’m only begging you to give me one more chance. Just once.]

215
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:30,703
[Pheem: If you feel bad for Mooyong, please forgive me and let’s make up.]

216
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,943
[Pheem: Let’s not make Mooyong an orphan.]

217
00:18:33,943 --> 00:18:36,583
[Pheem: Just because his dad and mum are having a quarrel.]

218
00:18:36,863 --> 00:18:39,103
[Pheem: I miss you so much.]

219
00:18:40,623 --> 00:18:41,903
[Pheem: I’m sorry.]

220
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:46,863
[Pheem: I’m so sorry I hurt you.]

221
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:57,663
I’m sorry, Pheem. But I have to keep my promise.

222
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,343
Hello, Mr. President.

223
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:28,303
Poj: I never know you’re Miss Kimheng’s granddaughter.

224
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:31,543
Why do you want to see me?

225
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:35,103
I’d like to ask you something.

226
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,383
Now that Pheem is engaged,

227
00:19:39,183 --> 00:19:41,703
how do you plan her future for her?

228
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:46,503
Since she’s not going to study in England as I’d first planned for her,

229
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:49,223
she has to get married right after she graduates.

230
00:19:50,463 --> 00:19:54,983
Then, Pheem and Poon will take over this company from me.

231
00:19:56,343 --> 00:19:58,023
Why do they have to get married then?

232
00:20:00,223 --> 00:20:04,343
It’s because if Pheem insists on studying here,

233
00:20:04,343 --> 00:20:08,503
her profile won’t be qualified enough to take the position of the company president.

234
00:20:08,503 --> 00:20:13,103
She needs an assistance. And that someone should be her husband.

235
00:20:13,943 --> 00:20:15,783
Poon has an exceptional profile.

236
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:17,103
He’s perfect for her.

237
00:20:17,703 --> 00:20:20,783
What if I ask you to take off your mask as a president,

238
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:24,103
and answer my question as her father?

239
00:20:24,663 --> 00:20:29,263
Why do you have to shape her life into something she doesn’t want to be?

240
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,343
Because I’m worried about her.

241
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:36,423
Becoming a company president…

242
00:20:36,423 --> 00:20:38,783
without having any basic knowledge or skills…

243
00:20:39,663 --> 00:20:42,103
would only bring her many more troubles.

244
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,903
Is there any other way than forcing her to get married?

245
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:50,423
A way that could change your mind.

246
00:20:52,263 --> 00:20:53,063
Yes.

247
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:55,103
What is it?

248
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:58,743
If she agrees to go study in England,

249
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,223
she might be able to learn a lot of things.

250
00:21:02,703 --> 00:21:04,463
She’d become stronger and more matured.

251
00:21:04,783 --> 00:21:06,903
But do you know why she refuses to go?

252
00:21:07,503 --> 00:21:08,663
It’s because of you.

253
00:21:12,143 --> 00:21:15,143
Since you’re the only reason she refuses to go to England…

254
00:21:15,743 --> 00:21:19,383
and also the only reason she’ll agree to go.

255
00:21:21,343 --> 00:21:22,983
What are you trying to say?

256
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,343
Let’s make a bet.

257
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,823
If you can make Pheem go to study in England,

258
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,863
I’ll do one thing as you request.

259
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,823
Anything?

260
00:21:36,823 --> 00:21:38,903
Yes, anything.

261
00:21:40,143 --> 00:21:45,823
But remember, you must not tell Pheem about this.

262
00:21:46,863 --> 00:21:54,063
If I can’t tell her, then how would she know?

263
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:58,743
Since the only reason Pheem wants to study here is because she loves you,

264
00:22:00,343 --> 00:22:02,983
you have to do anything to make her hate you.

265
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,863
Yes! I’m seeing her.

266
00:22:06,983 --> 00:22:08,103
Are you happy now?

267
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:11,423
What we had…

268
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:14,263
was over since you got engaged to Poon.

269
00:22:15,663 --> 00:22:16,943
You and I…

270
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:20,423
can never go back to what we used to be, Pheem.

271
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:23,303
Hey, are you sure you’ll leave it like this?

272
00:22:24,663 --> 00:22:27,383
It’s the only way I can do for her own good.

273
00:22:29,063 --> 00:22:35,223
Also, you must not get in touch with her while she’s still in England.

274
00:22:35,623 --> 00:22:37,783
Otherwise, she’d go soft and run back home.

275
00:22:38,783 --> 00:22:39,583
So?

276
00:22:41,263 --> 00:22:47,943
I’ll do it, if you’ll keep your promise.

277
00:22:48,943 --> 00:22:49,583
Good.

278
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,183
What do you want then?

279
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,423
Don’t force her to do anything again.

280
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:04,183
Please let this be the last time you make her do anything against her will.

281
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:12,463
I’ll keep my promise.

282
00:23:14,543 --> 00:23:16,503
And I’ll be waiting for you, Pheem.

283
00:23:27,543 --> 00:23:28,623
Uncle.

284
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:30,983
Does Pheem really have to go to England?

285
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:32,383
Yes.

286
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:38,263
Pheem, aren’t we already engaged?

287
00:23:38,743 --> 00:23:40,503
Why do you have to go to England now?

288
00:23:42,703 --> 00:23:43,663
Why do you think so?

289
00:23:44,663 --> 00:23:48,063
No, Pheem. Can you not go?

290
00:23:48,063 --> 00:23:50,423
I’ll miss you so badly if you go.

291
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:54,183
That's your problem, not mine.

292
00:23:55,943 --> 00:23:58,663
Uncle, will there still be a wedding between me and Pheem?

293
00:24:01,783 --> 00:24:04,743
Well, we’re fiancé anyway.

294
00:24:05,783 --> 00:24:07,023
Let’s talk about it when I come back.

295
00:24:10,943 --> 00:24:14,623
All right, if that’s what you said so.

296
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,583
I’ll wait for you until you come back then.

297
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:38,463
I already asked my friend in England to take care of your university documents.

298
00:24:38,943 --> 00:24:41,183
The accommodation is also taken care of.

299
00:24:41,823 --> 00:24:44,183
Once you arrive there, if you still need anything…

300
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,303
we can go buy it together.

301
00:24:46,463 --> 00:24:47,903
Whatever you say.

302
00:24:48,423 --> 00:24:50,623
Thank you for taking care of everything for me.

303
00:24:50,783 --> 00:24:58,383
About Poon, why did you agree to keep the engagement going?

304
00:24:58,903 --> 00:25:01,223
Since you’re going away,

305
00:25:02,023 --> 00:25:06,463
if it were me, I would’ve used this opportunity to call off the engagement.

306
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,823
So that you can start anew there without any worries.

307
00:25:09,463 --> 00:25:13,023
No, I’m going to keep being engaged to him like this.

308
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,743
What for? You don’t love him, do you?

309
00:25:19,543 --> 00:25:24,583
He toyed with my feelings and made me break up with Kie.

310
00:25:25,703 --> 00:25:27,743
I’m going to toy with his feelings too.

311
00:25:28,623 --> 00:25:29,903
I’m not going to break off this engagement.

312
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,943
I’ll keep him dreaming for a pie in the sky.

313
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:36,103
That I’ll love him and get married to him one day.

314
00:25:37,743 --> 00:25:41,623
I’m going to hurt him, just like how he has hurt me.

315
00:25:53,703 --> 00:25:56,983
[Next Break]
Have you heard Pheem already resigned from our university?

What?

335
00:27:10,234 --> 00:27:11,394
I just heard about it.

336
00:27:11,394 --> 00:27:14,794

She’ll fly to England next week.

338

Things are going as planned, aren’t they?

339
00:27:30,674 --> 00:27:35,394
What? Tell me honestly,

340
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:37,514
are you really okay if it turns out like this?

341
00:27:37,514 --> 00:27:39,994
Are you going to let her hate you like this?

342
00:27:41,154 --> 00:27:45,714
Yes. What her dad wants her to do…

343
00:27:46,154 --> 00:27:47,594
is actually for her own good.

344
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:50,074
And one more thing,

345
00:27:50,234 --> 00:27:52,674
I don’t want her to do anything against her will anymore.

346
00:27:52,794 --> 00:27:56,034
I’m sure her dad will keep his promise.

347
00:27:57,674 --> 00:28:00,074
Listen, if it were me,

348
00:28:00,594 --> 00:28:02,634
I wouldn’t give a damn about the marriage…

349
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:04,514
and just get back together with Pheem.

350
00:28:04,514 --> 00:28:06,994
I’d rather be happy with what’s right in front of me.

00:44:10,456 --> 00:44:12,536
What’s our plan for today?

519
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:17,816
The VP is scheduled to monitor work at the company for 2 days.

520
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:23,616
After that, we’ll move to another city next week and stay there for 3 months.

521
00:44:23,856 --> 00:44:25,336
That’s where our factory is.

522
00:44:25,376 --> 00:44:28,496
Will you also be there during the entire 3 months, Yatsu-san?

523
00:44:28,496 --> 00:44:30,736
Oh, I’m afraid no.

524
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:34,096
But the VP has to…

525
00:44:34,096 --> 00:44:37,056
work with our production engineering manager there.

526
00:44:37,336 --> 00:44:41,416
Mr. Poj has assigned her to work with you.

527
00:44:41,936 --> 00:44:45,496
So, I have to learn my job from an engineer?

528
00:44:45,576 --> 00:44:48,016
Yes, but this one is really talented.

529
00:44:48,296 --> 00:44:51,136
Yatsu-san: She’s in charge for this project.

530
00:44:51,576 --> 00:44:55,336
You’ll definitely learn a lot of things from her.

531
00:44:55,616 --> 00:44:59,416
Wow, she must be someone my dad really trusts.

532
00:44:59,416 --> 00:45:00,976
Yes, she’s like his shogun.

533
00:45:04,016 --> 00:45:04,896
Okay.

534
00:45:04,896 --> 00:45:07,256
You’ll see her when we go to the office.

535
00:45:07,256 --> 00:45:10,976
I’ll drop you off at the hotel first.

536
00:45:11,496 --> 00:45:13,296
Then we can go to the office later on.

537
00:45:13,296 --> 00:45:15,816
We can go straight to the office. I’m not tired.

538
00:45:15,816 --> 00:45:20,376
But please stop by at the drug store for me, I just need to buy eye drops and some personal stuff first.

539
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:22,656
The drug store is close to the office.

540
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:25,056
So is your hotel.

Yes.

555
00:47:22,376 --> 00:47:26,256
This branch is where we use for trading products from Japan to Thailand.

556
00:47:26,576 --> 00:47:29,336
Our company has one particular product which is a bestseller here.

557
00:47:29,896 --> 00:47:32,896
That’s why we decided to take over the manufacturing factory in Japan…

558
00:47:33,456 --> 00:47:36,416
five years ago in order to reduce the cost of importing products.

559
00:47:36,696 --> 00:47:39,056
This product is still a bestseller right now.

560
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:42,376
So, we are planning to manufacture a similar product line in Thailand.

561
00:47:42,376 --> 00:47:44,016
This would help reduce the shipping cost too.

562
00:47:44,536 --> 00:47:47,056
Wow, sounds very interesting indeed.

Being able to work here is one of my first priorities in life.

Why do you want to work for our company?

591
00:50:29,336 --> 00:50:33,576
