Pheem!

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,720
Pheem: Is this why you don’t want me to come into your room?

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,560
If you agree to be my girlfriend, please keep this gear necklace.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,960
If you dare take it back, I’ll kill you!

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,360
I’m Tar.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,760
If you have any problem, you can come and ask me anytime.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,120
Thank you, Tar.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,760
Pheem: Do you read this kind of book too?

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,120
Kie: My senior buddy gave it to me.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,560
Did she give you this one too?

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,920
Yes.

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,840
You can’t just sit here sipping on a soda drink.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,640
Don’t you ever compliment any girl that her lips are kissable again.

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,040
Understand? Or else I’ll punish you.

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,440
Not there, Pheem!

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,800
Kie!!

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,440
Yes?

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,280
Hi.

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,560
Am I wearing…

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,680
My pyjamas. I helped you changed into them last night.

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,720
Your PJ…

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,880
Pheem, don’t…

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,600
Pheem!

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,040
Are you done?

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,000
Mhm.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,280
I’ll get you some clothes. Your top is probably all dirty with your puke.

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,800
It’s hot.

28
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,840
- Not here, Pheem. You can’t!
- But it’s hot.

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,240
-Pheem!
-Kie

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,320
-   My jeans too.
- No, no. Don’t do it.

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,360
But I don’t feel comfy. It’s not comfy.

32
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,080
I’m going to take them off.

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,080
Pheem!

34
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,520
They’re not comfy.

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,840
What? Does this mean you already saw me naked?

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,240
I don’t see any problem with it since…

37
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,520
I’m going to be responsible for everything.

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,160
Kie.

39
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,760
Why are there dark circles under your eyes?

40
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,160
I hardly slept.

41
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,240
You didn’t give me a break last night.

42
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,040
I hardly get any sleep at all.

43
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,040
All night?

44
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
Did I bother you that much?

45
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,960
How come I couldn’t remember anything? That’s too bad.

46
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,680
Did I really try to make you do that to me all night?

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,880
Stop. Not like that.

48
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,080
Huh? What then?

49
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,080
Ouch, Pheem!

50
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,600
Oh, I’m so sorry!

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,760
I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean it.

52
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,320
But you don’t have the right to complain though.

53
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,000
Who do you think made me end up like this?

54
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,200
Whatever. I’m still mad at you.

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,600
And sulking too.

56
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,680
Please don’t be mad at me. You already punished me last night.

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,200
How?

58
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,200
Well, you beat me up like a punching bag.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,920
Ouch, my back hurts.

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,800
Hey,

61
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,000
are those lips so kissable?

62
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,080
Are that girl’s lips…that kissable?

63
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,760
Really?

76
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,480
Don’t be shy, Pheem.

77
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,640
I don’t believe you. I would never do something like that.

78
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,120
No matter what,

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,640
you have to do whatever I say if you want me to forgive you.

80
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,400
You’ll forgive me if I pamper you, right?

81
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,320
I guess so.

82
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,720
So, what do you want me to do?

83
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,680
It’s almost my birthday.

Sure.

86
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,360
So that I can also make a (marriage) proposal to your father.

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,520
Or am I now in a series? That can’t be, Pock.

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,920
- Pock!
- Huh?

00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,720

00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,840
Prae.

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,320
Hello.

98
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,680
Hello.

99
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,880
This is Prae, my older cousin.

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,160
She moved to England many years ago.

101
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,920
She’s here for a vacation.

102
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,480
Welcome, everyone.

103
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,040
I’ve prepared a lot of food for your BBQ party today.

104
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,880
You can take your friends to the garden.

105
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,080
The maid should have the grill ready by now.

106
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,080
I’ll get the ingredients from the kitchen and will follow you there.

107
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,240
Okay.

108
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,480
Let me help you then.

109
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,640
Okay.

110
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,640
As for me, Pock, I’ll help take the rest,

111
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,880
including Namfon and Ga, to eat something and wait for you in the garden.

112
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,520
Okay.

113
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,120
Follow me then.

114
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,440
Yes.

115
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,480
Here you go, these are all the ingredients.

116
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,680
Yes.

117
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,360
I didn’t introduce myself earlier. I’m…

118
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,240
Kie, right?

119
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,960
Oh, you know my name?

120
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,480
Of course, we finally met. You look quite cool in person.

121
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,800
Why wouldn’t I know you?

122
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,240
I’ve seen your face for 4-5 years now.

123
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,520
Since when you were still in junior high.

124
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,560
Pheem has your photos all over her room.

125
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,160
I must have had amnesia if I couldn’t remember you.

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,120
4-5 years? That’s since our junior high.

127
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,960
But how come I had never seen you before?

128
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,520
You seem to be very close to Pheem.

129
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,160
That’s right. Uncle Poj took me in ever after my parents passed away.

130
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,840
I grew up with Pheem so we’re close like blood sisters.

131
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,520
That’s why I know she really likes you.

132
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,880
She has liked you for a long time too.

133
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,480
I’m glad you’re now Pheem’s smile and happiness.

134
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,640
I feel bad for her though because Uncle Poj is so busy and hardly has time for her.

135
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,640
He’s quite dictated and often pressures her about her studies.

136
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,000
I think he wants her to take over the business after him because she’s his only child.

137
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,440
As for me, I’ll fly back to England after this winter.

138
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,560
What are you doing there?

139
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,000
I work there as a landscape architecture.

140
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,000
Wow, that’s cool.

141
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,280
- Give me a hand here.
- Yes.

142
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,280
Please take care of Pheem for me.

143
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,880
I’m rooting for you.

144
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,320
How is it?

145
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,640
Let me try.

146
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,880
Hmm, you’re quite good.

147
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,600
So much food today.

148
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,520
I was afraid it might not be enough for you and your friends.

149
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,360
Pheem.

150
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,280
Shrimp!

151
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,480
Soooo good!

152
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,840
Pock!

153
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,280
What?

154
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,200
Why did you eat it?

155
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,800
Well, I’m your wife. I thought you peeled it for me.

156
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,640
I’ll peel another one for you, Pheem.

157
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,840
Okay.

158
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,000
Aww, I’m so jealous.

159
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,640
I want someone who can peel shrimps for me too.

160
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,800
Ga, can you do it for me please?

161
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,320
Please, please, please. Peel the shrimp for me. I want to eat it.

162
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,600
Please, brother.

163
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:49,040
Look, my hands are so weak.

164
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,640
If I have to peel it myself,

165
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,680
my nails will also be ruined. So, can you please do it for me?

166
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,640
Please, please, please, please.

167
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,080
Your friend is quite silly, Pheem.

168
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,760
What?!

169
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,800
Fon!

170
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,880
Have we just met for the first time?

171
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,360
why did you say that?

172
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,800
that's harsh

173
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Kie

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,320
We all have to struggle in life, Pock.

175
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,560
Don’t you know that even these shrimps have to slough off their shells by themselves?

176
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,880
Why can’t you do it yourself then?

177
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,040
I might not be able to peel the shrimp myself,

178
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,480
but I’m able to shed some of my outer layers. Look.

179
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,760
Am I sexy?

180
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,400

Sorry.

You said it twice already. No need to apologise.

185

It’s because of your sharp tongue that you’re still single like this.

186

But don’t worry. If you end up being single,

187

I’ll sacrifice myself and be your girlfriend.

No, but I’ve looked it up on Google.

544
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,806
It said you have to make sure the cloth is damp.

545
00:39:17,806 --> 00:39:21,166
Otherwise, it might give you more fever.

546
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:22,606
There, it’s damp now.

547
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:25,806
Are you sure, Pheem?

548
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:27,766
Yes.

549
00:39:31,526 --> 00:39:32,326
There you go.

550
00:39:34,286 --> 00:39:38,366
Or…do I have to add soap? So that the patient would smell nice.

551
00:39:38,366 --> 00:39:40,966
Or maybe a dish washing soap?

552
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:44,406
Maybe I should go shower.

553
00:39:44,406 --> 00:39:46,446
It’d only take a minute. Much faster.

554
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:48,326
Kie,

555
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:51,326
sit down!

556
00:39:56,846 --> 00:39:59,166
I really want to come here and do all this for you.

557
00:39:59,406 --> 00:40:03,486
Are you going to turn down my good intention like this? That's not nice at all.

558
00:40:05,086 --> 00:40:07,246
Okay, please do it. Go on.

559
00:40:09,606 --> 00:40:10,406
Okay.

560
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:13,326
Here you go.

561
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:47,166
Where should I start?

562
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:52,366
You have to take off your shirt first.

563
00:40:55,566 --> 00:40:57,126
Do I have to do that?

564
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:58,526
Yes,

565
00:40:59,566 --> 00:41:01,686
how would I be able to wipe your body then?

566
00:41:01,686 --> 00:41:04,486
Okay. I’ll take it off.

567
00:41:10,406 --> 00:41:13,206
Let me do it.

568
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:18,766
Pheem, I thought you said you’d give me a sponge bath.

569
00:42:18,926 --> 00:42:21,926
Isn’t this also a part of my body? Just wipe it.

570
00:42:21,926 --> 00:42:22,806
Come on.

571
00:42:26,486 --> 00:42:27,566
Okay.

572
00:42:27,966 --> 00:42:31,446
That’s not clean enough. You actually have to put your hand inside.

573
00:42:32,326 --> 00:42:36,966
That’s all right. I’d rather do it like this.

574
00:42:40,086 --> 00:42:42,006
Look where you’re wiping too.

575
00:42:42,406 --> 00:42:45,046
I’m looking.

576
00:42:49,046 --> 00:42:53,046
Finally, it’s done. I’ve never done this for anyone before.

577
00:42:53,246 --> 00:42:54,886
You’re the first one.

578
00:42:56,086 --> 00:42:57,046
You don’t say.

579
00:42:59,926 --> 00:43:03,726
Come. Let me see if Kaokie now smells nice.

580
00:43:03,726 --> 00:43:04,766
Let me check.

581
00:43:09,766 --> 00:43:12,766
Stop. You can’t get close to me.

582
00:43:12,766 --> 00:43:14,766
You might catch a cold.

583
00:43:15,446 --> 00:43:20,526
If those viruses inside your body will get into my body,

584
00:43:20,566 --> 00:43:25,206
I’m okay with that. I’ll see them as a gift of love from you.

585
00:43:25,326 --> 00:43:27,926
Oh, you’re down bad, huh?

586
00:43:30,446 --> 00:43:33,886
Aren’t you going home?

587
00:43:34,926 --> 00:43:37,566
No, I’m going to sleep here tonight.

588
00:43:39,486 --> 00:43:41,446
Will your dad be okay with it?

589
00:43:42,646 --> 00:43:45,606
He won’t say anything.

590
00:43:48,486 --> 00:43:53,406
But…I don’t think it’s a good idea. You might catch a cold from me.

591
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:57,806
Also, I barely have any strength today.

592
00:43:58,206 --> 00:44:03,206
What if you try to molest me, how would I be able to resist?

593
00:44:04,286 --> 00:44:05,006
Oh, yeah?

594
00:44:08,766 --> 00:44:12,966
Don’t worry. I have a way to prevent myself from catching a cold from you.

595
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:25,806
Mooyong, please help prevent me from getting the virus.

596
00:44:26,646 --> 00:44:28,526
There, I’ll be fine now.

597
00:44:30,326 --> 00:44:32,766
Viruses spread through air, Pheem.

598
00:44:32,766 --> 00:44:35,846
The pillow won’t help.

599
00:44:40,086 --> 00:44:40,966
Here.

600
00:44:42,086 --> 00:44:45,046
Now, sleep. So that you’ll get well soon.

Kie.

602
00:45:21,326 --> 00:45:25,966
Seeing your face can help make me get well sooner.

603
00:45:27,366 --> 00:45:29,046
I’m not a medicine.

604
00:45:35,046 --> 00:45:37,846
I’ve never known…

605
00:45:38,286 --> 00:45:40,486
that there’s nothing more pleasant…

606
00:45:41,486 --> 00:45:44,486
than seeing the face of someone you love so close like this.

607
00:45:44,886 --> 00:45:48,966
What a sweet talker. If it weren’t because you had caught a cold,

608
00:45:49,566 --> 00:45:51,126
I’d have tried what your lips taste like.

609
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:55,486
You can try them when I get better.

610
00:45:57,966 --> 00:46:02,206
Just go to sleep now, so that you’ll get well soon.

611
00:46:02,686 --> 00:46:03,206
Sleep.

612
00:46:03,206 --> 00:46:05,326
Good night.

613
00:46:05,726 --> 00:46:07,486

Pock: Or has Pheem’s dad already found out about you?

619
00:47:13,926 --> 00:47:16,686

The fever has gone.

636
00:49:07,514 --> 00:49:10,834
I have a good nurse. I’m getting much better now.

637
00:49:12,554 --> 00:49:16,834
You’re giving me a sweet talk since early morning, Mooyong…

638
00:49:21,954 --> 00:49:25,274
You should go home. Your family might be worried about you.

639
00:49:25,714 --> 00:49:28,074
But I don’t want to leave you here alone.

640
00:49:29,194 --> 00:49:33,114

Well, it’s…

Never mind then.

648
00:50:18,594 --> 00:50:20,074
It’s about Poon, right?

649
00:50:29,754 --> 00:50:33,154
Yes, he likes me.

650
00:50:34,234 --> 00:50:38,794
But don’t worry. I’m not interested in anyone.

651
00:50:38,794 --> 00:50:43,274
I’m not seeing anyone but you.

652
00:50:46,234 --> 00:50:47,754
Please believe me.

Pheem!

656
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:45,314
Where have you been?

657
00:51:46,594 --> 00:51:48,594
I went to look after my friend at the hospital.

658
00:51:48,874 --> 00:51:50,154
She’s sick.

659
00:51:50,514 --> 00:51:52,074
Why didn’t you tell me first then?

660
00:51:52,954 --> 00:51:55,074
I’ve been trying to get ahold you all day.

661
00:51:55,634 --> 00:51:58,114
I had to ask Prae to call you instead.

662
00:52:01,754 --> 00:52:03,074
I’m sorry.

663
00:52:03,834 --> 00:52:06,074
But I know that if I had told you first,

664
00:52:06,434 --> 00:52:07,994
you would never me stay over with my friend.

665
00:52:08,194 --> 00:52:09,874
So, you just disappeared like this?

666
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,714
You’re disappointing me.

667
00:52:12,834 --> 00:52:14,234
What should I do with you?

668
00:52:16,474 --> 00:52:20,754
I think I’ll have to change my mind…and send you to study in England.

669
00:52:21,594 --> 00:52:25,234
Maybe we don’t have to make such a big deal about it, Uncle.

670
00:52:25,274 --> 00:52:28,634
You too. Stop encouraging your sister.

671
00:52:30,674 --> 00:52:33,874
Uncle, I think you can just give her a light punishment.

672
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:36,274
But she won’t learn a lesson if I do that.

673
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,914
Just try it first, Uncle.

674
00:52:39,554 --> 00:52:43,554
Maybe, you can…have her grounded.

675
00:52:44,154 --> 00:52:46,834
And confiscate her phone so that she can’t go out with her friends.

676
00:52:47,234 --> 00:52:49,034
I think that should be much enough.

677
00:52:49,034 --> 00:52:50,114
Stop it, Poon!

678
00:52:50,514 --> 00:52:52,194
This is a family matter.

679
00:52:52,194 --> 00:52:52,994

00:52:53,034 --> 00:52:54,234
No, it’s you who should stop!

681
00:52:57,154 --> 00:53:01,274

Please calm down, Uncle.

From now on, you can’t use your phone…

00:56:37,354 --> 00:56:40,474
Mhm, I haven’t talked to her for a while now.

702
00:56:40,474 --> 00:56:42,354
Her phone is always off.

703
00:56:43,194 --> 00:56:47,114
Is she sick? She might have gotten viruses,

704
00:56:47,114 --> 00:56:49,114
a gift of love, from your body.

705
00:56:49,714 --> 00:56:51,754
She wouldn’t have switched off her phone then.

706
00:56:52,914 --> 00:56:54,434
Have you done anything to upset her?

707
00:56:54,554 --> 00:56:59,994
No, that night when she came to see me, we were still lovey-dovey.

708
00:57:01,394 --> 00:57:02,914
So, she just disappeared?

709
00:57:03,874 --> 00:57:05,314

00:57:21,714 --> 00:57:23,194
I’ll be home soon.

712
00:57:35,394 --> 00:57:38,394
Was I being too loud it woke you up?

713
00:57:40,554 --> 00:57:46,514
No. But…is there anything wrong?

714
00:57:49,194 --> 00:57:50,034
No.

715
00:57:52,074 --> 00:57:53,434
Come, let’s sleep.

716
00:57:57,634 --> 00:57:58,634
Good night.

717
00:58:00,434 --> 00:58:01,554
Good night.

718
00:58:10,074 --> 00:58:14,034
Come to think of it, she was actually acting weird that night.

719
00:58:15,514 --> 00:58:17,314
Hey, or maybe…

720
00:58:17,634 --> 00:58:19,514
Pheem’s dad has already found out about you.

721
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:22,634
That she went to stay over at your place, so she now gets punished.

722
00:58:23,554 --> 00:58:25,234
She’s no longer a kid.

723
00:58:25,234 --> 00:58:27,154
Why would she get punished for doing that?

724
00:58:27,714 --> 00:58:31,314
Hey, she’s probably grounded right now.

725
00:58:31,314 --> 00:58:33,474
With no food or water.

726
00:58:33,474 --> 00:58:36,514
Waiting for a prince in shining armour like you to go and rescue her.

727
00:58:37,394 --> 00:58:40,674
Geez, I’m getting worried now.

728
00:58:41,794 --> 00:58:44,474
If you want to know, let’s prove it.

729
00:58:45,634 --> 00:58:46,434
Let’s go!

730
00:58:50,954 --> 00:58:54,754
Darn it, Kie!

731
00:58:55,074 --> 00:58:58,634
I forgot that her house wall is like the Great Wall of China.

732
00:58:59,234 --> 00:59:00,194
What should we do?

733
00:59:00,234 --> 00:59:01,154
What to do now?

734
00:59:02,714 --> 00:59:05,274
Hey! I have an idea.

735
00:59:06,034 --> 00:59:07,754
You. Come stand over here.

736
00:59:07,754 --> 00:59:09,754
Put your hands together like this.

737
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:10,954
Yes, make sure your fingers are interlocked.

738
00:59:11,234 --> 00:59:13,674
Now, repeat after me. Hooya!

739
00:59:13,674 --> 00:59:14,474
Hooya!

740
00:59:14,474 --> 00:59:15,674
Again. Hooya!

741
00:59:15,674 --> 00:59:16,434
Hooya!

742
00:59:16,434 --> 00:59:19,514
Right. Now, I’m going to count to three then you shout out Hooya, okay?

743
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,554
1 2 3!

744
00:59:20,554 --> 00:59:22,794
Hooya! Pock! What the hell are you doing?

745
00:59:22,794 --> 00:59:24,994
Damn it, Pock! It hurts!

746
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:25,954
Hang on, let me try again.

747
00:59:25,954 --> 00:59:27,034
Just calm down…

748
00:59:27,034 --> 00:59:28,034
and hold your hands together tightly.

749
00:59:28,034 --> 00:59:29,434
Okay, 1 2 3!

750
00:59:29,434 --> 00:59:30,874
Pock!

751
00:59:30,874 --> 00:59:31,834
Kie!

752
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:33,154
It hurts!

753
00:59:33,914 --> 00:59:37,314
Hey, why can’t I see anything?

754
00:59:37,554 --> 00:59:38,274
Kie.

755
00:59:39,314 --> 00:59:43,554
From this angle, I can clearly see her dad’s car.

756
00:59:43,954 --> 00:59:46,074
This means he’s home.

757
00:59:49,914 --> 00:59:51,274
But from my angle,

758
00:59:51,994 --> 00:59:55,714
I can’t see her car. Does this mean she’s not home?

759
00:59:59,234 --> 01:00:01,034
Yeah, you’re right.

760
01:00:01,594 --> 01:00:03,354
But Kie.

761
01:00:06,914 --> 01:00:08,714
From what you told me,

762
01:00:08,714 --> 01:00:11,914
I’m quite sure Pheem is being grounded.

763
01:00:11,954 --> 01:00:16,154
Geez, Pock! If she's grounded, then we should have seen her car here.

764
01:00:16,234 --> 01:00:17,914
Well, you’re right.

765
01:00:18,954 --> 01:00:20,394
Now what?

766
01:00:20,474 --> 01:00:23,314
I don’t know. Should we look again?

767
01:00:23,314 --> 01:00:24,514
- Yeah.
- Just to make sure.

768
01:00:24,874 --> 01:00:28,834
Hmm, I can’t see anything.

769
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:30,154
I only saw her dad’s car.

770
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:36,074
Geez, Kie. I don’t think this will work. Now what?

771
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,794
I have a question though.

772
01:00:39,954 --> 01:00:40,314
Yeah?

773
01:00:40,314 --> 01:00:42,234
Why can’t we just ask someone in the house directly?

774
01:00:42,394 --> 01:00:44,914
Why do we have to be sneaky and act like a thief?

775
01:00:44,914 --> 01:00:46,674
Yeah, you’re right.

776
01:00:47,114 --> 01:00:50,314
We can just go in there and tell them we’re here to visit her, right?

777
01:00:50,394 --> 01:00:51,714
Yeah, that’s right.

778
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:55,034
Geez, get up then. Come on.

779
01:00:56,114 --> 01:00:56,874
We’re all dirty.

780
01:00:56,874 --> 01:00:58,034
- Hey, look!
- What?

781
01:00:58,034 --> 01:00:58,914
The door is opening. Her dad!

782
01:00:58,914 --> 01:01:00,554
- Pheem’s dad!
- Her dad!

783
01:01:00,554 --> 01:01:01,834
What to do now?

784
01:01:02,114 --> 01:01:04,154
Look! That’s Pheem’s car! It’s Pheem!

785
01:01:04,154 --> 01:01:07,994
Pheem! Pheem, please get out of your car.

786
01:01:08,314 --> 01:01:10,114
Pheem! Pheem! Pheem!

787
01:01:10,114 --> 01:01:11,754
Pheem! Pull over, Pheem!

788
01:01:11,754 --> 01:01:15,034
Pheem, Pheem. Oh…

789
01:01:15,034 --> 01:01:17,354
Hello, Prae.

790
01:01:17,354 --> 01:01:19,634
Hi, Pock and Kie. What are you two doing here?

791
01:01:20,554 --> 01:01:22,594
We…

792
01:01:22,954 --> 01:01:26,714
We can’t get ahold of Pheem at all. Is she okay?

793
01:01:28,034 --> 01:01:31,034
Well…Pheem is sick.

794
01:01:31,034 --> 01:01:33,154
She’s also having a quarrel with her dad.

795
01:01:33,154 --> 01:01:35,754
That’s why she’s being grounded for a while.

796
01:01:36,914 --> 01:01:40,034
See? Exactly what I told you.

797
01:01:41,474 --> 01:01:44,074
Is Pheem going to be all right?

798
01:01:44,354 --> 01:01:47,634
Is the quarrel with her dad so serious that she has to be grounded?

799
01:01:48,274 --> 01:01:49,594
She’s much better now.

800
01:01:49,834 --> 01:01:51,234
Please don’t worry.

801
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:55,834
But I think right now, you two should go back first.

802
01:01:55,834 --> 01:01:59,554
If Uncle Poj sees you here, Pheem might get into more trouble.

803
01:02:00,114 --> 01:02:04,274
I’ll tell Pheem that you’re here to see her.

804
01:02:04,274 --> 01:02:04,994
Okay?

805
01:02:08,594 --> 01:02:09,594
Let’s go back.

806
01:02:14,394 --> 01:02:15,194
Okay.

807
01:02:15,514 --> 01:02:16,754
I’m going in then.

808
01:02:17,194 --> 01:02:19,714
- Yes, thank you.
- Bye.

811
01:02:36,074 --> 01:02:37,954
The one Kie said her lips are kissable.

812
01:02:38,034 --> 01:02:39,554
