Wait, didn’t you say if it were a boy you’d want him to be an architect…

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,280

- I don’t think so.
- Right, sweetie?

- She should be a business tycoon like me.

179
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,920
All right, dear. Let’s eat.

180
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,480
Okay.

181
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,200
- Let’s eat.
- Here, take it.

182
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,640
She looks suspicious though.

183
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,560
Come.

184
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,320
Kee, take this.

185
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,640
Wow, they all look yummy.

186
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,880
Looks so good.

187
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Let’s dig in.

188
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,360
Where’s Peem?

189
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,040
In the dining room, Sir.

190
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,320
Why don’t you read your textbooks, sweetie?

191
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,600
Instead of watching something nonsense like this.

192
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,520
I've just finished studying.

193
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,880
I just want to relax a bit.

194
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,840
I’ve already cancelled all your extra classes on Sunday.

195
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,200
Isn’t that enough?

196
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,480
But you moved them to Saturday instead. My schedule is so tight.

197
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,360
How?

198
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,880
You still have some free time in the evening.

199
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,480
I’m thinking maybe I should also get you an English tutor.

200
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,640
Aren’t you going to give me a break at all?

201
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,360
Why would you need so much break?

202
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,080
You’ll have to take over the company from me in the future.

203
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,440
You’re my only hope.

204
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,000
You must be prepared and good at everything.

205
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,680
You don’t have time to slack off like this.

206
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,280
But I’m tired.

207
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,240
No matter what it is, I always give you everything that you want.

208
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,800
Studying hard is the only one thing I’m asking from you.

209
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,360
Can’t you just do it for me?

210
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,160
Fine, I’ll do it.

211
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,360
But can you please do me a favor?

212
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,120
What is it?

213
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,840
Miss, it’s almost 8 o’clock. Aren’t you going in?

214
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,160
Just a second. She’s still not here.

215
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,400
There she is.

216
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:53,455
[Alarm going off]

217
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,615
[Siriwit  Suksa High School]

218
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:19,495
Miss, it’s almost 8 o’clock. Aren’t you going in?

219
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,895
Just a second. She’s still not here.

220
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:26,135
Whom are you waiting for, Miss?

221
00:19:29,495 --> 00:19:30,695
Nothing.

222
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,975
There she is.

223
00:19:49,175 --> 00:19:50,375
Are you late too, Kee?

224
00:19:50,495 --> 00:19:52,695
You too, Peem?

225
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:54,815
Quickly. Or we won’t make it.

226
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,535
3 2 1.

227
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:06,575
Aww, come on.

228
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:07,855
Absolutely not.

229
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:09,775
Those who are late will be punished.

230
00:20:10,415 --> 00:20:11,535
It’s already after 8.

231
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:13,375
It seems you guys love to run.

232
00:20:13,935 --> 00:20:15,175
I’ll let you do what you love.

233
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,735
Please, just this time.

234
00:20:18,735 --> 00:20:19,535
No.

235
00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:20,695
Please, Teacher.

236
00:20:20,975 --> 00:20:21,775
No.

237
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:36,135
Ten lapses. Done.

238
00:20:45,415 --> 00:20:48,935
Kee, please wait. Only five more rounds.

239
00:20:55,135 --> 00:20:57,375
I’ll run with you, Peem.

240
00:21:08,775 --> 00:21:10,415
Sorry, too fast.

241
00:21:14,335 --> 00:21:17,215
Do you live far from school? Why are you late?

242
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:19,015
Probably got stuck in traffic like me.

243
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:22,695
Nope. My house is on the same street as our school.

244
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:23,895
I just got up late.

245
00:21:24,695 --> 00:21:28,775
Hey, we’re the same then. Which alley is your house?

246
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:30,135
14.

247
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:35,575
Really? I’m only two allies away. Mine is 12.

248
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,215
How do you come to school?

249
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:40,615
I walk here.

250
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:44,415
I don’t want to come by car. It’s a waste of fuel, not to mention the traffic jam.

251
00:21:44,415 --> 00:21:48,255
I don’t want to create PM2.5 or add more cars to the traffic in front of our school.

252
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:52,415
That makes me feel like I’ve done something wrong.

253
00:21:54,135 --> 00:21:57,255
Hey, I didn’t mean to make you feel like that.

254
00:21:57,495 --> 00:22:00,455
Just one car wouldn’t create that much PM2.5.

255
00:22:02,175 --> 00:22:03,575
Too late, Kee.

256
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:10,575
Peem, let’s hurry up.

257
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:43,575
Here.

258
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:50,855
It’s okay. I have a handkerchief. I don’t want to generate waste.

259
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:17,175
Want me to teach you?

260
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:19,535
So that you can do it next time.

261
00:23:21,295 --> 00:23:23,055
Okay.

262
00:23:32,455 --> 00:23:34,175
Start from this.

263
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:38,935
Then do this.

264
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:33,895
And this.

265
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:40,375
Here you go.

266
00:24:45,255 --> 00:24:52,095
Thanks. But I don’t know if I’ll be able to do it as good as you.

267
00:24:56,455 --> 00:25:00,015
Then, you can always let me do it for you.

268
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:06,135
Thanks.

269
00:25:08,615 --> 00:25:12,175
Do you know that when a girl ties a tie for you,

270
00:25:12,735 --> 00:25:17,895
it means she wants to have you tied to her for the rest of her life?

271
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:31,655
I’ll see you then.

272
00:25:37,815 --> 00:25:42,575
Kee: I first thought it was destiny that kept throwing me next to her.

273
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:48,655
But come to think about it, it might be Peem’s intention to make it look like a coincidence.

274
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:54,335
Checkmate.

275
00:26:16,895 --> 00:26:20,815
Kee, Kee!

276
00:26:22,575 --> 00:26:23,575
Kee!

277
00:26:24,775 --> 00:26:25,935
Kee!

278
00:26:28,575 --> 00:26:29,375
Peem.

279
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,735
Can I walk home with you?

280
00:26:56,335 --> 00:26:58,095
Can I walk home with you?

281
00:27:02,895 --> 00:27:06,055
Well, I don’t want to add more traffic jams to our school.

282
00:27:06,455 --> 00:27:10,375
And the PM2.5 too.

283
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:17,935
Great!

284
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:23,695
But will your dad be okay with this?

285
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:27,175
I heard he’s very possessive of you.

286
00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:30,335
That he always has a driver following you around.

287
00:27:32,415 --> 00:27:38,295
I’ve already asked for his permission. He said he’d only agree if you walk me home.

288
00:27:38,895 --> 00:27:40,815
You don’t have a problem with that, right?

289
00:28:19,695 --> 00:28:21,255
Let me carry the bag for you.

290
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:23,535
Thanks.

291
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:30,415
Why would you want to walk home though?

292
00:28:30,415 --> 00:28:33,295
Don’t you usually have a driver to pick you up?

293
00:28:33,615 --> 00:28:37,855
I told you I don’t want to create PM2.5. And I also want to walk home with you.

294
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:39,335
Miss.

295
00:28:42,295 --> 00:28:44,615
I’ll walk home, okay?

296
00:28:44,615 --> 00:28:45,495
Yes, Miss.

297
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:53,175
♫ Don’t let me imagine it alone ♫

298
00:28:53,175 --> 00:28:59,695
♫ I love you only. I want to see your face every day ♫

299
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:06,255
♫ I’ve never looked at anyone else. I’ve always loved you but only kept it to myself ♫

300
00:29:06,255 --> 00:29:12,015
♫ I love you only. I love you more than I can say ♫

301
00:29:12,415 --> 00:29:13,815
Geez, Pock!

302
00:29:14,695 --> 00:29:17,775
Peem is definitely flirting with you.

303
00:29:19,695 --> 00:29:20,495
Flirting?

304
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:26,015
Yeah, or else why would she want to walk home with you every day?

305
00:29:26,655 --> 00:29:30,615
Hmm…I don’t think so. Maybe because we live on the same street.

306
00:29:32,935 --> 00:29:34,335
Do you like her?

307
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:38,415
No.

308
00:29:38,415 --> 00:29:39,975
Your ‘No’ means ‘Yes’.

309
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:42,935
I said no.

310
00:29:48,175 --> 00:29:49,935
Why are you fidgeting?

311
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,695
Who’s fidgeting? I’m not. I’m fine.

312
00:29:55,415 --> 00:29:59,935
I knew it. I’ve sensed it since our school holidays before Grade 10…

313
00:30:00,415 --> 00:30:03,615
that Peem often kept stealing a glance at you.

314
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:12,655
Pock: Since Grade 9’s second semester under that Indian cork tree.

315
00:30:13,735 --> 00:30:14,535
Hey.

316
00:30:16,735 --> 00:30:17,735
Thank you.

317
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,735
Pock: Peem kept looking at you secretly.

318
00:30:34,295 --> 00:30:35,815
Pock: During Grade 10’s first semester,

319
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:38,815
[Applause]
Well done, Kee!

320
00:30:38,855 --> 00:30:40,575
Pock: She was overly cheering for you

321
00:30:44,895 --> 00:30:46,295
Pock: And overly worried about you.

322
00:30:51,535 --> 00:30:53,135
Coming!

323
00:30:53,815 --> 00:30:55,215
Took you so long.

324
00:30:55,215 --> 00:30:59,495
Come on. Here’s your fried rice, J.

325
00:30:59,495 --> 00:31:02,135
This is spicy basil chicken for Ploy and…

326
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:04,375
Crispy pork with Chinese kale for Pock.

327
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:05,935
Thanks.

328
00:31:05,935 --> 00:31:07,415
And here…

329
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:10,295
is for you, Kee.

330
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:14,775
Crispy pork with Chinese kale and fried egg.

331
00:31:15,495 --> 00:31:16,975
In a heart shape too.

332
00:31:17,535 --> 00:31:19,255
Pock: Everything is overly special for you.

333
00:31:21,815 --> 00:31:25,375
She even got you an extra egg in your food.

334
00:31:28,135 --> 00:31:32,175
Do you believe me now that she’s crazy for you?

335
00:31:32,175 --> 00:31:34,215
You’re her bias.

336
00:31:42,815 --> 00:31:47,495
But…but she’s never said she likes me.

337
00:31:47,855 --> 00:31:50,055
Geez, what’s so hard with it?

338
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:54,095
If you want to know, just ask her.

339
00:31:55,095 --> 00:31:59,935
But I guess someone like you wouldn’t dare to do it. Boo!

340
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:09,095
Just you wait. I’m going to tell her this evening.

341
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:14,655
Are you all right?

342
00:32:14,775 --> 00:32:16,095
I’m okay. Sorry.

343
00:32:16,095 --> 00:32:17,335
Kee!

344
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:28,184
Peem!

345
00:33:38,824 --> 00:33:41,984
I have something to tell you.

346
00:33:47,864 --> 00:33:51,264
Well, I…

347
00:33:52,224 --> 00:33:53,424
I…

348
00:33:55,424 --> 00:33:56,384
Keerun.

349
00:33:56,544 --> 00:33:58,944
I need you to help me move something. Now.

350
00:33:59,744 --> 00:34:00,544
Yes.

351
00:34:03,984 --> 00:34:06,064
I’ll go help the teacher first.

352
00:34:16,584 --> 00:34:17,424
I’m okay.

353
00:34:18,584 --> 00:34:21,664
Kee: If there’s a first time, then there must be a second time.

354
00:34:21,664 --> 00:34:22,504
Peem

355
00:34:23,584 --> 00:34:27,944
I want to tell you that…Well, I…

- We want to know.

01:02:14,279 --> 01:02:19,039
Um…I think…I think so.

713
01:02:20,359 --> 01:02:25,119
No, I mean…why don’t you go ask her yourself?

714
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:29,879
I’m not Kee. I can’t answer for her. Why don’t you go and ask her yourself?

715
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:31,039
Thanks!

716
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:39,399
All clear!

717
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:43,639
Wait!

718
01:02:44,839 --> 01:02:48,039
I just wanted to say that’s the stairs to the second floor.

719
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:49,639
Geez, Pock!

720
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:51,439
You scared me.

721
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:58,279
I’m asking you honestly, when are you going to stop avoiding Peem?

722
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:00,759
Do you know how tiring it is to keep lying to her…

723
01:03:00,759 --> 01:03:02,719
and deal with her pressure over me?

724
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:06,199
It’s stressing me out so much I thought I almost got a stroke.

725
01:03:07,639 --> 01:03:10,519
I just… want to go home on time as usual.

726
01:03:11,439 --> 01:03:13,919
Usual? How usual? Please explain.

727
01:03:14,279 --> 01:03:17,999
Usually, you’d find excuses to do this or that…

728
01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:20,519
or practising basketball just to wait for Peem to walk home together.

729
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:23,399
That’s not usual – waiting for Peem.

730
01:03:24,439 --> 01:03:29,079
Geez, I’m so stressed. The other day, Peem was sulking and kept ignoring you.

731
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:31,599
Now, you’re sulking and keep ignoring her.

732
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:33,839
I’m not sulking.

733
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:37,439
Then why on earth are you avoiding her?

734
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:44,039
You’re really avoiding me.

735
01:03:48,839 --> 01:03:49,759
Pock.

736
01:03:50,839 --> 01:03:52,679
I thought you said, ‘all clear’.

737
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:58,279
It really was. I saw her getting in her car and her driver just drove off.

738
01:03:58,279 --> 01:04:02,439
That’s why I told you it was all clear. I really meant it.

739
01:04:02,959 --> 01:04:06,319
You’ve helped her lying to me all this time?

740
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:18,239
Umm, do you want mini pancake rolls? The ones in front of our school are really good.

741
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:20,079
You’d regret it if you didn’t give it a try.

742
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:24,879
So, I’ll go buy some pancake rolls then.

743
01:04:24,879 --> 01:04:26,159
You two talk nicely, okay?

744
01:04:34,439 --> 01:04:36,239
Are you mad at me?

745
01:04:38,439 --> 01:04:39,399
No.

746
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:50,039
Then, why did you stop walking home with me? You also skip practising basketball.

747
01:04:53,399 --> 01:04:57,039
I think I’m going to cut down on it. I’m getting bored.

748
01:05:01,799 --> 01:05:03,399
Of basketball or of me?

749
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:15,679
If you don’t want to walk home with me,

750
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:22,639
you can just be honest. I’ll stop waiting for you.

751
01:05:28,279 --> 01:05:32,279
Okay, I don’t want to walk home with you.

752
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:42,999
Do you really mean it?

753
01:05:56,239 --> 01:05:59,719
Kee, what fillings do you want for your pancake rolls?

754
01:06:07,319 --> 01:06:09,519
I shouldn’t have come back.

755
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:14,039
Okay then, I’ll just order the sweet fillings for you.

756
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:16,399
Your life is so bitter right now.

757
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:20,159
I’ll order them for both of you.

758
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:21,719
Bye.

759
01:07:12,519 --> 01:07:17,319
our class is responsible for two game booths.

760
01:07:17,319 --> 01:07:19,319
Marry Christmas

761
01:07:19,319 --> 01:07:20,239
Dart game

762
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:22,039
We're not here to throw darts.

763
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:24,879
We're here to throw our hearts at you.

764
01:07:26,399 --> 01:07:28,679
Can you girls over there quiet down a bit?

765
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:30,919
We can't focus on spooning eggs here.

766
01:07:30,919 --> 01:07:32,679
never know spooning eggs

767
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:34,359
would need that much attention.

768
01:07:34,839 --> 01:07:35,879
Have a safe flight.

769
01:07:35,879 --> 01:07:37,639
I'll be back soon.

770
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:39,199
You can do it.

771
01:07:39,759 --> 01:07:40,799
Peem!

772
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,159
have something to tell you.

773
01:07:42,479 --> 01:07:43,719
Since you're going to England,

774
01:07:43,719 --> 01:07:45,279
can you get me autographs of Liverpool's players?

775
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,719
I'm their FC.

776
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:49,319
Glory Glory Man United

777
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:50,959
Isn't that Man-U?

778
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:52,479
Oh, really?
