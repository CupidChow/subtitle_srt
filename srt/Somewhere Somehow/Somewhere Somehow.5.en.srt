Have a happy birthday, Pheem.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,800
You have a rival now.

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,680
Where have you been?

4
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,480
I went to visit my friend at the hospital.

5
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,640
If I had asked you first, you wouldn’t have allowed me to stay over.

6
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,240
So, you just disappeared?

7
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,360
Maybe we can just give her a light punishment.

8
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,760
Have her grounded and her phone confiscated so that she can’t go out with her friends.

9
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,840
See? Exactly what I told you.

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,680
I’ll tell Pheem you’ve come to see her.

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,120
Can I go see you at your faculty?

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,040
Please give me a few more days.

13
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,840
Is this why she didn’t want me to come?

14
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,080
Are you going to Samed too? Has Beer asked you to go help him there?

15
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,080
Fine, I’ll go.

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,520
Let’s go to the sea!

17
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,600
You’re acting weird.

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,320
What?

19
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,720
Pock! Kie!

20
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,200
Is this why you were trying to hold me back?

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,920
Kie.

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,880
Thanks for helping me checking into the hotel, and even take me out to eat something.

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,720
You know what? On my way here while I was on the boat, I was so hungry.

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,480
Aren’t you hungry?

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,920
No.

26
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,000
Hey, have I done anything to upset you this much?

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,640
If that is so, then I’m sorry.

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,840
Never mind.

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,800
Are you done?

30
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,640
I thought you said you were so hungry.

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, that was…

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,880
Excuse me, can I have the bill please?

33
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,240

52

Are you okay?

53
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,960
Can you get up? Let’s sit here first.

54
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,480
You’ve got sand everywhere.

55
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,360
Does it hurt?

56
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,160
A lot.

57
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,880
Why did you run after me?

58
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,280
Let’s try standing up.

59
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,760
Can you walk?

60
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,200
Ouch, I can’t walk! It hurts so much.
- No?

61
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,320
What do you want me to do then?

62
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,520
- Ouch! It hurts!
- Okay, okay.

63
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,200
I don’t want to go back to my room yet.

64
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,680
I want to stay like this.

65
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,480
Keep looking at the view.

66
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,520
Keep looking at the view.

67
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,720
Mhm. I want to stay like this, to possess you like this and not letting you go anywhere.

68
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,200
Sounds creepy though. I have to go help Pock do the work.

69
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,760
But I don’t want you to go.

70
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,800
I really can’t stay, Pheem. Please don’t sulk.

71
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,400
Kie.

72
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,080
Yes?

73
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,480
Can you please stop turning me a cold shoulder?

74
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,240
When you’re like this, it feels like my heart is torn into pieces.

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,120
Better now?

76
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,200
Try not to walk for a while and you should be okay soon.

77
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,160
I’ll…go see Pock then.

I’m sorry.

81
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,280
Please. I’m so sorry.

82
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,000
Do you love me?

83
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,920
Mhm.

84
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,080
Mhm what?

85
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,880
Mhm means…I love you.

86
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,600
Then why do you like to walk away from me? You didn’t pick up my call too.

87
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,920
It’s because I’m not good with words.

88
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,120
Especially when my mood is not stable.

89
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,320
I’m afraid…I might say things on impulse.

90
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,840
Like that time when I told you I didn’t want to walk home with you…

91
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,920
when in fact I actually wanted to.

92
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,960
So?

93
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,920
I just…want my mood to be more stable first.

94
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,920
I’m just someone who is foolish, weak, and hot-headed.

95
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,240
I know those are bad habits.

96
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,960
I’m trying to improve myself for you.

97
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,520
But old habits die hard and they’re not that easy to change.

98
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,640
Can you give me more time?

99
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,960
But please don’t blame yourself anymore.

100
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,640
I don’t anyone to talk badly about my girlfriend.

101
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,760
Even that someone is me?

102
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,360
You can’t. Only I can do that to you.

Okay, got it.

104

If you finally did it, I’ll have to fulfill my vow by dancing there.

133

Why the heck did you make such a vow?

134
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,200
Or do you want me to cancel it?

Let’s take a pick. 1 2 3!

191

-All gone.

194
00:16:59,107 --> 00:17:02,387
- Gone, gone.  All gone.
- I think you should stop. Pheem!

195
00:17:03,027 --> 00:17:09,547
You’re drunk. Let’s…Pheem.

196
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:12,227
Let’s go sleep inside.

197
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:17,467
I’m not drunk. I’m having fun.

198
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:23,187
- Let’s stop, Pheem.
- Who’s drunk?

199
00:17:26,107 --> 00:17:27,587
I’m not drunk.

200
00:17:34,947 --> 00:17:40,307
Okay, you should rest now.

201
00:17:40,907 --> 00:17:42,547
I’m…I’m going to leave.

202
00:17:42,907 --> 00:17:44,347
Are you leaving?

203
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:46,947
Wait, Kie.

204
00:17:46,947 --> 00:17:49,387
Wait.

205
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:56,867
Please don’t go. Stay with me first.

206
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:03,387
Please…Stay with me.

207
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:06,387

208
00:18:07,947 --> 00:18:09,227
Please…

209
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:17,307
I shouldn’t do that.

210
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:22,467
Why? Why not?

211
00:18:23,787 --> 00:18:26,347
We used to sleep together before.

212
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:33,307
Your heart is beating so fast.

213
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,747
Are you having a dirty thought about me?

214
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:49,507
Yes, you’re right.

215
00:20:04,387 --> 00:20:05,627
Are you hurt?

216
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:21,747
So…what’s next?

217
00:20:23,987 --> 00:20:26,227
I guess we have to kiss again.

218
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:56,227
Kie,

219
00:20:56,227 --> 00:20:57,747
I’m scared.

220
00:20:58,827 --> 00:21:00,827
What are you scared of?

221
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:06,387
I’m scared that…

222
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:11,587
after you finally get you want from me,

223
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,467
then you’ll leave me.

224
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:18,507
Am I that kind of person to you?

225
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:25,867
Please don’t be scared.

226
00:21:27,507 --> 00:21:29,427
I’ll never leave you.

227
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,147
Ouch, Pheem!

228
00:23:22,827 --> 00:23:25,507
My rascal. Are you sober now?

229
00:23:48,587 --> 00:23:50,187
Kie!

230
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,747
Stop it.

231
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:57,827
Why are you shy?

232
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:07,787
This…is mine.

233
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,267
This…is mine.

234
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:13,267
This is also mine.

235
00:24:14,347 --> 00:24:15,787
This too.

236
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:24,387
And also…this.

237
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:30,387
Hey, who said it’s yours.

238
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:34,267
No one. But they’re reserved for me only.

239
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:47,667
So, tell me what you plan to do today?

240
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:56,147
Well, on our first day that we’re officially husband and wife,

241
00:24:58,107 --> 00:25:01,467
I want to do what we did last night again.

242
00:25:03,707 --> 00:25:05,027
Stop it.

243
00:25:05,347 --> 00:25:06,627
Can’t we?

244
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,627
No.

245
00:25:16,347 --> 00:25:20,067
Stop fooling around or else you won’t be able to get anything done today.

246
00:25:22,947 --> 00:25:24,267
I’m not fooling around.

247
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,227
I’m serious.

252
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:43,187
Yes, my wife?

253
00:25:47,387 --> 00:25:48,867
Stop it.

254
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,307
I’m up now.

255
00:25:54,747 --> 00:25:56,227
Kie!

256
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:57,907
Oh, wow.

257
00:25:58,947 --> 00:26:00,387
Don’t look.

258
00:26:27,027 --> 00:26:31,667
Kie! Get out. I’m going to shower.

259
00:26:32,547 --> 00:26:34,107
Let me shower too.

260
00:26:36,187 --> 00:26:40,507
I’m going to shower.

261
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,187
Let me shower too. Please…

262
00:26:47,827 --> 00:26:49,707
Let me do it for you.

263
00:28:05,347 --> 00:28:10,227
Eat up so that you’ll have more strength tonight.

264

Kie!

265
00:28:12,627 --> 00:28:15,947
You’d better tell yourself that. Eat your egg.

266
00:28:17,627 --> 00:28:19,227
I’ll bring you some more.

267
00:28:19,227 --> 00:28:21,227
No, Pheem.

268
00:28:23,427 --> 00:28:29,227
Let the hubby do that stuff. You as a wife just sit here and wait.

269
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:39,227
Hey, what’s up?

270
00:28:39,227 --> 00:28:40,067
Hi.

You’ve just come down for breakfast?

274
00:28:46,827 --> 00:28:50,227
Yes, I went to bed late last night.

275
00:28:50,427 --> 00:28:52,907
Where were you yesterday? I couldn’t find you anywhere.

276
00:28:55,747 --> 00:29:01,707
Oh, it’s just…My girlfriend came so I went to stay with her.

277
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,827

Nice to meet you, Pheem.

282

Yes, babe?

285
00:29:43,587 --> 00:29:45,187
Her lips are so pretty, aren’t they?

286
00:29:45,347 --> 00:29:48,267
Do you still they are tempting?

287
00:29:48,427 --> 00:29:55,147
Of course not. For me, the only lips that I find tempting are yours.

288
00:29:56,387 --> 00:29:58,667
Make sure it’s true.

289
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:02,467
- Absolutely. I’m so sorry.
- You’d better watch out.

290
00:30:02,507 --> 00:30:04,787
I’m so sorry.

The red mark on her neck, did you do that?

Geez, come here.

314
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:42,980
Is it yellow?

What yellow?

316
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:53,580
I want to know if the sky has turned yellow for you, or is it still blue?

317
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,740
The sky is blue, of course. How could it be yellow?

318
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,740
My dear husband, do not lie or try to hide it from me.

319
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:11,620
Why? Because that gleeful excitement is now written all over your face.

321

What do you mean?

I wouldn’t dare. I always chicken out,

325
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,620
remember?

326
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,900
Do you realize that you’re so obvious right now?

327
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,860
How?

328
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,660
First.

329
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,140
Your lips…are quivering.

330
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:50,980
You’re smiling all the time. You usually walk around looking like a constipated cat.

331

332

333
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,460
you didn’t come back to our room last night.

334

- What?

338
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,060
Aww, you stayed there just to accompany her.

339
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:20,020
It’s fine if you don’t want to tell me, but just answer this…

Nothing.

00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,860
Are you shy?

358

00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,220

- Aww, I still couldn’t get enough.

Hello, Pheem.

401
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,260
Are you back?

402
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,100
If you can see me here, that means I’m back. You don’t have to ask.

403
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,060
Oh, well…

404
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,140
You planned it quite well.

405
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,660
Uncle Poj wasn’t home when you left.

406
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,300
He’s also not here when you’re back.

407
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,260
Where is she going?

408
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,140
Her faculty’s volunteer camp.

409
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,300
Do you know who’s going with her, Prae?

410
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,220
I’m just concerned about her safety.

411
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,540
She’s with Namfon. She said it’s mandatory. Everyone at the university has to do it.

412
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,620
Okay.

413
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,260
Wait, didn’t you girls go to the camp together?

414
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:44,340
Wait, Namfon. Are Pheem and Kie close?

415
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,140
If I hadn’t called Namfon, the girl you said you went to the camp with…

416
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,620
I’d have believed, like Uncle Poj did, that you really went to the volunteer camp.

417
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,060
So what? Are you going to run on your paws and tell my dad about it?

418
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,220
Whoa, take it easy. You don’t have to be so angry.

419
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,300
What did you do that the camp? Why are you looking so tired?

420
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,780
What’s that red mark on your neck? Did you get bitten by the mosquito?

421
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,860
Who did it?

422
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,340

That’s enough, Poon! Stop prying into my personal life.

Don’t make me hate you even more.

I still want to have some good things to think of you as an older brother.

But if you keep trying to find fault in everything I do and tell it to my dad so that he’d punish me,

429
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,460
then so be it.

430
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,140
No, no. Hang on, Pheem.

431
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,820
I’m not going to tell your dad about this.

432
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,220
He might have a heart attack if he knew it.

433
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:09,700
No matter what, I’m going to get engaged to you since our parents already approved of it.

434

No. No way.

00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,980
Personal? Well, my friend also has personal matters to take care of.

What? I have nothing to hide.

456

What is Pheem to you?

462
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,980
Seeing that you already knew where to find me,

463
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,220
I’m sure you’ve also looked into other details. Why on earth would you ask?

464
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:14,620
I saw a red mark on Pheem’s neck. Did you do that to her?

465
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,940
Hey!

466
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:28,460
So? Did you leave that red mark on her neck?

467
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,420
What kind of answer do you want to hear?

468
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,500
The truth. I want the truth.

469
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,580
If you want the truth, then the answer is yes.

470
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,620
Do you have any idea how Pheem’s life has gone terrible…

471
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,340
since when she started seeing you?

472
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:56,500
How could us loving and dating each other make her life terrible?

473
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,860
Of course, it could.

474
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,700
She’s never been like this before. She used to be a good girl and always listen to her dad.

475
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:10,540
But now she’s behaving like a spoiled brat. Like a bitch, ever heard of that?

476
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:15,620
She lies about everything just so that she could see you. Isn’t that terrible?

477
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,820
What exactly do you want?

478
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,020
I want you to know the truth.

479
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,860
To know what Pheem has to go through these days.

480
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:28,100
She was grounded. Her phone got confiscated. All because of you!

481
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:35,340
Oh, and actually, she should’ve gone to study in the UK as her dad had planned for her.

482
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,620
But in the end, she didn’t go. Because of whom?

483
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:43,540
I guess it’s you again that made her lose this great opportunity in life.

484
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:49,060
What’s so different if she studies here? Why do you people keep bossing her around?

485
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,260
Oh fuck! Oh my god!

486
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:58,420
Okay, let me tell you this. It’s totally different.

487
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:02,540
If Pheem is going to take over from her dad as a president of a mega company,

488
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:06,060
what’s written in her profile would be so bloody important. Understand?

489
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,580
And you know what? If other shareholders find out that…

490
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,660
Fuck! God damn it!

491
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,020
Who did that?

492
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:23,420
Oops, sorry. I don’t know where I should dump this water after washing my socks in it.

493
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,380
It looks quite dirty around here, so I decided to dump it here.

494
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,780
Just you wait, Bitch.

495
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,140
Sure, I’ll be waiting.

496
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:40,500
You too. If you don’t want her life to get any more worse, just leave her alone!

I’m fine. But are you okay though? Dumping dirty water on him like that. Poor him somehow.

00:48:02,406 --> 00:48:04,326
I allowed you to study here…

531
00:48:05,126 --> 00:48:09,126
but all you do is fooling around and ignoring your studies.

532
00:48:09,766 --> 00:48:11,286
I can’t let it go on like this.

533
00:48:14,206 --> 00:48:15,446
What are you going to do?

534
00:48:16,206 --> 00:48:19,966
I’ve been thinking. I’m going to send you to England.

535
00:48:20,006 --> 00:48:22,166
So that you’ll stop your nonsense behaviours.

536
00:48:22,406 --> 00:48:23,246
I’m not going.

537
00:48:23,766 --> 00:48:24,566
You have to.

538
00:48:25,566 --> 00:48:26,766
Calm down, Pheem.

539
00:48:27,606 --> 00:48:33,206
But dad, I don’t want to go. I promise I’ll never lie to you again.

540
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:36,846
I’ll study hard and choose any field you want me to study.

541
00:48:37,006 --> 00:48:41,206
But please don’t send me England. I want to stay here.

542
00:48:43,366 --> 00:48:44,806
Then you have to get engaged to Poon.

543
00:48:44,926 --> 00:48:48,606
But I don’t like him. Why should I get engaged to him?

544
00:48:50,086 --> 00:48:53,326
Because he can support you in the future.

545
00:48:53,846 --> 00:48:59,006
With Poon by your side, I won’t have to worry about who’d be helping you at the company.

546
00:49:00,286 --> 00:49:04,646
No. I can take care of your company despite graduating from Thailand.

547
00:49:05,326 --> 00:49:10,806
But it’s not enough. You have to choose between going to England…

548
00:49:10,806 --> 00:49:16,006
or get engaged to Poon, so that I can rest assured someone will support you at work.

549
00:49:17,966 --> 00:49:21,126
Why do you have to dictate my life and control what I would do?

550
00:49:21,606 --> 00:49:23,006
I don’t want to do it!

551
00:49:24,566 --> 00:49:28,166
Then, don’t call me dad!

552
00:49:29,326 --> 00:49:33,926
Whoever lives here must follow my rules!

553
00:49:34,126 --> 00:49:36,766
Fine! If that’s what you want.

554
00:49:37,126 --> 00:49:41,006
I’ll get out of here. I don’t want to live here anymore!

555
00:49:41,246 --> 00:49:46,726
This place is like a prison for me. I’ve never had a life of my own!

556
00:49:47,886 --> 00:49:48,566
Pheem!

557
00:49:48,566 --> 00:49:50,846
Why are you talking back to me like this?!

558
00:49:50,846 --> 00:49:54,486
Uncle! Uncle!

559
00:49:56,246 --> 00:49:57,446
- Dad!
- Uncle!

560
00:49:58,206 --> 00:49:59,006
Dad!

561
00:49:59,206 --> 00:50:01,966
- Dad! What’s wrong?
- Call the ambulance!

562
00:50:02,006 --> 00:50:03,206
Uncle.

563
00:50:03,926 --> 00:50:05,366
Dad.

564
00:50:12,086 --> 00:50:16,286
Mr. Poj is experiencing symptoms caused by heart arrhythmia…

565
00:50:16,286 --> 00:50:19,406
which is aroused or triggered by chronic stress.

566
00:50:20,646 --> 00:50:22,086
Just a stress?

567
00:50:22,326 --> 00:50:28,806
Yes. When people are stressed, they’d release a substance to arouse the heart,

568
00:50:29,366 --> 00:50:31,686
making it beating too fast or too slow.

569
00:50:32,046 --> 00:50:34,566
Sometimes, it causes the patient to pass out.

570
00:50:34,566 --> 00:50:37,126
Or even cause a heart attack.

571
00:50:45,406 --> 00:50:47,406
Will he be able to recover from this disease?

572
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:50,166
Try to avoid getting stressed out.

573
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:55,166
Take the pills regularly, and his health should be back to normal.

574
00:51:00,246 --> 00:51:01,046
Thank you.

575
00:51:01,206 --> 00:51:04,166
My pleasure. Please excuse me then.

576
00:51:29,726 --> 00:51:34,726
Do you know how Pheem’s life has gone so terrible since she started seeing you?

577
00:51:36,286 --> 00:51:40,726
She’s never been like this before. She used to be a good girl and always listen to her dad.

578
00:51:41,086 --> 00:51:43,326
But now she’s behaving like a spoiled brat.

579
00:51:44,086 --> 00:51:46,326
She lies about everything just so that she could see you.

580
00:51:46,606 --> 00:51:49,006
Isn’t that terrible?

581
00:51:49,686 --> 00:51:58,206
[Phone buzzing]

582
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:03,686
[Pheem’s calling]

583
00:52:08,326 --> 00:52:11,846
Hi, babe. Do you miss me?

584
00:52:12,006 --> 00:52:18,926
Of course. That’s why I called. We hardly see each other lately.

585
00:52:20,726 --> 00:52:24,206
Actually, she should’ve gone to study in the UK as her dad had planned for her.

586
00:52:24,646 --> 00:52:27,726
But in the end, she didn’t go. Because of whom?

587
00:52:27,886 --> 00:52:32,366
I guess it’s you again that made her lose this great opportunity in life.

588
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:35,286
I don’t want to go to England. I want to stay here!

589
00:52:35,406 --> 00:52:36,686
Then you have to get engaged to Poon.

590
00:52:36,966 --> 00:52:40,726
But I don’t like him. Why do I have to get engaged to him?

591
00:52:42,846 --> 00:52:44,486
- Pheem…
- Kie…

592
00:52:49,486 --> 00:52:51,206
Go ahead, say it first.

593
00:52:52,926 --> 00:52:55,846
It’s okay, you go first.

594
00:52:57,686 --> 00:53:03,046
Well…my dad wants me…

595
00:53:05,046 --> 00:53:14,766
He wants me take extra classes in English. I’m so fed up. What were you going to say?

596
00:53:17,686 --> 00:53:23,726
I want to ask you if I can go to the volunteer camp with my faculty.

597
00:53:25,246 --> 00:53:29,086
If so, we might not see each other for a few more days.

598
00:53:31,566 --> 00:53:32,766
You should go.

599
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:38,726
My dad is sick right now. I have to look after him.

600
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,126
I don’t think I’ll have time to see you these days.

601
00:53:44,446 --> 00:53:45,846
I’m so sorry, babe.

602
00:53:46,606 --> 00:53:49,246
Don’t worry. Please take care too.

603
00:53:50,726 --> 00:53:51,966
I’ll see you then.

604
00:53:52,286 --> 00:53:53,886
Kie, wait.

605
00:53:59,566 --> 00:54:00,846
I love you.

606
00:54:16,206 --> 00:54:18,726
Okay, move it.

607
00:54:18,726 --> 00:54:19,726
This way!

608
00:54:20,286 --> 00:54:21,686
It’s okay. Leave it to me, Pock.

609
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:24,206
Geez, Pai is so annoying!

610
00:54:25,726 --> 00:54:28,166
Don’t forget the boxes.

611
00:54:29,926 --> 00:54:33,046
Pock, is Kie okay?

612
00:54:34,366 --> 00:54:40,406

Thank you.

637
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:51,486
So that you won’t be complaining later that your senior buddy is not taking care of you.

638
00:56:52,286 --> 00:56:54,046
I wouldn’t dare complain about you.

639
00:56:54,926 --> 00:56:56,486
How is it going so far? Tired?

640
00:56:57,526 --> 00:57:04,526
Yes, but it’s fun. Thank you for letting me join this volunteer camp.

641
00:57:05,646 --> 00:57:09,926
Does this mean you’ll also join us next year?

642
00:57:10,606 --> 00:57:11,526
Sure.

643
00:57:12,926 --> 00:57:17,606
Actually, I first thought painting wouldn’t be that hard.

644
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:21,686
But after a while, my arms are limping now.

645
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:27,166
That’s because you’re a newbie. Look, you’ve got paint all over you.

646
00:57:28,766 --> 00:57:34,726
Yeah. This type of paint is so hard to wash off.

647
00:57:35,846 --> 00:57:39,886
It’ll probably take quite a long time.

648
00:57:40,526 --> 00:57:42,446
Just like our feelings, huh?

649
00:57:43,046 --> 00:57:47,006
No matter how hard you try to erase or forget it, you still can’t.

650
00:57:49,606 --> 00:57:53,366
Do you have something bad you want to erase?

651
00:57:54,606 --> 00:58:00,606
Not really a bad thing. It’s rather a good thing that shouldn’t happen.

652
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:11,166
Then, why do you want to erase it? You can just keep it.

653
00:58:12,646 --> 00:58:17,966
Like these paints on my hands. Suppose I can’t wash them off,

654
00:58:18,846 --> 00:58:25,246
I’ll just keep it like that. Think of it as a souvenir to remind me that I once came here.

655
00:58:27,526 --> 00:58:28,606
Maybe you’re right.

656
00:58:31,846 --> 00:58:35,366
I don’t know what it is that seems to worry you now,

657
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:40,366
but a strong girl like you will surely get through it. Right?

658
00:58:41,646 --> 00:58:44,886
Keep only the good things as a remembrance.

659
00:58:45,806 --> 00:58:48,046
Just like what you said.

660
00:58:53,006 --> 00:58:54,286
Yes, Tar.

661
00:59:47,806 --> 00:59:48,966
Thank you.

662
00:59:53,726 --> 00:59:59,726
It’s my fault. He’s sick because of me.

663
01:00:00,846 --> 01:00:03,966
Come on, don’t blame yourself.

664
01:00:04,246 --> 01:00:08,766
Your dad is stressed out from working too hard, not because of you.

665
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:14,606
But I’m still the cause somehow.

666
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:20,206
About the choices he asked you to choose earlier,

667
01:00:22,806 --> 01:00:29,206
I know you don’t want to choose either way. But no matter what your decision is,

668
01:00:30,366 --> 01:00:33,006
I’m always here to support you.

669
01:00:39,406 --> 01:00:40,526
Thank you.

670
01:00:44,966 --> 01:00:46,766
I guess I’ll have to choose one way or another.

671
01:00:48,166 --> 01:00:51,606
Seeing him like this, I don’t want to do anything to upset him.

672
01:00:53,846 --> 01:00:56,926
I have to go back to England next month.

673
01:00:58,086 --> 01:01:00,366
I can’t help worrying about you and your dad.

674
01:01:05,406 --> 01:01:07,126
- Prae.
- Yes?

675
01:01:09,486 --> 01:01:11,566
Should I just get engaged?

676
01:01:14,366 --> 01:01:20,086
So that my dad wouldn’t be worried, and so that I can still be with Kie.

677
01:01:20,606 --> 01:01:25,646
Be with the person I love, and don’t have to go abroad.

678
01:01:27,046 --> 01:01:29,086
And get to take care of him too.
