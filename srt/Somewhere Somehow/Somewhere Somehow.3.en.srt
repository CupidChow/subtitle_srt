[Previously]
Kie, can you please stop chasing me away?

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,080
From now on, I’ll wait for you and walk home with you every day.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,000
Happy Birthday, Kie.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,600
named him ‘MooYong’.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,800
When I go to England,

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,520
you can hug him and think of me when you’re in bed.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,080
Are you going to England again?

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,920
You look like someone who has a broken heart.

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,720
Kie!

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,320
it’s really her.

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,040
My dad wants me to go to the university in England.

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,920
How about this? I’ll be your tutor.

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,800
And we can go to the university here together.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,080
You two already went on a date but you’re still not together?

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,360
Fine! I’m going to confess to her on our graduation day!

16
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,480
Fabulous!

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,640
Teacher : And this is where we’ll have our graduation ceremony.

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,080
Please go to your room…

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,480
according to list I told you.

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,640
Check your room no.…

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,880
and go straight to your room. Let’s go.

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,400
Watch your steps too.

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,880
Make sure you don’t forget anything.

24
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,920
Are you guys taking a selfie?

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,200
What’s wrong?

26
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,960
It’s so not my day today.

27
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,880
How?

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,280
During those three hours on the bus,

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,160
that brat Toy just got himself glued next to Pheem.

30
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,120
I had to go sit at the back.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,200
Not to mention Pheem’s friends.

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,680
They’re surrounding her like a mother snake protecting its eggs.

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,120
Yeah, you’re right.

34
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,800
But then I kind of understand why they’re like that.

35
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,600
Did you see when that boy from class 2 got on to our bus?

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,760
He kept staring at Pheem and trying to hit on her.

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,160
What’s even worse…

38
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,000
is that I don’t get to stay in the same cabin with Pheem.

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,040
Hey, calm down.

40
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,280
You’ll definitely win over her heart at this graduation camp, trust me.

41
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,560
Sure?

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,400
Yeah, I’ve got a plan for you.

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,960
Let’s go to our room first.

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,040

56
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,720
- Pock.
- What?

57
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,520
Do I really have to jump?

58
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,320
I’m scared.

59
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,840
Don’t worry. Confessing to her up there is so romantic, trust me.

60
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,520
Really?

61
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,080
Yeah.

62
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,840
Really?

63
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,600
Yes!

64
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,920
I want to play that one!

65
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,960
Okay.

66
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
I’m not scared anymore. I’ll do it!

67
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,040
Good! Let’s go!

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,400
Pock.

69
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,040
What?

70
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,280
I can’t see when I can get to talk to Pheem.

71
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,560
Listen, once Pheem comes up here,

72
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,440
I’ll find a chance for you to confess to her.

73
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,400
Okay?

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,520
Next one please.

75
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,880
Go on.

Whoa!! Pock!

Kie!

80
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,920
Shit! She’s going to kill me!

Let’s keep going.

113
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,960
Are you ready?

114
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,040
Yes!

115
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,640
If you’re ready, may I ask Group 2 to come up and dance?

♫Row your boat to buy a drum, row your boat to buy a drum♫

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,160
♫Can Group 2 come up and move your bums? ♫

122
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,640
Only two of you?

123
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,760
Where are you friends?

124
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,920
Well, they…

125
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,360
They went to the loo, Teacher.

126
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Can you two do it then

127
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,480
Sure!

128
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,880
Wow, that’s the spirit. Bring it on then!

129
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,120
Do what?

130
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,040
Now is your chance. Do your best, buddy.

131
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,880
Ahem!

132
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,600
Hi, guys.

133
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,400
I think this graduation camp…

134
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,560
is probably the last camp we all will get to have fun together.

135
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,480
That’s why…

136
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,000
Kie has something to tell you guys.

137
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,400
Well, time flies, right?

138
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,680
In the blink of an eye, we’re now graduating.

139
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,840
We’ve been together for years.

140
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,840
We played together…and studied for exams together.

141
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,760
We even got punished together. I really enjoyed all those time we spent together.

142
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,560
Thank you for coming into my life…and making me happy.

143
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,240
You make me want to come to school every day.

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,280
Friend: I never know we were the reason she wanted to come to school that much.

145
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,480
You’re exaggerating.

146
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,400
I…I don’t know if we’ll still see each other every day like this.

147
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,560
So, I’d like to take this opportunity…

148
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,080
to tell you my feelings that I’ve been harbouring for so long.

149
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,480
That…

150
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,880
That…

151
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,720
Say it!

152
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,280
Say it! Say it! Say it!

153
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,320
Say it! Quickly! Just say it!

154
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,720
Say it! Say it! Say it!

155
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,680
Say it! Say it! Say it!

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,400
I love Pheem!

157
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,040
Kie: I’ve loved you for a long time.

158
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,240
I love Pheem!

159
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,240
I love Pheem!

160
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,600
Excuse me!

161
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,480
Excuse me!!!

162
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,560
Bew, go tell him.

163
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,720
What were you saying earlier?

164
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,840
I’m done.

165
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,360
Let’s hear it for Group 2, everyone!

166
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,920
I guess it’s not my day today.

167
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,880
It’s all right. I have a backup plan.

168
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,440
Just wait until tonight when everyone is already asleep.

169
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,600
Only you and Pheem alone with no one else.

170
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,560
Trust me, this will work.

171
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,720
It’d better be.

172
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,400
Yeah.

173
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,200
Pock: Quickly, go!

174
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,000
Quickly, Kie!

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,160
Geez, what the heck?

176
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,760
Hurry up, it’s important!

177
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,960
What is it?

178
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,720
Just follow me.

179
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,720
Oh, wait.

180
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,320

You kept looking at me.

I was just enjoying the song. I only think of you as a friend.

201

202
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,120
It was as a friend.

203

359
00:22:11,423 --> 00:22:12,503
Bye Bye!

360
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,983
Geez, you’re bloody popular.

361
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:25,943
So what? There’s only one person I’m interested in.

362
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,743
But you still haven’t told her though.

363
00:22:30,703 --> 00:22:33,903
So? We’ll go to the same university anyway.

364
00:22:34,663 --> 00:22:36,743
Plenty of chances there.

365
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:37,623
Really?

366
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:39,743
Kie.

367
00:22:42,703 --> 00:22:45,583
Where’s that confident girl earlier?

368
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,263
Hey, let me sign it for you.

369
00:23:02,263 --> 00:23:04,143
Can you write something for me too?

370
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:24,903
Wow, are you writing a farewell message or speech?

371
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,543
It’s tickling.

372
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:32,583
Once you’re home,

373
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:33,823
you’ll know what I wrote.

374
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:38,063
Done.

375
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,503
Let me write a message for you too.

376
00:23:43,503 --> 00:23:44,303
Sure.

377
00:24:20,343 --> 00:24:21,303
It’s done.

378
00:24:23,543 --> 00:24:25,543
Bye Bye high school life, Kiran.

379
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:28,663
See you at the university.

380
00:24:30,183 --> 00:24:33,343
So…do you have anything to tell me?

381
00:24:35,263 --> 00:24:36,343
Well, Pheem

382
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,063
Well, Pheem…I…

383
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:40,543
I…

384
00:24:40,543 --> 00:24:41,623
Pheem.

385
00:24:52,183 --> 00:24:53,503
what did she write?

386
00:24:53,903 --> 00:24:55,183
There’s a heart too.

387
00:24:55,343 --> 00:24:56,183
Let me see.

388
00:24:58,743 --> 00:25:03,183
Kie, I don’t think you have to confess to her anymore.

389
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:04,703
Why?

390
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:09,623
You’ll know when you get back home.

391
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,143
It’s the best!

392
00:25:33,543 --> 00:25:36,543
After graduation, I still hadn't told her how I feel.

393
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:40,983
During school holidays,
we were both busy preparing to get into the university

394
00:25:41,463 --> 00:25:44,383
I met her again at the welcome ceremony for freshmen.

395
00:25:49,503 --> 00:25:52,983
Kie, Kiran Pipittayaphongsa from Engineering!

396
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:56,383
KiKie!

397
00:25:57,143 --> 00:26:00,863
Cheering squad: No, over here.

398
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,183
Cheering squad: If you drop it, you have to start from the beginning.

399
00:26:05,343 --> 00:26:06,383
Quick, quick!

400
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:10,983
Hello, I’m Pheem Pheemanas from Economics.

401
00:26:11,943 --> 00:26:14,303
Female spiders, sit down!

402
00:26:15,543 --> 00:26:18,343
Next, male spiders, sit down!

403
00:26:22,503 --> 00:26:24,463
Are you ready, spiders?

404
00:26:24,463 --> 00:26:25,263
Are you ready?

405
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:26,903
3 4..Go!

406
00:26:26,943 --> 00:26:31,903
♫Itsy bitsy spider, climbing up one after another♫

407
00:26:38,903 --> 00:26:40,783
Hello, everyone.

408
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:43,943
I’m Pock Paradee from Engineering.

409
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:46,503
Engineering! Engineering! Engineering!

410
00:26:48,183 --> 00:26:51,943
That’s awesome! So awesome, Pock!

411
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,943
That’s awesome!

412
00:27:02,383 --> 00:27:04,543
Cheering squad: Keep going, guys!

413
00:27:05,263 --> 00:27:07,343
Cheering squad: Hey, Pock!

414
00:27:13,503 --> 00:27:14,103

415
00:27:14,183 --> 00:27:14,783

418

419
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,863
Cheering squad: Cheering for Freshmen, 3 4!

420
00:27:22,863 --> 00:27:25,423
Wheeee…Boom!

421
00:27:25,463 --> 00:27:27,743
Cheering squad: Next, we’ll give you a tribute by faculty.

422
00:27:27,743 --> 00:27:30,543
Cheering squad: All right, split up!

423
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:34,063
See you, Pheem.

424
00:27:36,703 --> 00:27:37,943
Bye Bye!

425
00:27:38,183 --> 00:27:40,183
Let’s go eat.

426
00:27:48,343 --> 00:27:49,503
Engineering, are you ready?

427
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:50,343
Yes!

428
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:51,623
Are you ready?

429
00:27:51,623 --> 00:27:52,343
Yes!

430
00:27:52,663 --> 00:27:53,823
Are you ready?

431
00:27:53,823 --> 00:27:54,303
Yes!

432
00:27:54,303 --> 00:27:55,703
3 4!

433
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:02,183
Engineer, Engineer, Engineer…Hey!

434
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,823
Engineer is cute. Are you ready?

435
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:05,943
Yes!

436
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:07,943
3 4!

437
00:28:08,263 --> 00:28:11,783
♫Wanna be in love, Engineer Engineer♫

438
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:15,263
♫So cute, Engineer Engineer♫

439
00:28:15,263 --> 00:28:18,543
♫But never find that one, Engineer Engineer♫

440
00:28:18,543 --> 00:28:21,783
♫Who’s dreaming about me, Engineer Engineer♫

441
00:28:21,943 --> 00:28:25,063
♫Engineer is cute, Engineer Engineer♫

442

443
00:28:28,263 --> 00:28:31,423
♫Someone who really loves me, Engineer Engineer♫

444
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:34,223
♫Please give me just one night♫

445
00:28:34,903 --> 00:28:39,023
Hey! Is that all you can do?

446
00:28:39,743 --> 00:28:41,703
This is our faculty song.

447
00:28:41,943 --> 00:28:44,503
If you can’t sing it, you don’t deserve to be an engineer student.

448
00:28:44,783 --> 00:28:47,103
Or receive an engineer gear (symbolic token) from our faculty too!

449
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:53,783
Then I don’t want it. I don’t know what I’ll do with it.

450
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:54,783
It’s just…

451
00:28:55,983 --> 00:28:56,743
What’s your name?

452
00:28:56,743 --> 00:28:57,503
Yeah, what’s your name?

453
00:28:59,703 --> 00:29:01,303
Oh, here.

454
00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:02,463
Pock!

455
00:29:03,663 --> 00:29:05,303
Answer the question!

456
00:29:05,903 --> 00:29:06,943
I’m Pock!

457
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:07,663
What’s your name?

458
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,143
Pock!

459
00:29:08,263 --> 00:29:08,863
Again!

460
00:29:08,863 --> 00:29:09,263
Pock!

461
00:29:09,343 --> 00:29:09,903
Again!

462
00:29:09,903 --> 00:29:10,303
Pock!

463
00:29:10,343 --> 00:29:10,863
Again!

464
00:29:10,863 --> 00:29:11,583
Pock!

465
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,703
Okay, good! Let’s go.

466
00:29:12,943 --> 00:29:13,943
Pock.

467
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:19,743
An engineer gear is a symbol for our engineering faculty.

468
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:24,903
If we give it to someone that we like, they will like us back.

469
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:28,823
If you bring it into the exam room, you’ll pass all the tests.

470
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,663
Then I’ll have it. If its benefits are that universal…

471
00:29:33,663 --> 00:29:34,463
I’ll have it!

472
00:29:34,863 --> 00:29:35,583
Good!

473
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:37,823
That’s good but…

474
00:29:38,183 --> 00:29:43,903
in order to get it, you must show up every time for each activity.

475
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:49,063
Then everyone will vote to decide if you really deserve to have it.

476
00:29:49,543 --> 00:29:50,423
Understand?

477
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,143
Yes!

478
00:29:52,783 --> 00:29:55,303
Good. Let’s continue singing.

479
00:29:55,343 --> 00:29:56,223
Tar.

480
00:29:57,183 --> 00:29:58,703
Do your best, everyone.

481
00:29:58,743 --> 00:30:00,663
Engineer is cute. Are you ready?

482
00:30:00,663 --> 00:30:01,423
Yes!

483
00:30:01,463 --> 00:30:02,903

Huh?

494
00:30:33,343 --> 00:30:34,023
come here.

495
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:35,103
come here.

496
00:30:35,103 --> 00:30:35,983
What?

497
00:30:35,983 --> 00:30:36,943
Do this.

498
00:30:41,263 --> 00:30:42,703
Are you tired?

499
00:30:42,903 --> 00:30:44,503
Drink some water first.

500
00:30:45,943 --> 00:30:46,743
Thank you.

501
00:30:47,383 --> 00:30:48,583
I’m Tar.

502
00:30:48,703 --> 00:30:51,903
If you have any problems, you can come and talk to me anytime.

503
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,983
Thank you, Tar.

504
00:30:57,143 --> 00:30:59,543
Can I ask you something? Ken, Pai, Come here.

505
00:31:00,143 --> 00:31:02,823
It’s raining. Where should we move them for practice?

506
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,943
Tar is cool, isn’t she?

507
00:31:08,943 --> 00:31:10,863
Yeah, so cool.

508
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:15,783
What did she say to you though? I smell something fishy.

509
00:31:16,863 --> 00:31:19,103
What do you mean? She just gave me water.

510
00:31:19,383 --> 00:31:22,583
I probably look so bashed up she felt pity for me.

511
00:31:22,943 --> 00:31:25,743
Really? I was doing a sumo squat back there…

512
00:31:25,903 --> 00:31:27,623
but didn’t get any water at all.

513
00:31:30,343 --> 00:31:31,743
What a charming girl you are.

514
00:31:32,343 --> 00:31:34,903
Be careful. Pheem might get jealous.

515
00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:37,103
There’s nothing though.

516
00:31:37,303 --> 00:31:38,543
Give it to me.

517
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:39,983
I’m thirsty!

518
00:31:40,103 --> 00:31:40,943
I haven’t had it yet.

519
00:31:41,463 --> 00:31:42,183
Give it.

520
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:44,863
Just go and ask her to give you another one.

521
00:31:44,943 --> 00:31:46,263
She gave it to me personally.

522
00:31:46,343 --> 00:31:47,783
- Give it.
- Go get it from her.

523
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:48,583
Why don’t you go then?

524
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:49,303
Why don’t you?

525
00:31:49,303 --> 00:31:50,103
Why don’t you?

526
00:31:50,143 --> 00:31:50,943
You do it!

527
00:31:51,663 --> 00:31:53,343
-Kie!
- Let me have it first.

528
00:31:53,543 --> 00:31:54,463
But I’m thirsty!

529
00:31:54,743 --> 00:31:56,463
Fine, take it.

530
00:32:04,903 --> 00:32:06,983
Do you know where economics faculty is?

531
00:32:06,983 --> 00:32:08,263
Can you take me to see Pheem?

532
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:09,463
Let’s go.

533
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:15,623
Who’s that?

534
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:25,263
Kie.

535
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:31,303
Kie and I are on our way to see you at your faculty.

536
00:32:31,903 --> 00:32:35,183
Do you drive now, Pheem?

537
00:32:35,383 --> 00:32:38,623
My dad won’t let me stay at the dorm.

538
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:40,743
So, I asked him if I can drive here instead.

539
00:32:42,703 --> 00:32:46,143
Do you guys want to go eat something? Let me drive you there.

540
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:48,063
Are you sure it’s safe?

541
00:32:49,183 --> 00:32:52,623
Of course. Let’s go.

542
00:32:53,143 --> 00:32:54,303
Okay, let’s go.

543
00:32:59,303 --> 00:33:00,263
Pock: I’ll pick the seat first.

544
00:33:07,503 --> 00:33:08,423
Thank you.

545
00:33:12,143 --> 00:33:12,943
Thank you.

546
00:33:16,343 --> 00:33:17,023
What?

547
00:33:17,503 --> 00:33:18,623
Never mind, I can get it myself.

548
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:20,143
Thank you!

549
00:33:27,543 --> 00:33:31,623
Kie, are you going to eat your hair too?

550
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,543
Come, let me help.

551
00:33:56,143 --> 00:34:00,423
Pock! Do you want to die adding so much fish sauce like that?

552
00:34:02,303 --> 00:34:07,223
My kidneys are fine. But I’m having diabetes right now.

553
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:12,583
Oh, you have diabetes?

554
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:15,383
Yes, now my level of sugar…

555
00:34:15,383 --> 00:34:18,343
is so high it almost reaches my eyes and my brain.

556
00:34:18,343 --> 00:34:20,263
Any more sweetness and I’ll have cut off my leg.

557
00:34:20,263 --> 00:34:21,943
So sweet!

558
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:23,503
You’re good at teasing.

559
00:34:23,943 --> 00:34:25,303
But it’s true.

560
00:34:26,543 --> 00:34:31,703
By the way, are you and Pock staying at the same dorm?

561
00:34:32,143 --> 00:34:34,583
Yeah…but not the same room though.

562
00:34:35,183 --> 00:34:39,423
That’s good. I want to stay at the same dorm with you too.

563
00:34:40,063 --> 00:34:44,383
So that we can meet more often. We might be going to the same university,

564
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,303
but we hardly met.

565
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,943
I also have to go practise cheerleading this evening.

566
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:53,903
Are you a cheerleader?

567
00:34:54,703 --> 00:34:58,703
Of course she is. She’s so pretty.

568
00:34:58,903 --> 00:35:02,023
Even I once got asked if I wanted to be a cheerleader…because I’m pretty.

569
00:35:03,343 --> 00:35:04,663
Bragging.

570
00:35:07,503 --> 00:35:11,703
Why don’t you and Pock come and watch me practising then?

571
00:35:11,703 --> 00:35:13,943
I’ll drop you two off at the dorm after that.

572
00:35:15,063 --> 00:35:20,383
We can grab something on the way and go to Kie’s room to celebrate our freshman year.

573
00:35:20,943 --> 00:35:22,503
Okay, let’s do that.

574
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:33,383
Thank you.

575
00:35:34,543 --> 00:35:35,543

Ready, 3 4!

580
00:35:47,543 --> 00:35:49,303
I can also do it as good as her.

581
00:35:49,463 --> 00:35:50,863
Why didn’t you look at me like that too?

582
00:35:51,703 --> 00:35:54,703
I can’t. I only have eyes for her.

583
00:35:56,903 --> 00:36:00,903
Now that the welcome ceremony is done…and you already have the faculty gear,

584
00:36:00,903 --> 00:36:03,783
are you going to keep it or give it to Pheem?

585
00:36:04,743 --> 00:36:05,903
I’ll give it to her.

586
00:36:06,263 --> 00:36:08,383
What are you waiting for then?

587
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:11,183
Look there. Someone else might give it to her first.

588
00:36:11,183 --> 00:36:15,463
Don’t you see how hot and sexy she is?

589
00:36:15,983 --> 00:36:17,703
Look over there.

590
00:36:17,983 --> 00:36:21,943
Those guys are staring and ogling at her.

591
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:23,183
They’re looking at her like…

592
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,143
a tiger looking at its prey.

593
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:28,823
Not to mention our senior, Boat, from the sophomore year.

594
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:31,903
He’s been trying to hit on Pheem since our first day at the uni.

595
00:36:31,903 --> 00:36:35,903
He’s handsome, rich, generous, kind, and lives in Bangkok

596
00:36:36,383 --> 00:36:37,543
Many girls are going after him.

597
00:36:37,783 --> 00:36:40,383
Pock! I can’t stand it anymore.

598
00:36:40,423 --> 00:36:41,383
-Where are you going?
-Let's go.

599
00:36:41,423 --> 00:36:42,743
Hey, where are you going?

600
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:44,703
What about our dinner with Pheem?

601
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,383
Later then. I have more important things to do.

602
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,143

Wait.

613
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:59,635
It’s a love confession, why the hell would you make a flow chart?

614
00:38:00,075 --> 00:38:02,155
A love confession is an art.

615
00:38:02,635 --> 00:38:04,075
What do you want me to do then?

616
00:38:07,115 --> 00:38:10,475
Let’s start from this…

617
00:38:10,475 --> 00:38:11,995
PLACE.

618
00:38:12,675 --> 00:38:15,875
It should be a place that helps create moments…

619
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:18,515
and sentimental feelings.

620
00:38:18,515 --> 00:38:23,075
Think of a place that would make Pheem impressed.

621
00:38:23,075 --> 00:38:24,875
Think hard. Think!

622
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:28,635
Give me your best. The most dazzling and fabulous one.

623
00:38:28,635 --> 00:38:29,915
Just imagine if you were Pheem.

624
00:38:29,915 --> 00:38:32,235
She’ll be so impressed until her last breath. Think about it.

625
00:38:33,675 --> 00:38:34,155
The sea.

626
00:38:34,155 --> 00:38:35,155
Should I take her to the sea?

627
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,435
Sea?

628
00:38:38,915 --> 00:38:40,875
Well, that’s nice.

629
00:38:41,675 --> 00:38:43,715
The mood would be quite romantic.

630
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,195
But…

631
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:51,235
It’s too far. Think of somewhere around here.

632
00:38:51,235 --> 00:38:54,995
If you’re going to take that long to confess, someone else might just do it first.

633
00:38:54,995 --> 00:38:58,075
Let’s start over. It should be close by and have a good atmosphere.

634
00:38:58,075 --> 00:39:04,115
Think, think! Come on, Kie.

635
00:39:04,115 --> 00:39:05,715
A nice place nearby.

636
00:39:10,155 --> 00:39:11,635
Our dorm’s rooftop!

637
00:39:11,635 --> 00:39:13,235
I used to go up there to observe stars.

638
00:39:13,235 --> 00:39:16,955
The atmosphere was nice, and the view was so romantic.

639
00:39:17,595 --> 00:39:21,235
Good, write that down. Our rooftop.

640
00:39:21,235 --> 00:39:25,035
The rooftop is actually a good choice.

641
00:39:25,355 --> 00:39:30,115
You can touch her…hug her…

642
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:32,235
And then…

643
00:39:34,635 --> 00:39:37,035
- Get you head out of the gutter.
- Kie!

644
00:39:39,995 --> 00:39:45,675
Then, look into my eyes and tell me you never think like that.

Because…

703
00:43:37,635 --> 00:43:40,195
I was surprised. I didn’t expect you’d come.

Come on, what are you hiding?

721
00:45:20,115 --> 00:45:21,835
Pheem, don’t!

722
00:45:21,835 --> 00:45:22,755
What is it?

723
00:45:22,755 --> 00:45:25,755
Oh, I’m sorry.

724
00:45:28,755 --> 00:45:31,355
I love you, Pheem. Only you. I’ve loved you for a long time.

725
00:45:31,355 --> 00:45:33,475
There are only a few people in this world that I care.

726
00:45:49,075 --> 00:45:50,675
Why can’t you let me finish reading it?

727
00:45:50,795 --> 00:45:52,275
You wrote that for me, didn’t you?

728
00:45:53,715 --> 00:45:56,515
Well, I…

729
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:01,035
Are you seeing anyone?

730
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,515
No, I’m not.

731
00:46:08,075 --> 00:46:11,395
But there’s this person I’m interested in.

732
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:13,435
She just hasn’t said anything yet.

733
00:46:14,475 --> 00:46:15,955
So, I can’t say it too.

734

Who is it?

735
00:46:24,355 --> 00:46:25,635
She’s right in front of me.

736
00:46:26,315 --> 00:46:28,075
I’m waiting for her to say it first.

737
00:46:34,675 --> 00:46:38,035
Well, I…

738
00:46:42,075 --> 00:46:45,755

740
00:46:55,795 --> 00:47:00,595
You don’t have to say it now. I’ve already been waiting to hear it for a long time.

741
00:47:00,955 --> 00:47:02,595
I’m leaving then.

742
00:47:06,955 --> 00:47:08,035
I love you, Pheem!

743
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:20,995

And you’re one of them.

Pheem, can you be my girlfriend?

If you agree, please keep this gear necklace.

750
00:47:58,515 --> 00:48:05,115
If not, just throw it away and I promise I won’t bother you again.

751
00:48:31,595 --> 00:48:36,195
If you dare take it back, I’ll kill you!

752
00:48:36,195 --> 00:48:40,595

So, it’s you who told Pheem I was in my room.

756
00:49:06,355 --> 00:49:10,355
Yes, it was me. I was the one who let her in.

757
00:49:10,635 --> 00:49:12,115
I knew it.

758
00:49:13,235 --> 00:49:18,715
Don’t change the subject. Did you finally do it with her?

759
00:49:19,555 --> 00:49:20,715
Are you crazy?

760
00:49:21,435 --> 00:49:23,235
Geez, you nitwit.

761
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:27,115
I went all the way to put you two in the same room.

Wait, don’t tell me…

763
00:49:29,795 --> 00:49:31,715
that you just let her go home without doing anything.

764

765
00:49:40,715 --> 00:49:41,515

00:49:41,515 --> 00:49:45,235

Come on, Sis.

You’re pulling so hard I’d lose all my hair soon. Please be gentler.

So? Tell me.

Let me go.

772
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:26,715
But I still want to hug you.

773
00:50:29,635 --> 00:50:35,435
Since we’re a couple now, can we do something else other than hugging?

774
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:38,755
What do you want to do?

775
00:50:41,355 --> 00:50:44,235
You’re taking advantage on me. I won’t let you.

776
00:50:50,995 --> 00:50:52,155
Stop it.

00:50:54,835 --> 00:50:57,755

Just do what a normal couple would do to each other.

00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:32,355
Something that’s worth the wait.

788
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:36,275
You should give her a combo set and make it worth the wait.

00:51:37,115 --> 00:51:37,995
What do you mean?

790
00:51:40,395 --> 00:51:43,315
Come here. Show me your nails.

791
00:51:46,595 --> 00:51:49,115
Excuse me, once you finish doing my manicure,

792
00:51:49,115 --> 00:51:50,755
can you also do it for my friend here?

793
00:51:50,755 --> 00:51:54,755
But make sure her nails will be as short as possible.

794
00:51:56,115 --> 00:51:57,675
Why do they have to be so short?

795
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:06,515
Because if your nails are long, they might cut into her…

00:57:58,896 --> 00:58:00,856
Whoa, what’s that?

901
00:58:01,136 --> 00:58:04,296
What are you going to do with those things?

902
00:58:04,616 --> 00:58:08,856
Here, they’re from your senior buddy.

903
00:58:09,176 --> 00:58:11,016
And a bunch of bananas too.

904
00:58:12,256 --> 00:58:13,656
Thank you.

905
00:58:14,096 --> 00:58:16,616
Wait. Let me take a picture for your buddy first.

906
00:58:16,616 --> 00:58:17,496
Okay.

907
00:58:17,496 --> 00:58:18,256
As proof.

908
00:58:18,256 --> 00:58:18,816
Sure.

910
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:20,816
Okay.

3 2 1…Trumpet!

912
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:30,656
This is for you, Kie. It’s from your senior buddy.

913
00:58:30,936 --> 00:58:33,496
There’s also a message – “Please look after yourself.”

914
00:58:33,496 --> 00:58:34,336
“Take care!”

915
00:58:35,096 --> 00:58:35,976
Thank you.

916
00:58:40,296 --> 00:58:45,176
So…do you guys have anything else?

917
00:58:45,176 --> 00:58:48,936
We have to go to our class now. I can’t wait to go to class!

918
00:58:48,936 --> 00:58:50,376
- I see.
- I love to study.

919
00:58:50,696 --> 00:58:53,456
Just one more thing. There’s a party to reveal your buddy this Friday.

920
00:58:54,736 --> 00:58:57,776
You know where it is, right? Don’t forget to show up.

921
00:58:58,336 --> 00:58:58,816
Yes.

922
00:59:01,816 --> 00:59:02,616
Yes.

- Take them.
- Okay.

924

See you.

925
00:59:06,816 --> 00:59:07,456

Well, let’s have some more. Aren’t you going to feed me?

930
00:59:23,856 --> 00:59:24,656
Do you want sugarcane?

931
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:26,736
No, thanks. Those are for you.

932
00:59:37,456 --> 00:59:39,336
So tired.

933
00:59:40,216 --> 00:59:41,456
Are you tired?

934
00:59:44,576 --> 00:59:47,696
Why don’t you get some rest first? Then we can go out to eat something.

935
00:59:49,056 --> 00:59:51,936
But I’m not hungry.

936
00:59:52,496 --> 00:59:55,416
I just want to cuddle you. Can we stay in?

937
00:59:56,816 --> 00:59:58,016
No, off you go.

938
01:00:01,656 --> 01:00:02,696
Hurry up and get some rest.

939
01:00:09,016 --> 01:00:12,536
Did you get snacks for me too? Thank you.

940
01:00:14,176 --> 01:00:17,536
Oh, that’s not for you. My senior buddy gave it to me.

I never know you read this kind of book too.

Not really. My senior buddy gave it to me.

Kaokie, Grandma will visit us this Sunday. Make sure you come home this weekend.

961
01:02:10,336 --> 01:02:13,576
Or else your grandma might make a scene. From Mum.

962

You’re off the hook this time.

963
01:02:21,096 --> 01:02:23,456
Well, there’s really nothing.

964
01:02:25,496 --> 01:02:29,096
But I never know your nickname is actually Kaokie.

965
01:02:29,096 --> 01:02:32,176
It’s cute. Sounds so Chinese.

966
01:02:33,296 --> 01:02:34,816
Grandma picked it for me.

967
01:02:34,816 --> 01:02:39,376
But only my family calls me like that. It’s quite hard to pronounce.

968
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:45,696
Can I have it back? I’m going to reply to my mum.

Miss you my junior buddy. From your senior buddy.

Who’s your senior buddy?

975
01:03:23,976 --> 01:03:27,216
I don’t know too. They’re not telling me.

976

It’s not time to reveal it yet.

I guess I have to. They will reveal our buddies.

01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:58,496
That’s right. Your senior also said that…

982
01:03:58,896 --> 01:04:02,616
your buddy is really pretty.

983
01:04:04,456 --> 01:04:07,056
No one can be as pretty as you, babe.

Of course not. Go ahead.

I just don’t want you to go though.

Then, I’m not going. I won’t go.
