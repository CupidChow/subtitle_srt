00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,320
[Previously]
Pheem is definitely flirting with you.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,960
I think it’s already nice the way it is.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,640
don’t want to lose a girlfriend, I mean, a friend.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,240
But you’ll get a girl instead. It’s worth it.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,440
Kie!

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,920
Get ready for a big gossip

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,640
Pheem and I are just friends. Is that clear?

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,520
You didn’t say anything wrong.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,200
But you were being too honest.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,160
The other day, Pheem was sulking and kept ignoring you.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,480
Now, you’re sulking and keep ignoring her.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,360
You’re really avoiding me.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,560
If you don’t want to walk home with me,

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,600
you can just be honest. I’ll stop waiting for you.

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,880
I thought you said it won’t be bitter anymore!

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,040
Here, your pancake rolls with sweet filling.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,920
Eat them.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,360
So that your life won’t be so bitter.

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,440
Come.

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,880
I’ll feed you.

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,960
I don’t want it.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,200
You know what?

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,040
It was like watching a horror movie back there.

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,600
I thought Pheem were going to slit your throat.

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,520
Yeah, I know.

26
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,280
If only she had a knife,

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,880
I would've been so dead.

28
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,680
You were so fast to ditch me…

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,120
and leave me with her alone.

30
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,640
But it wasn’t my business.

31
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,280
You two should clear it up between each other.

32
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,000
So…is everything all right?

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,480
Wait, judging from your look…

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,520
It’s obviously not.

35
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,680
But I think it is.

36
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,440
How?

37
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,160
I made it clear that I didn’t want to walk home with her.

38
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,120
What?!

39
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
Are you nuts?

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,960
How’s that all right?

41
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,280
Geez, Kie.

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,720
I really don’t know what to call you now.

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,640
Why are you trying to avoid her?

44
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,680
Wait, let me guess.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,720
You’re mad at her, aren’t you?

46
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,960
Because she said Toy is her type.

47
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,040
Right?

48
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,160
Am I right?

49
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,440
I am, aren’t I?

50
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,120
Geez, are you a miss know-it-all or what?

51
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,640
Well, you can trust me about this stuff.

52
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,160
And you know what? When Toy heard that,

53
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,120
he kept following her around like a dog.

54
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,440
He couldn’t keep his mouth shut and now the whole school knows it.

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,120
How wouldn’t I know then?

56
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,240
He might want to make it public.

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,360
Kie, it was just a silly talk with her friends.

58
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,320
You happened to be there and overheard it.

59
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,920
But she did said it, didn’t she?

60
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,960
But those were just words.

61
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,560
You used to tell me, remember?

62
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,840
That we can’t judge people only by what they say.

63
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,480
We have to look at their actions too.

64
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
Why?

65
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,520
Because people can just say whatever they want to.

66
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,720
But they can’t feel or do everything exactly as they said.

67
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,520
See?

68
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,120
Now that you’re experiencing it yourself,

69
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,080
how come you can’t remember it?

70
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,160
Also,

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,200
from what I’ve seen, Pheem has never paid any interest to Toy.

72
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,080
I think she even finds him annoying.

73
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,040
All I hear is, ‘Kie this, Kie that’.

74
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,920
Or ‘Pheem likes this or that’.

75
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,480
All her attention in on you!

76
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,600
Really?

77
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,240
Yes.

78
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,440
Who am I?

79
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,800
I’m the mother of Natasha (Romanov).

80
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,960
Also, it’s almost Christmas.

81
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,680
You should go apologize and make up with her. Trust me.

82
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,560
Pock: Just do it, please.]

83
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,240
Pock: So that we can enjoy Christmas together. She’s our friend anyway.

84
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,280
Even though there’s one person, which is obviously you,

85
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,720
who thinks of her more than just a friend.

86
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,920
Who said I think of her like that?

87
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,800
Geez, why are you so stubborn?

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,400
Let me see your lips.

89
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,440
Why is it so tight, huh?

90
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,280
Here, eat them up.

91
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,440
Eat!

92
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,400
อือ เออ!

[Somewhere Somehow]

104
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,840
All right everyone, I’m ready.

105
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,160
For Christmas party this year,

106
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,680
our class is responsible for two game booths.

107
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,040
They're a Dart game and Eggs Spooning game.

108
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,800
Let’s divide our responsibilities into 3 groups.

109
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
First team is responsible for preparing prizes.

110
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,400
Second team for preparing game tools and equipment.

111
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,560
And the last team for decorating the booth.

112
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,560
We have two game booths so there should be 6 teams.

113
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,240
Okay?

114
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,880
Let’s start teaming you up then.

115
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,200
So…Pock, Kie, and Pheem.

116
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,640
You can take care of the decoration for the Dart game booth.

117
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,480
Ping, can I switch team?

118
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,960
I’d rather take care of the prizes.

119
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,400
Uh, has someone already done it?

120
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:24,520
Hey, are we really at the point where if there’s you there won’t be Pheem?

121
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,320
Why, Pheem?

122
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,080
I just don’t feel like doing it.

123
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,320
Well then…

124
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,560
Ae

125
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Can you take of the decoration instead?

126
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,080
Well, I’m afraid I…I…

127
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,120
That’s all right. Never mind.

128
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Just forget I asked.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,200
Can you guys do it?

130
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,480
No!

131
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,360
Anyone wants to volunteer? What about those at the back?

132
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,680
It’s okay, Ping. Pock and I can handle it.

133
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,480
It’s not that hard.

134
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,600
Are you sure?

135
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,480
No!

136
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,760
She can’t wait to do it.

137
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,680
Come on, let’s go buy the materials.

138
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,360
Now.

139
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,640
[Ping: Good.]

140
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,200
Get up!

141
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,680
Okay.

142
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,280
That’s good.

143
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,080
[Ping: For the rest of you,]

144
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,320
[Ping: I’ll just assign you on a team then.]

145
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:33,160
[Ping: Let’s say…your gang can go find something to do.]

146
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,520
[Ping: I mean, find equipment for the game booth.]

147
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,400
Kie, what the heck was that? You should’ve asked me first.

148
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,520
What makes you think you and I alone would be able to do it?

149
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,600
What should I do then?

150
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,200
Pheem doesn’t want to work with me.

151
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,800
Why bother trying to hold her back?

152
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,360
So, who’s sulking now?

153
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,720
Isn’t it you who should be sulking?

154
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,920
Are you confused or what?

155
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,760
That’s enough. Shh!

156
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,480
Stop talking and let’s get to work.

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I think it’s fine now.

158
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,440
Let’s ask the others what they think.

159
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,880
The board is done.

160
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,360
All we need are the balloons and a sign.

161
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,160
Do you guys want to add anything?

162
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
No, right?

163
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,320
I think it’s good now,

164
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,120
[Ping: …but something is kind of missing, don’t you think?]

165
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,640
[Ping: I can’t point it out though.]

166
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,440
Pock.

167
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,640
Huh?

168
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,680
I’ll be back.

169
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,600
Yes, Pheem?

170
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,120
Please tell your best friend…

171
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,520
that the background colour is too pale.

172
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,080
Okay.

173
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,560
Hey, Pheem said the background colour looks too pale.

174
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,680
Please go tell her…

175
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,520
that if it’s too vibrant, you won’t be able to see the letters clearly.

176
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,360
Okay.

177
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,760
Kie said if it’s too vibrant, you won’t be able to see the letters clearly.

178
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,120
Then tell her to just outline the letters.

179
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,800
Pheem said you should outline the letters.

180
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,280
That’ll make it look dirty and not pretty!

181
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,840

00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:51,769
We wish you a Merry Christmas!

363
00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:55,529
We’re not here for a dart game.

364
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:01,249
Excuse me, can you please move over a little? You’re in the frame.

365
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:03,009
Oh, I’m in the frame?

366
00:29:03,249 --> 00:29:04,809
Kie!

367
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:10,369
We brought you some gifts.

368
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:11,849
Thanks.

369
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:17,769
All right girls, take the darts.

370
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:19,489
We’re not here to throw darts.

371
00:29:19,689 --> 00:29:22,689
We’re here to throw our hearts at you.

372
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:24,849
Girls, are you ready?

373
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:28,889
Wheeee…Bang!

374
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:33,969
Can you girls over there quiet down a bit?

375
00:29:34,449 --> 00:29:36,409
Your friends here can’t concentrate.

376
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:41,889
I never know you need to be so concentrated when spooning the eggs.

377
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,449
I just found out today.

378
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:47,049
Kie, can we take a picture with you?

379
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:55,969
This is a booth for playing darts.

380
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:58,969
Please make sure you’re here to do what you’re supposed to do.

381
00:30:01,329 --> 00:30:03,289
Girls, let’s throw darts!

382
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:07,529
Come, let me help. Just take one each.

383
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:34,089
I heard many people visited your booth today.

384
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:37,569
Well done, both of you. Congratulations.

385
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:43,169
What?

386
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:47,209
Don’t accept it.

387
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:50,769
Pheem is staring daggers at you.

388
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:58,209
Is it heavy? I’ll carry it for you.

389
00:30:58,769 --> 00:30:59,609
It’s okay, Tae.

390
00:30:59,729 --> 00:31:01,689
That’s right. Don’t worry, we can carry it.

391
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:03,409
It’s okay, we don’t want to trouble you.

392
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:06,569
It’s all right. We can carry it.

393
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:07,649
Please go home.

394
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:09,009
It’s okay, we’ll be fine.

395
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:13,369
Do you really want to help that much?

396
00:31:13,649 --> 00:31:15,129
Then carry this for me too.

397
00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:17,809
What are you guys waiting for?

398
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:19,849
Wait!

399
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:23,529
That’s not all.

400
00:31:24,609 --> 00:31:26,649
If you’re so eager to help,

401
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:28,929
please go inside and help us clean up.

402
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:30,249
Let’s go.

403
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:37,929
Seriously, Kie.

404
00:31:38,969 --> 00:31:43,369
Why do you always let other people come near you?

405
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:52,609
I think on your way home,

406
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:54,169
she’ll definitely slit your throat.

407
00:31:56,769 --> 00:31:59,369
Any last words before your final moment?

408
00:31:59,969 --> 00:32:02,209
Don’t exaggerate it.

409
00:32:02,729 --> 00:32:04,849
I don’t think it’d be that bad.

410
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:10,529
Listen, from my research on Pheem’s Explosion phenomenon…

411
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,089
aka Pheem’s explosive jealousy on you,

412
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:16,329
have I ever been wrong when I warn you about her?

413
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,809
Since you’ve done the research,

414
00:32:19,849 --> 00:32:21,769
do you have any solution to it?

415
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:25,209
Yes, come closer.

416
00:32:48,449 --> 00:32:49,769
I told you.

417
00:32:59,249 --> 00:33:01,529
Oh, I found a coin!

418
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:06,689
Aww, that cat is so cute!

419
00:33:10,569 --> 00:33:12,809
Oh, is that Cream?

420
00:33:15,089 --> 00:33:18,049
Do you want it? Cream cookies.

421
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:26,769
No, I don’t like cream. I hate cookies and cream!

422
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:31,529
Wait for me, Pheem.

423
00:33:32,249 --> 00:33:33,569
My dear Pheem.

424
00:33:34,449 --> 00:33:35,249
What?

425
00:33:36,449 --> 00:33:37,529
Wait for me too.

426
00:33:38,689 --> 00:33:40,489
Why don’t you walk faster?

427
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:43,369
I remember you used to walk so fast.

428
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:47,929
But you told me to slow down, didn’t you?

429
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:53,169
I never disobey you, my dear Pheem.

430
00:33:57,129 --> 00:33:58,369
What did you just say?

431
00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:02,729
I said Pheem. Pheem.

432
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,609
No, before that.

433
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:15,849
My dear Pheem.

434
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:22,889
Can you say it again?

435
00:34:26,209 --> 00:34:31,769
My dear Pheem…

436
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,009
Ouch!

437
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:36,609
Aren’t you coming?

438
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:39,409
Yes, yes.

439
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:40,329
Kie

440
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:43,449
don’t forget your duty.

441
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:45,769
My duty?

442
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:50,609
Ouch, Pheem!

443
00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:52,449
Here, your duty.

444
00:34:56,209 --> 00:34:58,049
Peem sometimes feels hurt

445
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,529
when I give attention to others.

446
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:00,209
That’s right.

447
00:35:00,209 --> 00:35:01,369
If I just say the magic words

448
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:04,209
‘Dear Pheem’ like Pok said,

449
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:05,929
and Peem will stop being upset.

450
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:09,209
Oh, it’s your birthday tomorrow.

451
00:35:09,529 --> 00:35:11,289
Should we go celebrate?

452
00:35:43,729 --> 00:35:46,049
Happy Birthday, Kie!

453
00:35:46,169 --> 00:35:46,969
Thanks.

454
00:35:54,169 --> 00:35:56,569
Happy Birthday to you

455
00:35:57,169 --> 00:35:59,449
Happy Birthday to you

456
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:04,209
Happy Birthday Happy Birthday

457
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:10,729
Happy Birthday to Kie!

458
00:36:12,649 --> 00:36:13,729
What the heck!?

459
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:16,489
Happy Birthday, Kie.

460
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:19,049
I wish you…Ouch!

461
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:22,729
Geez, can you stop touching my friend?

462
00:36:22,729 --> 00:36:24,329
Move over, it’s almost time for class!

463
00:36:24,689 --> 00:36:26,809
Can you please accept my heart?

464
00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:28,809
Er, yes.

465
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:30,329
- Thank you.
- Kie!

466
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:31,929
Haven’t I told you not to flirt around?

467
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:51,689
Shit, you’re so dead!

468
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:56,209
Go on, run! Give it to me.

469
00:36:57,209 --> 00:36:59,329
I told you, damn it!

470
00:37:18,009 --> 00:37:21,409
Excuse me? Is Kie here?

471
00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:23,969
I think she just went downstairs.

472
00:37:24,129 --> 00:37:26,889
Oh, that’s good. I’ll surprise her with this cake then.

473
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:28,009
Where’s her desk?

474
00:37:29,529 --> 00:37:30,129
Over there.

475
00:37:30,129 --> 00:37:30,929
Thank you!

476
00:37:39,729 --> 00:37:40,969
So cute!

477
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:45,289
Well, I made her a birthday cake.

478
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:47,369
It’s cookies and cream.

479
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:49,569
Do you think she’ll like it?

480
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,929
Cream, instead of wasting your time going after Kie,

481
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:03,409
isn’t it better to go study?

482
00:38:03,569 --> 00:38:04,969
If Kie really likes you,

483
00:38:05,169 --> 00:38:07,169
you won’t have to keep running after her like this.

484
00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:08,369
Understood?

485
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:09,849
That’s harsh.

486
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:12,009
Cream.

487
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:14,649
Your cake.

488
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:20,329
So mean!

489
00:38:56,169 --> 00:38:57,649
Class, pay respect to the teacher.

490
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:00,769
Good morning.

491
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:02,249
[Teacher: Good morning, everyone.]

492
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:06,529
[Teacher: Does anyone forget to bring their textbook today?]
[Pock miming: I told you.]

493
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:09,609
Pheem!

494
00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:13,569
Pheem, wait up.

495
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:16,569
What?

496
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:22,329
Want me to help carry your bag?

497
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:23,729
Ouch.

498
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:24,849
Sorry.

499
00:39:26,649 --> 00:39:28,249
Just worry about yourself first.

500
00:39:28,689 --> 00:39:30,569
Both of your hands are full.

501
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:32,409
You’re right.

502
00:39:36,489 --> 00:39:37,369
Are you tired?

503
00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:39,569
Of what?

504
00:39:40,649 --> 00:39:43,929
So many people are approaching you every day.

505
00:39:46,169 --> 00:39:50,809
Hmm, on a special like this…yes, I’m kind of tired.

506
00:39:51,529 --> 00:39:53,569
They hardly leave me alone.

507
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:58,089
But on other usual days, I’m not that tired.

508
00:39:58,089 --> 00:39:59,529
Because I hardly pay attention to anyone.

509
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:01,129
Or care about what they think.

510
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:05,249
Wow, and you’re still this popular.

511
00:40:07,569 --> 00:40:10,849
There’re only a few people in this world that I care about.

512
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,569
I’m jealous of them.

513
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:19,769
Then, you should also be jealous of yourself.

514
00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:27,329
I care about you.

515
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:38,449
Aww, you’re smiling.

516
00:40:39,129 --> 00:40:39,809
No.

517
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:42,769
I’m not going to forgive you unless…

518
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:45,769
Unless…

519
00:40:58,649 --> 00:41:03,009
Happy Birthday to you

520
00:41:03,009 --> 00:41:06,569
Happy Birthday to you

521
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:11,129
Happy Birthday Happy Birthday

522
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,249
Happy Birthday, Kie.

523
00:41:20,529 --> 00:41:21,329
Thank you.

524
00:41:22,609 --> 00:41:24,049
Happy Birthday, Kie.

525
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:26,889
I wish you all the happiness.

526
00:41:27,249 --> 00:41:28,809
I almost couldn’t surprise you.

527
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:32,529
Yeah, it almost turned into a death day instead.

528
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:35,929
Just kidding.

529
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:40,769
Thank you, Pheem. The cake looks delicious.

530
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:43,329
Where’s my present?

531
00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:45,329
Oh, just a second.

532
00:41:53,049 --> 00:41:57,129
Here you go. Open it.

533
00:41:57,329 --> 00:42:02,929
Open it. I hope you like it.

534
00:42:13,609 --> 00:42:16,489
Did you…make it yourself?

535
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:20,009
Why? You don’t like it?

536
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:22,409
I designed it by using you as a reference.

537
00:42:22,649 --> 00:42:25,209
No, I love it! This alien doll looks so cute.

538
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:26,529
It’s a pig not an alien!

539
00:42:26,729 --> 00:42:28,489
I love this pig doll so much.

540
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:32,489
It’s my favourite birthday gift.

541
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:36,329
Thank you, Pheem.

542
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:39,249
He also has a name.

543
00:42:39,249 --> 00:42:41,129
named him ‘MooYong’.

544
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:48,529
His name is cute. He also looks cute.

545
00:42:48,729 --> 00:42:50,089

you can hug him and think of me when you’re in bed.

548
00:42:57,249 --> 00:42:59,929
Are you going to England again?

549
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:04,009
Mhm, this time my dad wants me to stay there for 2 months.

550
00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:07,409
Oh, two months?

551
00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:12,409
He wants me to stay longer than last time.

552
00:43:14,209 --> 00:43:18,889
This means…I won’t get to see you for 2 whole months then.

I thought you said you’d stay there for 2 months.

It’s been only a month, why are you back so early?

555
00:43:40,209 --> 00:43:41,329
I couldn’t stand it.

556
00:43:41,529 --> 00:43:42,489
You couldn’t stand what?

557
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:43,929
I miss…

Hello, Pheem’s father.

564
00:44:35,828 --> 00:44:38,908
Pheem, we have to go now.

565
00:44:40,108 --> 00:44:40,908
Yes.

566
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:48,068
Do you want to go to the airport and see me off there?

567
00:44:49,508 --> 00:44:50,468
It’s all right.

568
00:44:50,468 --> 00:44:51,788
I’ll see you off here.

I’ll be back soon.

Pheem, I have something to tell you.

While you’re there, don’t forget to think…

577
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:06,428
about our homework during school holidays.

578
00:46:09,068 --> 00:46:10,028
And one more thing.

579
00:46:11,508 --> 00:46:14,988
Well, I want to tell you that…

Pheem!

634
00:52:15,148 --> 00:52:16,508
Is this for me?

It’s been just a month, why are you back so early?

643
00:52:52,828 --> 00:52:54,428
I moved up the date.

644
00:52:55,068 --> 00:53:00,028
Because I couldn’t stand it.

645
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,628
You couldn’t stand what?

646
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:09,268

00:53:11,548 --> 00:53:15,348

654
00:53:31,228 --> 00:53:32,628
Missing home.

655
00:53:35,508 --> 00:53:38,988
Oh, sorry.

656
00:53:40,668 --> 00:53:43,828
I think I should go now.

657
00:53:43,828 --> 00:53:45,908
I just remember I have an errand to run.

658
00:53:47,188 --> 00:53:48,468
Where the heck are you going?

659
00:53:49,228 --> 00:53:52,348
Well, I have to buy a fish sauce for my grandma.

660
00:53:52,588 --> 00:53:54,948
I’ll take these then.

661
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:01,788
This is your chance, don’t you waste it, okay?

662
00:54:03,628 --> 00:54:06,268
See you then. Bye Bye. Talk nicely.

663
00:54:12,908 --> 00:54:16,228
It’s been a while,

664
00:54:17,748 --> 00:54:21,908
have you lost weight? Your cheeks look so sunken now.

665
00:54:25,908 --> 00:54:29,308
If you don’t want me to look like this,

666
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:34,788
then don’t go away for so long again.

667
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,748
Going to England this time…

668
00:54:42,468 --> 00:54:49,308
made me realized how I really miss you.

669
00:54:50,668 --> 00:54:53,468
Do you also miss me?

670
00:55:01,068 --> 00:55:04,308
Pheem, I have something to tell you.

671
00:55:11,268 --> 00:55:13,068
Well, I…

672
00:55:16,548 --> 00:55:19,508
I want to tell you…

673
00:55:21,548 --> 00:55:22,948

What? Mooyong?

676
00:55:44,468 --> 00:55:46,988
Geez, Kie! Are you nuts?

677
00:55:46,988 --> 00:55:48,988
And you even came all the way here…

678
00:55:48,988 --> 00:55:51,348
just to ask me this? Unbelievable.

679
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:56,108
Just saying ‘Pheem, I miss you’, how hard could it be?

680
00:55:56,388 --> 00:56:00,308
But I almost fainted…

681
00:56:00,588 --> 00:56:02,268
when I just held her hand.

682
00:56:02,748 --> 00:56:05,148
If I have to say something sweet like that,

683
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,148
aren’t you afraid I might have a heart attack?

684
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:10,108
Stop. No more excuses.

685
00:56:10,308 --> 00:56:12,468
Seriously, you’re only good at studying.

686
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:15,868
But when it comes to love, you’re so lousy at it.

687
00:56:16,628 --> 00:56:18,108
What do you want me to do?

688
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:21,868
My relationship with Pheem is going well so far.

Why? What are you scared of?

691
00:56:30,308 --> 00:56:33,268
Pheem and I are both girls, aren’t we?

692
00:56:34,868 --> 00:56:37,428
She might just like me as a friend.

693
00:56:39,428 --> 00:56:41,948
Kie, if you keep hesitating like this,

694
00:56:41,948 --> 00:56:43,668
another dog might steal your meat first.

695
00:56:43,668 --> 00:56:44,948
You’re both girls and so what?

696
00:56:44,948 --> 00:56:48,348
Girls have both masculine and feminine sides.

697
00:56:48,348 --> 00:56:51,188
You should know when to create an opportunity for yourself.

698
00:56:52,428 --> 00:56:54,828
Just watch me.

699
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,908
I’ll show you what it’s like to create an opportunity for yourself.

700
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:13,228
Pock!

701
00:57:14,508 --> 00:57:15,428
Pock!

702
00:57:15,468 --> 00:57:16,268
Pock!

703
00:57:16,268 --> 00:57:17,148
Help!

704
00:57:17,188 --> 00:57:17,708
Pock!

705
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:19,228
Hey, don’t be scared!

706
00:57:19,388 --> 00:57:21,508
It’s a child’s pool – only 60cm deep.

707
00:57:28,388 --> 00:57:31,028
It’s just a child pool but I almost got drowned,

708
00:57:31,028 --> 00:57:34,268
can you help teach me how to swim then?

709
00:57:34,268 --> 00:57:37,428
So that I can enjoy swimming in an adult pool.

710
00:57:37,588 --> 00:57:39,548
Sure.

711
00:57:39,988 --> 00:57:41,028
Thank you!

712
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:02,708
Hello, Dad.

713
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:06,428
Why are you home so late? Where have you been?

714
00:58:06,988 --> 00:58:09,708
I dropped by at my friend’s place to give her something.

715
00:58:11,748 --> 00:58:13,988
Next time, if you’re going to be home this late,

716
00:58:13,988 --> 00:58:16,028
tell the driver to go with you too.

717
00:58:16,348 --> 00:58:20,308
Or if you want to eat anything late at night, just tell our maid.

718
00:58:21,628 --> 00:58:22,428
Yes.

719
00:58:23,428 --> 00:58:25,348
Go upstairs and freshen up yourself.

720
00:58:25,548 --> 00:58:27,068
Then come down for dinner.

721
00:58:27,748 --> 00:58:29,028
We have a guest today.

722
00:58:31,628 --> 00:58:32,428
Who is it?

723
00:58:35,148 --> 00:58:38,548
The import industry is losing a lot of money these days.

724
00:58:39,188 --> 00:58:41,428
The tax alone almost got us bankrupted.

725
00:58:48,628 --> 00:58:49,788
Good evening.

726
00:58:49,908 --> 00:58:50,708
[Poon’s parents: Hello.]

727
00:58:50,868 --> 00:58:51,988
Hello, Poon.

728
00:58:56,308 --> 00:58:58,348
Wow, we have plenty of food today.

729
00:59:00,388 --> 00:59:02,028
Poon bought them for you.

730
00:59:03,988 --> 00:59:05,868
He heard that while you were still in England,

731
00:59:06,308 --> 00:59:09,348
you could hardly eat or sleep because you miss Thai food.

732
00:59:09,348 --> 00:59:13,668
So he has ordered all this especially for you.

733
00:59:14,428 --> 00:59:15,228
Thank you.

734
00:59:16,388 --> 00:59:18,908
But you shouldn’t have bothered.

735
00:59:22,068 --> 00:59:23,668
It’s really nothing, Pheem.

736
00:59:24,388 --> 00:59:25,828
I heard that you are back,

737
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:26,708
so I just want to pay you a visit.

738
00:59:27,468 --> 00:59:29,228
My parents also want to come see Uncle Poj.

739
00:59:29,228 --> 00:59:30,468
Right, Uncle?

740
00:59:31,188 --> 00:59:32,268
Thanks a lot.

741
00:59:32,948 --> 00:59:36,188
From now on, if you have any problem with your study,

742
00:59:36,188 --> 00:59:38,308
you can ask for his help.

743
00:59:38,788 --> 00:59:40,468
You two should get to know each other more.

744
00:59:40,468 --> 00:59:41,908
[Poon’s Mum: That’s right. So that our families will be closer.]

745
00:59:41,908 --> 00:59:42,508
[Poon’s Dad: Yes.]

746
00:59:45,308 --> 00:59:46,468
Pheem,

747
00:59:46,468 --> 00:59:48,628
was it not good living in England?

748
00:59:48,628 --> 00:59:49,988
Why did you come back so early?

749
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:53,428
When I was there for a summer course,

750
00:59:53,788 --> 00:59:57,788
I remember how I miss Thai food so bad.

751
00:59:58,068 --> 01:00:01,468
Oh my gosh, did you also feel the same?

752
01:00:01,588 --> 01:00:03,188
You miss Thai food too, right?

753
01:00:04,588 --> 01:00:07,428
Yes, I was homesick.

754
01:00:10,388 --> 01:00:12,748
Your dad probably sent you there…

755
01:00:12,868 --> 01:00:14,508
because he wanted you to experience it first.

756
01:00:15,508 --> 01:00:17,508
But I don’t want to go to study in England.

757
01:00:18,988 --> 01:00:20,548
You have to, dear.

758
01:00:20,748 --> 01:00:23,388
You’ll be taking over my business in the future.

759
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:25,388
Graduating from Thailand is not enough.

760
01:00:26,108 --> 01:00:28,188
You have to go study in London.

761
01:00:30,028 --> 01:00:31,068
That makes sense.

762
01:00:33,068 --> 01:00:35,188
Okay, let’s eat, shall we?

763
01:00:36,308 --> 01:00:38,228
Please do the honour, Uncle Poj.

764
01:00:38,828 --> 01:00:40,468
Okay, I’ll start with the nearest one.

765
01:00:54,348 --> 01:00:55,148
Pheem.

766
01:00:55,788 --> 01:00:59,028
Wow, it’s only our first day of school and you’re already studying?

767
01:00:59,268 --> 01:01:00,068
So diligent.

768
01:01:04,148 --> 01:01:06,948
Pheem…are you okay?

769
01:01:07,308 --> 01:01:09,108
Why do you look so serious?

770
01:01:10,228 --> 01:01:12,588
My dad wants me to go to the university in England.

771
01:01:13,748 --> 01:01:16,508
Hmm, England again?

772
01:01:16,788 --> 01:01:19,028
This time it’ll be for many years then.

773
01:01:19,948 --> 01:01:23,268
Yes, but I really don’t want to go.

774
01:01:23,948 --> 01:01:26,468
Why not?

775
01:01:26,908 --> 01:01:28,708
Many people would want to go study there.

776
01:01:29,988 --> 01:01:32,308
I was there for only a month and I knew I couldn’t stand it.

777
01:01:33,548 --> 01:01:37,228
If you’re really going, I guess I’ll be so thin then.

778
01:01:40,428 --> 01:01:45,908
How about this? Can you try talking to your dad?

779
01:01:46,228 --> 01:01:49,868
Tell him that universities in Thailand…

780
01:01:49,868 --> 01:01:51,828
are actually as good as those overseas.

781
01:01:55,068 --> 01:01:56,388
I already did.

782
01:01:57,628 --> 01:02:02,668
But he said if I couldn’t get accepted into an international program at the university he has chosen,

783
01:02:04,188 --> 01:02:05,908
I have to go to England.

784
01:02:09,188 --> 01:02:11,348
Why does he get to decide what you want to do?

785
01:02:12,068 --> 01:02:15,348
It’s your life, you should get to make your own choice.

786
01:02:15,948 --> 01:02:17,268
So conservative.

787
01:02:19,388 --> 01:02:21,908
I didn’t mean to say bad things about your dad.

788
01:02:23,988 --> 01:02:25,908
I never get to choose anything.

789
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:35,148
Dad probably believes I won’t make it into the university he has chosen.

790
01:02:36,028 --> 01:02:37,908
That’s why he came up with this condition.

791
01:02:56,908 --> 01:02:59,748
How about this?

792
01:03:00,428 --> 01:03:03,068
I’ll be your tutor.

793
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:06,508
And we can go to the university here together.

794
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:09,868
I’ll prove to your dad…

795
01:03:11,428 --> 01:03:13,468
that you are capable of choosing your own life.

796
01:03:22,268 --> 01:03:23,068
Okay?

797
01:03:31,828 --> 01:03:32,628
Thanks.

798
01:03:33,988 --> 01:03:37,548
What about you? Where do you want to study?

799
01:03:39,468 --> 01:03:42,148
No idea. I just want to study engineering.

800
01:03:45,948 --> 01:03:52,828
Then, let’s go to the same university together.

801
01:03:54,468 --> 01:03:56,748
So that I’ll have encouragement to study.

802
01:03:58,748 --> 01:04:00,748
Mhm, let’s do that.

804
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:11,548
Yes, I promise.

01:04:25,908 --> 01:04:27,148

You know what? Looking up from the deep pit,

903
01:17:48,010 --> 01:17:49,970
I can even tell you two like each other.

904
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:53,690
Just get this done with and ask her to be your girlfriend.

905
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:55,250
I’m tired of shipping you two.

906
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:58,730
Is it that obvious?

907
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:01,130
Can’t you tell?

908
01:18:02,650 --> 01:18:06,090
But does Pheem really like me?

909
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:08,010
For heaven’s sake. No, she doesn’t like you.

910
01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:11,250
She doesn’t like you one bit but she keeps getting so jealous when anyone comes near you.

911
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:14,770
Kie, you two…

912
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:17,170
are already behaving like a couple no matter what you think.

913
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:22,810
Neh, you don’t say.

914
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:27,730
Yes. Your relationship with her…

915
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:30,210
is like liquid in a saturated state.

916
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:33,410
With just a few more heat,

917
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:37,170
it will then evaporate. Only a few more.

918
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:40,490
Pock, can you speak more human?

919
01:18:41,490 --> 01:18:44,770
No, if I had made it sound easier, I wouldn’t have looked this smart.

920
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:51,730
Kie, I’m serious. I’m sure Pheem is waiting for you to confess to her.

921
01:18:52,450 --> 01:18:53,490
Do I have to?

922
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:57,570
Geez, dumbass! No, you don’t. She’ll just realize it herself.

923
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:02,010
When will you stop being so tight-lipped, Miss Kiran?

924
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:07,610
I didn’t say I’m not going to tell her.

925
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:13,090
I’m just…I’m just waiting for the right moment.

926
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:15,290
What moment? What are you waiting for?

927
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:17,690
For her to dance your way, or until next life?

928
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:23,650
I just can’t find the right timing, don’t you get it?

929
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:31,970
Listen, we’ll have a graduation camp next week.

930
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:35,610
Graduation camp?

931
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:40,690
Yes.

932
01:19:41,650 --> 01:19:44,690
Good atmosphere there and it’ll be before we finish Grade 12.

933
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:47,250
You’ll surely seal the deal there.

934
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:50,010
Trust me. Hooya!

935
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:54,010
Fine! I’m going to confess to her on our graduation day!

936
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:54,970
Fabulous!

937

938
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:02,290
Kie!

Kie, Kiran Pipittayaphongsa from Engineering!

940
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:18,090
[Kie!]

941
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:20,170
[Let’s hear it for her!]

942
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:21,370
What is it?

943
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:26,250
[Kie!]

944
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:27,730
Pheem.

945
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:31,490
[Pheem: Is this why you don’t want me to come into your room?]

946
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:33,650
[Damn it! Are you nuts?!]

947
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:35,610
What do you want me to do then?

948
01:20:35,810 --> 01:20:37,370
You have to go all in with her.

949
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:38,930
Give it all you got!

950
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:43,770
This means…you saw everything then?

951
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:44,570
Kie!

952
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:49,410
Oh, a mosquito!
