00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,260
[Previously]
Don't talk to me like we're close.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,780
Should I call you ‘Miss’...

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,660
from now on?

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,340
Kie-san.

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,460
I miss you

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,860
Yumi and I are just colleagues.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,400
I don’t care what you’d do.

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,300
Calm down first.

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,220
I’ll rush there and take care of everything for you.

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,740
My bestie!

11
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,060
Aww, buddy.

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,380
Whom are you coming with?

13
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,140
Tan!

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,100
Pheem!

15
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,460
Should we go eat something this evening?

16
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,500
Do you want to go to an Onsen together?

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,660
We all should go together then.

18
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,260
Asking to tag along so easily like this,

19
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,620
don’t you have anything to give us in exchange?

20
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,660
More wasabi please!

21
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,180
Kie won!

22
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,330
I give up.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,060
Respect Man, Great job.

24
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,600
I...Can I go with you?

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,330
Oh, she just asked if we could tag along too?

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,340
Yeah, sure.

27
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,780
You can come with us.

28
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,540
Pheem is yours but Tan is mine!

29
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,260

00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,620
♫I’ve been watching you for so long but you never know it♫

31
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,300
♫That someone is secretly admiring you ♫

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,860

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,130
Do you want to go to the loo first? I’ll take you there.

42
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:41,900
Okay

43
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,420
Hey, let’s hurry up or we’ll be late.

44
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,180
The train here is always right on time.

45
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,560
Let’s go, Pock.

46
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,860
I haven’t gone to the loo yet.

47
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,740
Oh, is it that one?

48
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,060
That one, right?

49
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,300
Our train is coming. Let’s hurry up.

50
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,260
Hurry up!

51
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,020
Give me that.

52
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,140
Do you want to miss the train?

53
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,020
Hurry up!

54
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,200
Pheem! Where’s she?

55
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,860
Hurry up! Let’s go!

56
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,540
Pheem! Pheem!

57
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,980
Hey, the door is closing!

58
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,700
Pheem!

59
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,380
It’s all your fault. We just missed the train!

60
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,380
Wait, Tan. Are you going to call Pheem?

61
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,460
No need. I’ll call Kie.

62
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Hey, Kie.

63
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,340
Pock, why didn’t you wait for me?

64
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,180
See you at the shrine then.

65
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,360
What? I haven’t said anything yet.

66
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,860
Oh! Yes, see you at the temple then.

67
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,220
Okay, talk to you later.

68
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,380
Yeah, see you.

69
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,380
Pheem.

70
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,020
Pock said let’s meet at the temple.

71
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,420
But I think we should get off at the next stop and wait for Pheem.

72
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,620
It’d only be a waste of time, waiting for each other like that.

73
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,660
Let’s just go and meet there.

74
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,180
But will they be okay?

75
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,220
Of course.

76
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,740
Just sit back and relax. We’ll meet them there.

77
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,220
Pock, I think we’re on the wrong train.

78
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,560
Let’s get off and start over.

79
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,100
Let’s go.

80
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,740
Tan, my stomach hurts a lot.

81
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,540
It’s probably food poisoning.

82
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,960
Tan!

83
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,060
Look, I’m having goosebumps everywhere.

84
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,960
Okay.

85
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,020
Please don’t leave me.

86
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,300
- Let’s go.
- Sure.

87
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,140
Be careful.

88
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,500
The rain should let up soon.

89
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,200
The app said so.

90
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,600
The weather here is always like this.

91
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,300
Why don’t you call Pock and ask where she is?

92
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,340
They’ve probably arrived before us.

93
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,360
Why? Do you miss Tan that much?

94
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,130
If you’re not going to call, I’ll do it.

95
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,060
Fine, I’ll call her.

96
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,580
Pock, where are you?

97
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,260
I can’t hear you.

98
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,980
Hello?

99
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,900
I can’t hear you.

100
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,460
Hello?

101
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,140
She’s probably still on the train.

102
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,360
There’s no signal.

103
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,940
That’s a terrible acting. Let me call Tan.

104
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,260
Hey, Pheem.

105
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,820
Tan, where are you?

106
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,660
I’ve been waiting for Pock for almost an hour now. She’s in the toilet.

107
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,220
I think she has diarrhea.

108
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,620
What? Pock has diarrhea?

109
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,420
- Yeah, that’s why we had to get off midway.
- she has diarrhea?

110
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,380
Please hurry up then.

111
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,900
Okay, I’ll call you later.

112
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,900
Pock is not on the train. Why would she be out of signal?

113
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,700
Well, she might be pooping in the toilet and there’s no signal there.

114
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,160
Hey, do you have the runs?

115
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,220
I’m buying time for you.

116
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,300
Just harvest it as much as you can.

117
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,940
Are you buying time for me or for yourself?

118
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,260
But thanks anyway.

119
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,620
Jerk!

120
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,460
Hey, who allows you to take my picture?

121
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,860
And why would you take it like that though? You can’t see any view there.

122
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,160
I don’t want to take a picture of the view.

123
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,340
I want to take a picture of you.

124
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,900
The view is really nice. Do you want me to take a picture for you?

125
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,220
No. I can do it myself.

126
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,100
No need to bother a Sensei like you.

127
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,740
It’s beautiful.

128
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,660
These rocks are called “Sakurai Futamigaura”.

129
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,740
They are very sacred.

130
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,900
I used to come here to make a wish, and it came true.

131
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,700
Really?

132
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,580
If you have anything you wish to come true,

133
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,860
try making a wish and close your eyes.

134
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,800
You said you made a wish here and it came true.

135
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,400
What did you wish for?

136
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,530
It’s something personal.

137
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,940
I’d rather not answer it, Miss.

138
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,980
Like I’d want to know.

139
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,860
Fine, I’ll tell you. It’s about work.

140
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,820
I wished that I’d get a job here.

141
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,780
Does it have to be here?

142
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,930
Wouldn’t it be better if it’s in Thailand?

143
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,020
What about Sine? Is she okay with this?

144
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,300
Sine…which Sine?

145
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,380
You mean the sand here? Well, it’s quite soft.
(*Sine means sand in Thai)

146
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,860
Sorry, it’s your personal life. I don’t need to know it.

147
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,960
Hey, where are you going?

148
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,460
I’m thirsty. I’m going to buy something to drink.

149
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,530
Wait here then. I’ll get it for you.

150
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,860
Pock, are you okay?

151
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,660
Yes. Just a second, Tan.

152
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,860
Just a minute.

153
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,780
Hang on.

154
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,930
It’s me, Tan.

155
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,700
Are you all right?

156
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,130
You look so pale. Are you okay?

157
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,660
I’m okay, Tan.

158
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,200
Do you want to go to the hospital?

159
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,060
No, I’m okay.

160
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,380
I’m so sorry I’ve troubled you.

161
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,140
You have to waste your time waiting for me.

162
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,180
That’s all right. Don’t worry.

163
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,760
Should we go get you some medicine upstairs?

164
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,200
Can you walk?

165
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,380
Yes.

166
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:44,900
Sure?

167
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,780
Let’s go then.

168
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,860
Tan! I’m having goosebumps.

169
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,500
Can I lean on you?

170
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,760
Sure.

171
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,060
Can you walk?

172
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,700
Yes.

173
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,260
Let’s go.

174
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,860
Where is she?

175
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,160
Where have you been? Why did you leave me alone again?

176
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,960
I’m sorry. It’s so hard to find a shop that sells water around here.

177
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,100
Next time, don’t disappear like this again.

178
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,580
Got it?

179
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,860
I’ll never leave you again.

180
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,060
I’ll wait for you and walk you home every day.

181
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,980
And I’ll walk slowly too.

182

358
00:27:52,512 --> 00:27:54,882
Tan called me and asked for your address in Japan.

359
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:56,762
I guess he wanted to surprise you.

360
00:27:57,182 --> 00:27:59,762
He did. He just showed up out of nowhere.

361
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:01,122
What a surprise.

362
00:28:01,912 --> 00:28:05,882
He’s trying so hard. He seems so worried about you.

363
00:28:06,242 --> 00:28:08,142
Much more than when you were still in England.

364
00:28:08,712 --> 00:28:10,922
He’s worried about everyone, Prae.

365
00:28:11,282 --> 00:28:13,162
But especially about you.

366
00:28:13,712 --> 00:28:17,642
So, does Tan have to meet Kie too?

367
00:28:18,142 --> 00:28:19,882
Wouldn’t Kie be jealous?

368
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:23,962
I don’t know. Back then when Kie had to be in this kind of situation,

369
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:25,382
she would just walk away.

370
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:29,182
But this time she went an eye for an eye with him.

371
00:28:30,882 --> 00:28:32,242
She’s so fierce.

372
00:28:33,982 --> 00:28:38,682
She probably wants to reconcile with you. How about you then?

373
00:28:42,082 --> 00:28:45,642
No, she broke my heart. I’ve learnt my lesson.

374
00:28:46,442 --> 00:28:48,382
I don’t want to suffer like that again.

375
00:28:49,182 --> 00:28:51,642
Are you sure you won’t change your mind?

376
00:28:52,582 --> 00:28:53,562
Yes.

377
00:29:13,762 --> 00:29:15,322
Ouch, Pheem!

378
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:18,942
Rascal.

379
00:29:19,582 --> 00:29:20,942

Where are we going today, Tan?

00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,710
Maybe this place.

398
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,210
The view is nice there and it’s not far from here.

399
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,870
Good morning.

400
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,670
I’m sorry, guys. I woke up late.

401
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,910
Are you hungry?

402
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,630
We have to be on a train for a while.

403
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,670
I’m not hungry.

404
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,110
Let’s hurry or we might miss the train.

405
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,430
How about we go inside and get something to eat before we leave?

406
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,870
Okay?

407
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,990
Here.

408
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,270
Take it.

409
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,230
Please take it, Pheem. Or she might shove it into your face.

410
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,870
She even went out to buy the materials to cook for you herself.

411
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,030
She knows you’ll be up late and won’t have time for breakfast.

412
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,350
Just take it so that we could leave.

413
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,830
Please. Or do you want us to miss the train?

414
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,710
Let’s go, Tan.

415
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,910
Hang in there, buddy.

416
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,990

417
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,830
What?

418
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,140
Your bag.

419
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,170

So, where are we going next?

456
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,910
I’m thinking of finding some beautiful places to take more photos.

457
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,870
Probably the Kinrin Lake.

458
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:53,810
Let’s go then.

459
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,310
Yes?

460
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:56,970
Let’s go!

461
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,540
Wait.

462
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:00,950
Let’s go.

463
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,790
Lucky, lucky, rich, rich.

464
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:11,990
Pock, it’s actually for washing away bad things.

465
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,150

00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:14,610
Oh, really?

467
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,030
Okay. Go away!

468
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,950
Enough with the wish. They already went that way.

469
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,110
Hurry and go after them.

470
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,590
go after them.

471
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,070
It’s so beautiful, Tan.

472
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,810
Yes, indeed.

473
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,510

00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,230

475
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:56,030

477
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,310
Okay.

00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,230

479
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,470
Can you take it for me?

480
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,870
But we already took lots of them earlier.

481
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,670

483
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,270
You’re so kind, Tan.

484
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,790
I know you can take more photos for me.

485
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,670
Sure.

486
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,810
Let’s go over there then.

487
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,030
Over there?

488
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,190
Yes. Come on.

489
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,010
Over there?

490
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,630
Yes, let’s go.

491
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,210
Want me to take it for you?

492
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,270
No need.

493
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,630
Tan, come over here. It’s so pretty.

494
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,750
Take a picture here for me.

495
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,550
Here. Over here.

496
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,610
Sure.

497
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,140
Hurry up.

498
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,790
Move to the right a bit.

499
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,270
Okay.

501
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,710
1 2 3.

502
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,790
1 2 3.

503

Is that enough?

504
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,670
Oh, over there is also pretty. Can I have more photos there?

505
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,710
But it already looks so nice here.

506
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,910
Over there too.

507
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,030
I already took lots of photos back there.

508
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,150
Don’t worry. Let’s take some more.

509
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:30,670
Want to take a look first?

510
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,610
No, not yet.

511
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,990
Sorry.

512
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,140
Pheem.

513
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,470
Wait, Pheem.

514
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,710
Wow, so pretty.

515
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,230
Who said you could take my picture?

516
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:42,230
I took a picture of the view, not you.

517
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,990
Point your camera the other way then.

518
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,070
Why would you point it my way?

519
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:48,990
Well, it’s pretty.

520
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:51,990
I mean the view.

521
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:00,190
Excuse me? I heard you talking in Thai.

522
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,150
Are you Thai?

523
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,710
Yes.

524
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,230
Could you please take a picture for us?

525
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,630
Of course.

526
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,550
Please make sure you get the lake and the view in the background.

527
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,510
Sure.

528
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,510
1 2 3.

529
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:18,670
One more.

530
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,270
There you go.

531
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,390
Please check if it’s okay.

532
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,710
Wow.

533
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,310
So cute.

534
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:29,950

Can we take a picture with you?

Sure.

Hey, are you done taking pictures?

539

Do you want me to take a picture for both of you?

541
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,910
No need.

542
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,510
Let’s go, or else her girlfriend might eat us alive.

00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,310
See you later. Have fun.

545

Who’s jealous? I’m just annoyed.

546
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,590

- It’s mine.
- No, you’ll just delete it.

Do you think they’ll sleep in the same room?

00:48:47,881 --> 00:48:51,111
I just want to know which room you’re in?

625
00:48:51,781 --> 00:48:53,041
I’m in this room.

626
00:48:53,341 --> 00:48:55,881
What about you, Tan? Which room?

But how would you know if they’re not dating or seeing each other?

635
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:54,741
Trust me, Pheem definitely doesn’t like Tan that way.

636
00:49:56,941 --> 00:49:59,001
What makes you think like that?

637

Do you know why?

641
00:50:14,481 --> 00:50:19,321
Because Tan is very sweet and caring. He’s also very attentive.

642
00:50:19,941 --> 00:50:24,741
The more you compliment him, the more it feels like you’re complaining about me.

643

Geez, you’re thinking too much.

644
00:50:28,981 --> 00:50:33,161

Although she might not have feelings for him now, you still can’t be so sure.

Because since I’ve known Pheem,

660
00:51:14,081 --> 00:51:17,841
I’ve never seen any guy friend who could get close to her as much as Tan does.

715
00:55:08,741 --> 00:55:10,111
to make her heart waver again.

716
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:16,281
I don’t want to see her suffer like that again.

717
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:21,001
Those scars in her heart are almost healed.

718
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:23,721
If you really love her,

719
00:55:26,941 --> 00:55:28,511
don’t come back and hurt her again.

720
00:55:40,941 --> 00:55:43,401
Tan, where’s Kie?

721
00:55:48,441 --> 00:55:50,141
I guess it’s really not my business.

722
00:55:50,741 --> 00:55:53,081
Why does he look so grumpy?

723
00:55:54,481 --> 00:55:55,281
Kie!

724
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:13,841
Kie!

725
00:56:14,241 --> 00:56:15,001
Kie!

726
00:56:15,641 --> 00:56:18,961
Are you all right?

727
00:56:19,401 --> 00:56:24,241
I just saw Tan earlier. He looked so grumpy like Scrooge in Christmas Carol.

728
00:56:25,441 --> 00:56:26,681
What did he say to you?

729
00:56:31,241 --> 00:56:32,921
He told me…

730
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:43,681
what Pheem was like…after I left her.

731
00:56:46,581 --> 00:56:47,881
Why did he tell you that?

732
00:56:49,141 --> 00:56:50,041
What does he want?

733
00:56:51,681 --> 00:56:53,711
He wants me to leave Pheem alone.

734
00:56:57,341 --> 00:56:58,641
And not hurt her again.

735
00:57:02,341 --> 00:57:03,311
So, what now?

736
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:06,041
Are you going to leave her alone?

737
00:57:13,741 --> 00:57:15,121
I can’t do that.

738
00:57:17,511 --> 00:57:19,481
Do you want to hurt her again?

739
00:57:22,641 --> 00:57:24,181
I’m not going to hurt her.

740
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:27,911
I’m going to heal her.

741
00:57:31,311 --> 00:57:35,721
Those scars in her heart that you can never fix.

742
00:57:42,941 --> 00:57:47,341
I’ll use the rest of my life to heal them for her.

743
00:57:55,241 --> 00:58:00,361
As long as she doesn’t shoo me away, I’ll never give up.

744
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:04,041
Ha, that’s my girl, buddy!

745
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:05,361
Do you know why?

746
00:58:05,361 --> 00:58:08,441
This best friend of yours has found you a great chance.

747
00:58:10,311 --> 00:58:11,401
What chance?

748
00:58:12,311 --> 00:58:17,711
Listen, I heard Pheem will use an Onsen at around 4 this afternoon.

749
00:58:20,641 --> 00:58:21,441
So?

750
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:25,881
Geez, Kie. You should go and remind her of the old time.

751
00:58:25,941 --> 00:58:28,961
Do you want me to tell you how to do it too, huh?

752
00:58:30,311 --> 00:58:31,111
Do you?

753
00:58:31,711 --> 00:58:33,841
Are you sure it’s a good idea?

754
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,401
I wouldn’t dare.

755
00:58:35,881 --> 00:58:38,721
Geez, Kie, you two used to be lovers.

756
00:58:38,741 --> 00:58:41,041
Old flames are easy to ignore, I mean ignite.

757
00:58:41,041 --> 00:58:42,401
Yes, ignite.

758
00:58:44,381 --> 00:58:48,921
You mean I can easily re-ignite an old flame with her?

759
00:58:49,381 --> 00:58:50,921
Yes, exactly.

760
00:58:50,921 --> 00:58:53,801
But you have to hurry and go find her right now.

761
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:05,761
Go now.

762

-Geez! Pock!

Aren’t you coming too?

773
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:28,911
I’m going to use a mixed Onsen.

774
00:59:29,341 --> 00:59:30,141
What?

775
00:59:30,241 --> 00:59:33,441
In case I might get to see a Naga.

776
00:59:33,781 --> 00:59:36,841
Are you nuts? This is Japan, not Nongkai.

777
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:41,321
Listen, right now, I’d be so happy with just a tiny green snake.

Yes! Go now!

Geez! Why are you shy? You won’t feel it once you go in there.

No but. Just go!

Go! Go! Go!

Good luck chuck, buddy. Hope she’ll forgive you soon.

789

As for me, I hope I’ll get to see a snake!

Your hair is all wet.

Do you still have a headache?

795
01:00:37,281 --> 01:00:39,361
You’d better hurry and get dressed.

She is so nice to me it’s kind of scary.

799
