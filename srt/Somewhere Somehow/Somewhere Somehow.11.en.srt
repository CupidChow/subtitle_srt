Kie, your nose is bleeding!

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,620
Kie: Are you worried about me?

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,300
Of course, I am.

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,400
Pheem: I really hate myself.

5
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,060
Pheem: I hate that when it’s about Kie, I seem so easy for her.

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,420
Pock: How do you know she’s also not in pain?

7
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,780
She has Sine.

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,300
She hasn’t dated anyone since that day.

9
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,340
Shit! I have to go.

10
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,820
Easy there.

11
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,340
Can you look after her for me for a while?

12
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,860
Thank you for always waiting for me, Kie.

13
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,100
Do you still have a headache?

14
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,540
Pheem: I’ll go buy you medicine.

15
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,220
Kie: It’s kind of scary when she’s so nice to me.

16
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,500
What if she’s up to something?

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,200
Do you think I’ll make it out alive?

18
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,700
Absolutely not.

19
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,900
Pheem.

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,820
Pheem.

21
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,660
Please open the door for me, Pheem.

22
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,100
- Kie!
- Pheem!

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,060
- Hey.
- Pheem.

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,660
I think there’s no way she’ll open that damn door for you today.

25
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,860
Just leave her be.

26
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,460
No!

27
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,180
Watch me.

28
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,900
Pheem!

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,180
Pheem!

30
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,500
Go away!

31
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,180
See? She just explodes.

32
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,500
Leave her be.

33
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:11,740
Come on.

34
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,500
No, listen to me.

35
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,500
I have wasted 7 whole years.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,100
I’ll never stay away from her for even a second from now on.

37
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,700
Wow.

38
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,560
Pheem!

39
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,420
- Please open the door.
- Go sleep with Pock tonight.

40
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,620
Pheem! Pheem!

41
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,100
Wait, Pheem.

42
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,220
I think she’s so pissed, buddy.

43
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,180
Just sleep with me tonight, okay?

44
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,180
I really miss you.

45
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,820
Come.

46
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,760
Come.

47
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,660
Kie: What was that for?

48
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,140
Why is she so quiet?

49
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,660
Damn you, Kie. You don’t have to do everything as I said.

Geez, Pock. I spent so long making that one.

I said…Pheem, sweetie.

108

Can you forgive me now?

109
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,500
I don’t know.

00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,300
Just easy like that?

115
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,900
Yeah, they were also like this back then.

116
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,940
Just saying those two words can make Pheem forgive her.

117
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,460
Then, why didn’t she say it since this morning?

118
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,420
I wonder too.

00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,540
Let me see.

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,420
It’s so cute.

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,460
Right?

142
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,140
I never thought someone like you would also have this cute and cuddly side.

143
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,580
Not just a cute side.

144
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,700
But some other sides too.

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,420
Yeah.

146
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,140
You’re so good at taking pictures.

147
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,260
Is it cute?

148
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,220
Don’t, Tan. I’m busy here.

149

00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,540

- Thank you.
- Very good!

00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:16,700
Huh?

160
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,980
Higomaru!

161
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,300
They’re both here!!

162
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,360
They’re mascots for the Kumamoto castle, aren’t they?

163
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,860
Wow, so lucky.

164
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,580
Today is a lucky day for us both.

165
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,780
Y…yeah?

166
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,580
I mean a lucky day for all four of us.

167
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,900
We can take lots of nice pictures today.

168
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,700
Yeah, that’s right.

169
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,130

Come here quick!

173
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,740
Actually, you bought quite a lot of sweets here, Pheem.

174
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,900
Just a bit.

175
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,780
I only bought this much.

176
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,220
You also bought some.

177
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,340
Of course, or else I won’t be full.

178
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,620
You can share with me if yours isn’t enough.

179
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,660
- Okay.
- But not with Kie, though.

180
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,380
Kie.

181
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,860
You’re like a magic pill indeed.

182
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,500
I thought you were just bragging back then.

183
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,660
What do you mean?

184
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,400
That time when you said you’d heal her.

185
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,930
I think she’s completely healed now.

186
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,700
ince I’ve known her,

187
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,930
she has always looked so down and been in sorrow.

188
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,620
Her eyes always look sad even when she smiles or laughs.

189
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,380
I’ve never seen her this happy before.

190
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,200
From now on, I’ll never make her cry or disappointed again.

191
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,260
I guess I should really give now, huh?

192
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,740
One day, you’ll find that someone who’s perfect for you.

193
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,140
Someone who can make your heart flutter.

194
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,900
Someone who looks so cute no matter what she does.

195
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,620
So sweet…

196
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,380
and endearing.

197
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,740
Someone you’ll never want to take your eyes off of her.

198
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,260
Someone who’s destined to be with you.

199
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,460
Does Pock already have a boyfriend?

200
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,260
What?

201

Does Pock already have a boyfriend?

203

P…Pock?

204
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,460
No, not yet. She’s single.

205
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,260
I think she’s cute…

206
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,500
and endearing.

207
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,540
When I’m with her, I feel safe as if protected by the Buddha.

208
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,660
Are you serious?

209
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,860
Yes, I am.

210
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,900
Pock: Let me drink some water first.

211
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,220
Like that?

212
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,300
Have a safe flight, Tan.

213
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,980

214

Please take care of yourself too, Pheem.

215
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,100
Sorry about those times I used to make you feel uncomfortable.

216
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,730
I now know I’m not that person who can heal your heart.

217
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,180
The only one who can do it…

218
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,820
is Kie.

219
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,660

I still haven’t eaten many things with you and Pheem.

231

There are many more places I want you to go together.

232
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,860
Are we not going to see each other again?

233
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,660
Pock, I’m not going to war.

234
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,660
Geez, don’t overreact.

235
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,460
You guys already exchanged your LINE and Facebook, didn’t you?

236
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,700
Shut up! How did you know?

238

It’s called ‘making friends’, jerk. Stay out of this!

239
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,180
You should go now, Tan. Don’t you have to take many stops before you get there?

240
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,700
Have a safe flight.

241
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,300
See you later then, Pheem.

And I’ll never leave your side.

374
00:24:18,705 --> 00:24:20,205
Can’t sleep, huh?

375
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:23,725
Mhm, I can’t sleep.

376
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:34,005
But you have to go to work tomorrow.

377
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,675
I don’t know why I can’t sleep.

378
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:48,565
What should I do to make you sleep?

379
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:56,045
Sing for me then.

380
00:24:58,275 --> 00:25:02,205
Any song that will put me to sleep.

381
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:11,275

385
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:23,845
Do you swear that’s a lullaby song?

386
00:25:27,405 --> 00:25:31,645
I just to see you smile.

387
00:25:32,905 --> 00:25:36,605
So that you’ll finally forgive me.

388
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:43,205
Does this mean you’re not mad at me anymore?

389
00:26:04,325 --> 00:26:05,165
Pheem.

390
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:12,965
I have something to tell you.

391
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,445
All this time when you’re not by my side,

392
00:26:25,905 --> 00:26:27,305
I’ve always slept alone.

393
00:26:29,645 --> 00:26:30,765
Alone.

394
00:26:32,205 --> 00:26:33,525
And only miss this one person alone.

395
00:26:36,205 --> 00:26:37,945
That person is you.

396
00:26:44,075 --> 00:26:54,645
I’m sorry for wasting those time we should’ve spent together.

397
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:04,285
There’s a reason…

398
00:27:06,285 --> 00:27:09,085
that I had to hurt your feelings.

399
00:27:11,205 --> 00:27:13,445
It’s not that I wasn’t hurt too.

400
00:27:19,045 --> 00:27:21,075
I guess I just made it more complicated.

401
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:27,285
But now…

402
00:27:31,545 --> 00:27:33,605
I’m not going to let that happen again.

403
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:40,045
I love you.

404
00:27:49,845 --> 00:27:55,565
You know what? I’d tried so hard to forget you all this time.

405
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:02,605
Since that day when you left me…

406
00:28:06,905 --> 00:28:10,045
until lately when we met again.

407
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:17,005
But the moment I saw your face…

408
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,805
I could no longer do it.

409
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:26,505
I don’t understand why…

410
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:32,305
when it’s about you, things seem to look so easy.

411

412
00:28:40,145 --> 00:28:42,125
Can you promise me?

413
00:28:46,675 --> 00:28:54,045
That no matter what will happen, don’t ever let go of my hand again.

414
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:08,005
Yes, I promise.

415

416

Pheem, did you see a ghost last night?

430
00:31:33,075 --> 00:31:35,345
No, is there a ghost here?

431
00:31:35,905 --> 00:31:37,645
It’s not like that.

432
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:41,525
I just think you look a bit tired.

433
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,925
I thought you got spooked by a ghost last night.

434
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:46,875
Wait, or was it a blanket ghost?

435
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,525
Neh, not that. Probably a ghost that loves to eat your puss…

Just kidding.

439
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:03,485
Anyway, where were you when there was a power outage last night?

440
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,285
Last night?

441
00:32:05,285 --> 00:32:09,245
Someone at the filming set asked me to go buy something.

442
00:32:09,245 --> 00:32:10,725
So, I went out to buy it.

443
00:32:10,725 --> 00:32:13,885
But when I came back, I couldn’t find Kie in our room.

444
00:32:13,885 --> 00:32:18,045

00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:45,669
So that you can set the right direction.

553
00:37:45,669 --> 00:37:50,069
And make a direct and effective approach when problems arise.

554
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,989
Okay, I got it now.

555
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:56,429
No wonder why my dad has sent me to learn from you.

556
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:59,389
That’s because besides the president himself,

557
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:03,709
no one would dare to teach you and be honest with you as much as I do.

558
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:05,749
Are you ready to check out the factory?

559
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:07,149
Yes.

560
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:11,909
Mr. Miyajima, she’s ready.

561
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:14,789
Let’s begin, then.

562
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:20,389
First, I’ll show you the first part of this factory.

563
00:38:20,389 --> 00:38:22,829
Please follow me. We’ll go inside.

564
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:23,869
Please.

565
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:24,509
Okay.

566
00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:54,749
Kie.

567
00:39:55,069 --> 00:39:56,829
What are you doing?

568
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:01,049
It’s a morning kiss.

569
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:03,709
Wakie wakie.

570
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:07,489
Let me sleep a bit more.

571
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:11,269
We’ve been working non-stop for many days. I’m so tired.

572
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:17,189
Who said she’d do her best and finish the work before it’s scheduled?

573
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:18,419
Hmm?

574
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,789
Five more minutes, please.

575
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:29,829
If you don’t get up…

576
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:32,349
I’ll carry you to the bathroom.

577
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:37,789
Or should I…do this?

578
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:40,029
Do what?

579
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:42,829
Like this.

580
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:44,789
Kie.

581
00:40:45,989 --> 00:40:47,829
Stop it, Kie.

582
00:40:51,709 --> 00:40:53,269
Good morning.

583
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:56,249
Kie! We’re in trouble.

584
00:40:57,819 --> 00:41:01,089
The office in Thailand just called and asked us to submit the project earlier.

585
00:41:02,089 --> 00:41:04,669
Wait, when do we have to submit it?

586
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:06,289
A month earlier than scheduled.

587
00:41:08,149 --> 00:41:09,189
One month?!

588
00:41:09,189 --> 00:41:09,989
Yes.

589
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:11,549
We won’t be able to make it in time.

590
00:41:11,689 --> 00:41:14,349
That’s right. We’ve already sped up the production line.

591
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:16,629
This is the fastest we can do.

592
00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:18,269
What to do now?

593
00:41:20,649 --> 00:41:25,069
Let me call my dad. I’ll ask him what’s going on.

594
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:27,549
Good. We have to know the exact cause…

595
00:41:27,689 --> 00:41:28,829
in order to handle it.

596
00:41:30,149 --> 00:41:32,749
Okay then. But can you please come inside with me now?

597
00:41:32,749 --> 00:41:35,069
The engineer team is having a problem and we have no idea how to fix it.

598
00:41:35,069 --> 00:41:36,469
- Please.
- Let’s go.

599
00:41:37,819 --> 00:41:38,909
Hurry up.

600
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:47,989
Dad, what’s going on?

601
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:51,229
Why do we have to speed up this much?

602
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:53,389
Poj: We have to speed up the production process here too.

603
00:41:54,249 --> 00:41:57,049
Poj: Our major partner is having a problem with their production line…

604
00:41:57,489 --> 00:41:59,349
Poj: and can’t manufacture the products.

605
00:41:59,989 --> 00:42:01,989
Poj: I’m also pressured by the clients.

606
00:42:02,149 --> 00:42:04,749
What if we can’t make it in time, Dad?

607
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:09,349
Poj: That’d be a breach of contract, and we’d have to pay them remedies.

608
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:13,789
Poj: But what’s worse is that we’d lose our credibility.

609
00:42:13,789 --> 00:42:16,349
Poj: And we’d lose the entire deal with them.

610
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:19,109
Fine, I’ll try my best then.

611
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:26,149
Kie.

612
00:42:26,149 --> 00:42:29,629
Kie, my dad has been pressured too.

613
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:36,989
So, my company has been forced to do it too.

614
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:39,069
We have to help them, okay?

615
00:42:41,249 --> 00:42:42,549
I understand, Pheem.

616
00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:48,549
If we can’t make it happen this time, we’ll lose our credibility for good.

617
00:42:49,419 --> 00:42:52,589
Our competitors will steal all of our market share in the future.

618
00:42:55,389 --> 00:42:57,149
What should we do now?

619
00:43:00,269 --> 00:43:01,309
Listen.

620
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:07,189
We have to make this project successful, okay?

621
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:09,589
So, I need all of your help.

622
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:13,069
I believe you, you, you, and everyone here.

623
00:43:14,269 --> 00:43:17,229
So, do you want to go with me?

624
00:43:20,289 --> 00:43:23,709
I do! Let’s fight for it together.

625
00:43:25,029 --> 00:43:27,349
- Yes. / - Me too.
- I’ll do my best!

626
00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:31,029
Right now, with all information we have…Let’s go!

627
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,109
Don’t worry, Pheem.

628
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:40,189
I’ll do everything to make it in time.

629
00:44:29,989 --> 00:44:31,069
Just a second.

630
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:46,419
Pheem.

631
00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:51,669
You can go home first. My work is not done yet.

632
00:44:52,049 --> 00:44:54,109
I think I’ll have to come here again tomorrow.

633
00:44:54,789 --> 00:44:57,189
But it’s Sunday tomorrow.

634
00:44:57,619 --> 00:45:00,429
We’ve been working non-stop for so many days now.

635
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:02,249
I think you need some rest.

636
00:45:03,019 --> 00:45:07,589
I know it’s urgent we you need a work-life balance somehow.

637
00:45:08,049 --> 00:45:10,669
But we’re running out of time.

638
00:45:14,189 --> 00:45:16,469
We have a chance to be together here in Japan.

639
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:21,069
I thought I’d get to have some alone time with you.

640
00:45:23,749 --> 00:45:25,309
I’m so sorry, Pheem.

641
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,849
I really have to come here again tomorrow.

642
00:45:28,549 --> 00:45:32,019
We’re behind the schedule right now.

But…isn’t the job you’ll take care of tomorrow…

644
00:45:36,589 --> 00:45:39,709
what Tob actually has to be responsible for?

645
00:45:42,589 --> 00:45:47,829
Tob’s job is our team’s job which is in turn our company’s job.

646
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:51,229
And our company’s job is also your responsibility, Pheem.

647

You’re the executive. You might not have to do everything yourself.

648
00:45:55,869 --> 00:45:59,309

Or a fish market? Or Kirin Lake?

00:52:15,323 --> 00:52:17,183
Let’s go see the doctor.

728
00:52:17,923 --> 00:52:20,183
No, I’ll be fine.

729
00:52:20,183 --> 00:52:21,063
I want to go to work.

730
00:52:22,293 --> 00:52:24,423
How could you go to work when you’re this sick?

731
00:52:26,423 --> 00:52:27,543
Come here.

732
00:52:33,563 --> 00:52:34,943
Sit down slowly.

733
00:52:50,423 --> 00:52:53,293
Take these pills before you eat breakfast, okay?

734
00:52:54,523 --> 00:52:55,743
No, I don’t want to.

735
00:52:57,223 --> 00:52:58,463
Why are you so stubborn?

736
00:53:40,293 --> 00:53:41,583
Good girl.

737
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:47,383
- Can I..
- go to work now?

738
00:53:47,383 --> 00:53:51,263
Now, it’s time to rest.

739
00:53:51,623 --> 00:53:53,183
But I…

740
00:53:55,263 --> 00:53:56,663
Lie down.

741
00:53:59,623 --> 00:54:01,263
But I…

742
00:54:02,023 --> 00:54:02,823
Don’t be stubborn.

743
00:54:04,763 --> 00:54:05,563
Now, sleep.

744
00:54:09,263 --> 00:54:10,463
Close your eyes.

745
00:54:34,703 --> 00:54:36,103
Kie.

746
00:54:40,623 --> 00:54:41,523
You’re awake?

747
00:54:43,763 --> 00:54:46,543
Did I just pass out?

748
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:58,183
Why are you sitting here? Go back to sleep.

749
00:54:59,693 --> 00:55:00,983
Are you feeling better?

750
00:55:03,893 --> 00:55:07,263
Come, let me check your fever.

751
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,863
It’s still hot.

752
00:55:18,493 --> 00:55:21,463
Are you not going to work?

753
00:55:22,503 --> 00:55:26,583
How can I leave you alone when you’re like this?

754
00:55:27,063 --> 00:55:29,743
Just go to work. Or else we won’t get it done in time.

755
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:35,823
I already told Mr. Miyajima I’d be on leave today.

756
00:55:36,163 --> 00:55:38,903
I also tell Tob what to do in details.

757
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:45,703
The project is urgent and I’m being a burden to you like this,

758
00:55:45,943 --> 00:55:47,943
will we be able to get it done in time?

759
00:55:50,123 --> 00:55:57,183
Please don’t worry. Work is important but you're also important to me.

760
00:55:59,893 --> 00:56:02,463
You should go get some more rest.

761
00:56:27,563 --> 00:56:29,323
Yes, Tob?

762
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:31,983
What did you say?

763
00:56:33,563 --> 00:56:35,263
An accident at the factory?

764
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:49,583
Tob!

765
00:56:57,543 --> 00:56:58,583
Okay, done.

766
00:57:00,223 --> 00:57:01,623
Are you all right, Tob?

767
00:57:01,863 --> 00:57:03,063
I’m fine.

768
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:10,943
It’s just…I climbed up to check on the machine’s piping system.

769
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:13,303
And fell down.

770
00:57:14,363 --> 00:57:16,503
I’m sorry for causing you trouble.

771
00:57:16,823 --> 00:57:17,983
It was all my fault.

772
00:57:18,623 --> 00:57:19,943
It wasn’t your fault, Tob.

773
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:23,823
It’s mine. I shouldn’t have taken leave. I should’ve come here to help you at work.

774
00:57:27,523 --> 00:57:29,023
What should we do now?

775
00:57:31,063 --> 00:57:34,143
If we can’t get it done in time, we’d be so screwed.

776
00:57:43,323 --> 00:57:45,583
Go get some rest, Tob. Don’t worry about it here.

777
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:46,143
Okay.

778
00:58:01,693 --> 00:58:03,983
Why are we so unlucky?

779
00:58:04,623 --> 00:58:05,563
I’m sick…

780
00:58:07,123 --> 00:58:09,363
and now Tob’s wrist is broken.

781
00:58:15,323 --> 00:58:20,343
Don’t stress out, Pheem. In time like this, you have to put yourself together.

782
00:58:21,463 --> 00:58:27,863
Think of it as another lesson in work.

783
00:58:29,063 --> 00:58:33,263
One day, you’ll have to become the president…

784
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:39,303
and many more problems will be waiting ahead for you to fix them.

785
00:58:40,963 --> 00:58:41,763
Understood?

786
00:58:42,893 --> 00:58:44,263
What should I do now?

787
00:58:44,923 --> 00:58:47,503
There’s nothing you can do right now.

788
00:58:47,693 --> 00:58:54,103
You can only support and cheer up our team.

789
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:58,583
If you keep stressing out like this, it’d only discourage them...

790
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:01,343
and make them lose motivation,

791
00:59:02,293 --> 00:59:03,093
okay?

792
00:59:04,543 --> 00:59:09,163
Mhm, I’ll try.

793
00:59:17,163 --> 00:59:18,163
Hello, Kie.

794
00:59:19,623 --> 00:59:20,743
Yes, O?

795
00:59:21,493 --> 00:59:24,093
Olan: I have something urgent to tell you.

796
00:59:24,423 --> 00:59:25,943
Listen carefully.

797
00:59:26,423 --> 00:59:29,103
Our president is flying to Japan.

798
00:59:29,963 --> 00:59:31,663
He’ll come here himself?

799
00:59:32,023 --> 00:59:34,623
Yes, he has planned to go there for work anyway.

800
00:59:35,383 --> 00:59:37,703
He just added another topic for the meeting.

801
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:40,223
It’s about the accident and the production engineer.

802
00:59:40,223 --> 00:59:41,863
About the safety stuff.

803
00:59:42,103 --> 00:59:45,063
And you have to report them to him.

804
00:59:46,293 --> 00:59:48,663
Okay, thank you for letting me know.

805
00:59:52,063 --> 00:59:54,123
Is Dad going to come here?

806
00:59:54,693 --> 00:59:56,923
We made a mistake. We just have to admit it.

807
00:59:57,523 --> 00:59:58,923
I’ll go with you then.

808
00:59:59,093 --> 00:59:59,893
But…

809
00:59:59,893 --> 01:00:01,143
As a vice president.

810
01:00:23,923 --> 01:00:25,183
Please, sir.

811
01:00:40,293 --> 01:00:42,663
Kiran, Why weren't you at the site when it happened?

812
01:00:44,063 --> 01:00:48,423
Checking out the system on a high level like that, can you just do it alone?

813
01:00:49,363 --> 01:00:50,343
So?

814
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:52,223
Well...I

815
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:57,663
It was my fault, sir.

816
01:00:58,223 --> 01:01:00,063
I wasn’t present there that day.

817
01:01:00,863 --> 01:01:04,903
I just worked via my phone and wasn’t there to supervise the work myself.

818
01:01:06,103 --> 01:01:07,383
I’m truly sorry.

819
01:01:08,893 --> 01:01:13,063
But sir, it was an accident.

820
01:01:13,563 --> 01:01:15,103
That’s not an excuse.

821
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,563
You already know it's urgent.

822
01:01:20,293 --> 01:01:22,963
You’re a production engineer manager.

823
01:01:24,693 --> 01:01:25,493
I’m sorry.

824
01:01:25,763 --> 01:01:27,263
You’re reckless despite the job being urgent.

825
01:01:28,623 --> 01:01:32,063
It’d only make us fallen behind the schedule more.

826
01:01:32,783 --> 01:01:36,103
If it damages our company, can you be responsible for it?

827
01:01:36,103 --> 01:01:39,303
Honestly, I’m very disappointed in you.

828
01:01:40,623 --> 01:01:43,543
Write down a report on your mistakes and give it to me.

829
01:01:43,823 --> 01:01:45,823
I’ll put you on suspension for one week.

830
01:01:47,893 --> 01:01:51,383
Sir, this is not the time to find out who’s wrong.

831
01:01:52,463 --> 01:01:55,423
You said so yourself that we can’t waste any more time.

832
01:01:55,903 --> 01:02:00,023
A good executive should rather help his subordinates to fix the problems, shouldn’t he?

833
01:02:08,223 --> 01:02:09,103
Fine.

834
01:02:11,163 --> 01:02:12,963
I’ll just give you a warning this time.

835
01:02:13,723 --> 01:02:17,763
But you have to finish the assigned work within the given time limit.

836
01:02:19,293 --> 01:02:25,303
Our company will not extend your stay for this business trip for whatsoever reason.

837
01:02:26,463 --> 01:02:30,223
If you mess up again, you do know what’ll happen, don’t you?

838
01:02:30,693 --> 01:02:31,563
But, sir…

839
01:02:31,763 --> 01:02:32,563
Yes.

840
01:02:32,963 --> 01:02:34,823
I’ll get this project done as scheduled.

841
01:02:35,323 --> 01:02:37,293
And I will not make mistake again.

842
01:02:41,923 --> 01:02:42,723
Okay.

843
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:46,183
Go do your work at the factory.

844
01:02:46,363 --> 01:02:47,163
Yes.

845
01:02:51,623 --> 01:02:53,943
I apologize for this unfortunate event once again.

Thank you.

862
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,170
I haven’t seen you for many years,

863
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:39,510
aren’t you going to ask me a bit how I am?

864
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,090
How are you, Dad?

865
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:47,170
You’re probably mad at me about Kiran.

866
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:51,010
Is what you did to her purely justifiable…

867
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:53,130
and not something personal?

868
01:04:57,070 --> 01:05:01,810
This is a world of business. Everything that I do, I do it for a reason.

869
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:07,050
It’s rather you who are mixing business with pleasure.

870
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:10,670
Who said I’m mixing business with pleasure?

871
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:14,310
Your order to finish this project as soon as possible made me fall sick.

872
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:16,930
Kie had to take a day off to take care of me.

873
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:20,710
That’s why Tob had to work alone and got into an accident.

874
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:26,970
No matter what, Kiran is still the one to blame in this situation.

875
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:31,270
She’s carrying many people’s expectations on her shoulders.

876
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:35,840
If she did something wrong but got away, what would those people think of her?

877
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:37,870
But Dad…

878
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,530
Not to mention her position.

879
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:46,050
I first planned that after this project is done,

880
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:49,050
I’d promote her to be the manager.

881
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:52,850
Which means she’ll have more responsibilities.

882
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:56,690
If your subordinate makes any mistake, you as a manager also have to take responsibility.

883
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:03,530
That’s another thing you have to learn, dear.
And you should learn to control your emotions,

884
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:06,250
and always remain composed.

885
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:08,290
It’s not like that, Dad.

886
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:10,370
I said it out of sympathy.

887
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,070
We’re only just colleagues.

888
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,970
I thought you still love her.

889
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:23,770
Why should I?

890
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:27,890
Did you forget she was the one who left me…

891
01:06:28,370 --> 01:06:30,290
and hurt me so badly?

892
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:36,810
Don’t tell me she still hasn’t told you the truth?

893
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:41,170
What truth?

894
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,010
What truth, Dad?

895
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:49,210
Well…

896
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:52,050
Kiran broke up with you…

897
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:55,930
because of me.

898
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:05,250
Kiran and I had made a deal.

899
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:11,970
She must make you hate her so that you’d leave her to study abroad.

900
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:15,330
And she must not tell you about it.

901
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,670
She must not contact you until you graduate and come back.

902
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:25,170
All this on one condition that I had to grant her an offer.

903
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,170
What offer?

904
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:35,090
She asked me…

905
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:40,330
never to force you to do anything against your will again.

906
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:51,970
That’s why…

907
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:56,710
you’ve never forced me to do anything all these years.

908
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:03,250
Your freedom in life…

909
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:07,330
is earned with her own risk…

910
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:10,730
to be hated by you for the rest of her life.

911
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:18,410
Why am I the only one who never knows about this?

912
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:23,610
Do you have any idea how that breakup…

913
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:28,510
has left a deep scar in my life?

914
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:35,490
I’m sorry.

915
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:40,850
What should I feel now, Dad? I’m so confused.

916
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:47,410
All this time, I keep blaming her for never defending herself.

917
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,250
And she has never blamed it on anyone, Dad.

918
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:07,970
Kie!

919
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:09,470
Kie!

920
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:11,010
Kie! Open the door!

921
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:17,370
What took you so long?

922
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:22,040
I’m sorry. I fell asleep in the bath.

923
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:25,170
Why are you back so early?

924
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:29,850
Listen, dear.

925
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:33,870
Do you know why Kiran chose to apply for our company…

926
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:37,410
despite knowing she’d have to see my face every single day?

927
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:42,130
She said that…

928
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:46,530
it was the only chance she might get to see you.

929
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:52,050
The rest is up to you now…

930
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:56,130
how you’d deal with someone who cares for you more than herself.

931
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:59,490
Does this mean…

932
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:03,090
you’re not against me and Kie being together anymore?

933
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:07,170
If it’s your happiness, I’d never be against it.

934
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:10,570
But you have to clear it up with Poon yourself.

935
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:13,050
I’m your parent and I’ve already given him my word.

936
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:16,970
You can’t expect me to just call off the engagement without any rhyme or reason.

937
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:19,810
Did you approve because of the agreement you made with her?

938
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:27,730
It’s because she’s proven to me that you’re the only one she’s been waiting for.

939
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:59,850
I know the truth now.

940
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:02,840
Dad told me everything.

941
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:11,730
The truth…

942
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:17,370
Your agreement with my dad.

943
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,890
Do you know…

944
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:46,010
that that kind of decision you made…

945
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:52,890
is like a death penalty to me?

946
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:03,640
I’m sorry, Pheem.

947
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:09,070
Why did you agree to do it?

948
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:13,650
Didn’t you feel bad for me at all?

949
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,670
I didn’t want you and your dad to quarrel.

950
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:30,210
And I also didn’t want you to keep breaking your promises with other people…

951
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:32,570
while I was the cause of it.

952
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:37,370
What if I had got scared and really hated you?

953
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:40,650
Or what if I had decided to date someone else?

954
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:44,210
Would that be worth it for what you've sacrificed?

955
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,240
Yes, it would.

956
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:44,810
In the end, as long as you’re happy with what you’ve chosen…

957
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:49,130
that’s the most worthwhile thing for me.

958
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:54,870
I believe in your love, Pheem.

959
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:05,640
It doesn’t matter if that person you’d choose in the end is not me.

960
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,370
It’s up to you to decide.

961
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:14,010
You fool.

962
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:20,310
I already have that someone.

963
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:24,210
I’ve chosen her for so long.

964
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:28,310
And I’ll never change my mind.

965
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,370
That someone is you.

♫All this time, I keep dreaming of you at night♫

971
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:13,110
You're such a crybaby.

972
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:17,010
You look messy.

973
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:25,850
I’ll throw away all those pains in the past.

974
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:32,650
From now on, all those times I’ve lost…

975
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:38,930
I’m going to take every second of our happiness back.

976
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:54,170
Pheem, are we done talking?

977
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:57,210
Mhm.

978
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,110
We can continue talking if you want.

979
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:03,410
But…

980
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:07,250
you have to let me do it with you first.

981
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,370
Okay?

982
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:10,530
But…

01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:11,570
[Next Episode]
Congratulations to our new production engineer manager,

984
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:14,490
Kiran Pipittayaphongsa.

985
01:17:14,490 --> 01:17:15,770
Applause!

986
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,040
I want you to be more careful about your demeanor.

987
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:24,610
I wouldn’t mind if you and Kie are now seeing each other.

988
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:28,010
But you should clear up with Poon and settle about the engagement yourself.

989
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:29,210
Yes.

990
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:30,570
I already talked to my parents.

991
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:34,450
After the wedding, I’ll take care of everything for you.

992
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:35,930
I want to call off our engagement.

993
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:37,810
What is going on, Pheem?

994
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:40,850
If I can’t marry her,

995
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:42,570
then I’m going to expose her!

996
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,570
Did Poon threaten you and the president?

997
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:45,970
He said he’d expose us, that we’re having an affair.
