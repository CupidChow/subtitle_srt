[Previously]
If you can make Pheem go to study in England,

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,080
I’ll do one thing as you request.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,320
Yes! I’m seeing her. Are you happy now?

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,000
I did everything so that I could save this love between us.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,280
But why all I get in return is losing her?

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,760
Pheem!

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,040
Also, you must not get in touch with her while she’s still in England.

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,760
About work, if you need my help with any project,

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,080
you can always let me know.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,360
Right now, our company is working on a big project that requires a co-investment with a maker in Japan.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,120
Do you want to try working there?

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,040
Okay.

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,320
This is our engineering manager.

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,960
Kie!

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,680
Welcome, Pheem.

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,880
Thank you

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,760
Uh let's uh bring me everything what we talk today, okay?

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,480
O.

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes, Pheem?

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,160
Can you change it?

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,760
Change what, Pheem?

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,800
I want to change my mentor.

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,240
But why?

24
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,000
Kie is our best one here.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,320
She’s also the youngest manager in our company.

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,160
Well…

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,360
Since she’s so young, she might be lack of experience.

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,320
Pheem, You don’t have to worry about that.

29
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,200
Although she’s still young, she’s very talented.

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,480
She’s also an expert in the production line.

31
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,640
She’s been in charge of 4 or 5 lines already.

32
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,680
All of them with extremely high productivity and efficiency.

33
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,600
- But I…
- Changing your mentor…

34
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,280
is easy and not something that’s not possible.

35
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,480
But that means we’d have to change the workforce and frameworks…

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,920
that have already been planned too.

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,160
All that just to satisfy your need alone.

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,400
Let me repeat, you alone.

39
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,360
So, I hope you have a justified reason for this.

40
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Can you please tell us your reason?

41
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,360
Pheem.

42
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,040
I’m begging you, please.

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,720
Our president has specifically assigned this job himself.

44
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
Wait.

45
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,520
- Did you say my dad has assigned it?
- Yes.

46
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,560
And since then, he has never said otherwise.
How about this, Pheem.

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,600
Why don’t you try giving her a chance first?

48
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,880
If you still can’t do it,

49
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,240
I’ll go talk to your dad for you.

50
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,800
You’re now a vice president.

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,840
You can no longer use those excuses like when you were in high school.

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,520
Pheem.

53
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,560
I’m going back to Thailand soon. And Kie is the person I trust the most.

54
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,600
Can you please give her a chance?

55
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,080
Please, Pheem.

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,600
Fine!

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,680
I’m not changing my mentor then.

58
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,520
I’ll just do it for my dad’s sake.

59
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,720
Or else someone might call me unprofessional.

60
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,800
I’m so relieved.

61
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,960
Please take care of her for me.

62
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,120
You’re the person I trust the most.

63
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,560
Don’t worry, O.

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,480
Dad, why is Kie working for our company?

77
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,560
Why haven’t you told me about this?

78
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,680
And why did you assign her as my mentor?

79
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
Wait, calm down, dear.

80
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,880
Please ask me one question at a time.

81
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,760
Why is Kie working for our company?

82
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,480
She sent it her application like the others.

83
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,600
I saw that she’s qualified to work for us.

84
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,400
And everyone on the committee also agreed. So, I decided to hire her.

85
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,960
Then, why haven’t you told me about this?

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,520
Because you never asked.

87
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,720
I also didn’t want to mention her name to you.

88
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,840
You also don’t want anyone to mention about her, do you?

89
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,440
Why did you hire her?

90
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,160
Because she’s talented.

91
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,960
I don’t want to lose someone talented like her.

92
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,680
I’d surely regret it.

93
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,160
But why did you assign her to be my mentor?

94
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,560
That’s because Kie has to go on a business trip in Japan anyway.

95
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,360
And I think she’s good enough to teach you about your work.

96
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,280
I just think she’s a good fit for the job. You’re an executive.

97
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,360
You shouldn’t mix personal things with business.

98
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,560
You’ll officially become a vice president soon.

99
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,040
I want you to focus more on work.

100
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,720
And never mix pleasure with business.

101
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
Can you do that?

102
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,280
Yes.

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,680
Uncle, are you sure you can separate work from personal affairs?

104
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,120
Kie is very talented.

105
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,360
Like I told you,

106
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,760
I made an agreement with her.

107
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,800
You and Kie are good at keeping secrets.

108
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,200
It’s been 7 years and still no one knows about it.

109
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,240
But I can’t understand her though.

110
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,720
She agreed not to get in touch with Pheem.

111
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,360
And even asked you to stop forcing her.

112
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,600
But she didn’t ask you to call off the engagement or allow her to be with Pheem.

113
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,520
Yes, come to think of it…

114
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,800
that was very clever of her.

115
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,800
Asking me to stop forcing Pheem to do anything.

116
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,960
If one day, Pheem happens to like Kie again,

117
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,480
it’s a win-win for that girl.

118
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,560
I never knew Kie is quite fierce too.

119
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,880
And do you know…

120
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,720
what that girl also said to me?

121
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,200
I thought you’d ask me to allow you to be with Pheem.

122
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,080
If I had done that,

123
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,560
what would make me different from you?

124
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,600
You like to draw the path for her.

125
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,880
And make her do whatever you think is best for her.

126
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,640
But I’m not that complicated.

127
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,840
I only want her to be happy. And live life the way she wants.

128
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,280
In the end,

129
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,160
whether she’ll break off the engagement…

130
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,120
and get back together with me or not;

131
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,200
it’s for her to decide.

132
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,040
As long as she’s happy, that’s enough for me.

133
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,840
What you just said makes me look like a bad father.

134
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,960
I wouldn’t dare.

135
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,880
Well, I’m not going to argue anything.

136
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,240
Just keep your promise and do what we’ve agreed.

137
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,560
Yes.

138
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,960
Anything else?

139
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,840
Yes.

140
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,720
Go on.

141
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,640
Please have your secretary drafted two copies of this agreement.

142
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,520
One for you, and one for me.

143
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,160
I’ll keep it as evidence.

144
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,320
Thinking about what she said to me,

145
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,680
I couldn’t help but ask myself what kind of a parent I’ve been all this time.

146
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,040
Is that why you let Pheem do whatever she wants?

147
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,760
Kie is so smart, clever, and cautious like her grandmother Kimheng.

148
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,440
I have to say, “Like grandmother, like granddaughter” indeed.

149
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,960
Do you mean the grandma who owns this ally and the land around our house?

150
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,200
Yes.

151
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,800
I always pay her a visit during the New Year.

152
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,120
Sometimes, when I have problems about work, I also go talk to her.

153
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,000
I never knew Kie is her granddaughter.

154
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,480
Not until she called to make an appointment,

155
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,360
and said that her granddaughter wanted to see me.

156
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,760
That was when I found out.

157
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,640
Why did you allow her to look after Pheem in Japan then?

158
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,040
Aren’t you afraid Pheem will get hurt again?

159
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,240
I just do what I see fit.

160
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,640
Kie is smart and talented.

161
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
She can be Pheem’s mentor.

162
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,440
That’s all.

163
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,640
Really?

164
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,320
Here is information about the factory we’ll be visiting.

165
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,400
And also your work plan for the rest 3 months.

166
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,120
Hey.

167
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,160
That’s a lot, I can’t read all of them.

168
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,920
You have to.

169
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,480
Seriously, why did my dad send you for this job?

170
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,240
Go ask him if you want to know.

171
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,480
He’s not gonna tell me.

172
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,520
I have a better idea. Why don’t you just quit here while you still can?

173
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,000
Because once I officially become a vice president,

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,640
the first thing I’d do is…fire you.

175
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,280
Just tell me honestly,

176
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,160
there’re hundreds of companies in this world,

177
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,000
why did you have to apply for this company?

178
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,560
Do you really want to know?

179
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,320
Because working here…

180
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,960
is the one chance…

181
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,160
that I’d get to see Pheem when she’s back.

182
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,760
That’s not an answer which would make me agree to hire you, Kiran.

183
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,720
But since you’re Miss Kimheng’s granddaughter,

184
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,440
I’ll give you another chance.

185
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,880
I insist on the same answer.

186
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,800
At least, I’d like to help Pheem to do her best at work.

187
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,560
Okay.

188
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,320
I agree to hire you as our production engineer.

189
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,560
Thank you.

190
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,880
Our production line in Japan is much better than I expected.

191
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,320
Your plan for the new production line seems to work well.

192
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,360
It helps save a lot of time.

193
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
That’s right.

194
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,000
It also helps reduce up to 7% waste in the production line.

195
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,920
This is amazing.

196
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,920
Well done, Kiran.

197
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,640
It’s because everyone also did their best to help.

198
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,760
That’s why it turned out well.

199
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,560

About the project with Mr. Sato…

201
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,680
and finding a mentor for Pheem in Japan,

202
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,520
what should we do?

203
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,120
Is Pheem going to Japan?

204
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,520
Yes.

205
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,600
She has to train for her job there.

206
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,080
I’m looking for someone to be her mentor.

207
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,560
Then, I’ll take this project.

208
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,160
And I’ll also be her mentor.

209
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,600
That sounds great, sir.

210
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,320
Having Kie as her mentor,

211
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,400
Pheem will get to learn many things from her.

212
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,120
Can I trust you though?

213
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,080
Yes.

214
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,680
You won’t find anyone more sincere and direct in teaching her other than me.

215
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,760
Are you sure you can do as you said?

216
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,080
Yes.

217
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,640
Good.

218
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,640
I’ll assign you as Pheem’s mentor.

219
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,240
You have to help her succeed in this job.

220
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,120
Because this will be her first job.

221
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,200
And also her first achievement.

222
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,640
More importantly,

223
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,240
you must succeed and have everything completed as planned within 3 months.

224
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,720
Can you do that?

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,560
Yes. As long as you agree to let me work there,

226
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,640
I can do anything.

227
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,840
What if you can’t do it?

228
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,440
I’m willing to resign.

229
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440

230
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,080
It’s a tough job indeed.

231
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,320
Looking over the production line…

232
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,960
and also teaching Pheem.

233
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,640
Are you sure you can do it?

234
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,880
Of course, O.

235
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,800

00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,680
Yes.

00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,720

Yes, we do.

361
00:26:30,106 --> 00:26:33,146
It’s very important to be punctual.

362
00:26:33,146 --> 00:26:35,346
Especially in the business world.

363
00:26:35,346 --> 00:26:38,866
We’re supposed to arrive early before the meeting.

364
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:40,666
Not after when it’s already started.

365
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:42,666
Because that’d mean you’re not prepared for the meeting.

366
00:26:42,906 --> 00:26:46,186
And that is the first lesson for you, Miss.

367
00:26:46,186 --> 00:26:50,866
Tell me, who’s the vice president and who’s the manager now?

368
00:26:51,946 --> 00:26:53,626
You’re the VP, of course.

369
00:26:54,106 --> 00:26:55,746
But I’m your Sensei.

370
00:26:57,426 --> 00:26:58,746
What’s Sensei?

371
00:26:59,626 --> 00:27:03,866
Sensei means a teacher in Japanese.

372
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:06,586
And you’re now only an intern.

373
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:13,106
Listen, I really want both of us to succeed in this project.

374
00:27:13,106 --> 00:27:14,986
It’s your first job.

375
00:27:14,986 --> 00:27:17,026
I want it to be successful.

376
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:20,586
I know. I have to do my best too.

377
00:27:20,586 --> 00:27:22,626
So that I can continue working here.

378
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:25,826
I don’t want to go back home and see your smug face there.

379
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:28,306
But you’re seeing it now, aren’t you?

380
00:27:28,306 --> 00:27:34,586
I’m afraid when this project ends, you’d actually be so eager to go home.

381
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,746
Because you want to see my face more often.

382
00:27:40,266 --> 00:27:42,266
Here, eat them.

383
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:55,466
Lesson no.2.

384
00:27:56,666 --> 00:28:00,066
A vice president shouldn’t make a mess when eating.

385
00:28:08,466 --> 00:28:12,546
You should also carry a handkerchief.

386
00:28:24,706 --> 00:28:29,626
Hmm, this snack’s filling is quite sweet.

387
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:37,346
Hurry up and finish it, or we might be late.

388
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:57,666
Good morning!

389
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:58,826
Good morning!

390
00:28:58,826 --> 00:29:00,306
Good morning!

391
00:29:09,226 --> 00:29:10,706
Good morning!

392
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:34,986
- Morning!
- Good morning!

393
00:29:34,986 --> 00:29:36,866
Kie! Is everything going well?

394
00:29:38,586 --> 00:29:39,786
Miss Pheem!

395
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:42,746
Hello. She just came from Thailand.

396
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:44,586
Hello.

397
00:29:44,586 --> 00:29:47,706
Wow, you’re so pretty.

398
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:49,626
She’s the president’s daughter.

399
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:51,266
What?! Really?

400
00:29:51,266 --> 00:29:53,546
I’m so sorry. Geez, O. Why didn’t you tell me?

401
00:29:53,546 --> 00:29:55,586
- I just did.
- Should’ve told me earlier then.

402
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:58,866
Miss Pheem, this is Tob, an engineer at our company.

403
00:29:59,186 --> 00:30:00,786
Yes, sir. Hello, sir.

404
00:30:00,786 --> 00:30:03,346
Oh, please. No need to be so formal.

405
00:30:04,026 --> 00:30:06,946
Today, we’ll have a meeting with Mr. Sato.

406
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:10,186
Mr. Sato is a Japanese maker that our company has taken over his business.

407
00:30:10,186 --> 00:30:12,826
But Mr. Sato could hardly understand English.

408
00:30:12,826 --> 00:30:15,826
So, we’ve hired an interpreter to help translate during the meeting.

409
00:30:15,826 --> 00:30:17,466
She should be here soon.

410
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,786
Her name is Yumi.

411
00:30:22,426 --> 00:30:25,466
Yumi-san!

412
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:29,506
Why is everyone so excited about her

413
00:30:29,506 --> 00:30:33,946
Well, Miss Yumi is cute.

414
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:36,546
Kawaii and so sexy too.

415
00:30:36,546 --> 00:30:41,546
When she also attends the meeting, our employees can hardly sit still.

416
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:45,306
But it’s too bad she doesn’t like guys.

417
00:30:45,306 --> 00:30:50,026
I wonder who it is that she likes. Who is it?

418
00:30:50,026 --> 00:30:51,786
Who is it the Yumi likes?

419
00:30:52,506 --> 00:30:53,026
Ouch.

420
00:30:53,026 --> 00:30:55,586
Cut it off. Stop joking around.

421
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:56,946
You’re always like this.

422
00:30:56,946 --> 00:30:59,026
- What the heck?
- Oh, Yumi is here.

423
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:02,386
[Next Break]
Can I have one set of sushi please?

424
00:31:02,386 --> 00:31:03,626
You can speak Japanese?

425
00:31:03,626 --> 00:31:05,306
Just a little.

426
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:07,186
That interpreter girl must have taught you well.

427
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:09,026
Are you jealous?

Good morning!

Yumi-san!

Kee-san!

442
00:32:08,724 --> 00:32:10,764
I miss you!

443
00:32:12,484 --> 00:32:14,364
It’s Kie, not Kee (means poop in Thai).

444
00:32:15,044 --> 00:32:16,524
Kie-san.

445
00:32:16,524 --> 00:32:18,204
I miss you.

446
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:19,564
Do you miss me?

447
00:32:23,164 --> 00:32:25,164
These two seem close, O.

448
00:32:25,804 --> 00:32:27,284
They are close.

449
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:33,084
This is Yumi. She’s a Japanese interpreter.

450
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:36,524
She can speak English and a little bit Thai.

451
00:32:36,884 --> 00:32:38,884
Hello, I’m Yumi.

452
00:32:38,884 --> 00:32:40,644
Nice to meet you.

453
00:32:43,284 --> 00:32:44,804
Nice to meet you.

454
00:32:47,284 --> 00:32:50,444
Kie-san, have you had lunch?

455
00:32:50,444 --> 00:32:52,444
Do you want to go eat with me?

456
00:32:54,844 --> 00:32:56,564
Where’s Mr. Sato?

457
00:32:56,564 --> 00:32:59,844
Oh, actually…it’s about time.

458
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,044
I think Mr. Sato should be here in a…

459
00:33:02,044 --> 00:33:04,644
Oh, Sato-san! He’s here.

460
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:06,484
Hello.

461
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,444
Hello.

462
00:33:13,604 --> 00:33:18,684
He said his name is Sato. He’s the president of Honeycomb company.

463
00:33:19,524 --> 00:33:24,684
This is Miss Pheem, daughter of Mr. Poj, our CEO in Thailand.

464
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:32,964
He said he’s very happy to meet you.

465
00:33:32,964 --> 00:33:36,444
And he wants us to make this project successful together.

466
00:33:36,444 --> 00:33:37,684
We can do it!

467
00:33:38,204 --> 00:33:39,284
Fighto!

468
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:44,564
Fighto! Fighto! Fighto!

469
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:49,924
In today’s meeting, we’ll talk about a cooperation between Thailand and Japan.

470
00:33:50,804 --> 00:33:54,124
This project aims to increase the standard of safety trolleys.

471
00:33:54,124 --> 00:34:01,964
So, we’ll start this meeting with the purchase orders made from Japan to Thailand

472
00:34:01,964 --> 00:34:09,644
We’re ordering a large number of air conditioners. And since they are selling well in Thailand,

473
00:34:10,044 --> 00:34:16,564
we need to order more of them from Japan and have them shipped to Thailand.

474
00:34:25,284 --> 00:34:28,524
So…do you understand what it’s about?

475
00:34:29,204 --> 00:34:31,164
Mhm, I do.

476
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:36,684
Can you explain it to me? What is it that you understand?

477
00:34:39,284 --> 00:34:42,244
I understand what I have to do within the next 3 months.

478
00:34:43,004 --> 00:34:45,564
Wow, that’s broad.

479
00:34:59,404 --> 00:35:02,244
Where’s your note? You’re not jotting down anything.

480
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,684
You!

481
00:35:05,084 --> 00:35:06,324
Hmm?

482
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:15,324
What are you looking at, Miss?

483
00:35:15,604 --> 00:35:16,844
Please pay attention.

484
00:35:22,084 --> 00:35:24,404
Come, let me take notes for you.

485
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:26,244
Hey!

486
00:35:26,244 --> 00:35:27,604
Shhhh!

487
00:35:28,724 --> 00:35:29,764
Sorry.

488
00:35:30,924 --> 00:35:31,764
Pheem.

489
00:35:31,764 --> 00:35:33,884
Do you want me to repeat any part in particular?

490
00:35:48,684 --> 00:35:49,884
[Don’t be stubborn, or I’ll kiss you.]

491
00:35:58,964 --> 00:36:00,364
Pheem.

492
00:36:00,364 --> 00:36:03,404
Do you want to take a break first?

493
00:36:04,284 --> 00:36:06,604
No, thank you.

494
00:36:06,604 --> 00:36:07,644
Okay?

495
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,004
So, we’re done for the meeting today.

496
00:36:23,004 --> 00:36:24,444
Thank you everyone for coming.

497
00:36:24,444 --> 00:36:28,404
Let’s have a lunch break. We’ll meet again in the afternoon.

498
00:36:28,404 --> 00:36:29,764
Thank you.

499
00:36:29,764 --> 00:36:31,284
Thank you.

500
00:36:31,284 --> 00:36:32,604
Thank you.

501
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:34,804
Thank you.

502
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:40,804
Don’t forget to save the minute of meeting for today.

503
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:43,484
Kie-san!

504
00:36:43,484 --> 00:36:46,484
I have to attend the next meeting.

505
00:36:46,684 --> 00:36:49,844
See you at the party tonight, Kee-san.

506
00:36:49,844 --> 00:36:51,084
Kee again.

507
00:36:51,444 --> 00:36:52,404
Miss Pheem.

508
00:36:52,404 --> 00:36:55,804
I have to attend a meeting about materials with Mr. Sato and another supplier.

509
00:36:55,804 --> 00:36:58,044
So…Kie.

510
00:36:58,044 --> 00:37:00,284
Please take care of her for me.

511
00:37:01,324 --> 00:37:02,724
Don’t worry.

512
00:37:02,724 --> 00:37:05,964
I’ll take really good care of our VP.

513
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,484
Please take care of me too.

514
00:37:16,324 --> 00:37:17,484
Kie-san.

515
00:37:17,484 --> 00:37:21,604
Sato-san wants all the files we talked about today.

516
00:37:21,644 --> 00:37:23,684
Can you please send them to me?

517
00:37:24,004 --> 00:37:24,884
Sure.

518
00:37:26,164 --> 00:37:27,684
See you tonight!

519
00:37:43,404 --> 00:37:44,004
You.

520
00:37:44,004 --> 00:37:47,724
Are you here for training or strolling around?

521
00:37:50,484 --> 00:37:53,724
So, what do you want to eat for lunch?

522
00:37:54,484 --> 00:37:57,964
Aren’t you going to give your student any private time, Sensei?

523
00:37:58,604 --> 00:38:01,244
I can take care of my own lunch.

524
00:38:02,524 --> 00:38:04,684
You’ve never changed all these 7 years.

525
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:08,564
What do you mean?

526
00:38:11,444 --> 00:38:15,084
I mean…you’re as stubborn as ever.

527
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:19,564
And still look so cute when you get angry too.

528
00:38:20,684 --> 00:38:25,244
If it’s not something related to work, please don’t bother me with it.

529
00:38:26,244 --> 00:38:31,684
Then, just think of it as my advice for your training during the lunch break.

530
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:35,404
If you keep wasting time looking around, you might be late.

531
00:38:35,404 --> 00:38:39,044
Japanese people are very serious about time.

532
00:38:39,044 --> 00:38:41,084
- But I…
- Don’t be stubborn.

533
00:38:50,324 --> 00:38:52,364
What would you like to order?

534
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:55,204
What do you want, Miss?

535
00:38:55,524 --> 00:38:56,684
Just give me grilled fish.

536
00:38:59,844 --> 00:39:04,684
Can I have one Sushi set and…one Saba set, please?

537
00:39:04,684 --> 00:39:08,524
Yes, one Sushi set and one Saba set.

538
00:39:08,644 --> 00:39:11,364
Is that all you’d like to order?

539
00:39:11,364 --> 00:39:13,004
Yes, thank you.

540
00:39:13,004 --> 00:39:14,484
Thank you.

541
00:39:21,044 --> 00:39:23,924
You can speak Japanese?

542
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,804
Just a little.

543
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:33,204
That interpreter girl must have taught you well.

544
00:39:36,404 --> 00:39:37,804
Are you jealous?

545
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:45,124
Why would I?

546
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:49,604
Fine, not jealous then.

547
00:40:07,564 --> 00:40:08,764
Come, Miss.

548
00:40:10,804 --> 00:40:11,804
let me do it.

549
00:40:32,404 --> 00:40:35,124
Why are you looking at me like that?

550
00:40:36,724 --> 00:40:37,484
Nothing.

551
00:40:41,884 --> 00:40:44,004
Is there anything else I should know about our company?

552
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,644
Well…

553
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:53,684
Before that, an army must march on its stomach.

554
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:58,804
And with this grilled Saba, you’ll surely get all the ideas flowing.

555
00:40:59,164 --> 00:41:00,484
Go ahead.

556
00:41:03,324 --> 00:41:04,204
That’s enough.

557
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:06,884
Stop being so good to me.

558
00:41:08,164 --> 00:41:12,844
If you think that doing all this will make me forget what you used to do to me,

559
00:41:13,124 --> 00:41:14,684
you can forget it.

560
00:41:14,684 --> 00:41:17,244
And stop acting like we’re close.

561
00:41:17,924 --> 00:41:20,084
Don’t forget I’m still your vice president.

562
00:41:20,924 --> 00:41:22,244
Yes, Miss.

563
00:41:23,604 --> 00:41:26,924
Please enjoy your food then.

564
00:41:40,924 --> 00:41:43,884
Or if you’re too lazy to lift your hand,

565
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:45,844
I can feed you instead.

566
00:41:45,844 --> 00:41:49,124
Or if you’re too lazy to chew, I can also chew it for you.

567
00:41:49,124 --> 00:41:50,164
You.

568
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:53,164
Did you even listen to anything I just said?

569
00:41:54,764 --> 00:41:56,364
Aren’t you going to feel ashamed for a little?

570
00:41:57,124 --> 00:42:00,524
How do you spell ‘ashamed’?

571
00:42:13,204 --> 00:42:14,644
By the way, Miss.

572
00:42:15,684 --> 00:42:20,884
This evening after the meeting, our company will hold a welcome party for you.

573
00:42:22,724 --> 00:42:26,124
Miss, are you listening?

574
00:42:26,124 --> 00:42:27,364
I am.

575
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:29,124
Okay.

576
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:36,324
Have lots of Saba so that you’ll have a clear head.

577
00:42:45,284 --> 00:42:47,404
Pheem, please don’t be mad at me.

578
00:42:47,404 --> 00:42:49,724
I just don’t want you to feel stressed.

579
00:42:51,644 --> 00:42:54,164
No talking about private life, Sensei.

580
00:42:54,924 --> 00:42:57,764
We still have a few hours before the party.

581
00:42:57,884 --> 00:43:00,604
Do you want to go shopping first?

582
00:43:03,844 --> 00:43:06,484
That’s considered a basic personal right.

583
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:09,684
So, I refuse to take advice on that subject, Sensei.

584
00:43:10,164 --> 00:43:12,444
I want to be alone. I’m going back to the hotel.

585
00:43:17,284 --> 00:43:17,844
Hey.

586
00:43:19,444 --> 00:43:20,484
Why are you following me?

587
00:43:24,364 --> 00:43:26,884
Basic personal right.

588
00:43:27,524 --> 00:43:30,004
I’m also going back to the hotel to get some rest.

589
00:43:31,404 --> 00:43:33,484
Please stop asking any further questions.

590
00:43:33,964 --> 00:43:37,124
Because it’s considered my personal right.

591
00:43:56,924 --> 00:43:57,724
Yes?

592
00:43:58,684 --> 00:44:00,804
I don’t think Pheem is okay with me.

593
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:04,924
Her every word is like a razor cutting to my heart.

594
00:44:04,924 --> 00:44:06,844
I could’ve died right then and there.

595
00:44:07,764 --> 00:44:08,764
Listen.

596
00:44:09,404 --> 00:44:11,244
She has the right to be so mad though.

597
00:44:11,244 --> 00:44:12,804
You hurt her so badly.

598
00:44:12,804 --> 00:44:15,084
You suddenly show up after disappearing for 7 years.

599
00:44:15,084 --> 00:44:18,044
Do you expect her to throw herself at you and give you a kiss?

600
00:44:23,404 --> 00:44:24,284
That’d nice though.

601
00:44:25,324 --> 00:44:27,364
But seeing her like that,

602
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:33,084
my dream to get back together with her…

603
00:44:33,084 --> 00:44:35,324
is probably just a dream now.

604
00:44:37,844 --> 00:44:40,484
I can barely make her talk to me nicely.

605
00:44:41,524 --> 00:44:44,204
So what? Are you going to give up?

606
00:44:50,244 --> 00:44:51,084
Never.

607
00:44:51,884 --> 00:44:53,524
If I give up now,

608
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,284
what I’ve been waiting for all these 7 years would mean nothing.

609
00:44:56,284 --> 00:44:58,044
Then what?

610
00:45:01,084 --> 00:45:04,444
I’m going to use the last method I’ve planned.

611
00:45:05,604 --> 00:45:07,044
What? How?

612
00:45:08,204 --> 00:45:11,124
Be thick-skinned and keep going after her.

613
00:45:11,884 --> 00:45:16,444
Well, you can do that.

614
00:45:16,804 --> 00:45:18,524
But I think the easiest way…

615
00:45:18,524 --> 00:45:21,964
is that you should stop being so tight-lipped and tell her honestly how you feel.

616
00:45:21,964 --> 00:45:23,244
Otherwise, it will turn out to be…

Geez, Pock. I’m hanging up.

620
00:45:37,084 --> 00:45:39,204

Pheem, after today, you’ll have 2-3 days for your free time.

638
00:47:07,108 --> 00:47:11,748
If you want to go to an onsen around here, I’ll ask Kie to take you there.

639
00:47:12,108 --> 00:47:15,548
Sure, O. I’d be glad to do that.

Oh, I have to fly back to Thailand tomorrow.

From now on, Kie will be the one who takes care of you.

If you have any question, you can ask her.

Don’t worry about work, I’m going to do my best to make it successful.

00:54:16,828 --> 00:54:19,668
So much!

720
00:54:21,348 --> 00:54:24,548
That’s because you’re stubborn. You should’ve listened to me.

721
00:54:25,908 --> 00:54:27,708
Now you’re hurt.

722
00:54:27,708 --> 00:54:32,188
I’m not stubborn.

723
00:54:34,148 --> 00:54:35,348
Ouch!

724
00:54:35,948 --> 00:54:36,628
Sorry.

725
00:54:41,308 --> 00:54:43,028
Do you feel better?

726
00:54:47,468 --> 00:54:51,068
Let’s try standing up.

727
00:54:51,068 --> 00:54:52,108
Okay.

728
00:55:13,988 --> 00:55:16,268
Your shirt is so thin, Miss.

729
00:55:18,868 --> 00:55:21,388
Please wear this.

730
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:45,628
Thanks.

731
00:55:47,268 --> 00:55:49,668
Aren’t you cold?

732
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:52,828
I’m fine.

733
00:55:54,428 --> 00:55:58,988
I don’t believe you. You’re getting goosebumps everywhere

734
00:56:02,508 --> 00:56:08,508
I have a scarf in my bag. Let me wrap it around your neck.

735
00:56:41,588 --> 00:56:43,508
Well…

736
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:48,188
Let’s go back to the hotel. Can you walk?

737
00:56:49,388 --> 00:56:50,428
No.

738
00:56:53,628 --> 00:56:54,628
So..

739
00:56:58,148 --> 00:56:59,708
Get on my back then.

740
00:57:07,748 --> 00:57:10,748
Just like the old days, isn’t it?

741
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:17,468
[Phone ringing]

742
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:22,188
I guess that’s about work.

743
00:57:24,828 --> 00:57:25,908
Why aren’t you picking up?

744
00:57:26,988 --> 00:57:30,428
It might be something important.

745
00:57:31,348 --> 00:57:34,548
Okay, I’ll put you down first.

746
00:57:46,228 --> 00:57:50,788
[YUMI: Goodnight Kiss!]

747
00:57:56,788 --> 00:57:58,068
Pheem.

748
00:57:58,628 --> 00:58:02,348
Pheem... it’s not like that.

749
00:58:02,828 --> 00:58:03,988
Pheem.

750
00:58:05,228 --> 00:58:09,068
Pheem. Listen, Pheem.

751
00:58:09,508 --> 00:58:18,028
It’s…Pheem! Pheem! Hey, isn’t your leg hurt anymore?

752
00:58:20,548 --> 00:58:21,708
Yes?

753
00:58:22,668 --> 00:58:24,068
When will you arrive?

754
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:29,188
I just told you I’ll reach there by 7 tomorrow morning.

755
00:58:29,188 --> 00:58:31,628
I just came out of the shower and will go to the airport after this.

756
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:34,108
What’s with the rush?

757
00:58:34,908 --> 00:58:38,748
Can’t you hurry up? Tell your captain uncle to be as fast as he can.

758
00:58:38,988 --> 00:58:43,068
Kie, I’m getting on a plane, not a mini-bus.

759
00:58:43,068 --> 00:58:46,588
How could I rush him like that? Are you nuts?

760
00:58:47,948 --> 00:58:51,108
What now? Can’t you just hang in there any longer?

761
00:58:52,828 --> 00:58:58,028
I guess so. I can’t see anyway out for me and Pheem.

762
00:58:58,828 --> 00:59:03,548
Don’t be afraid, buddy. Just like what a wise Chinese philosopher used to say…

763
00:59:03,548 --> 00:59:06,148
if there’s no way out, then just exit the way you came in.

764
00:59:07,228 --> 00:59:07,948
Who said that?

765
00:59:08,788 --> 00:59:12,628
His name is “Wang Yiao Niao” from the Mor Dynasty.

766
00:59:13,748 --> 00:59:15,108
I’ve only heard of the Tang Dynasty.

767
00:59:16,308 --> 00:59:16,828
Geez!

768
00:59:17,508 --> 00:59:20,868
Geez, it’s a long-lost dynasty that existed a long time ago. You don’t have to pay attention to it.

769
00:59:20,868 --> 00:59:24,068
Listen, Kie. Just calm down first.

770
00:59:24,068 --> 00:59:28,508
Once I get there tomorrow, I’ll take care of everything for you.

771
00:59:28,508 --> 00:59:30,668
Trust me, you’ll definitely get Pheem back.

772
00:59:30,668 --> 00:59:33,388
I was able to make you two a couple before,

773
00:59:33,388 --> 00:59:35,988
having you two making up is so “chirp chirp” (easy peasy).

774
00:59:36,148 --> 00:59:41,468
Hey, you know you aren’t allowed to bring pets on the plane, right?

775
00:59:42,148 --> 00:59:46,468
I don’t think you can take a bird with you.

776
00:59:47,028 --> 00:59:52,748
Geez, by ‘chirp chirp’ I meant easy peasy.

777
00:59:53,028 --> 00:59:56,988
Why did I ever choose to be friends with a moron like you? Bye!

778
01:00:21,428 --> 01:00:23,988
Where to get a train to the city?

779
01:00:27,068 --> 01:00:28,068
Oh, sorry!

780
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:42,348
You’re welcome. No, I mean. It’s okay.

781
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:44,068
You’re okay, right?

782
01:00:44,068 --> 01:00:45,548
Yes.

783
01:00:49,148 --> 01:00:50,388
Thank you

784
01:00:58,348 --> 01:01:00,388
Wow, so handsome.

785
01:01:00,388 --> 01:01:03,148
I lost my brain for a while there.

786
01:01:08,628 --> 01:01:11,108
Should I follow the map or my heart?

787
01:01:11,108 --> 01:01:14,468
Map or my heart? Map or my heart? Map or my heart?

788
01:01:15,108 --> 01:01:16,708
I’ll follow my heart then.

789
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:26,908
Can I sit with you, Pheem?

790
01:01:29,188 --> 01:01:31,908
Who said you can call me by my name? Call me Miss.

791
01:01:33,548 --> 01:01:37,988
It’s a holiday today. Do you still want me to address you by your title, my lady?

792
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:47,348
Give me some too…my lady.

793
01:01:47,988 --> 01:01:48,708
Hey.

794
01:01:50,828 --> 01:01:56,988
Fine, no more teasing. Please give me some too since you’re holding it anyway.

795
01:02:10,748 --> 01:02:16,748
Eat it. I even squeezed it out for you. Don’t let me down. Eat all of it.

796
01:02:16,748 --> 01:02:20,788
Yeah…okay.

797
01:02:30,188 --> 01:02:33,668
Hmm, so sweet.

798
01:02:34,468 --> 01:02:36,188
Then, come.

799
01:02:36,868 --> 01:02:41,028
You should eat all of it. I’m going to sit here and watch you finish it.

800
01:02:45,148 --> 01:02:47,108
Open your mouth.

801
01:02:58,188 --> 01:02:59,708
Just a second.

802
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:05,748
Hi, have you arrived? Okay, I’ll pick you up.

803
01:03:07,548 --> 01:03:10,628
I really want to eat it, Pheem.

804
01:03:10,628 --> 01:03:13,588
But my friend is waiting at the airport. I have to go pick her up now.

Do you want to go to an onsen with me?

806
01:03:20,868 --> 01:03:21,508
Sure.

807
01:03:21,508 --> 01:03:24,588
Oh, that sounds interesting. I’m also thinking of taking her there.

808
01:03:24,588 --> 01:03:28,388
You’re asking to tag along so easily like this, don’t you have anything to exchange for it?
