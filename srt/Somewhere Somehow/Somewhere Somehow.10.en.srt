Pock said let’s meet at the shrine.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,840
Just harvest it as much as you can.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,360
Is Kie the owner of that gear necklace, Pheem?

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,600
Does this mean Tan has to meet Kie?

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,000
Wouldn’t she get jealous?

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,320
Back then when we were in this kind of situation,

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,920
she would just walk away.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,160
But this time she fought back and didn’t back down at all.

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,080
So, are you going to change your mind?

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,320
No.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,720
Why would you come back and hurt her again?

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,240
I’m not going to hurt her.

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,880
I’m going to use the rest of my life to heal her.

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,440
That’s my girl, buddy.

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,960
Pheem is going to use an Onsen. You should go remind her of the old time together.

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,880
Go now! Good luck chuck, buddy. Hope you and her will make up soon.

17
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,120
What are you thinking?

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,080
Hey! How did you get in here?

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,880
I just walked in. No one said I couldn’t use it.

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,320
The room is so big, why do you have to sit here?

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,280
Wow, you still look as pretty as ever.

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,440
Kie! Go away. Don’t look.

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,680
What? I was just being honest.

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
I just described what I saw…that you’re really pretty.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,400
I said don’t look! Don’t look!

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,640
Pheem, if you keep hitting me, you’d get even more naked.

27
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,200
Turn around!

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,200
No need to be so shy. I used to see you naked before.

29
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,440
I said don’t look!

30
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,400
Fine, I won’t.

Well…

35
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,800
Do you want to move to a bigger zone?

36
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
The view is much prettier there.

37
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,920
But it’s okay if you’re scared.

38
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,400
Why would I be scared?

39

Geez, the tension here is so thick I could cut it with a knife.

194
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:50,892
Here, Pheem.

195
00:17:52,252 --> 00:17:54,892
Thanks, but just eat it.

196
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,372
Here, Kie.

197
00:18:01,012 --> 00:18:05,012
Just eat something.

198
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:07,052
You hardly ate anything earlier.

199
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:08,452
I don’t want it.

200
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:13,012

00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:17,452
A strong one too.

204
00:18:24,892 --> 00:18:26,132
Hey, take it easy.

205
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:29,372
Wait. It’s not fun if you keep drinking alone like that.

206

Why don’t we have a duel? You and me.

208
00:18:34,172 --> 00:18:35,372
Don’t do it, Kie.

209
00:18:36,052 --> 00:18:39,292
It depends on what the winner would get.

210
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:52,372
The winner will get to sit next to Pheem on a train.

211
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:54,492
Do you want it?

212

Sure. Let’s do it.

213
00:18:59,732 --> 00:19:01,572
Geez, Kie!

214
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:04,692
Let’s start.

215
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:21,772
Easy there.

216
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:30,852
- Enough, Tan.
- Kie.

217
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:35,852
Please, Pheem. This is between Kie and me.

218
00:19:37,412 --> 00:19:38,372
Cheers.

219
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:51,012
Go on then. Just get wasted all you want.

220
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:54,252
Just do whatever you want.

221
00:19:54,412 --> 00:19:56,532
Wait, Pheem. Where are you going?

222
00:19:57,332 --> 00:20:00,772
I’ll get some air outside. It’s frustrating in here.

223
00:20:00,852 --> 00:20:02,492
Hold on, wait for me too.

224
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,132
I’ll be right back, Kie.

225
00:20:04,132 --> 00:20:04,932
Pheem.

226
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:12,812
Hey, do you still want to do it?

227
00:20:13,852 --> 00:20:15,652
Sure, bring it on.

228
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:18,772
Cheers!

229
00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:30,132
Pheem, can we talk?

230
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,292
Is it about Kie?

231
00:20:37,172 --> 00:20:38,452
Mhm.

232
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:45,252
I don’t know what you and Kie are fighting about.

233
00:20:46,172 --> 00:20:48,252
But I can honestly tell…

234
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:51,972
that Kie feels really bad about it.

235
00:20:55,532 --> 00:20:57,372
She already told you, didn’t she?

236
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,252
Not at all, Pheem.

237
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:07,092
It’s because she didn’t tell me anything, that’s why I know she feels so horrible.

238
00:21:15,132 --> 00:21:16,492
I hate myself.

239
00:21:18,532 --> 00:21:21,812
I hate how I made everything look so easy for her.

240
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:28,692
Seven years, Pock. I had to suffer and live with those pains for 7 years.

241
00:21:29,652 --> 00:21:32,572
With those questions I never got to hear the answer from her.

242
00:21:36,012 --> 00:21:40,332
Then she just came back into my life and acted like nothing happened.

243
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:44,852
Acted like we were close like before.

244
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:48,092
But actually, we’ve just met for only 3-4 days, Pock.

245
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:51,892
She never explains anything to me.

246
00:21:53,372 --> 00:21:55,612
Do you think that’s fair?

247
00:21:58,092 --> 00:22:01,292
Pheem, please calm down and listen to me.

248
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:07,452
I understand everything, Pheem. But so what, if it’s been only 3-4 days?

249
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:10,852
You said you have suffered for 7 years.

250
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:15,852
Do you want her to suffer for another 7 years too?

251
00:22:16,572 --> 00:22:21,252
Listen, Pheem. This is love we’re talking about, not an equation.

252
00:22:21,572 --> 00:22:25,012
Both sides don’t always have to be equal.

253
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:28,212
Life is so short, Pheem.

254
00:22:28,212 --> 00:22:35,252
Too short to make yourself suffer while you and her still love each other this much.

255
00:22:41,052 --> 00:22:42,212
Also,

256
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:48,372
how do you know Kie hasn’t suffer during the past 7 years?

257
00:22:50,492 --> 00:22:52,052
Of course, she hasn’t.

258
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:57,252
She still has Sine. But I have no one.

259
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,772
She dumped me, Pock.

260
00:23:01,452 --> 00:23:06,932
No, Pheem. Since that day Kie broke up with you, she hasn’t dated anyone.

261
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:08,972
Shit!

262
00:23:10,052 --> 00:23:13,452
What do you mean, Pock?

263
00:23:15,052 --> 00:23:15,492
Well…

264
00:23:15,492 --> 00:23:19,492
If she hasn’t dated anyone all this time, why did she never contact me?

265
00:23:20,812 --> 00:23:22,012
I don’t believe you.

266
00:23:22,772 --> 00:23:25,372
Shit, I’m so screwed.

267
00:23:26,932 --> 00:23:27,972
Well, it’s…

268
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:29,652
Tell me…

269
00:23:29,652 --> 00:23:30,412
- Pock.
- Huh?

270
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,452
Please tell me.

271
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:36,492
Okay, listen, Pheem.

272
00:23:37,052 --> 00:23:41,012
It’s just…I’m not supposed to tell you anything.

273
00:23:41,412 --> 00:23:43,932
And I don’t think Kie would tell you anything too.

274
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:51,292
Because if she does, it would be like blaming it on someone. Yeah, that’s right.

275
00:23:52,372 --> 00:23:54,412
What are you talking about? I don’t get it.

276
00:23:55,972 --> 00:23:57,932
Geez, what to do now?

277
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:00,012
Please tell me.

278
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:01,612
Okay, fine.

279
00:24:01,612 --> 00:24:05,172
Listen, I can only tell you this.

280
00:24:05,452 --> 00:24:11,852
If your definition of love is to take all the pain just to be with the one you love,

281
00:24:12,092 --> 00:24:17,132
Kie’s definition of love is to let the person she loves live freely.

282
00:24:17,772 --> 00:24:21,332
That’s all I can say. I can’t tell you anything more.

283
00:24:21,732 --> 00:24:25,732
Let’s just say…you’ll get it one day.

284
00:24:27,252 --> 00:24:31,532
Geez, damn it! That’s all I can say, Pheem.

285
00:24:31,532 --> 00:24:33,892
I’ve done my best. I’m going now.

286
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:36,492
Pock!

287
00:24:39,932 --> 00:24:42,492
Pock, wait. Pock!

288
00:24:42,492 --> 00:24:43,692
Don’t pressure me, Pheem!

289
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,452
Pock, please tell me more!

290
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:50,892
Come on, Tan! Quickly!

291
00:24:50,892 --> 00:24:54,172
Sure, I’m not going to give up.

292
00:25:00,372 --> 00:25:01,572
More!

293
00:25:01,612 --> 00:25:05,692
Calm down, Kie! Easy there, buddy.

294
00:25:06,012 --> 00:25:07,132
That’s enough.

295
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:08,932
Enough, Kie.

296
00:25:08,932 --> 00:25:12,052
Geez, let’s stop.

297
00:25:12,572 --> 00:25:14,012
You moron. Stop it.

298
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,292
Why? We still don’t have the winner.

299
00:25:15,292 --> 00:25:16,772
That’s enough, Kie.

300
00:25:16,772 --> 00:25:17,172
Stop.

301
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:18,612
Where’s your glass? Give it to me.

302
00:25:18,612 --> 00:25:22,252
What do you mean? We still don’t have the winner.

303
00:25:23,492 --> 00:25:24,892
Let’s go home.

304
00:25:25,372 --> 00:25:27,652
No, I’m fine. Bring me more.

305
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,812
Geez, that’s enough. Let’s stop.

306
00:25:29,812 --> 00:25:31,572
Give me your glass. Let’s drink till drop.

307
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:32,732
Enough.

308
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,292
I said let’s go!

309
00:25:39,332 --> 00:25:40,412
Bill, please.

310
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:45,052
Who’s the winner then?

311
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:48,132
Let’s go. Get up.

312
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:48,972
Can you walk?

313
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:50,612
Sure. I’m good.

314
00:25:50,612 --> 00:25:51,692
Can you walk?

315
00:25:55,572 --> 00:25:58,012
Shit, you rascal!

316
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:00,812
Kie! Wait up!

317
00:26:00,812 --> 00:26:02,612
Geez, Kie!

318
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:04,292
Hold it. Geez!

319
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:08,412
Damn you, Kie.

320
00:26:08,412 --> 00:26:09,972
Geez, how are you feeling?

321
00:26:10,212 --> 00:26:11,412
Damn it.

322
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:13,932
Will any dog just show up around here?

323
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,012
What are you looking for, Pock?

324
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:18,212
I’m looking for dogs.

325
00:26:19,212 --> 00:26:21,372
Huh? Are you afraid they’d bite you?

326
00:26:21,652 --> 00:26:24,532
Don’t worry, they hardly have any stray dogs here in Japan.

327
00:26:25,012 --> 00:26:27,332
It’s not because of that. It’s rather something else.

328
00:26:27,692 --> 00:26:30,852
Kie, can you walk? Are you okay?

329
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,372
Sure?

330
00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:35,012
Kie!

331
00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:36,732
Geez.

332
00:26:37,732 --> 00:26:41,692
I never thought Kie could be this drunk.

333
00:26:41,772 --> 00:26:43,892
Stop it, Tan.

334
00:26:44,132 --> 00:26:47,172
It’s all your fault. Why did you challenge her to do it?

335
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,972
Can’t you see what she’s like now?

336
00:26:49,892 --> 00:26:53,172
Pheem, calm down. Please calm down.

337
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:56,052
Kie, are you all right?

338
00:26:56,052 --> 00:26:58,612
How can we go back then?

339
00:26:59,172 --> 00:27:01,572
Are you okay now? Okay, buddy?

340
00:27:02,892 --> 00:27:03,392
Kie

341
00:27:03,932 --> 00:27:08,292
What? Oh.

342
00:27:09,572 --> 00:27:11,692
Okay, just sit.

343
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:15,612
Geez, Kie. Are you okay?

344
00:27:18,652 --> 00:27:20,252
Are you okay, Kie.

345
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:21,252
Are you okay?

346
00:27:27,132 --> 00:27:28,492
Geez, let’s go.

347
00:27:28,492 --> 00:27:29,492
Careful.

348
00:27:29,492 --> 00:27:31,092
Easy there.

349
00:27:31,132 --> 00:27:33,972
Seriously, you just ruined the party.

350
00:27:34,092 --> 00:27:36,972
Let’s go.

351
00:27:36,972 --> 00:27:38,372
Careful there.

352
00:27:41,212 --> 00:27:42,812
Pock…so…

353
00:27:42,812 --> 00:27:43,332
Yeah?

354
00:27:43,692 --> 00:27:45,772
are you sure you can handle her tonight?

355
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:47,092
Of course.

356
00:27:47,892 --> 00:27:51,252
Oh, I mean I don’t think so.

357
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:56,052
Suddenly, I feel like I might have the runs again.

358
00:27:58,652 --> 00:28:00,492
Why are you coughing if you have a stomach ache?

359
00:28:01,812 --> 00:28:07,132
Oh, it’s just…I guess the gas just got pushed up from my ass through my mouth.

360
00:28:07,132 --> 00:28:11,172
So, it makes me keep…coughing like this.

361
00:28:11,772 --> 00:28:13,012
Never heard of that before.

362
00:28:13,612 --> 00:28:19,252
Pheem, I’ll go buy some medicine first.

363
00:28:19,252 --> 00:28:21,772
I don’t have any more of it in my room.

364
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:22,812
Okay?

365
00:28:22,812 --> 00:28:25,412
Who’s going to take care of her then?

366
00:28:25,692 --> 00:28:29,492
Can I leave her with you for a while?

367
00:28:29,772 --> 00:28:32,492
If I don’t get the medicine now,

368
00:28:32,612 --> 00:28:34,852
I don’t think I’d be able to look after her.

369
00:28:34,932 --> 00:28:37,652
I’d just keep going in and out of the toilet.

370
00:28:37,772 --> 00:28:39,372
Please look after her for me.

371
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:40,692
- But I…
- Pleaseeee.

372
00:28:40,692 --> 00:28:42,012
Ouch, my stomach. Can’t hold it anymore, Pheem.

373
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,332
- But…
- Please take care of her. Pleaseee.

374
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:50,132
Listen, if you take her with you,

375
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:54,932
you might find out something I couldn’t tell you earlier.

376
00:29:00,892 --> 00:29:02,132
Oh, okay.

377
00:29:04,012 --> 00:29:07,812
I’ll walk you to the hotel first, and I’ll go buy medicine later.

378
00:29:08,212 --> 00:29:09,332
Let’s go, Kie.

379
00:29:09,532 --> 00:29:13,772
You girls can take care of yourselves, right? I’ll just hang out here for a while then.

380
00:29:14,492 --> 00:29:15,292
Mhm.

381
00:29:15,612 --> 00:29:17,812
Let’s go, Kie. Be careful.

382
00:29:18,212 --> 00:29:18,852
Hold on.

383
00:29:19,372 --> 00:29:20,372
Go home safely.

384
00:29:21,132 --> 00:29:22,892
- Easy there, Kie.
- Be careful.

385
00:29:22,892 --> 00:29:24,852
Geez, Kie.

386
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:30,132
Damn you. I have a stomach ache but I still have to carry you.

387
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:49,132
Be careful.

388
00:29:49,132 --> 00:29:50,012
Wait.

389
00:29:50,012 --> 00:29:51,772
Hold on, Kie.

390
00:29:51,772 --> 00:29:53,612
Okay.

391
00:29:53,612 --> 00:29:54,972
Put your arm on my shoulder.

392
00:29:54,972 --> 00:29:55,332
Let’s go.

393
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:57,452
Easy there.

394
00:29:58,412 --> 00:29:59,732
Be careful, Pheem.

395
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,172
Okay.

396
00:30:01,172 --> 00:30:02,572
Careful there. Watch your steps.

397
00:30:02,572 --> 00:30:03,412
Let’s go.

398
00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:04,332
She’s so wasted.

399
00:30:04,332 --> 00:30:04,972
Okay.

400
00:30:06,052 --> 00:30:10,092
Geez, wait.

401
00:30:13,692 --> 00:30:15,892
Can you handle it, Pheem?

402
00:30:16,572 --> 00:30:17,372
Mhm.

403
00:30:18,492 --> 00:30:23,212
The pharmacy that I want to buy medicine is just around here.

404
00:30:23,892 --> 00:30:29,172
Don’t worry, Pock. Just go do your things. I’ll call a cab from here.

405
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,772
Okay, I’ll hurry back after I’m done.

406
00:30:33,172 --> 00:30:36,492
Can you text me when you’re there? I’m kind of worried.

407
00:30:37,012 --> 00:30:38,452
Here, take this back too.

408
00:30:38,452 --> 00:30:39,732
Can you put it…

409
00:30:39,732 --> 00:30:40,652
Okay.

410
00:30:40,652 --> 00:30:41,932
Okay, please take care.

411
00:30:41,932 --> 00:30:44,092
Kie, put it around my neck.

412
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,892
Easy there.

413
00:30:45,892 --> 00:30:50,092
Be careful, Kie. Let’s go slowly.

414
00:30:50,372 --> 00:30:54,972
This way. Just a bit more. Can you walk?

415
00:30:55,332 --> 00:30:59,452
Please God, please make everything go well.

416
00:31:22,452 --> 00:31:23,292
Sorry.

417
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:24,732
Hey, it’s me.

418
00:31:24,732 --> 00:31:27,732
Pock? I thought you already left.

419
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:29,892
Why did you come back?

420
00:31:30,532 --> 00:31:35,252
Well, the pharmacy that I want to buy medicine is around here.

421
00:31:35,252 --> 00:31:40,332
But I still have a stomach pain so I’m looking for somewhere to rest for a while.

422
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:43,532
Then I came across you here.

423
00:31:47,212 --> 00:31:50,892
Aww, you look like a sad cat there.

424
00:31:52,132 --> 00:31:56,372
Hey, do you want me to sit here and drink with you?

425
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:06,452
But…you have to buy me drinks though.

426
00:32:09,852 --> 00:32:10,732
Sure.

427
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:12,972
Okay then.

428
00:32:18,332 --> 00:32:20,772
Slow down, Pock.

429
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:39,332
Please excuse me. Now, I’m also tipsy like you.

430
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:42,732
I’m afraid you’ll get drunk first.

431
00:32:43,972 --> 00:32:44,772
Of course not.

432
00:32:46,812 --> 00:32:47,852
Throw it away for me.

Slowly. That’s right. Be careful.

454
00:34:20,786 --> 00:34:21,826
Pheem.

455
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:25,066
Kie.

456
00:34:25,746 --> 00:34:29,666
Pheem.

457
00:34:35,386 --> 00:34:37,426
Let me go first. I can’t breathe.

458
00:34:44,546 --> 00:34:48,306
Now, let’s get you on a pillow.

459
00:34:48,306 --> 00:34:52,546
Okay there.

460
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:57,026
What’s wrong?

461
00:35:00,746 --> 00:35:03,266
What’s wrong, Kie?

462
00:35:44,706 --> 00:35:47,546
Okay, wrench it first.

463
00:35:49,266 --> 00:35:50,226
That’s it.

464
00:36:51,786 --> 00:36:56,026
I made you this necklace so that we would be a pair.

00:36:56,426 --> 00:36:59,666
We’re soulmate, aren’t we?

466
00:37:02,026 --> 00:37:03,946
Do you still keep it?

467
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:12,946
How do you know Kie hasn’t suffered during the past 7 years?

468
00:37:13,386 --> 00:37:17,186
Since that day she broke up with you, she hasn’t dated anyone.

469
00:37:18,226 --> 00:37:23,066
What really happened? What else you’ve kept a secret from me?

470
00:37:43,786 --> 00:37:45,146
Pheem.

471
00:37:48,826 --> 00:37:50,186
It’s really you.

472
00:37:53,946 --> 00:37:55,906
Please don’t leave me again.

473
00:37:58,786 --> 00:38:00,026
I’m begging you.

474
00:38:03,186 --> 00:38:04,826
Please don’t leave me.

475
00:38:12,426 --> 00:38:14,786
Don’t leave me, Pheem.

476
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:20,146
Pheem. Pheem.

477
00:38:29,186 --> 00:38:30,906
Who actually left who?

478
00:39:00,106 --> 00:39:00,986
Shit!

479
00:39:01,266 --> 00:39:02,666
Shit!

480
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:03,906
You can’t come into this room.

481
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:06,346
You can’t blame me. I thought it’s a mixed Onsen.

482
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:07,666
Hey! Wait!

483
00:39:09,426 --> 00:39:10,786
Tan!

484
00:39:11,026 --> 00:39:11,666
Pock!

485
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:13,666
Geez!

486
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:16,586
How did you get in here?

487
00:39:16,826 --> 00:39:19,266
I…I thought it’s a mixed Onsen.

488
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:22,226
And it’s quite late so I thought…no one will be using it.

489
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:25,626
It’s not a mixed onsen. Can’t you see the private sign?

490
00:39:28,186 --> 00:39:33,906
Oh, really? But Tan…it’s my cloth you’re holding there.

491
00:39:41,226 --> 00:39:43,826
But…since I’m here anyway…

492
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:46,186
can I just use it too?

493
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:50,346
You don’t have to be shy. It’s actually quite good.

494
00:39:51,066 --> 00:39:52,186
What do you mean?

495
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:01,626
I thought you said you have a stomach pain.

496
00:40:02,026 --> 00:40:03,506
Have you taken your pills?

497
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:08,506
Oh…yeah, I already did.

498
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:14,546
Don’t you know an Onsen here can help cure diarrhea?

499
00:40:16,386 --> 00:40:19,626
I’ve been using it for a while, how come I’ve never heard of that?

500
00:40:21,706 --> 00:40:29,066
So, why are you here so late? Or are you still thinking about Pheem?

501
00:40:36,506 --> 00:40:39,546
Tan, can I be honest with you?

502
00:40:41,946 --> 00:40:44,866
I think you should know her better than I do,

503
00:40:45,586 --> 00:40:48,426
that she’s not someone who’d do anything against her own will.

504
00:40:49,266 --> 00:40:52,266
When I asked her to look after Kie for me,

505
00:40:52,706 --> 00:40:56,986
she wouldn’t have agreed if she had never wanted to do it.

506
00:40:57,946 --> 00:41:02,946
Just let the two of them stay together. After all, you’re the one who came second.

507
00:41:05,706 --> 00:41:07,266
I’ve come so far to see her.

508
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:10,066
Do I really have to back off and let them be?

509
00:41:12,026 --> 00:41:21,266
Well then, if you don’t want it to be a waste of time, why don’t you look for another choice?

510
00:41:22,226 --> 00:41:23,306
What choice?

511
00:41:24,386 --> 00:41:27,826
This choice. Mwah!

512
00:41:28,746 --> 00:41:32,866
[Laughing] Me.

513
00:41:33,786 --> 00:41:36,746
I think I should go now.

514
00:41:37,266 --> 00:41:41,786
Please take your time. But can you turn around first?

515
00:41:42,146 --> 00:41:42,906
Fine.

516
00:41:44,786 --> 00:41:46,026
Don’t look, okay?

517
00:41:53,266 --> 00:41:54,066
Tan!

518
00:41:55,586 --> 00:41:56,386
Your cloth.

519
00:41:57,026 --> 00:41:58,186
Shit!

520
00:42:00,426 --> 00:42:02,386
Turn around, Pock!

521
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:04,346
Don’t look!

522
00:42:05,266 --> 00:42:07,546
Wow, so white!

523
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,666
Shit! I said don’t look!

524
00:42:11,866 --> 00:42:13,186
Anaconda!

525
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:18,506
Damn it!

526
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:39,026
Geez, my head hurts.

527
00:42:48,426 --> 00:42:51,226
This is not my room.

528
00:42:54,826 --> 00:42:56,026
It’s Pheem’s.

529
00:43:05,426 --> 00:43:06,346
Are you up?

530
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:10,066
Let me see.

531
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:14,106
What are you doing?

532
00:43:16,266 --> 00:43:18,266
I’m not going to do anything to you.

533
00:43:20,386 --> 00:43:22,906
I just want to check if you still have a headache.

534
00:43:23,826 --> 00:43:24,946
Do you want to take pills?

535
00:43:27,746 --> 00:43:29,626
Come, hurry and get dressed.

536
00:43:29,626 --> 00:43:33,666
I’ll take you outside and find something to eat to cure your hangover.

537
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:39,226
If you don’t hurry, I’ll do it for you.

538
00:43:42,466 --> 00:43:45,946
I’ll go get the warm bath ready for you.

539
00:44:06,706 --> 00:44:07,746
What the heck was that?

540
00:44:11,986 --> 00:44:16,306
I’m confused. What happened last night?

541
00:44:17,306 --> 00:44:19,906
I wonder how Pheem and Kie are doing now.

542
00:44:20,546 --> 00:44:22,866
They might get back together already.

543
00:44:25,626 --> 00:44:27,346
I guess I really have to give up, huh?

544
00:44:28,386 --> 00:44:32,586
Sometimes, you can’t do anything but let it go.

545
00:44:33,106 --> 00:44:37,746
Why don’t you try looking at someone around here instead?

546
00:44:39,586 --> 00:44:43,306
Hey, do you want to get hit by a car? I was just kidding.

547
00:44:44,066 --> 00:44:45,426
Yeah.

548
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,466
I’m looking for a facial foam.

549
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:54,746
Let’s go over there then. You can hardly find those brands in Thailand.

550
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:55,386
Over there?

551
00:44:55,386 --> 00:44:56,186
Yes.

552
00:44:56,506 --> 00:44:57,546
- Follow me.
- Please lead the way.

553
00:45:00,706 --> 00:45:02,546
Here you go.

554
00:45:03,906 --> 00:45:05,706
Wow, thank you.

555
00:45:10,306 --> 00:45:14,426
Tan, they hardly sell this one in Thailand.

556
00:45:14,426 --> 00:45:16,626
It’s an eye treatment product.

557
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:21,986
If you use it, your eyesight might get better, and you might see things clearer.

558
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:26,386
For example, you might see someone who really cares about you right over here.

559
00:45:26,946 --> 00:45:27,746
Okay.

560
00:45:32,106 --> 00:45:33,746
Hey, don’t you want it?

561
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:48,946
Let me see. Did you get wet?

562
00:45:49,866 --> 00:45:51,626
Oh, your hair is all wet.

563
00:45:55,186 --> 00:45:56,626
Do you still have a headache?

564
00:45:59,826 --> 00:46:01,506
I’m fine.

565
00:46:02,386 --> 00:46:05,786
Just wait here. I’ll go get some medicine for you.

566
00:46:06,226 --> 00:46:07,306
Wait, Pheem.

567
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:16,066
What happened last night? I can only remember I was so drunk.

568
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:21,826
Yeah, you were so drunk…and Pock also got the runs.

569
00:46:22,226 --> 00:46:24,946
So, she told you to sleep in my room.

570
00:46:29,986 --> 00:46:34,266
I didn’t make a scene or bother you, did I?

571
00:46:36,266 --> 00:46:37,186
Why?

572
00:46:38,746 --> 00:46:42,906
Well…when I’m drunk, I’m not quite usual self.

573
00:46:44,906 --> 00:46:47,826
Don’t worry, you didn’t make any mess.

574
00:46:48,626 --> 00:46:52,786
You just…slept soundly like a baby.

575
00:46:56,786 --> 00:47:01,946
Okay, so…I’ll go get medicine for you. Please wait here. I’ll be right back.

576
00:47:18,386 --> 00:47:19,586
What the heck?

577
00:47:28,066 --> 00:47:33,426
Pheem, I’m so sorry.

578
00:47:34,746 --> 00:47:40,266
I never wanted to hurt you.

579
00:47:41,866 --> 00:47:45,226
But I didn’t want to ruin your future.

580
00:47:48,066 --> 00:47:55,386
So, I had to make you hate me and didn’t want to stay with me.

581
00:47:57,266 --> 00:47:58,786
What do you mean?

582
00:48:00,786 --> 00:48:03,946
Kie. Kie.

00:48:04,306 --> 00:48:07,626
Wake up and talk to me first. Kie!

584
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:29,946
Hey, Pheem.

585
00:48:30,626 --> 00:48:31,426
Just a second.

586
00:48:33,106 --> 00:48:36,906
Pock, what is this all about?

587
00:48:37,306 --> 00:48:40,186
You already heard her murmuring, right?

588
00:48:41,466 --> 00:48:43,786
It’s…exactly what she said.

589
00:48:44,026 --> 00:48:49,626
When Kie is drunk, she won’t be able to control herself.

590
00:48:50,106 --> 00:48:55,506
She’d keep rambling on what she really feels about everything.

591
00:48:55,946 --> 00:48:57,506
Especially about you.

592
00:48:57,786 --> 00:49:00,746
Is there anything that I still don’t know?

593
00:49:01,586 --> 00:49:06,186
Pock, I’m begging you. Please tell me everything.

594
00:49:07,786 --> 00:49:15,266
Well, I happen to know that Kie also has a finsta.

595
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:19,226
She only uses it to ramble about how she misses you.

596
00:49:20,506 --> 00:49:24,986
She never told me about this. I was just being nosy and found out.

597
00:49:25,306 --> 00:49:29,866
If you check it out, you might get less mad at her.

598
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:34,306
I’ll send you the details then.

Kie: It’s raining heavily here in Thailand. But I guess it must be freezing there in England.

600
00:49:51,266 --> 00:49:55,666
I don’t know if you’re taking good care of yourself. Are you wearing thick layers of clothes?

601
00:49:55,906 --> 00:50:01,746

Kie: Pock and I have moved to another dorm for a while now.

603
00:50:08,546 --> 00:50:12,826
We decided to move because I couldn’t stand staying at a place where I used to have Pheem by my side.

604
00:50:13,346 --> 00:50:20,666
I can still picture you here vividly. It doesn’t fade away as time goes by.

605
00:50:21,506 --> 00:50:23,666
Yet, it had become clearer and clearer.

- Kie, let’s take a picture together.

Okay, let’s go.

709
00:59:40,475 --> 00:59:41,475
Yatsu-san.

710
00:59:41,475 --> 00:59:42,595
Yes, Yumi-chan?

711
00:59:42,595 --> 00:59:45,595
Please take us to our boss’s house.

712
00:59:45,595 --> 00:59:46,075
Aha.

713
00:59:46,075 --> 00:59:47,675

00:59:50,315 --> 00:59:51,395
Okay.

718
00:59:51,395 --> 00:59:52,515
Oh, watch out!

719
00:59:52,515 --> 00:59:54,315
So dangerous.

720
00:59:54,315 --> 00:59:57,715
I’m so sorry.

721
01:00:03,955 --> 01:00:07,315
Sorry, sorry.

722
01:00:07,315 --> 01:00:08,155

We’ve arrived.

728
01:00:30,995 --> 01:00:40,595
This is our president’s house. We’re going to stay here. It’s so beautiful.

729
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:42,835
Let’s go inside.

730

We also have a beautiful garden.

733

Do you want to look around?

734
01:00:54,195 --> 01:00:56,635
Follow me. You can take a look.

735
01:00:56,635 --> 01:00:57,555
Wow!

736

737
01:01:06,155 --> 01:01:07,195
Go talk to Pheem.

738
01:01:07,515 --> 01:01:08,395
Pheem.

739
01:01:10,755 --> 01:01:17,315
Yumi said she’s assigned to find the best accommodation for Vice President.

740
01:01:17,635 --> 01:01:21,875
And I’m also assigned to stay with you.

741
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:25,475
Because the president doesn’t want you to live here alone for 3 whole months.

742
01:01:26,075 --> 01:01:26,995
Is that so?

743
01:01:30,315 --> 01:01:35,715
Well…since there’re only two bedrooms, should we…

744
01:01:35,715 --> 01:01:37,915
Should you and I sleep in a different room?

745
01:01:38,595 --> 01:01:41,235
What? Only two bedrooms?

746
01:01:41,595 --> 01:01:42,555
Mhm.

747
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:48,195
I’ll sacrifice myself for you then.

748
01:01:48,475 --> 01:01:52,195
You can go stay with Pheem. I’ll stay with Tan.

749
01:01:53,155 --> 01:01:54,515
We can’t do that!

750
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:55,715
Of course, we can!

751
01:01:56,435 --> 01:01:59,835
Pock, don’t worry about the room.

752
01:02:00,115 --> 01:02:03,235
I’ll fly back to England the day after tomorrow. I can sleep anywhere.

753
01:02:03,835 --> 01:02:05,355
You’re leaving?

754
01:02:08,075 --> 01:02:09,395
Is anyone hungry?

755
01:02:09,635 --> 01:02:13,675
I can take you to a great restaurant. Follow me.

756
01:02:13,675 --> 01:02:14,715
