The answer is yes!

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,000
Do you know how terrible her life has been since she started seeing you?

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,640
Pheem’s dad: You keep fooling around and ignoring your study!

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,280
I’m going to send you to England.

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,080
I’m not going!

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,240
Then you must get engaged to Poon.

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,080
If that’s what you want, I’ll move out of here.

9

Should I accept this engagement?

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,120
You surely give out a vibe of a house spirit.

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,960
I think you mean a housewife.

15
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,160
That means you already have a husband then.

she came to stay with you just less than 24 hours before her engagement.

Oh, fuck!

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,480
What the hell was she thinking?

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,200
Did she see you as a dog’s poop or what?

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,120
Geez, so fucking worthless.

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,360
Or maybe a cat’s poop? After she’s done, she just buries it.

00:28:02,435 --> 00:28:03,555
Get lost.

357
00:28:03,705 --> 00:28:05,115
I don’t want to see your face.

358
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:06,435
Out!

359
00:28:07,175 --> 00:28:08,435
-Pheem.
-Get out!

360
00:28:08,435 --> 00:28:09,335
Okay, okay.

361
00:28:24,315 --> 00:28:28,195
♫ What you’ve always given me ♫

362
00:28:28,195 --> 00:28:31,915
♫ Is nothing but a heartless love ♫

363
00:28:31,915 --> 00:28:38,395
♫ Never once that you’ll be waivered ♫

364
00:28:39,355 --> 00:28:40,715
♫ What you… ♫

365
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:42,235
Kie!

366
00:28:42,235 --> 00:28:45,515
Why are you so fucking cruel?

367
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,435
Did you mean just cruel?

368
00:28:51,175 --> 00:28:52,595
No, fucking cruel.

369
00:28:52,595 --> 00:28:53,835
Seriously...

370
00:28:53,835 --> 00:28:56,275
don’t you feel bad for Pheem at all?

371
00:28:56,475 --> 00:28:58,395
And don’t you feel bad for me?

372
00:28:58,395 --> 00:29:00,515
It felt like she cheated on me.

373
00:29:00,675 --> 00:29:01,635
Hey.

374
00:29:01,635 --> 00:29:04,835
Maybe, she was pressured…

375
00:29:04,835 --> 00:29:07,675
or couldn’t avoid it because of some reason. That’s why she did that.

376
00:29:08,075 --> 00:29:11,435
And now you just told her to stop seeing you,

377
00:29:11,435 --> 00:29:13,875
wouldn’t she be crying her heart out?

378
00:29:14,075 --> 00:29:15,315
I don’t know.

379
00:29:15,935 --> 00:29:17,635
But I saw the tears though.

380
00:29:19,575 --> 00:29:20,675
Lots of them.

381
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:23,995
Geez, Kie!

382
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,195
You’re heartless!

383
00:29:25,735 --> 00:29:27,635
I’m not ready yet.

384
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:32,075
I’m not ready to act like it’s nothing.

385
00:29:32,475 --> 00:29:36,075
Also, Pheem is now engaged.

386
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,115
What right do I have to be with her?

387
00:29:39,135 --> 00:29:42,355
What’s between us is over.

388
00:29:45,775 --> 00:29:47,355
But…Hold on.

389
00:29:47,835 --> 00:29:50,275
Before you’re going to sit here sobbing like a sad dog,

390
00:29:50,835 --> 00:29:52,435
have you asked her to clarify everything?

391
00:29:55,595 --> 00:29:58,595
You just believe it without asking her first?

392
00:29:59,105 --> 00:30:00,715
But she’s already engaged.

393
00:30:01,355 --> 00:30:03,195
Isn’t it over then?

394
00:30:11,705 --> 00:30:15,315
Geez, enough with your sad songs.

395
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:16,275
Let’s go.

396
00:30:16,575 --> 00:30:17,395
Go where?

397
00:30:17,635 --> 00:30:18,515
Drinking.

398
00:30:18,515 --> 00:30:20,395
Ken and Pai just called.

399
00:30:20,395 --> 00:30:21,915

Pai: Is she heartbroken?

405
00:30:58,635 --> 00:31:00,035
Pock, is your friend heartbroken?

406
00:31:00,505 --> 00:31:03,395
Aww, my dear sis.

407
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:05,515
It’s all right.

408
00:31:05,735 --> 00:31:07,315
You can find someone new around here.

409
00:31:07,935 --> 00:31:10,595
Many girls will line up for a pretty face like you.

410
00:31:10,595 --> 00:31:11,235
That's right.

411
00:31:11,335 --> 00:31:13,315
I’ll call someone for you.

412
00:31:13,315 --> 00:31:14,635
Ken: Where’s Tar’s no.?

413
00:31:14,735 --> 00:31:15,795
Oh, you’re going to call her?

414
00:31:18,275 --> 00:31:20,355
Hey, I’m okay.

415
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,235
Oh It's okay.

416
00:31:23,275 --> 00:31:25,955
Okay guys. Listen, Kie.

417
00:31:25,955 --> 00:31:29,075
Anything you want to eat or drink today, just name it.

418

Order all you like. It’s Pai’s treat.

419
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:34,675
Pock!

420
00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:38,835
What? Are you being stingy with your junior?

421
00:31:38,835 --> 00:31:41,555
What do you want? I’ll make it for you.

422
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:43,035
On the rock then.

423
00:31:43,905 --> 00:31:44,475
Good.

424
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:46,435
Let’s get you drunk.

00:31:46,575 --> 00:31:47,675
What are you doing?

426
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:51,115
Didn’t you say you wanted it on the rock?

427
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:53,675
I meant soda on the rock.

428
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:56,955
Kie.

429
00:31:57,575 --> 00:31:59,755
You fucking idiot.

430
00:31:59,755 --> 00:32:01,475
Who uses ‘on the rock’ with soda?

431
00:32:02,135 --> 00:32:04,505
Then, give me whiskey and soda.

432
00:32:05,035 --> 00:32:07,715
Good, that’s it.

433
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:09,505
Pai: Hey, look at that table.

434
00:32:09,635 --> 00:32:10,675
Ken: Fuck, man. Just watch,

435
00:32:11,175 --> 00:32:12,315
I think her husband is coming.

436
00:32:12,535 --> 00:32:13,335
Pai: Is he around?

437
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:14,835
Ken: No. That means...

438
00:32:14,835 --> 00:32:15,515
Pock.

439
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:17,195
What the heck are you doing?

440
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:19,475
Why did you put your finger in there?

441
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:23,355
What? Don’t you know?

442
00:32:23,505 --> 00:32:24,835
When you cook rice,

443
00:32:24,935 --> 00:32:28,315
you use your finger to measure the amount, like up to your first finger joint.

444
00:32:28,315 --> 00:32:30,115
So that the rice will be perfectly cooked.

445
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:30,915
Here.

446
00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:32,715
Why don’t you just add the ice first?

447
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:35,835
Geez, you’re so picky.

448
00:32:36,275 --> 00:32:37,075
Here.

449
00:32:37,835 --> 00:32:41,515
I don’t want it. You already put your finger in there. It’s dirty.

450
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,355
Geez, fussy.

451
00:32:43,635 --> 00:32:44,635
Ken.

452
00:32:44,635 --> 00:32:45,435
Yes, Pock?

453
00:32:45,535 --> 00:32:48,275
I made this one especially for you.

454
00:32:48,275 --> 00:32:50,475
Your first drink. Go on.

455
00:32:50,475 --> 00:32:52,235
-Really?
-Can I have it instead?

456
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:53,355
No, you can’t.

457
00:32:53,355 --> 00:32:54,155
Here, take it.

458
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:54,995

Pai: Please accept it. Think of it as a gift from your senior.

Pock: Oh, I hardly take a bribe from anyone. Please drink it.

00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:37,588
Pai: How many fingers?

536
00:37:37,988 --> 00:37:39,308
Pock: Two!

537
00:37:45,868 --> 00:37:49,228
Pock&Kie: Hey, I’m so sorry.

538
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:50,468
Pai: They didn’t puke!

539
00:37:51,308 --> 00:37:52,548
Ken: Shit, we’re doomed.

540
00:37:53,428 --> 00:37:55,068
Pai: Give them some water.

541
00:37:57,428 --> 00:37:58,868
Ken: Will they make it home?

542
00:37:58,868 --> 00:38:00,588
Pai: Let’s go, Pock.

543
00:38:06,028 --> 00:38:08,108
Congratulations to both of you!

544
00:38:08,868 --> 00:38:11,788
You are the first one to receive this special prize from us!

545
00:38:15,308 --> 00:38:16,708
What prize is it?

546
00:38:16,948 --> 00:38:19,268
Since we’ve opened our restaurant,

547
00:38:19,428 --> 00:38:22,268
you’re the first one to behave exactly like the name of our shop.

549
00:38:24,708 --> 00:38:26,268
What?

550
00:38:27,228 --> 00:38:29,548
[So drunk the dog eats your puke]

551
00:38:39,388 --> 00:38:41,668
Can we take a picture of you?

552
00:38:42,188 --> 00:38:43,308
Picture?

553
00:38:43,748 --> 00:38:45,548
Sure! Go ahead.

554
00:38:45,548 --> 00:38:47,428
Get up then.

555
00:38:51,508 --> 00:38:54,028
Can those who didn’t puke please leave the frame?

556
00:38:54,028 --> 00:38:54,988
Oh, okay.

557
00:38:54,988 --> 00:38:56,508
Get out.

558
00:38:56,548 --> 00:38:58,708
Here we go. 3 2 1.

559
00:38:58,708 --> 00:38:59,668

560
00:38:59,668 --> 00:39:02,148

00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:09,188
Pocky from Engineering!!

563
00:39:10,188 --> 00:39:10,948
Thank you.

564
00:39:10,988 --> 00:39:12,068
That’s for your next time.

565
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:13,708
Awesome! You’re awesome!

566
00:39:15,828 --> 00:39:18,308
Thank you.

567
00:39:21,908 --> 00:39:23,308
Now what?

568
00:39:24,188 --> 00:39:24,828
Don’t!

569
00:39:24,828 --> 00:39:25,908
Don’t do it, Kie.

570
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:27,908
Look over there.

571
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:31,268
If you puke again, he’ll get even fatter.

572
00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:32,388
So, don’t.

573
00:39:32,388 --> 00:39:34,268
Calm down.

574
00:39:35,148 --> 00:39:36,108
So, don’t.

575
00:39:39,228 --> 00:39:40,228
Fuck!

576
00:39:42,308 --> 00:39:43,428
Geez!

577
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,268
Damn it.

578
00:39:45,788 --> 00:39:46,668
Kie!

579
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,348
You too!

580
00:39:49,628 --> 00:39:52,468
They have a name for this award too, huh?

581
00:39:53,748 --> 00:39:56,028
Does everyone know about this?

582
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:57,628
Yes.

583
00:39:57,748 --> 00:39:59,628
But the restaurant owners are so happy though.

584
00:39:59,668 --> 00:40:01,068
And more than that,

585
00:40:01,588 --> 00:40:03,508
the regulars there also want to see you in person.

586
00:40:04,108 --> 00:40:08,228
Well, I guess it’s something we should be proud of, isn’t it?

587
00:40:10,268 --> 00:40:12,948
We really got trashed last night.

588
00:40:13,028 --> 00:40:13,828
Yeah.

589
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:18,548
Then, I guess you probably forgot the promise you gave me.

590
00:40:20,308 --> 00:40:21,108
Huh?

591
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:27,308
What promise?

592
00:40:29,148 --> 00:40:30,108
Wait.

593
00:40:30,868 --> 00:40:32,788
I didn’t give you any weird promise, did I?

594
00:40:54,468 --> 00:40:56,868
Why are you stopping me?

595
00:40:58,668 --> 00:41:00,348
That’s a men’s toilet.

596
00:41:02,468 --> 00:41:03,708
Oh.

597
00:41:05,628 --> 00:41:06,668
Thank you.

598
00:41:10,388 --> 00:41:11,188
Wait.

599
00:41:15,908 --> 00:41:20,388
Can I change from a ‘thank you’ to something else instead?

600
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,268
What do you want then?

601
00:41:39,948 --> 00:41:40,748
Oh, that’s right.

602
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,028
I want to make a wedding presentation.

603
00:41:50,348 --> 00:41:54,628
I mean…I want to make a wedding presentation for my older sister.

604
00:41:58,868 --> 00:42:00,988
Can you teach me how to do it?

605
00:42:11,308 --> 00:42:12,788
Just say yes.

606
00:42:18,188 --> 00:42:19,148
Okay.

607
00:42:20,588 --> 00:42:21,388
Okay. Thank you.

608
00:42:24,828 --> 00:42:26,708
Can I go to toilet now?

609
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,228
Wait.

610
00:42:35,548 --> 00:42:37,268
This way.

611
00:42:40,868 --> 00:42:44,628
So…I already said yes?

612
00:42:46,548 --> 00:42:48,028
Mhm.

613
00:42:51,588 --> 00:42:52,628
Wait.

614
00:42:53,068 --> 00:42:55,948
Actually, for this kind of work,

615
00:42:55,948 --> 00:43:00,028
wouldn’t it be better if you ask your Com Arts friends to teach you?

616
00:43:03,188 --> 00:43:08,348
But those guys are hard to talk to. I can’t communicate with them.

617
00:43:09,948 --> 00:43:11,908
Please. You’ve promised me, Kie.

618
00:43:15,948 --> 00:43:19,828
Well…okay.

619
00:43:19,828 --> 00:43:26,228
If you think a Com Arts girl like you will be able to understand an Engineering girl like me,

620
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,548
I won’t mind helping you.

621
00:43:28,788 --> 00:43:29,748
Okay.

622
00:43:30,988 --> 00:43:32,708
How about this evening?

623
00:43:34,588 --> 00:43:35,388
This evening?

624
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,548
I’m kind of in a hurry.

625
00:43:39,628 --> 00:43:40,428
You sure are.

626
00:43:40,988 --> 00:43:41,588
Just a bit.

627
00:43:41,588 --> 00:43:42,188
Yeah.

628
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:43,628
See you this evening then.

629
00:43:43,908 --> 00:43:44,788
Bye.

630
00:43:49,468 --> 00:43:52,028
Pock: I don’t like to flirt around.

631
00:43:52,548 --> 00:43:54,948
I don’t like to flirt around.

632
00:43:54,948 --> 00:43:59,508
- Just tell me what time you want, Sine. I can go anytime.
- Pock!

633
00:44:01,068 --> 00:44:02,508
- Stop it. / - I don’t like to flirt around, Sine.

634
00:44:02,828 --> 00:44:03,948
I don’t like to flirt around.

635
00:44:04,388 --> 00:44:07,068
- Pock! Why are you always like this?
- I don’t like to flirt around!

636
00:44:09,068 --> 00:44:10,148
When did I ever do that?

637
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,548
Every single day.

638
00:44:12,668 --> 00:44:14,508
Now, let’s try to import the file.

639
00:44:15,428 --> 00:44:20,668
Tap here and click ‘Import’. Done.

640
00:44:23,988 --> 00:44:26,588
What kind of students only keep looking at the teacher’s face?

641
00:44:26,868 --> 00:44:29,108
I’m trying to teach you here. Look at the screen.

642
00:44:30,428 --> 00:44:33,748
Hmm, the after-effect is quite harder than I thought.

643
00:44:33,948 --> 00:44:34,988
How did you do it?

644
00:44:38,068 --> 00:44:41,468
When I was in high school, I wanted to make a birthday presentation for Pheem.

645
00:44:41,908 --> 00:44:46,628
So, I looked it up on the internet and learnt it from YouTube.

646
00:44:50,148 --> 00:44:51,108
Wow, you’re good.

647
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:53,268
You can do this much just by learning from YouTube.

648
00:44:53,548 --> 00:44:56,428
You’re a fast learner, aren’t you?

649
00:44:59,308 --> 00:45:01,748
Well, not really.

650
00:45:02,668 --> 00:45:05,828
Whether it’s a computer program or mathematics,

651
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:09,628
the basic idea is always 1+1 equals 2.

652
00:45:11,468 --> 00:45:13,868
But with the person’s heart, it’s different.

653
00:45:14,948 --> 00:45:17,468
That’s why I always have a problem when it comes to people’s minds.

654
00:45:23,908 --> 00:45:26,268
Don’t look so sad.

655
00:45:27,108 --> 00:45:27,988
Smile a little.

656
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:29,068
Come on.

657
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:32,988
Smile for me, please.

658
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:35,748
Or are you low on sugar?

659
00:45:36,308 --> 00:45:37,108
If so…

660
00:45:41,028 --> 00:45:42,388
I have some sweets for you.

661
00:45:42,388 --> 00:45:44,108
But you have to smile first.

662
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:45,868
Come on. Smile.

663
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:49,988
Or do you want me to feed you?

664
00:45:51,588 --> 00:45:52,508
I can do that.

665
00:45:56,148 --> 00:45:58,788
Just kidding. No more teasing.

666
00:45:59,228 --> 00:46:02,228
But you have to tell me what I should do to make you smile.

667
00:46:05,908 --> 00:46:10,988
Well, maybe we should call it a day for now, or else we might be home late.

668
00:46:12,348 --> 00:46:13,748
Okay, but…

669
00:46:13,748 --> 00:46:14,868
You have to smile first.

670
00:46:16,428 --> 00:46:18,068
Come on. Smile.

671
00:46:22,228 --> 00:46:24,388
Okay, I can see all your 32 teeth.

672
00:46:25,668 --> 00:46:26,468
Let’s go.

673
00:46:32,948 --> 00:46:33,868
Want some?

674
00:46:45,468 --> 00:46:47,108
Are you sure you don’t want me to walk you back?

675
00:46:47,788 --> 00:46:49,668
Yeah, don’t worry.

676
00:46:50,388 --> 00:46:52,788
Let’s say goodbye here.

677
00:46:52,948 --> 00:46:53,828
Hey, wait.

678
00:46:59,148 --> 00:47:01,748
Here, take it.

679
00:47:03,668 --> 00:47:04,908
No, thanks.

680
00:47:06,108 --> 00:47:09,148
I want to give it to you as a thank you gift…

681
00:47:09,148 --> 00:47:10,628
for teaching me today.

682

685
00:47:40,988 --> 00:47:43,148
I’ve called you so many times. Why aren’t you picking up?

686
00:47:43,588 --> 00:47:44,588
Come, let’s go home.

687
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:46,388
No, let me go.

688
00:47:52,068 --> 00:47:53,028
What?

689
00:48:15,508 --> 00:48:16,668

And may all your wishes come true, my dear daughter.

749
00:55:51,704 --> 00:55:56,384
We’ll always be a litter box for you, dear.

750
00:56:10,224 --> 00:56:17,624
Aww, she used to be a tight-lipped girl.

751
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:20,344
But now she’s just a crybaby.

752
00:56:20,624 --> 00:56:23,904
Please don’t cry. Be happy. It’s your birthday.

753
00:56:27,664 --> 00:56:29,304
Come, let’s eat your cake.

754
00:56:30,204 --> 00:56:32,704
I haven’t brushed my teeth yet.

755
00:56:33,224 --> 00:56:36,544
Aww, no dear.

756
00:56:36,544 --> 00:56:38,344
We’re going to give alms to the monk.

757
00:56:38,864 --> 00:56:42,704
Your Granny Kimheng has prepared a lot of food for you.

758
00:56:43,464 --> 00:56:44,504
Is she already here?

759
00:56:56,904 --> 00:56:57,904
Granny.

760
00:56:57,904 --> 00:56:58,944
Are you already here?

761
00:57:00,904 --> 00:57:03,704
How are you, my darling Kaokie?

762
00:57:03,864 --> 00:57:05,064
Are you up now?

763
00:57:05,064 --> 00:57:07,024
Of course you are. That’s why I can see you here, isn’t it?

764
00:57:10,304 --> 00:57:12,184
What’s wrong?

765
00:57:14,004 --> 00:57:15,944
Aww, I miss you too.

766
00:57:17,004 --> 00:57:18,064
Okay.

767
00:57:19,984 --> 00:57:21,584
Give me a kiss.

768
00:57:23,334 --> 00:57:24,424
This side too.

769
00:57:25,424 --> 00:57:30,464
That’s enough. Look, you’re leaving marks all over my cheeks. They’ll ruin my makeup.

770
00:57:30,464 --> 00:57:32,184
But I miss you so much.

771
00:57:32,204 --> 00:57:33,744
I miss you too.

772
00:57:33,804 --> 00:57:35,824
Come, let me kiss you instead.

773
00:57:35,824 --> 00:57:36,824
Okay?

774
00:57:39,404 --> 00:57:40,504
Oh, wait.

775
00:57:40,504 --> 00:57:41,824
Have you showered and brushed your teeth?

776
00:57:42,464 --> 00:57:43,824
Hurry up and get it done.

777
00:57:43,824 --> 00:57:45,464
So that we can go give alms to the monk.

778
00:57:45,564 --> 00:57:46,364
Okay?

779
00:57:46,664 --> 00:57:47,464
Right?

780
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,104
You want to help me prepare the food?

781
00:57:52,104 --> 00:57:54,384
- I’m going to help you first.
- Okay, dear.

782
00:57:54,384 --> 00:57:55,704
You’re so clingy today.

783
00:58:01,304 --> 00:58:03,984
Are you going to celebrate with your friends today, Kaokie?

784
00:58:04,464 --> 00:58:07,504
Yes, Pock’s already asked me to go party this evening.

785
00:58:07,904 --> 00:58:09,864
Wow, sounds fun.

786
00:58:10,564 --> 00:58:12,584
Don’t get drunk, or you won’t be able to get home.

787
00:58:15,264 --> 00:58:16,264
Don’t worry, Dad.

788
00:58:16,864 --> 00:58:17,864
I’m going too.

789
00:58:18,004 --> 00:58:18,504
Really?

790
00:58:18,504 --> 00:58:20,624
I’ll take care of her.

791
00:58:20,624 --> 00:58:23,464
Oh dear, that makes me worry even more.

792
00:58:23,464 --> 00:58:25,024
I’m not sure who’ll take care of whom.

793
00:58:27,734 --> 00:58:29,544
Are you going home after this?

794
00:58:30,664 --> 00:58:31,304
Not yet.

795
00:58:31,304 --> 00:58:33,064
I’m going to stay with you all day.

796
00:58:33,264 --> 00:58:34,064
Okay?

797
00:58:34,064 --> 00:58:35,944
Okay.

798
00:58:47,204 --> 00:58:48,464
You're here?

799
00:58:50,334 --> 00:58:52,224
Thanks.

800
00:58:53,664 --> 00:58:56,064
Granny…

801
00:58:56,164 --> 00:58:56,964
Yes, dear?

802
00:58:57,304 --> 00:58:58,134
Wait.

803
00:58:58,504 --> 00:59:02,424
Why is my Kaokie so clingy and cuddly today?

804
00:59:05,604 --> 00:59:08,904
Granny, can I ask you something?

805
00:59:09,334 --> 00:59:11,384
Yeah, you can.

806
00:59:12,564 --> 00:59:16,104
If you keep hurting someone that you really love…

807
00:59:16,104 --> 00:59:20,904
over and over again, can you still call it love?

808
00:59:20,934 --> 00:59:22,144
Hm? Wait a minute.

809
00:59:22,144 --> 00:59:26,064
I didn’t mishear it, did I?

810
00:59:26,824 --> 00:59:29,584
Is my Kaokie in love now?

811
00:59:29,584 --> 00:59:31,504
Tell me. Who? Where?

812
00:59:31,504 --> 00:59:32,464
Who is it?

813
00:59:33,504 --> 00:59:36,064
I used to.

814
00:59:36,464 --> 00:59:40,064
But I’m not sure about now and in the future.

815
00:59:40,164 --> 00:59:42,704
Oh, going dramatic all of a sudden.

816
00:59:43,064 --> 00:59:44,734
So, what’s wrong?

817
00:59:49,004 --> 00:59:50,344
What if…

818
00:59:50,344 --> 00:59:52,944
two people who are so much in love…

819
00:59:54,164 --> 00:59:55,704
haven’t seen each other for a long time.

820
00:59:56,564 --> 00:59:57,984
Haven’t gotten in touch at all.

821
00:59:58,864 --> 01:00:00,504
Then one day they meet again.

822
01:00:00,664 --> 01:00:02,784
Can they still fall in love with each other?

823
01:00:03,204 --> 01:00:07,104
Oh, this is such a teenager’s problem, dear.

824
01:00:07,464 --> 01:00:08,824
Look how old I am now.

825
01:00:08,824 --> 01:00:11,184
If you’re going to ask me anything,

826
01:00:11,184 --> 01:00:13,544
it should rather be about Dhamma.

827
01:00:13,544 --> 01:00:14,264
Okay?

828
01:00:14,304 --> 01:00:15,704
Geez, Granny.

829
01:00:15,704 --> 01:00:17,704
I’m not interested in Dhamma right now.

830
01:00:18,804 --> 01:00:19,664
Okay, fine.

831
01:00:19,804 --> 01:00:23,664
Listen to me carefully and make sure you keep it in mind.

832
01:00:24,104 --> 01:00:28,464
Whatever that doesn’t belong to you, no matter how hard you try,

833
01:00:28,764 --> 01:00:30,104
it will never be yours.

834
01:00:30,534 --> 01:00:32,904
But if it belongs to you,

835
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:36,704
no matter how long or far apart you’re separated from it,

836
01:00:36,704 --> 01:00:39,534
it will eventually come back to you.

837
01:00:44,504 --> 01:00:46,344
I love you the most.

838
01:00:47,164 --> 01:00:47,964
Really?

839
01:00:48,534 --> 01:00:49,824
Isn’t it because you want my inheritance?

840
01:00:51,264 --> 01:00:52,384
Just kidding, dear.

841
01:00:52,384 --> 01:00:55,264
I love you too. So much.

842
01:01:13,404 --> 01:01:15,184
Oh, hello!

843
01:01:15,184 --> 01:01:17,224
Aren’t you Miss ‘So Drunk The Dog Eats Your Puke’?

844
01:01:17,224 --> 01:01:18,664
Look, it’s her.

845
01:01:18,664 --> 01:01:20,544
Wow, it’s you.

846
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:22,504
The girl who won the prize.

847
01:01:22,504 --> 01:01:24,304
Can I take a picture with you?

848
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:28,224

849
01:01:29,004 --> 01:01:29,804

850
01:01:30,464 --> 01:01:31,744
Thank you.

851
01:01:32,534 --> 01:01:34,424
Please do your best today.

852
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:37,344
I hope you’ll win the prize from us again today.

853
01:01:37,664 --> 01:01:38,904
You can do it!

854
01:01:41,584 --> 01:01:46,264
Wow, you’re quite famous.

855
01:01:46,904 --> 01:01:49,704
I guess I have to tell our parents about it.

856
01:01:49,704 --> 01:01:51,344
And our Granny too.

857
01:01:51,344 --> 01:01:53,384
Stop it, Ga.

858
01:01:53,704 --> 01:01:55,424
I’m so embarrassed right now.

859
01:01:58,804 --> 01:01:59,944
This place is so big.

860
01:02:00,734 --> 01:02:02,534
Why isn't pock herey yet?

[Door knocking]

862
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:16,664
Happy Birthday!

863
01:02:17,304 --> 01:02:19,784
Here, a gift from me.

864
01:02:20,164 --> 01:02:22,304
Happy Birthday, my hubby.

865
01:02:22,504 --> 01:02:23,964
Come give me a kiss.

866
01:02:25,104 --> 01:02:27,304
Geez, Pock!

867
01:02:28,064 --> 01:02:28,944
Stop it.

868
01:02:29,734 --> 01:02:32,424
Oh, isn’t this my affair?

869
01:02:32,424 --> 01:02:34,144
Let me kiss you too.

870
01:02:34,144 --> 01:02:34,904
Come on, Ga

871
01:02:34,904 --> 01:02:36,264
Pock! Don’t!

872
01:02:37,104 --> 01:02:38,104
Why?

873
01:02:40,204 --> 01:02:43,534
Hey, why are you dressing up so fancy today?

874
01:02:44,264 --> 01:02:50,904
I have to look fabulous today as the crowned queen of ‘So Drunk The Dog Eats Your Puke’.

875
01:02:50,904 --> 01:02:52,544
And also,

876
01:02:52,544 --> 01:02:54,944
we get to sit at the VIP table today.

877
01:02:56,664 --> 01:02:57,464
What?

878
01:02:58,404 --> 01:02:59,544
VIP table?

879
01:02:59,544 --> 01:03:01,584
Yeah. VIP.

880
01:03:02,564 --> 01:03:06,144
Why are we so lucky? Isn’t it usually always reserved?

881
01:03:07,064 --> 01:03:08,304
Sine booked it for us.

882
01:03:10,864 --> 01:03:12,904
Damn you, Pock.

883
01:03:13,964 --> 01:03:15,624
Why did you ask her to do that?

884
01:03:15,804 --> 01:03:17,544
You know so well what she’s thinking.

885
01:03:17,804 --> 01:03:19,184
I'm not comfortable.

886
01:03:19,764 --> 01:03:23,304
But she wanted to hold a birthday party for you.

887
01:03:23,704 --> 01:03:25,424
I didn’t want to turn her down.

888
01:03:25,424 --> 01:03:27,064
So, I just said yes.

889
01:03:27,864 --> 01:03:29,184
Come on, Kie.

890
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:31,264
I know you don’t want to give her any hope.

891
01:03:31,264 --> 01:03:33,744
But let’s just have fun today.

892
01:03:33,744 --> 01:03:35,144
Please…Please?

893
01:03:38,664 --> 01:03:40,584
